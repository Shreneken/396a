            "content": "What the heck was this? Seriously, Halloween H20 was a perfect ending to the Halloween franchise and so help me God if this was their \"final sequel\" this was the worst way to end it. I remember seeing this in the theater and afterwards just everyone saying how much they hated this movie. First off they have Jamie Lee Curtis all crazed looking and drugged up and then\u0085 they kill her off! Oh, my, God! How could they?! Shame on these stupid people, this is a pathetic attempt of the MTV generation trying to add technology to the Halloween series. What did the very first Halloween present to us? A killer who stalks babysitters and wanted to kill his family off, nothing else, that's it. Very simple, why do they try to crap up the story? How could you make a Halloween movie bad? Apparently this stupid director must have been drinking or doing some illegal substance because this was just a shamed attempt at giving us a few scares.Beginning three years after the events of Halloween H20, Laurie Strode, has been confined to a psychiatric care facility. The Summer Glen paramedic located the body of Michael Myers in the dining hall of Laurie's school, Hillcrest Academy High School. When attempting to seemingly do away with the terror from her brother once and for all, she had killed an innocent man. Unable to deal with the crime and the fear of her brother, Lauire was later confined to a sanitarium. Myers had earlier attacked the paramedic and forcefully switched clothing and his mask. The paramedic was rendered a mute from a crushed larynx. On the night of October 31, 1998, Myers cleverly escaped once again. When Michael finally appears, Laurie lures him into a trap, but before she can kill him for good, he turns the tables on her. In a confrontation on the sanitarium's rooftop, she reaches over to pull off his mask to make certain it is actually her brother. He suddenly grabs her and pulls her over the edge with him, stabbing her deep in the back. She gives him a kiss on the lips of his mask, lastly telling him, \"I'll see you in Hell.\" Michael releases the knife from his sister and she falls many stories below to her death. Myers finally accomplished killing his sister, a pursuit twenty-three years in the making. He then makes his way back home to Haddonfield, Illinois. One year later on Wednesday October 30th, six college students win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show in which they are to spend Halloween night in the childhood home of Michael Myers. Their mission is to find out what led him to kill. On the actual date of October 31, the investigation is done in a style reminiscent of the MTV reality show, Fear. On this night, through the entrepreneurial broadcast business Dangertainment, it is shot live on the internet. Of course who is going to be there to ruin it? You guessed it, Big Bird, Happy Halloween.This is just a stupid sequel, Halloween: Resurrection makes the other sequels look like masterpieces. Halloween 2 started off terrific, we slumped just a little, nothing major, things picked up majorly with Halloween H20, so how in the heck did this movie get messed up? Because the director and writer were looking to relate to today's audience, which are a bunch of ignorant teens and this was just a waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours' as well, I promise you, you're not missing out on anything, don't watch this movie. Let's just forget about it and think that H20 was the way the Halloween franchise ended, oh, Michael, please don't ever do this again, either that or kill the director, or I will! Where's my butcher knife? Happy Halloween.1/10",

            "review_title": "Proof that the 'Halloween' series should not have been resurrected",
            "content": "John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween H20' is the one exception and the fourth film is also watchable. 'Halloween: Resurrection' is the worst offender. One of the worst sequels ever, of the genre and any genre, and one of the most pointless. 'Halloween H20' was a perfect place to stop the series, to have it resurrected so badly and in a way that disgraces the 'Halloween' name to intelligence insulting degrees is enough to make the blood boil. The only halfway good thing is Jamie Lee Curtis and she and her iconic character are written out in such a slap in the face way in a scene that is anything but creepy or suspenseful. Sadly that is the one scene that actually feels like it belongs in a 'Halloween' film.Curtis aside, the acting is absolutely dreadful. By far the worst acted of the sequels, yes worse than the 'Revenge...' and 'Curse...', with the embarrassment that is Busta Rhymes being the biggest offender. The entire cast of characters are far more annoying than Tina in 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers' which is quite a feat.Laughably awful dialogue, in a script that shouldn't have been approved beyond first draft if even that, can also be found. The film is even more ineptly directed than Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers' and the non-horror scenes in 'Season of the Witch'. Visually, it is far too gimmicky that it severely gets in the way of the atmosphere.The music, after improving drastically in 'H20', is even bigger a drawback than in the fifth and sixth films, no it is no longer one of the best assets like it was in the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and just doesn't fit in placement or in tone. There is nothing remotely creepy, tense, suspenseful or even entertaining here, the deaths cause unintentional laughs, nothing creative or shocking.The atmosphere is just ruined by that, gimmicky filming, a paper thin, confusing and ridiculous story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, terrible dialogue and acting, intelligence insulting stupidity (Rhymes versus Michael, the nadir of the entire series bar none) and erratic pacing (mostly dull).In summary, should never have been made, an unforgivably poor quality and pointless excuse of a sequel and a film. 1/10 (a rare rating for me these days but this deserves it).

            "content": "What can I say? If I've seen a film worse than this, it certainly doesn't spring to mind right now. I managed to get to the first screening in the local area and, even though the audience was fairly small, I still counted eleven people who walked out at various points in the movie and never came back. Now either Michael Myers slashed them up on their way to the lavatories or, like me, they were bored stiff by this absolute CLUNKER of a flick.The plot, or what little semblance there is of one, is simple yet completely ludicrous. An organisation called Dangertainment, headed by the entrepreneurial Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), gets together a group of six students (!) to spend the night in serial killer Michael Myers' childhood home, in the hope that they will \"find clues\" as to what drove Myers to kill and kill again. Quite why, 25 years on from the murders, they think they will achieve anything by sending a group of teenagers into a house that, in the real world, would probably have long been demolished, is beyond me. Surely it is the job of police psychologists to dissect the minds of serial killers anyway? The film conveniently forgets the previous five sequels (with the exception of \"H20\"; this gets an irrelevant reference in the gratuitous opening scenes which serve merely as an excuse to waste Jamie Lee Curtis' talents in some customary 'running around' antics) and throws us almost immediately into the environment of the house, where each of the six kids are given a little handy-cam to strap to their heads and told to go searching for clues... You with me so far? Well, that's pretty much all there is to it. Needless to say, Myers himself shows up at the house about 10 minutes into the movie (how? why?) and decides he wants to kill everybody one by one, in the style we've now become accustomed to.This paper-thin tale is told so badly, it's almost hard to believe what you're seeing on screen and that anyone was dumb enough to spend time and money filming it. I suppose you could almost see it like a series of noisy soundbites strung together randomly. It keeps things simplistic to the point of being nonsensical, presumably to avoid confusing its target audience of dribbling inbreds. I think I could've written a better, more entertaining and reasonable script myself on the back of a beermat. Nothing is ever explained or justified, no matter how implausible and ridiculous things get, and yet, bogglingly, the film still seems to take itself fairly seriously. It tries desperately to shock with a series of boring but bloody knife murders (nothing we haven't seen ad nauseam in any of the previous films) and innumerable 'false' scares with flashlights and toys falling out of cupboards. It's all so by-the-books and done-to-death that you'd have to have never seen a single horror film in your life to find it even remotely tense or scary.I think what bugs me the most about the film is just how terribly made it is. Even forgetting the GAPING plot holes, there are loads of obvious continuity errors and a sad, desperate style of direction that seems to drag every scene to the point of agony in a desperate attempt to pad out the already-short running time of the film. The cast do nothing to help things - all the characters are cardboard stereotypes and the ugly, plastic teens seem to be having a battle to see who can be the most skin-crawlingly irritating. I think it ends up as a tie between Katee Sachoff's hyperactive, squeaky airhead and Bianca Kajlich's jitterbug 'heroine', who spends the entire movie simpering and screaming loudly every time someone drops a pin. Oh, for the record, Busta Rhymes is absolutely ATROCIOUS in this. His entire purpose in this movie seems to be to deliver the worst examples of wisecrack-by-numbers dialogue I've ever heard (ie: \"Trick or treat, motherf**ker?\") and he plays his role as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel, but without the charm or charisma of either.I'd like to say John Carpenter would be ASHAMED to see such a horrible mess made out of his characters, but when you consider the maestro himself is making films almost as bad as this these days, he probably couldn't give a toss so long as the money keeps rolling in. I think this fact in itself proves just how much horror movies have changed since the first \"Halloween\" was made and, to its credit, \"Halloween Resurrection\" would be a perfect example of an \"of its time\" product you could stick in an 'early 21st century' time capsule for future generations to balk at. It is every bit as throwaway and pointless as the culture that spawned it. It is loud, crass and in-your-face constantly, despite having absolutely nothing to say when it gets there - it's like the movie equivalent of an annoying little brat screaming at you, desperate for attention. \"Look at me! Look at me! I'm being noisy and irritating!\"... I would highly advise, for your sanity's sake, that you don't look since, like that annoying child, you'll only encourage it and I, for one, don't think I could cope with another sequel this bad... This film is utter garbage and I fail to think of a single way in which they could've made it any worse. A resounding 0 out of 10.",

            "content": "It comes as little surprise that HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION was the last film in the long-running HALLOWEEN series (except for the new Rob Zombie 're-imaginings'). It's a real stinker of a movie, totally devoid of any kind of originality and playing out its storyline with an inane mix of seriousness and goofiness, never really working as a straight film or a spoof. It's heavily indebted to two films: SCREAM, what with the self referencing and the self-aware nature of the hidden cameras, internet webcams etc., and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, with lots of mock-grainy video camera footage used in an attempt at atmospheric scares.HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION begins in a totally unacceptable way: by killing Jamie Lee Curtis' character, Laurie Strode. Apparently, Curtis only agreed to appear if she would be killed off, so the scriptwriter decided to have her do something extremely stupid (and anybody who knows her character, especially from the first film, would know that she would never do something this crazy). Once that unpleasantness is out of the way, we're back into the predictable teen slasher mould, with a bunch of teenagers hooked up in the Myers house, having sex and smoking drugs until Myers himself turns up to bump them off. This film tries to update the plot into the internet age, so characters use palm-top computers and communicate online rather in real life, although oddly nobody seems to use a mobile phone much. It's all rather pointless.The stalk 'n' slash sequences are amusing rather than frightening, and the cheesy gore effects are just that: all effect, all put on, without any impact. There's also one of the dumbest-looking severed head gags I've seen in a movie. The teen cast is pretty awful, with the ladies particularly ill-represented. Bianca Kajlich is an uninteresting heroine, and the rest of the girls are either bimbos or, in the worst case, Tyra Banks. Not that the guys fare much better: the two familiar cast members are American PIE's Thomas Ian Nicholas (he's offed quickly in a gag ripped from HOUSE) and black rapper Busta Rhymes, whose kung fu schtick come the climax is frankly embarrassing. This time around, Myers isn't in the least bit frightening, and he's played by a stuntman who should have stuck to doing stunts rather than trying to act menacing. The only decent thing about this film is the classic HALLOWEEN music, and even that was better in the original.",

He stabs her in the back and sends her off the roof. Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), Rudy Grimes (Sean Patrick Thomas) and Jen Danzig (Katee Sackhoff) are friends studying in Haddonfield University. Jen signs them up for a reality show at the Myers house. They are joined by Bill Woodlake (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Donna Chang, and Jim Morgan in the show run by Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) and Nora Winston (Tyra Banks). Myles Barton is in a chatroom relationship with Sara. Unknown to them, the six reality TV guests are locked in the house with Michael Myers.Despite any possible retcon, the first fifteen minutes are still the best part of this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is Halloween every bit as much as Michael Myers. The rest is something else. Whatever it is, it's not Halloween. The reality TV idea is annoying and it gets worst with the intermittent reality TV camera work. I like a few of the actors, but Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes really lower the likability factor. It's so bad that I am more interested in everybody getting killed. I don't care if any of them survive.",

            "content": "There are just some times when a good movie franchise is abused and milked for all it's worth.  The first of the series is great and sets the mark ,the 2 occasionally 3 sequels that follow are mediocre and anything after that is just trying to make money of an audience that has no other place to spend their money.  I, unfortuantely was a member of that audience, as I paid money to watch HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, the 8th installment of the once classic HALLOWEEN franchise.I don't even no where to start; bad cast, bad acting, boring death scenes (not to sound wierd, but why else do you go see a movie like this), need I go on.If you noticed that this movie is mostly made up of celebrities, it is no mistake.  This is all the movie has going for it, and yet it fails in that department.  The biggest mistake a horror movie can make is when it spends most of its time setting up the big death scenes and then knocks off its characters one right after another.  That is exactly what happens in RESSURECTION.  Every character w/the exception of 2 die in a consecutive chain that takes up about 20 minutes of the movie and the other hour is spent trying to gather of what little plot exists.The horror doesn't stop there.  This HALLOWEEN installment doesn't have the style that made the first two so good.  With the exception of a somewhat unexpected opening, the movie is poorly put together.Clearly an attempt to make some fast cash off a dying series, HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION  hopefully is the last time Micheal Myers takes the screen. Yet, I am sure there will find some way to bring back the masked killer. There always is a chance that the executives in charge of this franchise will make a good decision and hang up the white mask and throw away the knife.  HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION rates as just a 2/10.",

            "content": "I fully understand all of the negative reviews but in my opinion Halloween: Resurrection is, in fact, one of the better editions to the series. Halloween took a quick dive after the first sequel, the third film in the series being nearly unrelated to the rest (not that I hated it- in fact I quite enjoyed it), and then the fourth, fifth and sixth being particularly bad films on their own right, even disregarding the understandable shadow of their origin material. Halloween has always had a troubled and rocky journey as one of the big grossing horror franchises to come out of the time period along with A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. In my humble opinion, this, the eighth film in the series, does what none of the others did- bring a lighthearted campiness to the series. Halloween H20, the preceding sequel, was inordinately well done and quite unexpected, but I think that by the time you reach the 8th film in the series you're expecting little other than some laughs, corniness and maybe a few new and exciting kills. This is what worked so well for Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, but what Halloween had refused to do. All throughout the series, Halloween obstinately stuck to an atmosphere of seriousness, always giving us a straightforward story, never being jovial or satirical until now. This movie may not be the best- the characters can be quite forgettable, the story line is mediocre at best, and the found footage cuts are of low quality and therefore unenjoyable to see on screen. Despite all of this I think that Halloween: Resurrection far surpasses much of the other trash to come from this franchise. And it has Busta Rhymes in it. By the time you reach the eighth film of a horror series what more could you realistically ask for?",

            "content": "Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now in an asylum, where she awaits the inevitable return of Michael Myers. Myers, after visiting her, returns to his childhood home and makes a nightmare for a group of kids who have decided to film a reality show inside the house.First of all, this film pretends that Halloween 4 through 6 never happened, creating the possibility that the Myers house has been abandoned for decades, rather than lived in by other families. This reboot is a result of the writing on H20, but it was still a bad idea no matter who started it.Second, one would think that bringing in Rick Rosenthal would be a good idea. He made \"Halloween 2\", which was probably the last solid part of the franchise. But Rosenthal is clearly not the horror directing master we might have thought, as he approaches this film with a weak vision and sense of style, more emulating MTV than his own work. A quick glance at his credits will explain this: he has spent the last twenty years making teenager-based television rather than horror films.Next, add Busta Rhymes. Like its previous installment with LL Cool J, this is the point in the series where a rapper is added to the mix. Much like how many horror franchises ultimately ended up in space, many started adding rappers to the cast. Why? I do not know. But it does nothing to help the credibility of the picture. Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks do not have the appeal for horror fans that other actors would have.The POV camera thing is a mess. It looks bad and is more or less a bad idea. Yes, it has worked in such films as \"The Blair Witch Project\" and more recent excursions. It does not work here. Had they cut that aspect out entirely, this film would have been a bit better instantly.No horror franchise took as big of a nosedive as \"Halloween\", with this being the final crash landing. Reviews of this film were so poor, and viewer appreciation so weak, it's very unlikely they will ever make another one in the series. Yes, they made the two Rob Zombie films after this, but I just like to pretend that never happened.",

            "content": "\"They don't make 'em like that anymore,\" friends of the horror genre often remark on their web sites in reference to killer films from the late 1970s and 1980s era. They are right.It's not just that sentiments of nostalgia have turned those films into little treasures in our memories. It's because current horror films stink. Not all of them, but plenty or more anyway.Ever since Dwight H. Little last captured the right Halloween spirit and atmosphere in 1988's Halloween 4, the series deteriorated into a ridiculous, messy and pathetic show. I don't care how many fans of the series curse part 3, it was a pleasant watch compared to what came after part 4. Halloween 5 was a complete prank and lacked any sense of storytelling (compliments to Danielle Harris, who managed to perform extremely well under the circumstances). Part 6, well, let's not waste any words on that one. H20 had its moments and decent acting by Jamie Lee Curtis, but a Southern California private school seemed like a poor replacement for Haddonfield. The producers dedicated it to Donald Pleasance, ignoring the fact that his last name was Pleasence (with an E) and had been spelled correctly on all earlier installments that involved his acting. So much for Moustapha Akkad's commitment to the project!Halloween Resurrection had a nice opening scene. A 1960s home movie at the Myers house, with the sounds of Johnny Angel performed by Shelley Fabares. It was cut. Of course, the Akkads in their infinite wisdom must have thought, why bother young people with an old song from someone they have never even heard of! Let's keep the film simple (and let's take a popular hip hop artist as the lead actor).But, thank God, Rick Rosenthal filmed one other decent scene. It involves Jamie Lee Curtis's character hospitalized in a mental institution. This actually is quite a nice scene, with the actress performing wonderfully. It provides a satisfactory and surprisingly original bridge between the events at the end of H20 and the current state of affairs in \"Resurrection\", with Laurie Strode at the end of her wits and a killer still on the loose.And after this? We might as well have left. After the promising Jamie Lee Curtis opening scene there seemed no budget, and more important: no inspiration left to come up with something, anything. It's a bore. It's a drag. The prospect of a replica of the original Myers house showing up is a joke. We're allowed one glimpse, and even on that one occasion it is very unsatisfactory: a big car is parked in front and taking the view, as the camera briefly glances up from a low, moving position. It beats me why they even bothered rebuilding it. The interior scenes can be ignored in this sense: it may have been any old house that Busta Rhymes's character Freddie Harris decided to do his online reality show in. And about these characters: have they ever been this flat in ANY Halloween sequel? NO! The characters in Halloween 5 or 6 were drawn brilliantly compared to what is presented to us here! Okay I realize this is actually pretty much of an achievement. Credit to Larry Brand and Sean Hood. It's amazing. The unimpressive cast (I'm not counting Curtis) is highlighted by 'stars' Busta Rhymes (pop artist who is kindly given the chance to act) and Tyra Banks (model who is kindly given the chance to act). Let's suffice by saying that in this case the actors have been given the roles they deserve.Enough said. Or... We often are told one should not apply the same criteria to a horror film as the ones that apply to drama or classics. But why on earth not? I admire more than one horror movie, but that does not mean I feel I should appreciate the crappy ones by the grace of the good ones. I can see when a film is made with no heart, no spirit and Resurrection is the key example of that. Furthermore, if these films -as we are told so often by people like Moustapha Akkad- are made for entertainment (read: cashing in) purposes only and not for quality acting, complex storytelling or great photography then why, why, why do they so vigorously renounce that one basic goal, the goal of being entertaining???",

And there are so many things that could've been better. 1. the title would've made more sense if Laurie had succeeded in killing Michael.

Reality TV was still very popular, and you can see why they came up with this plot.Sadly that's the end of the good news, from there on it's downhill, I personally disliked the story, they had no qualms about cheapening the legacy of the great Halloween. It's tacky, the production, plot, characters lack any sense of quality, only the music stands out well. The behaviours of all characters are nonsensical, you keep saying to yourself 'would they really do that?'They tried, but failed. 4/10",

Halloween 8 is an awful movie that is devoided of any orginality or redeeming qualties (Trya Banks is smoking hot, but is little more than an extra with a line or two). Halloween 8 spits on everything that previous movies have worked hard to preserve since John Carpenters genre inventing original, the worst Halloween 8 actually think's it has the goods.H8 had an impressive budget (due to the healthy box office of the last film) but squanders it on actors that add nothing to the movie but prolong their own dismial carrers. Busta Rhymes actually proves a good leading man until becoming undone by his own ego, most of the other actors have tongue firmly pressed in their check and most phone it in. Jamie Lee Curtis deserves special mention as she almost displays hate for her iconic cult character and cant wait to put to the whole franchise in the past.As a fan of the franchise the biggest problem I had was an arrogance to acknowledge previous movies in the series and tries to forge it's own path that leaves Michael Myers holding his dick in his hand. Halloween 8 Resurrection come across as a scream hybrid that wont satisfy casual fans or die hards and as the final reel fades out everyone will be thinking \"That would never happen\".",

No 7th or 8th film in a series is any good, the 4th, 5th and 6th usually aren't neither, but that's ok. Actually, I had some hopes for this film, walking in the theater. The original Halloween was one of the best in the genre, with never-dying Michael Myers entering the big-screen in spectacular fashion. But the second in the series was already far beyond par, and the rest was pure formula (haven't seen any of em though). Then came H20: 20 YEARS LATER, which benefited again from Jamie Lee Curtis' presence. Not a good film, far from being a stand-out in the genre, but at least it had SCREAM-writer Kevin Williamson on the credits, and was actually pretty enjoyable too. So I thought: well, maybe this new Halloween will have some suspense too, maybe some surprises (I'm a sucker for surprises). But what I saw...well, I'm still speechless. This film was even worse than most stupid entries in this genre.First of all, we get a stupid explanation for the fact that Michael is STILL alive (unbelievable if you saw the previous one). Then we get Jamie Lee Curtis in the mental hospital. What happens next, might show her attitude towards the series by now. The beginning has actually nothing to do with the rest of the film, it isn't even a good opening to this film, unlike the SCREAM-intros. Then we get to see the actual film, which is pretty much, like one of the characters puts it, Halloween meets the Osbournes, or Big Brother, or the German movie DAS EXPERIMENT, or whatever. You put the usual bunch of irritating high-school friends in one house, put some cameras on top and let Mike (umm...Michael) Myers do his thing. Is it thrilling? Nope, it just seems Myers is doing a routine slashing in here. There's no suspense at all, just people getting killed like you knew they would. Not hard to guess that the \"smartest\" will survive. Is it funny? Yeah, if you can laugh at lame dialogue and the aforementioned irritating characters. If that's your thing, fine, shows why all these dumb-headed high-school comedies nowadays are such a success. Oh, and it's so dumb-minded that you can't even stop shouting at the screen: \"Oh, come on! As if...\"But what could you expect from a movie that was directed by the same man that directed Halloween II? It's so formula that you cannot only predict everything from the first til the last minute, but it's so bad that the last-minute surprise is even more irritating than usual. It's so obvious by now that, indeed, \"Evil never dies\" , that it's even boring to see these people trying to put M.M. to rest, without being ultimately successful. How long will they go on with this and what's the point of making another movie like this if nothing works out in the end. I'm sure Michael must be pretty tired by now. But maybe we get a Halloween: 60 years later, in x years time, where Michael is a geriatric patient, killing off his fellow patients. Maybe that would be a thriller! As far as this one is concerned: it's more of a thrill finding ways to stay awake while Michael is doing his thing than watching this bore. 1/10",

            "content": "Every wretched movie in this yawn-inducing series retroactively changes the ending of the previous film, so, it comes as absolutely no surprise that, yet again, this latest, and last, sequel to Carpenter's wildly overrated original begins by retroactively changing the ending of H2O. It is most difficult to care what happens when we know that, no matter what happens, the ending will be changed in the next sequel, which is contractually obligated. Now get this: it was not The Shape who lost his head at the end of H2O, it was some random ambulance driver, who The Shape dressed in his own clothes and put his mask on before making his escape. Somehow, this random ambulance driver gained superhuman strength, survived being run over by Laurie, assumed a confrontational stance and stared down the van she tried to run him over with for a second time, survived the fall down the hillside, and didn't bother to even try to take his mask off. It was not until *after* she beheaded him that the mask was removed, and we learn of the switch. There are at least SIX completely implausible points in that set up. We've been told repeatedly that Myers is trying to kill any living relative. If that is true, then after he kills JLC at the end of her contractually obligated cameo appearance, why doesn't he bother going after her teenage son (from H2O)? Apparently that would make too much sense. He decides to go back to his childhood home, which, by all accounts, should have been demolished decades ago, and hacks up a group of college-aged losers who are there filming a reality programme for internet viewers. Internet viewers who think it is only a Halloween horror film, and shout commentary at their screens, a la Mystery Science Theatre. The producers even tried to add a little bit of \"buddy movie\" here, as one of the viewers helps the lead girl, over the web. The overly self-aware casting is overflowing with celeb-retards , with ... I shudder to even type his name, \"Busta Rhymes\" as the token rapper, Tyra (America's Next Top Model) Banks, JLC only along for the ride to add her name value to this enervation, along with various other no-names who will never be heard from again, even if their character survives this one. The climax has Myers boringly being set on fire again, and electrocuted, in an ending which made me say \"We already know that won't kill him\", as it rips off Halloween II, co-directed by this film's director, Rick Rosenthal. And of course, the obligatory, contractually obligated set-up for yet another sequel, which, if it ever materialises, will doubtlessly begin by retroactively changing this film's ending. When do we get a sequel which shows Myers going after the Akkads, to finally end this crap?",

It's completely content at being what it is: a bland entry into a franchise that, with the exception of one film, had descended into parody a long time before. The one thing this movie does try to do different with the franchise is that it uses more F bombs than all the other Halloween films put together (before Zombie, of course). This should be no surprise given Busta Rhymes is one of the stars. So yeah...that's something to be proud of.The cast is mostly terrible. Jamie Lee Curtis, clearly fed up with Halloween, reprises her iconic role for the sole purpose of seeing her killed off once and for all. You can't really blame her for wanting to be rid of this mess. The rest of the cast is made up of the super annoying Busta Rhymes, the beautiful Tyra Banks, and a host of (at that time) aspiring stars. Of the bunch I would say Bianca Kajlich and Katee Sackhoff comport themselves best. Obviously this movie did nothing to help the careers of anybody involved with it.Rick Rosenthal, who I felt did a decent job way back when with part 2, directs ineptly here. There isn't a memorable scene in the entire movie. It's just a loud, obnoxious mess of a slasher film. I struggle to decide whether this is the worst of the series or part 5 is. Both are excrement. There's also something truly sad about a Halloween movie being so unoriginal that it borrows from or rips off various other movies (Blair Witch Project, Scream, Terminator 2, Peeping Tom). The first Halloween movie was an innovator, not an imitator. It's just sad to see how far the franchise fell by 2002. I also think it was very indicative of the state of horror films at the time.",

Sure they found a clever way to undo the closure of Halloween H2O and make it possible to bring Mike up to his old shenanigans, unfortunately that whole segment is hasty and the rest of the movie's garbage. The \"what really happened\" explanation is just a loophole for making a movie that's neither necessary nor any good, and so I present to you Halloween: Resurrection.I'm not going to write any spoilers about what happens to Laurie, but I think anyone who loves the original Halloween and its characters will think what they did with her in this movie is crap and only put her in here for the sake of having Laurie in it.The characters are plastic. Even by the end of the movie when you get to know all of them a little bit, you don't care enough about them to want to see them escape the wrath of Mike Myers. In fact, you'll probably look forward to their demise at his hands. That's how flat and/or despicable these characters are. Even the lead role doesn't have much personality. She's nice and smart and decent, just like Laurie was in fact, but somehow she doesn't have much personality. I don't think her character was developed enough, otherwise she could have made a good heroine. The rest of the characters are people you pretty much hope get killed off, especially the tech lady played by Tyra Banks and most of the kids that tour the haunted house. Obnoxious people, hastily made characters. And Busta Rhymes plays the typical black dude with a boisterous personality. Not a bad acting job, but what a typical clich\u00e9 character.The technology is another factor. Another case of fusing horror with the fancy gimmick of modern technology (or what was modern in 2002 anyways). Just because we have things like reality shows and phone-texting nowadays does not mean it will make a horror movie any scarier, or realistic, or better at all. Having people emailing and playing on their phones and all in the movie takes away from the good old-fashioned terror you get from something as simple as a lurking shadow or the gleam of a butcher knife.There's a couple of notably cool things in the movie, like when Freddy dresses up like Mike Myers while Mike is there in the flesh and you see two Mikes walking one behind the other. Well that was more funny than anything. The scene with the bong was funny too. And the murder scenes are alright and in typical Mike Myers fashion, but otherwise Resurrection bombs as a horror film and leaves you yet again with no closure, except this time you wouldn't really want to see another sequel.",

The film starts three years after the events of H20, with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in psychiatric care after chopping the head off Michael Myers. In a small series of flashbacks you find out that it wasn't actually Michael (Brad Loree), it was another man in his costume (which makes no sense whatsoever). He manages to get back to Laurie, and in attempt to kill him she and he end up falling off a roof, with Laurie getting his knife in her chest. You'd assume Michael would stop killing once his sister is dead, but no, TV producer Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) is setting up the reality TV show DangerTainment inside the house that young Michael grew up in. A bunch of thrill-seeking volunteers have agreed to live and be filmed by various cameras inside this house, with no way out. The volunteers are Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Donna (Daisy McCrackin), Jen (White Noise 2: The Light's Katee Sackhoff), Bill (American Pie's Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Scott (Billy Kay). Obviously not long after they have entered Michael shows up to murder all the volunteers, and Freddie was planning to scare them dressed as Michael, and it takes a while for the viewers of the show to realise what is happening is real. In the end, it looks like Michael Myers is killed in a fire started, but when he is taken to the morgue his eyes open, so he could be alive (of course!). Also starring Luke Kirby as Jim, Ryan Merriman as Myles Barton, Tyra Banks as Nora and Rick Rosenthal as Professor. The violence is limited, Curtis has a pathetic final appearance, the performances are all dull, the camera work looks like a crap attempt at The Blair Witch Project in places, it is just a boring attempt at a revamp for an already dying series.

But I watched, and you want to know why? Dedication. I've put in hours watching the horrid Halloweens from part three on up, so what's one more bad sequel?H.R. picks up three years after H20 (which had another New York rapper in L.L. Cool J). Laurie Strode (JLC) is in a ward of some kind for mental patients. We find out through some lousy soap opera-style writing that Laurie Strode never killed Michael Myers in H20, but rather an EMT whom Michael put his mask on so he could escape. Ridiculous I know. It doesn't even suit M.M.'s persona to take his mask off and put it on someone else so that he can escape. That would imply fear or awareness of danger which Myers has none of.At any rate, he caught up with Laurie at her place of institutionalization and finally succeeded in killing her*, then politely handed over his beloved butcher knife to a patient as if to say, \"I'm retired.\"*I wonder how they solve that problem for Laurie Strode to be in \"Halloween\" (2018)?H.R. then jumps to Haddonfield, Illinois, the birthplace of it all. Freddie (Busta Rhymes) and his assistant Nora (Tyra Banks) of Dangertainment have selected six participants to spend Halloween night in the Myers house. The whole event is to be streamed POV on the internet. Maybe that could work in 2021, but in 2002 that idea would be dead in the water. Internet speeds on average were what... 5Mbps? I think I had the top tier of AT&T U-Verse back then and I had a whopping 18Mbps. That was barely ideal for internet surfing, so streaming was totally out of the question. And what was more technologically mysterious were the text messages the main character, Sarah (Bianca Kajlich), was receiving. They were coming in one letter at a time! As a secret admirer of hers was watching the stream, he was trying to help her by alerting her of Myers' whereabouts in the house (as if there wouldn't have been massive lag in the stream). As he was texting her, the text messages were appearing on her phone screen one letter at a time which has NEVER been the way texting worked. So, in a technological leap forward we get a live streamed show in 2002, while at the same time we get some incredibly backwards and non-existent form of text messaging. Unreal.Anyway, hack hack, kill kill, Michael Myers slices and dices through ten bodies by the time it's all said and done. Predictably, one girl lives while other more able-bodied people die. She was the one cautious, simple, morally upright, non-ostentatious character so she deserved to live. Same formula that was used back in 1978 when the first \"Halloween\" was made. You'd think after 24 years they'd try something new.",

And they don't. The main point with Carpenter is that he manages to produce and set up some crucial moments when we don't know who is who and where we are, in reality or in virtuality, in a real murder or in a fake hoax. And that is when we get over the limit and manage to believe the unbelievable. Carpenter is also extremely good at keeping the film in dark shadowy half lights that are necessary for him to play on the depth of the picture and to hide what is going to come out of the dark without any due process of announcing itself. You must not look for any deeper or wider meaning, because there is none, except that we accept to be the eye of the camera, or we accept the camera to be our eye, hence we accept to be voyeurs inside a film that is itself a voyeuristic adventure since we capture the action through cameras and TV screen relayed onto the internet and a portable telephone. We are confronted to at least two if not three levels of voyeurism with the organizers of the first level becoming the direct victims of the adventure, and then the guinea pigs of these becoming the victims of the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic game they had accepted to get into. And even further the audience of these two levels on the Internet becoming themselves victims of the game because they believe it is a game even when it turns more than sour. It is the use of a portable telephone via an instant messenger that will enable this voyeuristic audience to become compassionate. And we, the voyeurs of Carpenter's film, are like innocent angels victimized by Carpenter and his tricks and what's more we enjoy it and would like to see some more, so that we even know, accept, desire and enjoy the very last punch line that closes this film without closing Michael Myers' eyes: he is eternal because after all this is reality TV and not any virtual fable told by some perverse deranged greedy film director.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",

            "content": "Halloween Resurrection is one of those movies that is hard to recommend. It has a few hits, but far too many misses, foul balls, and walks. As a real sequel, it follows H20 several years later when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now in a mental institution. She has gone permanently crazy. Michael Myers, as to no surprise, shows up to finally do her in. At this point, it seems Halloween Resurrection could have stopped. Not so fast. A crazy reality television producer wants a new reality show. He has several people spend the night in the home of Michael Myers in Haddonfield, Illinois. This is to the chagrin of the town, as well as the resident. After all, this is Michael's home. In any case, the bleached William Shatner mask makes its return to take-out the unwanted guests. There are a few tense moments that give us a little scare, and a little suspense. Still, this is not true to the Halloween myth. Even looking at Halloween 4, 5, and 6, as well as the official trilogy of 1, 2, and 7, Michael Myers has a vendetta against relatives. Once they are eliminated, the rage should be gone. As for this one, there is no \"reaching\" out to the person trapped inside the pathological, methodological madness. That is what really brings this movie down to the real \"slasher\" level. There is no depth of character the Shape offers in previous roles. Worse, there is no protagonist with the relationship. We had Laurie for one set, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie in the other. In other words, there is no real \"hero.\" Finally, just as in H20 (and the remake), there is no guts in release date. This movie is called Halloween. So why is it released in the summer? Apparently, producers had no confidence in the king of Halloween. In any case, we have finally crossed into the Friday the 13th universe where mediocrity is abound. Of course, I think mediocre is generous.",

I'm not even going to name the rapper, he ruined the whole thing. He must've had some kind of influence in the writing because he got to yell put downs at Michael Myers in one scene without getting his throat cut, and in the last pathetic scenes he gets to karate-kick Myers and shock him to death while getting some verbal thrashings in. This alone should make most people want to throw up. The camera work throughout the house was incredibly lame. If you dislike stupid camera effects as much as I do, stay away from this. It was giving me a headache. Jamie Lee was killed off at the beginning, the most likely reason is she wanted this to happen so she wouldn't have to be in any more sequels. Her final kiss goodbye accompanied by the line \"see you in hell\" was terrible. This movie ranks way down there with Charlies Angels: Full Throttle as my all time worst.

            "content": "Let me answer on my summary, everything can go wrong. First, it picks up were H20 ended so again forget part 3,4,5 and 6. Secondly, money makes the world go around, Jamie Lee Curtis is just in it for a teaser. And last, Michael died in H2O but here they gave a stupid twist to H2O's ending and never explained anything. The only good thing was that they brought back Rick Rosenthal, the director of part 2.So Laurie Strode is just in it in the first minutes, the part that makes H2O a bit laughable, but once that's over we see the main storyline. And here we have the popularization of Michael Myers. This has nothing to do with Halloween, I remember pinhead (Hellraiser: Hellworld) being involved in an internet craziness, well, this is nothing else. Just watch Michael's first killing, that's surely based on, and an inside joke, to Peeping Tom's killings with a tripod. Look, if you go back to the Myers' house than it's just not possible that Michael is still living in that house, abandoned for 20 years. And with the kids running into trouble, nobody goes out to rescue them, even as you can follow their mayhem on the Net! And the way it was filmed is just picking in, again, on mockumentaries and docu style horrors like Blair Witch or FearDotCom. I have seen the 4 endings that were shot and one, the CSI ending was surely made to go further on with the franchise. Katee Sackhoff was in this flick as Jen just to move one year later to the Batllestar Galactica series as Starbuck. Daisy McCrackin, reveals some flesh and there's more red stuff and stabbing then in H2O, so on that part it really looks more Halloween then H2O but still, bad storyline. Up to this writing Michael didn't reappear if we don't count Rob Zombie's remake with it. Brad Loree did fine as Michael Myers, and the acting was okay, sadly as John Carpenter once said, a good flick needs a good story, and how many franchises died with the popularisation of the main character (remember Freddy!)Gore 2/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",

The movie had no redeeming features. College students that you really didn't care for thrown into a MTV's Fear kind of setting that is the Myers House.Tyra Banks by far was the worst actress in this film, she played an idiotic role and was no need for her in it. The whole Internet thing takes the confined spaces that the other films offered and puts it on display like a freakshow for all to see. The Halloween series is supposed to be dark, scary, and extremely shocking. This entry is boring, lackluster, and just plain dull.*spoiler* And why did they have kill off Laurie Strode? She survived all of Michael's attacks, shouldn't she have been given a reprive?\nThis movie sucked tho, and that is thanks to Mostapha Akkad, in any interview he does, he jerks his thumb at the statue of Michael that is behind him and says 'As Long As This Guy Is Around, We'll make money.' Sadly, the production, and scripts suffer due to this. Akkad won't let Michael die...and then the films will become a joke.Rick Rosenthal was ripping off his previous halloween 2 directing days. Michael appears out of the shadows, a character slipping in blood, and 'Dr. Mixer' a character out of H2.... *sigh*  Rosenthal should stick with directing TV episodes, which he's done for the past 10+ years. Don't direct a bad movie.John Carpenter or Kevin Williamson has to come back and write a decent script for this series! If you want to understand what really drove Michael to kill his sister, read the Halloween novel by 'Curtis Richards'. It is much, much better that any of the sequels and ranks up there with the first film.I thought Halloween 6 was bad, 6 is actually one of the better films in the series compared to this. this is the worst in the series!!!!\nIf I gave this film any stars, I'd be kidding myself.",

Michael finally finishes off his sister, Laurie Strode, which kinda sucked. One year has passed and Freddie Harris starts a new website called DangerTainment and six lucky people win a chance to be in it, and the location is Michael Myers' childhood home. I love that the house looks just like the original house. Sara, Rudy, Jen, Bill, Donna, and Jim are the winners, and they meet Freddie and Nora for their interviews. Meanwhile, across town, Myles 'Deckard' Barton is watching Sara do her interview, because he is interested in her and has been helping her with internet stuff. on HALLOWEEN, they all go to the Myers house, and broadcast live on the Internet for millions of people to watch. No one can leave until the show is over, so they are all locked in. Little do they know, Michael is back and doesn't like uninvited guests. At a college HALLOWEEN party, Myles 'Deckard' is watching the show, and when Michael shows up, Myles believes that the people are actually being killed, but no one else at the party does until Sara is the last one alive and calls Myles for help to tell her where Michael is at. Freddie finds Sara and realizes what is happening. Most people hate that Busta Rhymes karate-chops Michael, but I have no problem at all with it! Later, in the garage, Sara has been knocked on the ground with some heavy equipment on her, and Michael is coming to kill her, then Freddie knocks the door down, and says \"Trick or treat, motherfu#*er!\" to Michael because he thought he killed Freddie.

            "content": "If there is one thing that can be counted upon in Hollywood, it is the sequel. As long as the film either makes a profit, however small, or is enough of a tax write-off to keep the producers afloat, the sequels will keep on a-coming. In some cases, such as X-Men 2 or Aliens, this is a good thing. However, they are a small minority that prove the rule, regardless of their excellence in themselves.Horror franchises are the worst offenders in this regard. It's not so surprising when you consider that horror is a difficult genre to make work, and that no writer wants to be associated with a horror film that fell flat (what's the writer of Halloween III up to lately?). There are, of course, only so many different ways one can kill people before it becomes blas\u00e9, so to speak. But, as recent films like Ringu or its American equivalent have shown, Hollywood can get significantly more original with its horror than it has tried for most of the last twenty years.The original Halloween, much like the original A Nightmare On Elm Street or the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was a novel concept that brought something new to the genre. In the case of Halloween, that something new was a silent killer who at times seemed more sane than his doctor. Of course, it also helped blow the number of murders committed by the mentally ill way out of proportion in the mind of the public, but it also exploits the fact that the extremely mentally ill are much more creative (Ed Gein, for example).The Halloween \"franchise\" should never have made it past the second episode. Where the first episode spent time creating an atmosphere and set up characters one cared about, the second episode could be summed up with \"hey, bimbo, try power-walking, he'll never catch you that way\". The worst part is that every episode since could be summed up in exactly the same manner. The fifth film made an abortive attempt to restore this tension, but failed.Fast forward to film number eight, and the best idea that the writers can come up with is sticking a mob of dopey twenty-somethings into the Myers house as part of a reality TV show. Not only is this a creative vacuum, it also opens up a million plot holes. For one thing, if the street that the Myers house is located on is still part of a residental zone, one has to wonder why the house hasn't simply been torn down and either had another house built on it, or been replaced by a small park. Another big plot problem is the stupidity of the cast. A murderer taking so long to dispose of a body, dragging a video camera all the while, is just begging to be caught.There's also a big problem with cinematography. One would have thought that if the idea of resolutions lower than 35mm film in theatres hadn't been firmly killed by cinematic turds like Blair Christian Project, it certainly has been buried by the likes of Baise-Moi or Attack Of The Clones. A signifcant portion of the film is seen through the eyes of web cameras, however, and the abrupt transitions between the formats do not make for a pleasant viewing experience.This is to say nothing of the fact that in spite of trying to make the film more \"now\" (did I mention the poorly-research pop-psychology subtexts?), the plot essentially boils down to \"Michael Myers shows up in Haddonfield, kills a bunch of random strangers, someone 'kills' him, the end\". Not exactly what I would call even slightly creative. Compare this with Ringu's ending, and it is easy to see why American horror films are so derided, even in their country of origin.I am not surprised in the slightest that the rating for this film is 4.4 out of ten. As I sit and watch it now, I don't think of how creative or interesting the story is, as I did with parts one and three. I think to myself something along the lines of \"Can't the Akkads do something creative for a change?\". I think that, in essence, summarises every frame of the film.",

Busta Rhymes is here and...it's pretty obvious he had some demands as to how his character would need to be portrayed to star in this s**tpile.

He just sorta walks around and swings his knife around, without rhyme or reason.Not only that, but the filmmakers decided that cutting between a normal film and grainy, almost unwatchable footage was a good idea. That it was also a good idea to cut a million times anytime Michael goes to kill someone, so there's literally no memorable kills here at all.The Ugly: Ironically, the film that was supposed to \"resurrect\" the Halloween franchise basically killed it.

There is not a single character in this that you can relate to(all are stereotypical and one-note), like, and there's a mere handful of them that you can even stand. They go out of their way to be obnoxious, and you do not feel any sympathy when they die. The acting is utterly unimpressive, for both the names and the unknowns in the cast. Worst are probably the model and the rapper. The music is OK, and the original theme does turn up here and there. This doesn't build up atmosphere, suspense or tension all that well. There are cheap scares, the set-up is forced, and, well, here's a clue for the film-makers who clearly had none: When those in the movie are bored, the viewers are, too. Editing and cinematography are decent at best. The show doesn't make sense; are they only going to do it once a year, on Halloween? There's only the one house, are they picking up a new sensationalist background for each iteration? Is it a one-time thing? Why on Earth do they think they'll be rich, it's not like they have something easy to franchise? This isn't likely to satisfy the least picky of its intended audience. There is plenty of bloody(and at points, gory) violence, relatively frequent strong language, a little sexuality/suggestive material and brief gratuitous nudity.

Michael Myers switched places with a Paramedic... I'd love to know where he keeps his spare masks? You'd think, that when he woke up in the van, he would have ripped his mask off, so Laurie would know that she had the wrong guy? Oh no...And thus, is the beginning of a truly terrible addition to an otherwise successful franchise. We finally get closure between Laurie and Michael right at the beginning... but after all Laurie has been through, I didn't think she would be stupid enough to double check she had the right guy, especially when he was stalking her with a knife anyway..Weak direction. Weak script. Weak cast. Busta Rhymes is obnoxious as Freddie Price, an entrepreneur of an internet web cast called Dangertainment, who selects 6 high school clich\u00e9s to spend a night in Myers childhood home. OF course, Myers trashes the party, and offs people in a way that doesn't go with the Halloween movies. In earlier movies, the violence and the gore was kept to our imagination. We would see the events leading to it, the flash of a knife, and then we would imagine the rest. \"Resurrection\" has blood and gore like there's no tomorrow, and it felt like I was watching some tacked on slasher movie, not one of the many sequels to Halloween.The Halloween movies were a rare franchise, that was intelligent, and always had the ability to shock, and entertain. The first movie sets the standards for all of todays slasher flicks. Halloween II was slightly dodgy with its story, and the pace was slow, but it was entertaining. Things dipped a bit in the late 80's, early 90's, but by H20, new life has been breathed into the series, and I thought things could only get better. How wrong I was.I almost feel ashamed for watching it all the way to the end. Saying that, I will watch it again. It's Halloween after all, and every movie franchise has a bad turkey (Phanton Menace, Freddy Vs Jason, Any hellraiser movie after the third...)

It seems the only reason she showed up was to set up why Michael was still alive (and their reasoning was less than satisfactory - it was asinine).  It would have been interesting if, as I was led to believe, her neurotic character was like Linda Hamilton in T2, escaping from the asylum to hunt down her brother...but no.  Instead, we're fed a Blair-Witch-Project-meets-Halloween setup, complete with dizzying, often annoying camerawork, a lot of bad jokes, tit-shots, and an assortment of one-dimensional characters who you never really care about as they're being sliced and diced by the maniac in the (now more detailed) William Shatner mask.  H20 should have been the end.  The previous entry was made with loving care by people who obviously had respect for the original film - and more than a typical bloody sequel, they were looking for a clever way to end the series. There was a plot, strong characters, and a purpose.  The new incarnation follows the typical bloody sequel trend, pitting the bad-guy against a bunch of unsuspecting kids.  Yet again, tons of bloodshed ensues.  And then we're left with that typical ending, standard from \u009180s films (particularly Friday the 13th) where  they leave it wide open for another sequel with the corpse's eyes opening.  Yawn.  I'm a huge horror (and Halloween) fan, but I've already seen this movie a billion times under a billion different titles with a billion different casts.\nI will admit that it's not all bad, though the cons far outweigh the pros. There is some clever dialogue (\"You have nice legs, when do they open?\") as well as an amusing on-camera bong scene.  The effects are generally good. And the guy playing Michael this time did a good job mimicking Nick Castle's mannerisms.  If this were made prior to H20, I might have liked it more. But enough's enough already!  Finally, what's up with the constantly evolving mask?  Not since part 2 has it even remotely looked like it did in the original.

Reality shows of course were a big and still new thing at the time of this movie but that doesn't mean you should drag the Halloween-series down to this level.

They entire world can watch it online but nobody seems to be worried when people start to die pretty quickly on already. Also not the crew of the show, which seems to consist out of 3 people only for some weird reason.It's of course not also really a very original concept to begin with. I mean it has been done many times before, in one way or another- and also a lot better in previous horror movies. Besides it doesn't really provide the movie with any exciting horror moments, mostly because it's being predictable all.\"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\" was not a perfect movie but it still was a decent enough reboot for the series, which introduced the Halloween movies to the more modern present style of horror film-making. With this movie they totally seem to abandoning this approach again and they pick a totally different approach again, which needless to say, doesn't work out very well.It was an horrible choice to kill of Laurie Strode in this one. Jamie Lee Curtis returned to the Halloween series in 1998 with \"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later\" and she reprises her role again in this movie but she is only in it for the first 5 minutes or so, in which she gets killed off by the Michael Myers character.This movie doesn't introduce some very hopeful new characters. I hope they were not thinking that Sara Moyer could be a good new main character for the series. It seems like a poor choice that the movie mostly decided on casting in youngsters, no doubt in an attempt to attract a new crowd of young people to the Halloween-series. The last movie had LL Cool J as a comical relief, this time this questionable honor goes to Busta Rhymes. He's just being Busta Rhymes though, pretending to be an actor. It must be said though that his characters works out better and more useful for the movie than LL Cool J's did in the previous movie.Funny though that the movie is being directed by Rick Rosenthal, the movie who 21 before this movie also directed \"Halloween II\". Other than that he really hasn't directed a lot more movies throughout his career.\"Halloween: Resurrection\" is a very simplistic and lazy written movie, that focuses more on attracting a new young audience than it thinks off the older and faithful fans of the series.

A horrible experiment gone absolutely wrong(As if the mere idea of it should evoke any kind of hope. Yeah, right!), and as we all know, in ultra commercial Follywood they simply love to hold on for dear life to anything that is slick, superficial, vomit-inducing, and ergo anything that makes sure the cardboard figures working there gets their hard earned millions. Anyway, back to this sad, sad, show I was talking about. Of course the best thing would have been not to spend one single iota of energy on it, but I figured that I might get some good, unintentional comedy, so why not? And sure as hell, what unfolded itself before my very eyes was a lesson in learning how to phrase a sentence like all good illiterates do; think long and hard before uttering the most simple thought, speak like a lazy drunkard, get your words(or letters for that matter) mixed up, and wait for it....here it comes...Wait...act like this is the way to go, act like you're real tough, when you actually have the vocabulary of a mentally challenged 3-year old!!

Maybe the FBI should have considered having a rapper on their payroll the next time they want to catch a serial killer, everyone knows now that a few pathetic karate-kicks, and lots and lots of verbal profanity is the way to go when faced with evil.

(Btw, that's not spoiling anything.)But hey... at least it wasn't set in space, which is where other horror movie franchises seem to want to go to die when they realize they've run out of ideas. (*Cough, cough*... Friday the 13th, Leprechaun, Critters, etc., *cough*) I guess that's sort-of a plus.\"Halloween: Resurrection\" is a tedious, shallowly-trendy, under- written (and under-directed) and shockingly cartoonish nail in the coffin to what started out as an excellent horror film series. The original was a classic by any measure, and a surprising number of the sequels were actually quite good as well. (In particular the second film, and the 20th Anniversary release \"Halloween H20\", both of which are definitely some of the best slasher-sequels ever made.)Even at their worst, earlier entries showed quite a bit of class and effort (even when it failed spectacularly, as in films like \"Curse of Michael Myers\"). Whereas this entry is instead keen to deliver the most boringly by-the-books scares and cardboard-flat characters, all while shoehorning in an incredibly dated plot revolving around the internet and reality TV- things that were just starting to take off big at the time. This reveals that the film is little more than a cash-in on the internet/reality-TV crazes, while also trying to capitalize by being part of a recognizable franchise. It's the absolute embodiment of \"hack filmmaking.\"And the true tragedy of this- this film was directed by Rick Rosenthal, who directed the generally very well-received \"Halloween II\", which is arguably one of the strongest entries in the entire franchise. In a shocking 180 degree turn, his return to the franchise results not in another solid sequel, but instead this abomination- the absolute worst in the entire franchise.After a prologue sequence too insulting to long-time franchise fans to even bother summarizing here, we are introduced to our new \"characters\" (a term I use loosely), who are to be featured on an upcoming internet-based reality-TV series. The hook of the show: They are to spend a night exploring the old Michael Myers house in Haddonfield, Illinois. Of course you know that that means: Michael comes home, and decides it's time to pick-off these intruders one-by- one, forcing them to try and fight for their survival.Nothing about this film works.Performances are stale, and alternate between irritatingly boring and infuriatingly over-the-top. The worst contender being the aforementioned rapper, Busta Rhymes, who seems to be trying way too hard to convince the world he's a charming, funny, likable actor when he clearly is out of his element. He comes across as a weirdly contrived cartoon-character that has been shoehorned into the film.The script (courtesy Larry Band and Sean Hood) is a disheartening and frankly condescending mish-mash of lazy re-hashes from prior films and the forced inclusion of the \"modern\" (aka, dated within six months) elements like the internet/reality-TV angle. \"Modern\" elements which were clearly only included because one of the writers happened to open up the entertainment section of his newspaper one day and see the words \"internet\" and \"reality-TV\" in the headlines, and came under the impression that putting these contrivances in would make the film feel \"timely.\"Add to that the obvious indifference on the part of director Rosenthal, and you can tell this film is just a complete mess. The film feels like he couldn't care less about crafting a good thriller. Scenes are shot with the most obnoxiously boring compositions, set design is clich\u00e9 (Oooo... creepy, grimy hallways... I haven't seen that before in every other horror film ever), poor costume design, etc. Rosenthal just didn't seem to put his heart into any decision made, and it's clear the whole film suffers for it.Heck. Even the mask used in the film doesn't measure up to previous entries. It's weird, cheap and looks like a bad fan-made piece of costuming, as opposed to a major Hollywood release.This is the film that destroyed the franchise. After the stellar prior entry, I had high hopes, and this film seemed like it was purposely going out of it's way to fail to meet any expectation... Even the lowest of expectation.This gets a well-deserved 1 out of 10. And I personally find it such a bizarrely poor film, that in no way fits in with the rest of the franchise tonally or stylistically... I don't even count it as canonical.",

I particularly liked the ending. It sort'a wrapped things up neatly I thought. But since they HAD to bring old Michael back (and by the way, I'm not complaining) they at least did it in a semi-plausible way.Halloween Resurrection takes place three years after H20 and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is in a mental hospital, following the traumatic experience of decapitating the wrong guy. Michael pays her a visit and thereafter the Michael vs. Laurie plot is laid to rest.BRING ON SOME NEW MEAT! An internet company titled DANGERTAINMENT (cool title) decides to offer a few young people the opportunity to spend a full night in Michael Myers's old house and the whole show will be broadcast live over the net. Of course, when they get there, Michael is waiting for them with a big sharp knife.Resurrection doesn't offer any novelty to the series. This is a plain slasher fest with no subplot whatsoever. That's basically OK, I mean, it's fast paced, Michael gets down and dirty from the get go and it's over in an hour and twenty minutes. The movie has some definite highlights and it generates a decent amount of suspense and has some very cool kills. Director Rick Rosenthal returns to the series, he made a very decent Halloween 2 and obviously has some respect for the genre.But the film isn't overall successful. It's got a paper thin storyline and you basically don't care about any of the characters, none. There's an annoying storyline concerning a geeky teenage boy at a party who watches the live show and of course he's the only one who knows that the show is for real while everyone else are totally oblivious to that fact. Busta Rhymes isn't very good as a central character. He simply doesn't fit all that well in this movie. His fancy (but utterly stupid) lines over the course of the whole film are really annoying. Just think how much better the movie would have been with a better written character and actor. LL Cool J, also a rapper, fared much better in H20. The internet angle, a new twist, is interesting but not used to it's full potential. I didn't think it added anything, I mean, it's just the routine slash fest that delivers here. And the tunnel, well, I thought it was just too much.But these Halloween films aren't perfect. Fans like them like this, with all their imperfections. They could make 5 more movies like this and I'd go see them and have a good time.Halloween Resurrection is a perfectly acceptable sequel. The first ten minutes alone are a knockout.",

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection is undeniably the Halloween franchise at its worst. While its predecessor, H20, was far from matching the 1978 original's excellence, the conclusion it delivered was beyond cathartic. Myers was dead, and Laurie killed him. Unfortunately, this film decided to \"resurrect\" Michael through a ridiculous alteration of H20's end. Doubling down, Myers kills Laurie within the opening sequence a la Scream. This choice is clearly disrespectful to the franchise, its fans, and truly just moviegoers as a whole. Beyond this egregious mistake, the storyline is fittingly abysmal. What makes the premise so uninteresting is its characters, who hold no weight to the franchise whatsoever. Following random college-aged adults locked inside the Myers house for a live camera show offers absolutely nothing to the audience, especially when nothing interesting is learned about the slasher within. This film only delivers Michael killing undeveloped characters who are one note, often annoying, and simply unlikable. Of course, the cast's bad acting is not aided by the unconvincing dialogue they worked with. Michael's kills are therefore created without real tension in a film helmed by lacking production and fit together by subpar editing. It is ultimately evident that the film lacks anything worthwhile. Never watch this.",

The interpretation of Jamie Lee Curtis who played for one more time as Laurie Strode was simple but good.

Anyway, I only managed to catch up with 3 of the sequels a couple of years back - but did get the opportunity to watch the above-average 1998 outing, HALLOWEEN: H20, during its original run; I'm not able to get a hold of nos. 5 and 6, so I had to make do with \"Halloween 8\" - directed by the man who brought us the atrocious first sequel! After a pre-credits sequence depicting the final confrontation between Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her homicidal sibling, the film takes up a premise that showed promise (sort of bringing the saga up-to-date with a \"Blair Witch Project\" perspective) - a Reality TV show set inside the ill-fated Myers house. While the heroine is adequate (though still made to share an icky relationship over the Internet with a whiz-kid teenager), the rest of the participants are the usual mixture of the bland and the obnoxious (particularly her publicity-seeking best friend); the cast also includes the two black producers of the show - with foul-mouthed (and top-billed) Busta Rhymes eventually engaging in an idiotic karate fight with \"The Shape\"!! Besides, the unattractive color (simulating the look of Digital Video) doesn't help...though John Carpenter's simple, effortlessly eerie \"Halloween\" theme still manages to generate the required response whenever it comes on! The DVD includes a few worthless deleted scenes and even 3 alternate endings (a sure sign, if any was needed, of the film's general dissatisfaction).",

Tyra Banks character Nora is a copycat Courtney Cox's Gale Weathers and gets little screen time. Like H20 the rest of the cast are just characters cut out from countless other films and meat for Michael to dispose of. The strong dark opening with Jamie Lee Curtis' cameo is probably the most interesting and satisfying part of the film.While trying to appeal to the teen film goers, it becomes the trend instead of setting it, this dilutes the scare horror factor that made Halloween successful.As a plain slasher it's an adequate ride, but lacks any of the previous Halloween magic including horror and fear.",

I really like the Halloween series, but this one should have never been made the way it was made.  The acting is absolutely horrible, the filming is atrocious, and the entertainment value is non-existent.Jamie Lee Curtis is featured in the very beginning, but is only in the film for a very short time(lucky for her), and after this the title comes up. Then it is nothing but downhill all the way to rock bottom.A group of \"young\" people (it must be tough being a 35 year old teen-ager) is stuck in the old Myers' house doing something.  One can never be sure just what they are supposed to be doing except perhaps showing how they cannot act.  ALL of these characters are very unlikable, two-dimensional parodies of human beings.  One never gets involved with any of them because there is no character development what so ever and no plot to boot!  The most obnoxious of the characters is the black guy with the long hair extensions, whose favorite word is, \"motherfu@#a,\" and he mouths it through huge lips (that seemed to have been over-inflated with collagen injections) through the whole mish-mash.This movie is NOT scary at all, has no tension, no excitement, and ALL the special effects are ruined by the constant (very irritating) injections of the \"view\" through the characters mini-cams they have attached to their heads (or whatever).What were the makers of this film thinking when they made this piece of crap?  I would like to know that, because it seems like they must have been on \"crack,\" or maybe sitting on their cracks when they put this drivel together.  Man, it just plain sucks!  It is no wonder that this films release was delayed so long, went through so many name changes (this always happens when the makers know they have a loser), and finally emerged only to be stillborn at the box-office.Maybe if they make another one of these movies for the \"Halloween\" series, the makers will pick some plain, regular people off the street to star in it, because there is no doubt ANYONE chosen off the street would be better at acting than the..uh.\"actors\" who appear in this bomb.

First they kill off Laurie Strode (Jamie Lees character) which takes away 50% of the interest in this movie. The beginning setting of the movie doesn't make sense at all. Also in the beginning sequence when Laurie could kill Michael she does something that doesn't make sense at all which results in her death in the hands of Michael. Then there is the character of Busta Rhymes. First of all he can't act and his character is lame. Then he goes to kick Michaels ass twice and win which is apparently something that Laurie couldn't do. There are other lame things in this movie like all the kills that Michael does. This is clearly just an attempt to make money with the Halloween series name. Jamie Lee wanted to get out of the series by getting her character killed.

Another thing about this one is that there are more deaths which should keep hardcore fans happy and plenty of totty to look at. Keeping with that pattern, \"Halloween 8\" also mostly discards (except for Laurie's involvement) all of the previous Mike Myers carnivals. But the worst sin which H8 commits is discarding H20's main raison d'etre (Michael back to stalk his nephew) to give our beloved mass murderer the task as just another psycho killing for no reason. A dumb thing about this movie is that there is no mention of Laurie's son John (played by Josh Hartnett in H20)! Where are the new answers promised? The links to the previous entries? Probably in Akkad's bank account.Screenplay-wise, this has to be the thinnest of all the Halloween films. The lead characters are so beyond underdeveloped it's a screen writing crime. And what about our heroine Sara (Kajlich)? You know the LEAD girl? She's also abandoned for a long period of time and I can't say that I found out anything about who she was throughout the film. And then we have the lousy dialogue, I laughed my ass off more than once. *MINOR SPOILERS* Wait till you see that chick hit Mike with a chainsaw that was funny as hell.Structure-wise, the flick is very simple...maybe too simple. We only get one subplot that has to do with Sara and some Don Juan kid (Merriman) flirting with her via email (God, I missed Sam Loomis there), but even that angle isn't explored to its fullest. Sure it wound up being a kool plot device during some of the tenser stalk sequences but in the end, it didn't amount to anything on a character level The murders here are way slick (loved the crushed head bit\u0085very nice) and mostly came through. Thank you for that. I also enjoyed the \"Blair Witch\" type vibe the film put out with the web cams. Rosenthal splits the screen 4 ways at times and the constant POV shots from the main players gave this sequel a more involving aura that often made up for the non-existent screenplay. Last but not least, I loved the small nods to \"Halloween\" and \"Halloween 2\" and really got into the Myers vs Rudy (Thomas) knife battle in the kitchen. Fun stuff.The acting Bianca Kajlich screams very well but she's no Jamie Lee Curtis didn't find her interesting enough, Busta Rhymes was awesome he was the best one in the whole film with his wacky dialogue and awesome kung fu moves he ruled this movie, Sean Patrick Thomas annoyed the hell of out me I'm glad he got killed off, and well not exactly going up in the acting world after making his name in Save The Last Dance, he just ends up in a slasher movie as a pointless annoying victim wrong career move, where is he now, Tyra Banks (Nora) shakes that ass and grabs that cash. Ryan Merriman (Myles) does what he has to do well. Billy Kay's character Scott really rubbed me the wrong way. Daisy McCrackin is stunning but doesn't do much, Luke Kirby was funny and annoying at the same time but had fun with his role, Katee Sackhoff the Brittany Murphy lookalike played the blonde bimbo well was she pretending to be annoying and stupid or is she a bad actress who knows but she has a great death scene, Thomas Ian Nicolas had a seemingly pointless role much like he did in the last American Pie movie, and lastly Jamie Lee Curtis although she wasn't in it much she was still the best thing about this movie and Brad Loree played Michael Myers well definitely one of the better ones throughout the series.All in all Halloween 8 does cut it as a sequel better than parts 3,5 and 6, despite the fact that Laurie is gone and there's no story left to tell. this is just a fast paced slasher movie with pleasing results and some wicked death scenes, although this one may not be as good as Halloween H20 it still rocks.",

Only the first film can objectively be considered great, although I've extracted enjoyment from all the sequels up till now. In truth, most of the sequels are pretty bad, but all, I think, have interesting aspects to them and offer at least a degree of entertainment value. \"Halloween II\" is a cold, dark and bloody slasher pic, much more violent than the original. \"Halloween III\" is a bold attempt to take the series in a new direction. \"Halloween 5\" has a terrific visual style. \"The Curse of Michael Myers\" is (as released in its theatrical version) a butchered near-masterpiece. \"H20\" brings \"quality\" back to the franchise. And so on and so forth. With the \"Halloween\"s, I take 'em all for what they are, and like 'em all. Except for \"Resurrection\", since all it is is an unmitigated disaster. It's a movie so awesomely inept as to make, I don't know, \"The Return of Michael Myers\" look like \"The Exorcist\". **SPOILERS** The explanation for how a \"beheaded\" Michael survived \"H20\" is laughable. There's a nauseating couple of scenes at the beginning in which the myth of Michael Myers is tied in to the stories of real life serial killers (which must make fun viewing for their victims' relatives and friends, hey?). Busta Rhymes makes just about the worst lead imaginable for a \"Halloween\" movie. Michael isn't remotely frightening. The film boasts not a single shock, and not a single moment of suspense (this is a picture in which the heroine is alerted to Michael's presence behind her by an e-mail message on her palm pilot, sent by a dorky kid at a Halloween party who's dressed as Vincent Vega from \"Pulp Fiction\", *yawn*, how \"clever\", how very, very far we've come from Haddonfield, 1978, and how very, very not worth it it all is). Michael getting his butt kicked (even if only temporarily) by a young martial arts enthusiast, and being on the receiving end of supposedly \"audience-pleasing\" quips like \"Happy Halloween, m**********r!\" just trashes everything the \"Halloween\" movies ever stood for, which admittedly wasn't very much - but at least parts 1 - 7 tried to scare ya. \"Resurrection\" at times almost seems like merely the pilot for a franchise starring Busta Rhymes as a businessman cum rapper cum kung fu guru who walks the earth to fight evil. Great. I hope at least that \"Resurrection\" will inspire people to check out Carpenter's original. I also have a happy image of Carpenter receiving royalty cheques for \"Resurrection\" and watching a cable screening of the film with some buddies, all of them wetting themselves with contemptuous laughter at this absolutely pathetic, bottom-of-the-barrel dreck.",

It is not the best film in the franchise, but it is probably my favourite because of its nostalgia and humour. The film will hopefully receive more positive reviews in future.",

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection (2002, Dir. Rick Rosenthal) Serial Killer Michael Myers is not finished with Laurie Strode, and their rivalry finally comes to an end. But is this the last we see of Myers? Freddie Harris and Nora Winston are reality programmers at DangerTainment, and are planning to send a group of 6 thrill-seeking teenagers into the childhood home of Myers. Cameras are placed all over the house and no one can get out of the house... and then Michael arrives home!When i first heard about this, i thought the concept was brilliant. Each character given a video game and sent into Michael Myers. Unfortunately, the idea didn't turn out too well. The film started off fantastic with the Halloween theme leading into the death of Laurie Strode, and then after that, the film just died. I actually found the acting in this film quite bad. The stars just could not fit in with the story and it's concept. Busta Rhymes character for me was the worst individual in this film. His acting came across very poor and seemed to best fit in a cheap, rip-off, straight to DVD movie. Once they entered the house, they should have really kept the film to the hand held cameras. The film would have been a lot more scary and more interesting if it didn't switch to an actual camera for the death scenes. If your a Halloween fan, you might as well watch this, to complete this series. If you don't fancy watching it, at least watch the first quarter, as this is how the series should have really ended.\"Kick his a$$! Kick his a$$! Kick his a$$!\" \"Who's better than Wat Chun Lee?\" \"Whoopin' everybody a$$ while he's smokin' a cigarette.\" \"Oh, $hit. Who's knockin' on my door this late?\" \"Whoever this is is distracting me from seeing Wat Chun Lee whoop some a$$.\" - Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes)",

In fact the opening scene even shows flashbacks to H20 and explains the story of how Jamie Lee Curtis chopped MM's head off at the end and hem managed to survive. The explanation is frankly ridiculous and completely gratuitous. Who cares how he survived? Throughout several (8 now!) Halloween movies, MM has been ripped/slashed/stabbed/thrown off buildings/lit on fire/ploughed into by vehicles/etc. etc. Wouldn't it have been more honest just to have his head sewn back on??!!Anyhow, we see Jamie Lee Curtis in the opening scene, which is slightly disturbing - but marred by being overtly melodramatic. She kisses him on the lips and whispers \"See you in hell\" before falling off a roof...And again, no explanation on why now - why this Halloween? Why MM waits until Hollywood decides to \"RESURRECT\" him for a particular Halloween... 1998, 2002, etc.It does attempt to explain that he's been hiding under his house all this time, but then it never follows through with this story, just one of many loose-ends in the movie.It also attempts to blame his psychotic tendancies on a childhood of abuse... although it is hinted that this may just have been set up my the webcast producers. Again, this isn't clarified. Was he abused as a child? Or were the producers of the webcast (entitled Dangertainment ... reminding me of a cartoon) attempting to add some spice to the story? Who knows, who even cares.The whole webcast thing has been done before, as I mentioned above, and even though all the different camera views and angles are directed expertly by Rosenthal, it's very much Been There Done That.The bodycount is much higher than H20, but the characters are so underdeveloped, that the death scenes create little impact.There are some good and even suspenseful (very few and far between... like a few amusing laughs/smiles in a really bad sitcom) moments, most notably towards the end when the main female character (the virginal one who survives) is running through the house, while gripping a hand-held messenger buddy; her online friend keeps buzzing her - rather than running to the house to save her? what's happened to the white knight and damsel in distress? now the white knight just watches the poor damsel online and emails her! - with instant messages telling her where MM is.At the end, MM is burned and electrocuted again (like this has happened before??... most notably at the end of H2 where MM burns slowly while \"Mr Sandman\" plays...), and the whole thing has a decidedly 80's feel to it. And when the final girl wields the chainsaw at MM and screams \"This is for ... (so and so he's killed in the movie)\", it's one of the best bad moments of over-the-top melodramatic and extremely awful acting ever displayed on celluoid.Even the very sequel-tempting (Halloween 9 anyone?) end is very lacklustre, lacking any real punch.This movie went through numerous title changes from HALLOWEEN 8 to HALLOWEEN THE HOMECOMING to HALLOWEEN H2K to HALLOWEEN EVIL NEVER DIES, and so on and so forth. These undecisive plodding changes are also clear in the script and direction.The eight Halloween movies probably cost less than 40 million in total to make and have taken God-knows how much (at least 10 times that figure) at the box office.And in fact, I'm a slasher fan and was quite looking forward to this movie. I was left virtually unimpressed... maybe it should be retitled (again!) to HALLOWEEN WHATEVER.",

I'm not a fan at all of the beginning scenes with Laurie Strode and its quite said that it ended this way with a hack installment. The movie went in the direction of a hood MTV real-world type feel which I guess was aimed to attract young audiences instead of true horror fans. The film takes place in Michael's old house which oddly changes a lot in each movie. The majority of the cast stunk, especially Busta Rhymes, it was only Bianca Kajlich who was likable.

One of the film's greatest strength here is the use of its central gimmick here of using the reality show addition to the series in an incredibly fun way. Not only is this one highly probably to occur here given the guidelines of what's known in the series thus far, and the set-up here is much more genuine and authentic here due to that. The early set-ups here showing their preparations of the house which gets fun with the hidden kills having to a lot to do with that, though the real fun here come from the integration this does in the final half using it as the primary factor in helping them escape. By utilizing the footage from the shows and the different headsets on the group as that frame-point and then tuning to the technology they share is s a means of guiding them out is a supremely imaginable scenario filled with suspense as the fellow partiers watching the broadcast continually shout out information to help him along brings this nicely full-circle with the stalking in the house providing plenty of insanely suspenseful scenes throughout the house and down through the garage which makes for some great times here. Outside of the finale, there's some great stalking throughout here as the early walk-through of the house up into the second floor or down into the basement which is a lot of fun as the big encounter here with the falling wall of fake bodies before the fine chase through the area settling on a fine kill. The upstairs scenes are almost as fun, with the great jump through the dresser to launch an attack, the absolutely crazy scene where they come face-to-face with the doppelganger and are unsure of who's the real one or if the game is still on-going, the great battle in the kitchen that has plenty of fine action as well as the outstanding ending brawl in the garage that gives this one some fun. Along with a stellar opening chase and some really fine, creepy work with Michael here, this has enough here to hold off the long flaw here. The only thing here is the fate of the show's organizer, who's one of the most annoying characters here who survives the whole affair based solely on who's playing him rather than anything to do with what happens to him in the film proper and even manages to survive in one of the most hokey methods imaginable to provide the final killing blow instead of the final girl which really should've happened here, doing so with some absolutely lame methods as well. This is really the only thing holding it back.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, an interrupted sex scene, and brief drug use.",

            "content": "After the pointless mess that was Halloween H20, I was obviously not all that excited to witness the Resurrection. However, once I've invested my time in 7 films in a franchise, it's pretty much a given that I'm going to see the 8th, if only to hold on to the vain hope that maybe someday I will get a Halloween sequel that comes anywhere close to matching the original.Resurrection isn't necessarily a good movie, but by utilizing a fresh concept and doing some interesting things with it, the film at least manages to be entertaining. At this point in the franchise, offering a Michael Myers tale that doesn't make you want to turn off the movie midway through is a genuine accomplishment.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about this 8th Halloween installment is how much it catches the viewer off guard. After all, with both Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in the cast, we're almost assured that this will be the penultimate awful Halloween sequel. But, when the end result is a modestly entertaining 90 minutes, we have to concede that Resurrection manages something that some of the other entries in the franchise haven't done.Don't get me wrong; there's still stupidity galore here.The opening scene with the return of Laurie Strode has nothing to do with the film that follows, and we get the sense that Jamie Lee Curtis only agreed to appear in Resurrection so that she could be killed off, thus sparing herself the indignity of ever having to appear in a Halloween movie again. While we should probably feel some sort of dramatic impact after seeing her finally fall prey to the bogeyman who has pursued her through three films before this one, the entire sequence is so devoid of suspense or purpose that any sense of climax is negated, and it's hard to feel much sympathy for our former protagonist when she essentially walks into the knife herself.Busta Rhymes is one of the main characters here, which is asinine enough in itself, but this idiocy is compounded by the series of lame one-liners he has throughout the film. In a franchise that has set new standards of dumb, there's no debating that the single worst line to ever grace a Halloween film is delivered from Busta's lips here: \"trick or treat, motherf****r\". Did I mention he also does karate in this movie? Unfortunately, I'm totally serious.Battlestar Galactica fans may be excited at the prospect of an early appearance by Katee Sackhoff. But don't be; she's the single most irritating and unlikable character in a cast full of them, and the dialogue our beloved Starbuck is forced to deliver is a frakking embarrassment.Then there's the slight problem of Michael Myers being decapitated at the conclusion of Halloween H2O, which could be viewed as a considerable hindrance to his being able to slash his way through his roster of victims here. Though the explanation used to solve this problem is iffy at best, it's worth noting that if you watch the finale of H2O, there isn't a single element that betrays the unlikely scenario described here. At least they thought it through a bit, we have to give them that.Elsewhere in the film, there is other evidence of a brain being involved somewhere in the creative process. The concept itself is strong and timely, and the execution is well realized. The alternation between different cameras to give us first-person views from our doomed characters that augment the standard film format sets up some nice images, particularly since we're dealing with dark and grainy video that heightens the tension on its own. Michael Myers hasn't looked scarier in years than he does lurking in the shadows of his dilapidated house, as seen through the POV cameras of his future victims.We alternate between the happenings inside the house and the view of the voyeuristic internet users watching the events from the safety of the outside world, and the reactions of the viewers are particularly smart. As Michael slices his way though the cast, the online audience is engrossed in the story, but unwilling to believe that what they are seeing is real. This is a fine commentary on how our media culture has learned to distrust how genuine the elements of reality TV are, and how we've adapted to accepting the most loathsome activities of the stars of these shows as part of the entertainment. Whether or not the film-makers realized they were making this observation, it remains a keen piece of media criticism.Though the door is clearly left open for yet another Halloween sequel, the franchise has splintered now, and Rob Zombie's reboot pushed the series in another direction. It's sort of too bad, since there is enough promise in Halloween: Resurrection to suggest that capable hands could have gotten the saga of Michael Myers back on track. Whatever film-maker ultimately decides to pick up the thread of this story where it left off, they would be wise to note the things that Resurrection does right, since it assuredly outshines the two film that preceded it. Not a difficult thing to do, granted, but a distinction nonetheless.",

It takes place three years after Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) supposedly chopped off Michael's head in 'Halloween H20'. Well we find out in this one that she got the wrong guy, and has since been locked away in a psychiatric facility. Michael kills her early on (WHICH I HATE!..) and we make our way to Haddonfield to meet our main cast of characters. Our main group of six is a bunch of young people participating in a reality show run by Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks...yeah. Anyways, the show consists of the group having to spend Halloween night in the scariest house in the USA - The infamous Myers house! Michael of course does not like this, and dispatches most of them in gruesome ways leading to a fiery conclusion.This one definitely the weakest of the original series, right next to 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'. At least part 5 had some real connection the Myers story! After Laurie is killed, we get a bunch of newbie characters that we never really even care about. The acting is OKAY, but the characters' are written as the most irritating people in existence. I never really cared for most of their safety, except maybe Sean Patrick Thomas' character Rudy. The main girl Sara is nice enough, but she is written and acted as a complete bore. The twist of having the reality show was good though, and I give them marks for thinking outside the box. Their time in the Myers house is also broadcast on the web thanks to Cameras set up all over the place, which adds an interesting twist when a person watching the show has to help guide the reality stars to safety. The scares just aren't there though, and that's what I watch a 'Halloween' film to get. I want to be startled. Michael isn't intimidating or creepy or even scary in this one. Completests of the series and of horror films (like myself) will have to see this at least once, but it's the weakest of them all for sure. The gore is fine, and the Myers house is done up well, but it's a disappointment.5/10",

Sadly though, they never attempt anything other than stabbings.John Carpenter's original low-budget horror flick, about a babysitter stalked by the bogey man, was a big hit that brought him much acclaim. A sequel was inevitable. Carpenter even worked on it. But after that, he bowed out and his producer Moustapha Akkad took over. He's not a filmmaker, he's a businessman. And for 24 years, he has served us the same sandwich, over and over.Rick Rosenthal, who directed Halloween II, is back behind the camera. One would assume that his familiarity with the franchise is a good thing. Too bad he's obsessed with cheesy lighting, obnoxiously loud sound effects and confusing editing.This film was supposed to be released in the autumn of 2001, but apparently there were major differences of opinion when the director of H20, Steve Miner, started fiddling with the finished print. The original title, Halloween: The Homecoming, was dropped because Dimension Films wanted a title that made it clear that Michael Myers was still alive. So they nicked half the title off an Alien movie and stuck it on.There is only one way to tell a story of teenagers being murdered by a psycho in a William Shatner mask/hockey mask/pillow case. And you've seen it a zillion times. The only minuscule difference this one offers is that the whole thing in broadcast on the Internet, which provides room for some gimmicky, if annoying, set pieces and a few clever tricks. But don't expect jaw-dropping twists, or intensity.An ambitious reality show producer (Busta Rhymes) sets up the Myers house with booby-traps and red herrings to juice his sleepover Internet show. A handful of teens, with stereotypical personalities, fall for it and deliver the goods. Until Mikey comes back, that is.What's that you say? Surely, Mikey can't be alive after Jamie Lee lopped his head off in H20? Well, the movie says that Michael stuck his mask onto someone else before being chucked into the back of the corpse-mobile. Umm...so where's the actual \"resurrection\"? What follows is a shlocky assortment of teenage slayings - Freddy, Mikey and Jason must surely have laid waste to most of teen America by now - and massacres. What motivates Mikey? Never revealed, man.Carpenter used this to good effect first time round. Parts 4, 5 and 6 - they dropped the roman numerals after III - added truckloads of story to the Michael Myers myth, which, although nothing but hokum, was at least interesting.H20 completely disregarded those movies and went back to killing for no reason. And now once again, it's just pointless bloodshed. Mikey isn't scary. Jason would flatten him in a second. You know that he's always going to get up after being hung, shot, stabbed, poisoned, fired out of a cannon or run over with a steam roller. There is zero suspense.Watching a rubber dog-doo machine make rubber dog-doo is not interesting. And watching a killing machine kill got boring well over a decade ago. It's time to try something new.Halloween: Resurrection tries a little harder, perhaps. And for this reason, it's one of the better sequels. But it's still a big jive turkey in need of a valuable lesson.Horror films should offend and disgust, not regurgitate the failures of previous sequels.",

My how its changed) that sign up and are chosen for a reality internet show.  Of course, Michael is there, and decides to turn their Dangervision outing into a truly life changing experience.Acting was so low caliber Im just going to ignore it and say once again that they really should have left the initial 10 minutes, rolled the credits and called it a series.  Worst performances by any group I've ever seen, and there is not a one of them that should be allowed to continue acting.  The world needs burger flippers too, and each of them would do admirably at that task.Clearly Moustapha Akkad and Dimension Films wanted to rush another sequel out, so they halfway threw together a story, that didnt even flow continually with the rest of the films, left plot holes you could drive a Nimitz class aircraft carrier through, hired a director that failed in his last effort at the series and called it a day.  This movie is so bad it makes \"Jason X\" look like a horror classic.Inevitably, and sadly, there will no doubt be another \"Halloween\" film, given the ending of this one.

Halloween: Resurrection sees Michael Myers back again in his very own home to do a bit of the old slicing and dicing with his kitchen knife just one more time. This time with 6 college students, who are spending the night in the house where it all began, broadcasting a live interactive show over the Internet. The good points of the film sees the franchise moving ahead with a semi-reality style which in someway is portrayed through the whole `Big Brother' thing with the whole camera's in every corner. Its certainly spices things up a bit, and just like every Halloween movie, there's plenty of Mike. But what I couldn't help notice was how much the film tried to give something new to a franchise that was simply satisfying the way it was before. Why change it?? The cast was filled with a bunch of nobody's that made there acting debuts in low down cheesy teenage movies. What is the franchise coming too!!! Halloween: H20 delivered a loyal more than satisfying ending to the films by visiting the old cast and not getting sloppy where a few of the other films had in the past. It ended perfectly with intensity and mind, and this film is sadly a low attempt to revive a series that was triumphantly put to rest years ago. My say is this, if the Halloween movies provided you with years of classic horror entertainment and you feel as a loyal fan of the series that you absolutely `MUST SEE MIKE MYERS' just one more time, then get down to your local video rental store. But sadly I have to inform you that after you watch this one, your going to be telling others like you that the once great slasher flicks of the Halloween series, has sadly gone down the toilet and been flushed for the crap this film is.

            "content": "SPOILERS TO FOLLOW! BUT WHO CARES??Those lousy, money grubbing bastards... they just couldn't leave a good thing alone! The previous film, HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER, was such an ideal way to end this series, but no --money talked, and so they stretched the rubberband so far here that it snapped. HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION is surely one of the dumbest, unnecessary, most hackneyed attempts to continue a franchise past its expiration date, EVER. The most offensive things occur right at the beginning. At the end of H20 we finally saw Michael Myers killed once and for all when Jamie Lee Curtis chopped off his head with an axe, right? Wrong. Because now an absurd plot device was created where we learn via flashback that prior to the decapitation, Michael supposedly got hold of a paramedic, crushed his larynx so he couldn't speak, and dressed him up in his own clothes and mask; thus, it was actually the paramedic and not Myers who lost his head (!). There is a certain creativity to such an idea, but it's also a cheap way with which to completely obliterate the last movie and try to keep the cash cow milked.The next part really puzzles me. The real Michael Myers arrives at a sanitarium where sister Jamie Lee now resides and he kills her within the first fifteen minutes. That's right - KILLS HER. So all Laurie Strode's efforts from those other Halloween films come to an abrupt and uncaring end in one flash. Aside from the plot point, the main thing that really bothers me about this to this day is why did Jamie Lee Curtis agree to do it? She had gone on record four years prior saying that it was her idea to return for the last chapter (H20) and have the Laurie character get her revenge. I have read that Curtis might have been contractually obligated to return for this cameo, but still it boggles my mind that she would have allowed her self-respected character to get offed, after she had been the one who wanted to bring some dignity back to Laurie Strode. If I ever meet her I'm definitely going to question her about this. Could the money have been THAT good??From here, Michael Myers has no family members left to kill. So a scenario is set up where an internet website is hosting a \"Reality Show\" for Halloween Night, staged in the very same old \"abandoned\" house that Myers grew up in as a child. They've got web cams and a live feed installed so that millions of viewers at home may get a thrill as rapper Busta Rhymes impersonates Michael to make it look good. At first it's just a gag, except when the real Myers heads back home again. You haven't lived until you've seen Busta kung-fu the masked Michael.I can't even write about this. It deserves zero stars for having the audacity to continue in such a stupid manner, but it does have some okay horror moments that earn it a star and a half. As far as I am concerned, HALLOWEEN: H20 was the true final film and this thing doesn't even exist. *1/2 out of ****",

            "content": "Released in 2002, Ressurection continues the story of H20 (1998) in which we all thought it was the end of the franchise. And to be honest, if I had stopped at it, it would have been the perfect end! However, Miramax Films' greed led to an eighth film in the franchise (Seventh by Michael Myers) to be made. As a matter of fact, they wanted to make a side film (as a third, you know?). With a new story, new killer, etc. But the producer Moustapha Akkad didn't want to, because he was afraid of another failure, just as Halloween III had failed, precisely because it was a film that had nothing to do with the story of Myers. The movie's original title would be Halloween: The Homecoming (something like Return Home) and they even considered returning Danielle Harris, Jamie Lloyd of H4 and H5, for a role in the film. However, the producers wanted to ignore the story of these two, just as H20 did, and they also wanted a title that indicated that Michael was alive, to draw attention. That's how the movie turned into Resurrection.The story of Halloween: Resurrection begins with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) committed to a sanatorium. She is the sister of psychopath Michael Myers (Brad Loree) and was tormented after a series of confrontations with the killer and feeling guilty for a fatal mistake. Once thinking that she had finally managed to kill her murderous brother (as suggested by the previous film in the franchise), she found that she was wrong and another innocent person ended up falling victim to her vengeful rage. Laurie is now just waiting for a new and inevitable confrontation with the serial killer, an event that is confirmed in a definitive deadly encounter between them in an interesting sequence set on the roof of the psychiatric hospital.At the same time, in the psychopath's quiet, small hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, a group of six young people is selected to participate in a program broadcast live over the internet with the suggestive name of Dangertainment (translated as The House of Panic). Its creator is an opportunistic businessman, Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), who, aided by assistant Nora Winston (Tyra Banks), expects high profitability with a reality show that consists of a group of young people spending a night at the house where the famous murderer Michael Myers he lived his childhood, coinciding with the arrival of the traditional Halloween (the famous Halloween). The archetypal group is formed by a discreet psychologist named Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), by ambitious Jenna Danzig (Katee Sackhoff), who exclusively wants fame, by culinary student Rudy Grimes (Sean Patrick Thomas), author of several silly jokes, by disinterested law student Bill Woodlake (Thomas Ian Nicholas), rebellious musician Jim Morgan (Luke Kirby), and beautiful Donna Chang (Daisy McCrackin), who struggles to say clever phrases. With cameras on for an internet broadcast, the group gets to know in detail the former home of the dangerous assassin, and as evil inevitably never dies and finds its way home, Michael Myers is back and ready to clean it up, reemerging from limbo to continue its legacy of blood and horror, increasing the region's death toll, and most importantly to keep the extensive franchise in business.Although the track record is not very positive, it is clear that there is a kind of convention where any new film in the Friday the 13th or Halloween series, or other similar productions, has always received a barrage of unfavorable reviews that is already turning into a clich\u00e9 repetitive. There are a multitude of types of horror movies, with different proposals and different themes, and all of them always have their good and bad elements. Halloween: Resurrection also has its highs and lows. The film begins by trying to correctly explain the chronology of events for those who do not know more about the fictional universe of the franchise, or for those who do not remember clearly the previous events. And it was clarified that only the original 1978 classic with its immediate 1981 sequel, plus Part 7 (Halloween H20 - Twenty Years Later, 1998), were considered in the story, excluding the other films in the series.For starters, it is important to be clear that this new film is the true antithesis of its predecessor: there is nothing innovative, the deaths are not very inventive and every actor who appears on stage seems to be there only to die in the following minutes, without the slightest creativity. There is no effort in search of any kind of verisimilitude. The task of identifying - and rooting for - any character is virtually impossible, as there is no way to believe anything you see. So, how to be scared by what happens on the screen? And a horror film that doesn't provoke fear is certain death - in the worst sense of the expression.Jamie Lee, who makes a small appearance at the beginning, must have at least been well paid - but not enough to make her come back in an eventual sequel, as the script tries to eliminate her for good. The rest of the familiar faces, like rapper Busta Rhymes and top model Tyra Banks, do exactly what you'd expect of them - that is, they play themselves - and take it all as a joke. The girl, Sara (Bianca Kajlich, who has never done anything worthy of note again after this work), knows only how to scream (with the help of the sound effects technician) and run, without showing any other minimally promising quality.The film is short, not wasting time with unnecessary situations and quickly the viewer is invited to witness the real horror of a group of young people who are spending a night in Michael Myers' old house, being attacked by the same, who lived in the basement during the recent years and resurfaces to drive the invaders out of their refuge. For those who appreciate violence and blood, there are good scenes of deaths with young people feeling the killer's extraordinary strength and the power of his sharp blade tearing through their bodies. And there is the interesting setting of an abandoned house of damned fame, with its various rooms corroded by the devastating action of time.In the story, participants in a television program are taken to spend the night in the house where a famous serial killer lived. What they don't know is that he's back and willing not to let anyone leave the place alive. You've already felt the clich\u00e9 in the synopsis, haven't you? But that's not the only problem. Besides the absurd decision to make Jamie die at the beginning of the film. The leading role is given to a bunch of insufferable characters, played by the worst possible actors. The reality show model that, in theory, should bring apprehension considering the vision of deaths in real time does not work. On the contrary, it makes you laugh. The decision to shoot handheld was also laughable. The poor quality of the image only frustrates the viewer and never causes tension as those involved must have thought. Of course, if in a horror/suspension movie there is an inability to cause tension, apprehension and fear in the viewer, it won't work.Furthermore, Troy Hansen's production design creates some obscure and cavernous spaces for characters to circulate, ideal cubicles for Michael Myers to throw the party. These scenographic choices demonstrate spatial control of those involved, but the obviousness of the dialogues and the randomness of the murders make the narrative very predictable and tiresome. Jumpscares are also used and abused, irritating in the too much sound organization of composer Danny Lux's film. Even in moments when nothing happens (much of the film) the soundtrack remains loud, trying to cause a kind of \"suspense\" or pass some level of threat.It is also noticed that there are undesirable easy scares, idiotic jokes, huge holes in the script, unlikely situations (the police take action only after the massacre, for example), and the unnecessary scenes of sex and drugs, which, although discreet, it is noted that they were inserted as if it were a must in every teen horror film. As well as the obvious, predictable, and mostly unsatisfactory outcome. The character played by rapper Busta Rhymes is ridiculous and almost unbearable, being a greedy creator of the macabre reality show and responsible for a series of banal phrases of attempts at humor, forcing us to root for Michael Myers to verify the quality of the sharpening of his knife in the flesh of the unfortunate.Directed by David Geddes, Halloween: Resurrection is deliberately dark in some passages and flirts a lot with the metalinguistic processes of the reality show. There are jokes about fame, nudity, some dialogue that tries to expand the film's reflexive possibilities, but the uneven direction and the script without dramatic rigidity demonstrate that the project for Michael Myers in the cyberculture era was doomed to failure. Halloween: Resurrection is tedious from beginnng to the end and ends this second timeline with a sour taste in your mouth. Laurie didn't deserve her fate, even though Curtis didn't want to be in the spotlight this time.",

            "review_title": "weak",
            "content": "*mild spoilers*They're really beating a dead horse with this series.  I'm a huge Halloween fan, and I don't remember ever expecting so much from a movie and getting so little.  I liked H20 a lot, and I thought it provided a very satisfying and logical conclusion to the series.  So when we're told right away that it wasn't really Michael who was beheaded at the end of H20 (it was, uh, a paramedic with the exact same size and build as Michael who swapped clothes with him, and apparently couldn't tell anyone because his voice box was crushed), I was left hoping against hope that the movie itself wasn't going to be as convoluted and stupid as its setup.Of course, it was.  The characters are all strictly cookie-cutter, with the majority of lines being completely gratuitous sound bytes (more on this later).  There are several stupid and obvious references to the first movie (e.g. bedroom closet door being smashed from the outside as girl cowers inside, MM pinning guy to kitchen wall with knives, MM sitting up creepily in the background as the camera focuses on the foreground), which only shows a lack of creativeness on the part of the filmmakers.  Perhaps worst of all, virtually all of the killings are unimaginative, garden-variety stabbings/impalings that we've seen hundreds of times in hundreds of better movies.  The other weak Halloween sequels could at least innovatively satisfy a general desire for gore.  Next, although I don't know a great deal about filmmaking, I could see some poor editing going on here.  At one point we're shown Michael lurking in the shadows, and the tip of his knife is stained with blood.  This is before Michael has used the knife on anybody (the knife he uses in the beginning of the movie is clearly disposed of). Really not good.  Finally, I don't know what other people thought of this, but I thought the concept of the movie was pretty condescending.  I can completely imagine someone saying \"Hey, since everyone's using the internet now, we'll tack this 'webcam' twist onto this classic horror series, and everyone will think it's really modern and edgy and want to see it!\"  This is augmented by a lot of really stupid and unnecessary technological references and gimmicks (communicating on the palmpilot, etc.).  I could be overreacting here, but the whole attempt to \"adapt the Halloween series to fit the 21st century\" strikes me as really ill-conceived.\nLast thing: I don't understand the impetus to keep casting rappers in action/horror movies.  Save one funny scene where he dresses up as MM and rants, watching Busta Rhymes was painful.  The talent he showed in Finding Forrester was drowned completely in an atrocious script.  Choice lines of his include: As Michael apparently gets his in the end, Busta shouts \"Happy Halloween, Mikey!\" (or maybe it was \"Happy Halloween, MOTHA****A!\"... I can't remember exactly) in the most dramatic voice possible. Then, in an apparent attempt by the writers to lend \"street cred\" to the movie, Busta exclaims \"Damn!  That looks like some fried chicken-ass shit!\" or something like that upon seeing MM's body.  I'm reminded of LL Cool J in Deep Blue Sea or to a lesser extent Dr. Dre in Training Day.  These guys aren't bad actors, they're just getting stuck with terrible lines that the writers think are \"cool.\"Anyway, please skip this movie whether you're a series fan or not, as it degrades all of the good Halloween movies that have been made.  It's very disheartening that instead of ending the series on a high note and preserving its reputation among horror movies, it was decided to milk the formula for more money.  We can only hope there's no Halloween 9, although this movie appropriately ends on the biggest unkillable-monster horror movie cliche of all time, leaving us dreading what they're going to come up with next to mangle this once-great idea.\nP.S. Apologies if I made any factual mistakes in this... I saw the movie earlier today and don't remember every little detail, but I'm pretty sure it's all right.",

            "content": "Rick Rosenthal returns from Halloween II to direct Halloween: Resurrection, the eighth in the franchise involving the serial killer Michael who is still out to get his family, and who still lives despite the cathartic ending of Halloween: H20. But what happened? Whereas Halloween II specifically worked to recreate the mood, tone, and construction of the previous movie, Halloween: Resurrection is a directly malicious attack on the franchise.It's three years after H20, and it turns out that the figure Jamie Lee Curtis decapitated in the previous film was a voiceless security guard, not Michael. Let us forget a moment that this makes no sense as the figure did attack Laurie Strode while she worked to defeat him, and instead focus on the fact that this movie pretty much makes short work of killing Laurie for no good reason except that it seriously seems like the filmmakers wanted to punish her, and the makers of the previous movie, for making an end to a franchise. Then the movie continues with a character named Sarah, possibly the daughter of Jamie Strode (from Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers), who joins two friends in a televised expedition to Michael Myers' childhood house for a night of reality television. Okay, so they're gonna get killed and people are going to watch them in real life. In some way, this movie really tries hard to present a \"voyeuristic aspect of television viewer-ship\" theme, marked by its pop critical and psychobabble dialog, an ill-conceived death-by-tripod, and Busta Rhymes saying some really stupid lines about the lack of humanism in television by the end of the film.If Halloween 5 was bad in construction, this one is bad in conception. The entire film is completely contradictory. It takes (bad) influence from reality television and The Blair Witch Project to make a movie about the dangers and emptiness of our popular televised lives, but the movie itself is filled with screen stars, monotonous television-style editing techniques, and a malicious contempt for everything the entire franchise stood for. The characters are more than stupid, this time they're even hateful, and what's worse, their confusion and clumsiness in the Dangertainment event shows an absurd lack of understanding from all levels of the production, from script to editing, on what the whole purpose of every level of the film is: the in-film dynamics of reality television, the out-film tension of viewer-ship, the point of the movie itself based on the themes it fails to actualize, and the relationship between those things.The actual film-making itself was flimsy and retarded. Rosenthal peppers the flick with worse scare-tactic cuts than even the most mundane of thrillers that come out practically every week, and then he tries to give significant dramatic effect with--seriously people--random slow motion takes of nothing happening! The acting and production design were equally as bad, making this movie literally seem like a random mish-mash of a bunch of stupid idiots running around an old, decrepit stage, pretending to be actors. Then the movie adds in new, in style, modern technology to show without a doubt that \"these kids are cool, they're completely relatable to a new generation!\" If this movie doesn't sound vomit-inducing yet, you have no soul.But all that aside, NOTHING forgives this film for Busta Rhymes. His entire presence is one of those hateful, headache-inducing things that makes people like me wonder if the filmmakers were just trying to get everyone to leave (not a bad guess, considering Rosenthal's aforementioned history with the franchise). A more obnoxious and uncomfortable character was never created for a horror movie, and then this film actually allows him to go all kung-fu on Michael and, the greatest sin of all, actually defeat him! By the time it ends, this movie has the ability to make you terminally ill--not because of the gorror approaches or the thriller tropes, but because it's so rotten and degenerate that the mise-en-scene itself smells like dead cat.The Halloween franchise has various levels of qualities and is in general an entertaining entity, but avoid this one at all costs. This movie should never had made it past the terrible script, much less the rest of production.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "The latest Michael Myers' slasher saga \"Halloween: Resurrection\" relies more on slick gimmicks rather than sickening gore to generate fear and anxiety. No, \"Resurrection\" doesn't surpass director John Carpenter's peerless slice'n dice classic \"Halloween\" (1978), which launched unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis into the Hollywood firmament as scream queen Laurie Strode. Yes, \"Resurrection\" tops 1983's \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch.\" Nevertheless, this derivative but efficient follow-up to the much superior \"Halloween H2O\" (1998), the second-best \"Halloween\" epic since Carpenter's original, piles up a reasonable body count, stirs up serviceable suspense, and features one of the more memorable moments (or the mother of all false alarms) of the franchise.\"Halloween: Resurrection\" fades in three years after \"H2O\" faded out. Evidently, Laurie believed she had beheaded her murderous younger brother, the \"unstoppable killing machine\" Michael Myers. Sadly, she learns to her shock that Michael swapped places with a paramedic. Macabre Michael crushed the guy's larynx, so he couldn't identify himself when Laurie hacked off his head. Consequently, the authorities have locked up poor Laurie in the loony bin . Meanwhile, when she isn't stashing her pills in a rag doll, guilt-ridden Laurie awaits her inevitable showdown with her big, bad bogeyman brother. Fifteen minutes later, Laurie confronts Michael (career stunt man Brad Loree), and you can guess who triumphs in their rooftop encounter. Hopefully, the proposed ninth chapter in the \"Halloween\" movies may rewrite Laurie's untimely demise the same way \"Resurrection\" shrewdly revived Michael. Director Rick Rosenthal, who helmed \"Halloween 2\" (1981), shifts the action from the insane asylum to the dilapidated Strode family domicile in Haddonfield, Illinois, where all the bloodletting began. Enter dot.com entrepreneur Freddie Harris (rapper Busta Rhymes of \"Shaft\") with a sure-fire scheme to cash in on Michael mania. Harris recruits six unsuspecting college students to appear on his Internet cybercast 'Dangertainment.' He promises them $5,000 apiece if they can survive a night in Michael's house. Each wears live web cams as they prowl the premises. Harris has wired the house with hidden cameras, too. Little does Sara (Bianca Kajlich of \"Bring It On\") and her five ill-fated friends know that menacing Michael has been living alone under the house. While Michael isn't knocking off these nitwits with his customary sadism, Sara's cyber-pen pal Myles Barton (Ryan Merriman) is typing out and sending messages frantically to Sara on her Palm-Pilot, warning our heroine about Myers' whereabouts. \"Halloween: Resurrection\" combines \"The House on Haunted Hill\" with \"The Blair Witch Project.\" The formulaic screenplay by Larry Brand and Sean Hood ignores the slasher movie rules about sex and drugs that Wes Craven's \"Scream\" trilogy outlined years ago. Gore- hounds looking for buckets of blood in the R-rated \"Resurrection\" may feel cheated by the overall lack of slash and gash. The best parts of \"Resurrection\" have little to do with horror and more to do with keeping this mass murder melodrama up-to-date with the latest advances in technological hardware. Altogether, only unquestioning \"Halloween\" aficionados will appreciate this gimmick-laden installment in the long-running series.",

It was all just a terrible mix-up and some poor random bloke got decapitated by accident! After re-watching that film recently, I was wondering what explanation they would come up with to attach Michael's head back onto the rest of his body. The first ever successful medical head transplant would have been a little too grotesque, even for a desperately long-running slasher series, so I guess this \"twist\" is the most acceptable excuse imaginable for yet another sequel \u0096 number eight already \u0096 in the franchise revolving on the unstoppable Haddonfield killing machine. Nobody asked to 'resurrect' the premise yet once more, and apparently it's the least popular entry in the series, but still a very watchable slasher with very few depth, but quite a lot of gory murders. The film opens inside the walls of a mental institution where Laurie awaits the inevitable return of her murderous brother. During a too obviously forced confrontation on the institute's roof, Jamie Lee literally kisses the franchise that turned her into horror's most legendary scream-queen goodbye once and for all. Michael returns to his childhood home in Haddonfield where he's lucky enough to receive a new shipment of victims without even having to leave the house. Hyperactive TV-director Freddie Haris (Busta Rhymes) recruited six teenagers to spend Halloween's eve in the legendary house where 6-year-old Michael killed his sister and broadcast everything they do and say live on the internet... Even if that includes getting stabbed repeatedly, impaled, head-crushed and decapitated. Personally, I hate the whole concept of Big Brother and similar reality-TV shows with a passion, so I secretly hope that one day they'll all follow the rules of \"Halloween: Resurrection\". Just put all the sad attention-seekers together in one ramshackle house and unleash a homicidal maniac upon them! Let's see how many losers will then still volunteer to have their pathetic lives displayed on camera. The film itself is pretty lousy, with absolutely no efforts to build up tension or to properly introduce the players. The dialogues are horrendous and endlessly stretched to connect one violent slashing with another. Very much unlike it was the case in \"Halloween H\u00b20\", since that film featured almost no graphic gore in the first hour. The girls are extremely pretty (even super model Tyra Banks makes an appearance) and they can scream really loud, the boys are a bunch of hopeless nerds and the script contains all the obligatory internet/chatting room clich\u00e9s. Worth checking out if it comes on TV.",

Nor is Michael after any family members once he gets to Jamie Lee, which by the way was so absurb to think a mental ward would have such sorry security.  Not to mention, every door in that place requires a key, so once Michael breaks her door down, there wouldn't be any door for her to open.  The whole internet show story was OK, but like I said, this film lacked any cool killings and very little blood.   But, the rat prop was cool.\nFINAL VERDICT:  See the other sequels; they are better than this one.",

It's not scary or suspenseful in any form or fashion and the characters are just annoying objects that are there only to be killed. Busta Rhymes takes out Michael Myers with karate, do I need to say more. Every aspect about this movie is just bad and it's one of those rare movies where I can't find one redeemable quality in it. I'm very lenient on horror movies and I usually give them higher ratings than others as it's my favorite genre, but this is actually one of the worst movies I've seen.

            "content": "An internet reality show broadcasts from Michael Myers' house on Halloween night.Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks star as Freddie and Nora, two producers of an online show called \"Dangertainment\". The two challenge six college students to spend the night in the Myers house, with the goal of figuring out what made him go bad. Among this group is Sara (Bianca Kajlich), who's having second thoughts about joining. As this show will be broadcast live on Halloween night, the participants all wear head cameras detailing their findings, which Sara's friend Deckard (Ryan Merriman) streams from a party. Unfortunately for participants, Michael has returned home.Halloween: Resurrection was directed by Rick Rosenthal, who returns to the franchise over 20 years after directing Halloween II (1981). Jamie Lee Curtis also returns as Laurie, but despite being plastered all over promotional media, she has a small role.Similar to Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), Halloween: Resurrection has elements of Scream. Both movies open with a shocking kill, before jumping to a completely different location. Unlike its predecessor though, Halloween: Resurrection's opening is cheesy and hokey, and is slathered with characters taking stupid actions that lead to their deaths.We then jump one year into the future and dive into the meat of the movie, which is the internet show angle. It stinks. It hypothetically could have been good, but it's not scary at all and there's too much shaky cam. The film is loaded with cardboard cut out characters that are just there to increase the body count, so you have absolutely no investment in these people. Character traits, you ask? One character is a chef, so there's that.This isn't even a spoiler - there's supposed to be a \"twist\" in the middle of the movie, where the characters get upset after realizing that Dangertainment \"set them up\" by staging props in the Myers house. Seriously, I've got bridges all over the world I want to sell these people.Why would the characters start having sex when they know they're being recorded? Speaking of which, characters die multiple times and it's caught on camera, but the Dangertainment team just happens to be looking away from the screen, or making coffee, or listening to music, or doing who-knows-what. If this film's characters had any sense, the run time would be 10 minutes long.Busta Rhymes is frequently referenced when discussing how bad this movie is, but the fact is he's not in the film that much. When he is on screen, the scenes generally feature more humor - and some infamously bad one liners - which don't work that well, but they're honestly more entertaining than the rest of the film, which is a drag to sit through.Regarding Michael Myers himself, his mask looks off. At the time the film came out, it was touted as the most accurate mask since the original, but the face looks a bit scrunchy, and the hair looks too puffy. That's the least of this movie's problems, though.Overall, Halloween: Resurrection is a terrible movie. It's an extremely boring, soulless film that killed the original continuity of the Halloween series. It boggles my mind how something this bad could get made, when all the studio needed to do to succeed was make a generic slasher film. I'll leave you with a quote from the Master of Horror himself, John Carpenter: \"I watched the one in that house, with all the cameras. Oh my god. Oh lord, god. And then the guy gives the speech at the end about violence. What the hell? Oh my lord.\"",

That scene where Busta takes on Michael Myers then karate chops him thru the window.  Please.  Finnaly Michael comes back in his house and stab Busta until he collaspses dead -the highlight of the movie. I rejoiced thinking that boring ass clown was gone forever.  But no, he gets to live again, his menacing attempts to act have been resurrected. He's up and around jumping and functioning as though nothing happened to him. Predictably he gets to kill Michael Meyers then calls him a motherf*cker for about the tenth time.  Naturally his lines are all seasoned with that charming phrase whenever possible.  The very final scene was also painfully predictable and quite dismal.  After complety trashing the Michael Meyers series these idiots have the gall to suggest a sequel.  Which washed up rap singer will they recruit for the next flop?  M&M?  Another thing is that mask.  Busta must have stoled the original because Michael's mask looked terrible.

The faltering franchise was dead until H20 revived it. H20 wasn't great but at thst point it was definitely the best film since Halloween 2.In 2002 we got Halloween: Resurrection. The web was starting to be more part of our lives so this film was put together with that in mind. Michael Myers for the internet age. The film opens pretty well actually with Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Laurie. She is in a mental institution. Apparently she had a breakdown after finding out that the man she killed in H20 was not Michael Myers. She apparently is catatonic from all of the medicine she is given. She fakes taking it she gets up and sees Michael. He goes after her and the confront each other. It is the only half way decent scene in the film. It's all downhill from there!!!We meet Freddie and Nora played by Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. They produce an internet reality show. They want to spend tge night and broadcast their show from Michael's childhood house. They get a band of really bland and stupid college students to spend the night to see if they could find out what made Michael a killer. And you know what happens next. Michael picks them off one by one in the house while the show is online so people are watching in real time. All of this is filmed with different types of cameras because there are supposedly cameras all over the house. No story, nothing, Michael in the house killing kids making a reality show. It us done without an ounce if tension. This movie came out 2 years after the very successful Scream so they went for thst kind of cool 90's vibe with this film. It fails miserably to create any tension at all. Rich Rosenthal directed this film. He was a veteran of the series having directed Halloween 2. Even though that film was not on the level of the original Halloween, it was a good sequel. The film looks good at times, the multiple looks of the cameras is kind of cool but that's it. There was just no tension, let alone scares to care much. Some of the casting in this film is just downright awful. I hope Jamie Lee Curtis got well paid for her little 5 minute cameo because it's the only thing worth seeing in this film.Jus horrible.Worst film in the series by far!!!Grade: F.",

Like HALLOWEEN H20, it ignores all the post-HALLOWEEN II sequels and hews to a chronology in which unstoppable killer Michael Myers vanished following his 1978 rampage, reappearing 20 years later to further torment his traumatized sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Here, six college students are recruited for a live, online reality show called \"Dangertainment.\" Outfitted with mini-camera packs, they'll spend Halloween night in the old Myers house in Haddonfield, Illinois, poking around dusty corners and looking for clues about Michael Myers' dark past. What they don't realize is that opportunistic producer Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) and his assistant have rigged the place into a haunted funhouse guaranteed to prompt the panicky reactions that keep viewers interested. Five of the group think the whole experience will be fake. Jen and Rudy hope the exposure will jump-start their careers, skeptics Donna and Jim figure it will give them something to sneer at and  Bill is just on the make. Only thoughtful psych student Sara (Bianca Kajlich), the archetypal \"final girl,\" is at all rattled by the house's bloody history, and it's giving nothing away to reveal that history is about to repeat itself. The film does its best to tie up loose ends - it opens with a prologue that severs forever the bloody tie between Michael and Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis, again gamely reprising the role that made her famous) - and put a fresh spin on familiar material without straying too far from the fan-tested formula. I'm highly surprised that Busta Rhymes was not nominated for a Razzie Award. The cameras in the Myers house are very similar to homemade movies. It sort of reminds me of a BLAIR WITCH PROJECT rip-off, but it's a good way to get the victims-to-be into the Myers house and keep them there once spooky stuff starts happening. But director Rick Rosenthal (HALLOWEEN II) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense, relying on cliched shadows and grainy, handheld images supposedly shot by the increasingly terrified students.",

Sadly, we no longer have Donald Pleasance who practically kept the films going. Jaime Lee is done with them. So what do we do? We cast a bunch of sorry unknowns who we don't have to pay much, plus a supermodel named Tyra Banks who has only a few lines, plus we put an Oscar worthy rapper (NOT!) in it that loves using the F-word every 2 seconds. The whole idea of using the cameras and a group of stupid, drunk kids at a Halloween party watching the whole thing on a pda/computer screen was so cheesy. And what I enjoyed about the Hallowen films up to this point was that they were cheese-free. The Blair Witch Craze is over - find something fresh guys! And the head chopping scene with the butcher knife was really ridiculous. I loved all the films up to this one. I like the direction they took with H4 and H5. H6 was OK. I hated that they cast another lame unknown in the role of Jaime Lloyd and then killed her off - another dumb idea! Danielle Harris should have been paid what she wanted. Anyway, John Carpenter is probably ashamed and disgusted by what they have done with this series if he watched H8 and I'm sure Donald Pleasance is rolling over in his grave. I hope H9 will be decent, but if they expect to do anything like they did in 8, I will not watch it and the series will be dead. Please let them have a decent plot and some real star-power with decent acting. Whoever came up with the idiotic ideas for this film really needs a hearty slap in the face for stupidity.

The previous movie had Michael being beheaded by Laurie. This movie retcons this by saying that it was actually someone else wearing his mask. His throat was crushed which is why he didn't tell Laurie who he was. Then why didn't he just take off his mask then? More importantly, how was he able to survive being hit by a car when he was just an ordinary person? The rest of the movie is basically a reality show with Michael in it. It's about as dumb as it sounds. It features a bunch of people living in Michael Myers' house as part as some publicity stunt but they get killed off like any other characters do. All of these characters are annoying and pointless and it seems like they belong in another movie. We get more lame scenes with fakeouts of other people wearing Michael's mask. A lot of the padding is just everyone talking with no relevance to the story. It's a waste of time. *1/2",

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection (2002) ** (out of 4) The sequel no one wanted but got anyways has some producers getting the bright idea to send six teens into the childhood home of Michael Myers on Halloween to see if they can come up with any evidence of why he's so evil. The house is rigged with cameras as are the six teens and they've got a group watching online but it doesn't take long for Myers to show up and start slicing them. HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION isn't as horrid as some have made it out but there's no denying the fact that it's pretty lifeless, useless and in the end it really wasn't needed. Director Rick Rosenthal, who also helmed HALLOWEEN II, doesn't do that good of a job here but I don't think he can take the full blame. One of the biggest problems is the actual screenplay that once again gives us an incredibly stupid story that simply makes very little sense. The movie starts off informing us how a sequel is even possible and the way they change the events that happened in HALLOWEEN H20 was just downright stupid and this opening twenty-minute sequence is just so bad, so lacking in scares and so silly that it really ruins the rest of the film. This first portion is pretty much its own separate movie as Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is in an asylum and Michael comes to visit. I found this entire sequence to be lacking and in the end it was really a horrible way to end the character. Once we hit the reality webcam stuff things don't get much better. The screenplay once again doesn't give us any characters to care about and most of those in the house are just downright annoying. The entire subplot with some party people watching it online really adds nothing to the movie. The way the film bounces back from actual footage and the webcam stuff grows rather annoying as things go on as well. Performance wise no one is all that memorable but Busta Rhymes gets the top-billing and doesn't do too bad of a job. It's rather sad seeing Curtis in the opening scenes because she and her character should have made their exit in the previous one. I understand the producer's need to make more money but the Laurie story should have been closed up or at least brought back in a better way. The killings are a tad bit more graphic this time around as well. HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTED is a film hated by many and I really can't blame them. As mediocre as everything is in the movie there's still some weird charm that comes from it. It's certainly not the worse in the series but thankfully it all ended here.",

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection starts with the not so shocking revelation that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) didn't decapitate her homicidal brother Michael (Brad Loree) at the end of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) but an unfortunate paramedic who Michael put his mask on so he could make his escape, it's been three years since then... It's modern day America & the craze for reality TV is at it's height & Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) has an idea, he intends to audition for teenagers to spend Halloween night in the now empty run-down house where notorious killer Michael Myers lived in Haddonfield & broadcast they're every move through the internet using small cameras attached to the contestants. Sounds like a winner, right? Anyway, friends Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), Jen Danzig (Katee Sackhoff) & Rudy Grimes (Sean Patrick Thomas) are all picked along with Donna Chang (Daisy McCrackin), Jim Morgan (Luke Kirby) & Bill Woodlake (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who think they can become famous if they play along. Unfortunately for them the Myers residence is far from empty, I mean even homicidal undead killers have to live somewhere, right? It just so happens that Michael doesn't like house-guests either...Directed by Rick Rosenthal who also appears in the film as the college professor Halloween: Resurrection was originally titled Halloween: The Homecoming & is the eighth film in the series which stopped individually numbering them in the title after part 5, I have to admit that I thought it was one of the better sequels but that isn't saying much is it? The script by Larry Brand & Sean Hood takes the topical notion of the reality TV show that is proving so popular even now with the likes of Big Brother, Survivor & I'm a Celebrity get me Out of Here in the UK & uses the basic concept as it's main story. It sort of feels OK actually & I quite liked the idea even though not much is made of it other than some The Blair Witch Project (1999) style shaky hand-held camcorder type shots. Having said that at heart it's a straight forward predictable slasher that in reality isn't any different from dozens of other's which litter video shop shelves & congest obscure cable TV station schedules. For it's type it's OK but nothing spectacular, it's one of those films I found watchable but almost totally forgettable as soon as the end credits started to roll.Director Rosenthal was responsible for probably the best Halloween sequel Halloween II (1981) so he has the dubious honour of being the only person to direct two Halloween films, I'm sure he's very proud although to be fair to him they are two of the better entries. Here he does an OK job, everything looks decent enough, there's the odd stylish moment & the kills are pretty good. On the negative side there are just too many pointless, dull & frankly boring shots of teens wandering around in the dark, Rick mate it becomes tedious very quickly so if you make a third one bear that in mind OK? After the totally anaemic previous entry pleasingly Halloween: Resurrection has some decent kills & some OK gore, someone gets a spike through their throat mounted on a camera tripod in a scene that rips-off/pays homage to Peeping Tom (1960), someone is impaled on a spike railing, someone has a kitchen knife stuck in their head, there's a cool decapitation, a slit throat, a severed head in a washing machine & someone's head is crushed.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 Halloween: Resurrection is generally well made with decent production values. The original Halloween theme is still cool as well. The acting isn't up to much & Rhymes gives a terrible performance. According to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section apparently leading lady Bianca Kajlich cannot scream (?why!) & she had to be dubbed in post production, to be honest considering the role & film I'd have thought being able to scream would have been an iron clad requirement.Halloween: Resurrection is an OK slasher in a cinematic world already full of them, it passes the time & is watchable but nothing special or to get too excited about. There are better slashers out there but there are worse ones as well, the choice is yours. The series started with Halloween (1978) & was followed by Halloween II then came the totally unconnected Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) brought Michael back, then came Halloween 5 (1989) & Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) which is when they stopped numbering them, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later was next before Halloween: Resurrection. It doesn't stop there though, a remake of the original Halloween (2007) is set to be directed by Rob Zombie sometime soon.",

            "content": "Well, this is it: the final review in a journey that's seen me make my way through a total of eight (including this one) horror movies all born of the same franchise. All told, we've had some classic moments, plenty of absurdity, and a third entry which doesn't feature the iconic Michael Myers in any way, Shape (Ha! See what I did there?), or form. The next to last entry, H20, promised to end the franchise on a slam-bang note, with Mr. Myers decapitated and Laurie Strode well on her way to finally overcoming the emotional toll that years of paranoia and attempts on her life by her psychopathic brother have wrought.But they\u2014the Tinsel Town powers that be\u2014couldn't leave well enough alone.Quite frankly, if the series had actually ended with H20 it would have been nothing short of a miracle. A studio opting for dignity as opposed to additional dollars is unheard of, so it should really come as no surprise that Michael would return to the big screen.\"How is that possible?\" you ask. \"Laurie cut his freakin' head off with an axe\u0085 right? That's the end. Kaput. Nothing else could possibly happen.\"Guess what: that wasn't Michael at the end of H20. It was actually one of the paramedics who'd attempted to recover Michael's body. We're told that the not-at-all dead sociopath sprang to life, crushed the larynx of said paramedic, and swapped their outfits, mask included. Admittedly, the explanation is pretty ingenious (though it starts to lose some credibility when one asks the question, \"Why didn't the poor sap just take off the mask and signal for help?\").Fast forward a couple of years. Laurie has been placed in a psychiatric institution due to the guilt she's endured after beheading a completely innocent man. She's spent her time preparing for Michael's inevitable return, having devised an elaborate setup that she implements in the opening moments of Resurrection. Laurie lures him onto the roof of the facility, uses a wench to string him up by his feet and then attempts to dispatch him. Predictably, Michael gets the better of her. He pretends to suddenly feel remorse at his actions, asking for her affection. When she acquiesces, he stabs her in the back (literally) and hurls her off of the building.That's it. That's how she dies.Laurie Strode, one of the definitive female action/horror protagonists of the past thirty years, is killed within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. It's one of those things that you have to see to believe; the first time I saw the movie I was appalled at the laziness of it all, and knew that what would follow could only induce queasiness.And that's exactly what happens. In essence, the story is reduced to a reality TV cash grab. Michael inexplicably returns home\u2014he's killed his whole family at this point, not counting the infant featured in Curse (a plot point that's strangely ignored here), so I'm not sure what he hopes to gain by doing this\u2014and survives by trapping and eating rats. When a crew of horny teenagers is recruited by Freddie Harris (played by Busta Rhymes, whose penchant for overacting is both hysterical and mind- numbing) to spend Halloween night in the former Myers home while the entire experience is broadcast live on the Internet, we can predict exactly what's going to happen. Michael starts killing people, and everyone watching thinks it's part of the act. Busta Rhymes uses some kung fu that he learned from watching Bruce Lee movies to kick Michael out of a window and eventually electrocute him. It's hackneyed as hell and infuriating.Michael, of course, isn't really dead, and when he dramatically regains consciousness in the Haddonfield Coroner's office we know that the same B.S. will continue, ad infinitum, until Michael faces both Freddy and Jason on Venus.The good news? Based on sheer mathematical probabilities, another good Halloween movie will be made eventually. It might just be another two or three hundred years before it happens.",

It is an absolute mystery how Moustapha Akkad allowed the series to go from H20 to this mess, which isn't even up to par with a Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie. True, Akkad, rest his soul, was transparently in the Halloween series for the money, but even he had his standards -- or so I thought.Director Rosenthal, no longer under the tutelage of John Carpenter and Debra Hill like he was when he helmed the decent Halloween II, can't even get the opening title sequence right (is that Arial Black I see?) and relies on a tepid John Wayne Gacy knockoff and an oh-so- convincing decapitation with a kitchen knife for scares. Even back in 2002, he was way late with all the reality TV/webcam gobbledygook. The film's premise plays out like your Great Aunt Gladys trying to sound hip and with the technological age because she managed to buy a tea cozy on eBay all by herself.It is best not to talk about Jamie Lee Curtis' involvement in this, so as not to exacerbate matters. After giving us the perfect ending to the series in H20, she was shackled to this project due to contractual obligations. Her character's undignified opening fifteen minutes are even more of a disgrace to the series than that awful Druid storyline in Part 6.What a disaster.",

            "content": "\"Halloween: Resurrection\" is another in the long list of \"Halloween\" (1978) sequels to be sure, but this one is better than most and uses interesting new cinematic techniques to enhance the horror. The story opens with a prologue in which we find out how Michael Myers (Brad Loree) escaped death in the previous installment \"Halloween H2O\" (1998) and what has become of his beleaguered sister Laura (Jamie Lee Curtis). After a couple of grizzly murders we move on to the main story. The main body of the film which involves six young people being chosen by promoters Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks to spend a night in the 25 year old deserted Michael Myers house, with the whole event being captured on video for a web cast over the internet. But of course you know who is also lurking about in the house. The six, and I hope I've got this right are Bianca Kajlich as Sara, the main character, Sean Patrick Thomas, Daisy McCrackin (looking like a younger Julianne Moore), Katee Sachoff, Luke Kirby and Thomas Ian Nicholas. Naturally there are the usual bloody murders as one would expect in a Halloween flick. Helping Sara escape the horror is high school student Ryan Merriman, who had established an on-line relationship with her and is watching the proceedings on the web. He is able to warn her through e-mails over their respective cell phones of impending danger. What sets this film apart though, is Director Rick Rosenthal's innovative use of digital video cameras strapped to the head of each of the six actors in the house. As well, there are stationary surveillance cameras scattered throughout the house for added effect. These are actual working cameras that capture the events of the story from six different points of view. The video footage is integrated with the film footage to give the film a more terrifying feel. We see what the characters see including a couple of their own murders.  Rosenthal reveals on the DVD that a Special Edition DVD will be forth coming where the viewer can follow any one of the six characters through the ordeal utilizing only the footage shot from their respective video cameras. In other words you can follow the story from six different points of view. Should be interesting.",

Alas, it all goes terribly wrong as Mikey pays them a visit.I'll start by saying, if the movie had been edited to only include the first 10 minutes, it would have been better than this 90 min pile of crap. Busta Rhymes gives possibly the worst performance in history and the rest of the cast are only a cut above him. The script is poorly written and the characters were not interesting. The score was generic and not the least bit scary. Brad Loree does play a good Michael though, and surprisingly he was the best actor (bar Curtis).Usually I'm OK for some mindless slasher entertainment but when its this bad, I just can't hack it.1/5.

He is back home again, killing teenagers in the eighth Halloween film, \"Halloween: Resurrection\". Anyone who saw the seventh one, \"Halloween: H20\", might remember that Myers supposedly had his head cut off by his grown-up sister Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) at the end of the film. But since, this is the eighth film, the writers conjured up a way to have Myers slicing his way through yet another picture.Surprisingly enough the director Rick Rosenthal (\"Halloween II\") and the screenwriters do create a fairly effective show down early on between Michael and sister, Laurie, who has been put in a mental hospital. After the opening few minutes though, the film becomes a mixture of the cliche and predictable. The plot revolves around having six teenagers spend a night over in the old Myers home as part of an online publicity stunt for a website. And surprise, surprise... Michael Myers is home.\nThe one trait \"Halloween: Resurrection\" lacks is tension, an obvious key ingredient to so many horror or suspense flicks. What made the first \"Halloween\" by John Carpenter so effective was a mood of genuine terror and tension based upon the unknown. Myers (in that film)appeared, then disappeared, he was basically a ghost and you waited and wonder when he would pop out of the darkness. This film as with virtually all slasher films now, possess none of that terror. Each killing in \"Halloween: Resurrection\" is telegraphed way ahead of time. So either Myers can stare at his victim for hours before he kills them or there will be a small meaningless chase before Myers shows his knife cutting abilities.The film has a few other low points, especially in the plot. No one seems to notice the cameraman go missing for hours after being killed and despite a loud scream not a sole hears Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas) meet his doom either. Although, this doesn't matter too much, since plausibility and the slasher film just don't go together. Then, there is rapper Busta Rhymes. I didn't know whether to laugh or cringe at some of the dialogue he spoke, which was just plain awful and silly at the same time.\nThe interesting aspect of this series as a whole, is how little things have changed in terms of the basics of the plot. Sure, some minor details are fixed. The teenagers in \"Halloween: Resurrection\" play on computers and e-mail rather than riding around in cars. There's even a mention of the TV show, \"The Osbournes\" in this movie. Despite the updating in visual and verbal references, little of substance has been added since the original. Michael Myers is still that unkillable boogeyman, and there are still teenagers waiting to be butchered. At least until movie executives stop seeing dollar signs next to the word, \"Halloween\".

My favorite Halloween movies are now Halloween the original, Halloween H2O, and now Halloween Resurrection. The rest of them aren't that great. The music was creepy like usual. The acting was good. I although had a little trouble with Sean Patrick, and the guy off of American Pie. I would watch them and think of Save the Last dance, and American Pie. But other than that this was such a great movie. I understand why people would be upset about what happen to Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie, but honestly if her brother can live through all the sequels why can't she. And plus the ending of Resurrection has an opening for another Halloween film. It would be so cool if Michael and Laurie Strode were in another Halloween Film and this time they duke it out one last time. You never know. it could happen. But moving on.

There are scenes in the movie that can be funny, but Michael Myers still looks silly and does dumb things.Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode is only in the first 6 or 15 minutes, and throughout the movie they explain what happened in the first 2 movies a lot like we did not know it before.Halloween: Resurrection (2002) was not good. It will have unintentionally dumb scenes, and laughably bad scenes. The ending leads to nothing and is confusing if you think about it from how everything led to an ending that tries to lead into the next movie.",

            "content": "In 1978 John Carpenter released one of the greatest horror movies in the form of Halloween. It's first sequel was okay but after that the series went downhill. It seems that every sequel would have a new backstory on Mr.Meyers and this is one is no execpation. I think the producers make a mistake by killing of Jamie Lee Curtis. Mrs.Curtis is what Halloween is about and only she can stop Meyers. I think the producers should have went with Josh Hartnett (but he's too big for movies like this) or Danielle Harris (but who has seen her in years) together since techinally they are siblings if you tie all the loose ends together. Halloween: Resurrection isn't scary but it's funny which isn't a good thing. Busta Rhymes makes the movie as Freddie Harris with his one-liners and the chicks in the movie are very hot. The film will disapoint hard core fans of the movie and those in the mood for a scare. The film might be better in my book if Bianca Kajlich had shown her knockers but all in all the film is just a gulity pleasure. The death scenes are okay and the chicks are hot. I give it 5/10.",

            "content": "I have been waiting to see this movie for 4 years. And after Halloween H20, me, my brother, and my best friend has disputed over the fact that if that was the real Michael Myers in H20, or just a copycat. Halloween Resurrection cleared this argument up, and is one of the many pleasures of Halloween: Resurrection. In the beginning, Michael tracks his sister Laurie down after 3 years in a mental hospital. On top of the roof, Michael finally kills Laurie, and then proceeds to go back to his home. The beginning sequence is very exciting to watch, and the music pumps up just at the right times. The story follows a group of teenagers who have won a contest set-up by Busta Rhymes, and Tyra Banks, to spend on night in the house of Michael Myers. Attached to their heads are cameras which they use to go around the house to try an uncover the mystery behind Michael Myers madness, and rage. But what they don't know is that Michael is already in the house, hell bent on killing them all. Halloween: Resurrection sets up these characters to die in cool, and sometimes elaborate ways. This movie cranks up the suspense by having Michael Myers at sometimes pop out of nowhere, and the score gives you that crank of music just at the right time to create an even more atmosphere of terror. Another pleasure of this movie is that is able to interract with the people who are watching over the internet, and sets up a very suspensful, and creey scene in which the heroine has a little palm computer device which allows her to make contact with the people wathcing, and they are able to tell her where Michael is. The movie not only has great suspense, I found my heart pumping at the end, and that's what a great horror/thriller should do. Halloween: Resurrection has a lot of funny line, and scenes, including a great one where Busta Rhymes { dressed up as Michael Myers] meats up with the real Michael Myers, and delivers a very funny outcome, which I will not reveal. Not only is Halloween: Resurrection creepy, and suspensful, it is able to create all that with a believeable plot which has characters, and events that are believeable. Followed by ok acting, and a funny performance by Busta Rhymes, great music, cool death sequences, a believeabl story, and ending which made me jump, Halloween: Resurrection is not as good as the first, but not that much close behind the first, Halloween: Resurrection stands as the best of Halloween sequels. 4 out of 4 stars.",

            "content": "After watching these crappy so-called slasher flicks like \"Urban Legends 2\" and \"Valentine,\" I'd be satisfied with a halfway decent slasher flick. Well, this is more than halfway decent--it's good.  Sure, it's nothing extraordinary, and there are those moments where you do wanna scream out, \"How stupid can these people be??\" but overall it's near par.  There are a few good scares, and Michael Myers never ceases to be creepy.  There's even some cool gross-out f/x, including a head rolling down the stairs.  But mainly, what makes it work is that it never gets too cheesy, yet it never takes itself too seriously.  And there's even a lil' bit of female nudity. What's a horror movie without some bare boobs?  Fans of the series will definitely be satisfied.*********SPOILER AHEAD**********If there's one harsh criticism I have, it's Busta Rhymes's speech at the end.  I found Busta perfectly convincing as the money-hungry founder of Dangertainment, in which he scares the hell out of his innocent young recruits to keep his Internet audience glued to the screen.  But at the end, he makes this heavy-handed, ludicrous speech about how the murders of these young people shouldn't be means of entertainment.  OK, maybe if it came out of a better actor's mouth, it would've sounded somewhat convincing--I mean Busta is a fairly good actor, but he's not ready for serious drama.So for all of you who are in doubt of this eighth installment to the series, don't be.  Trust me, bring the popcorn, you'll have one hell of a time!My score:  7 (out of 10)",

What we have here is another completely redundant instalment of the boring Halloween series, which once again sees dreary killer Michael Myers slashing his way through a bunch of stupid teenagers. The only difference between this and all the other Halloween films is that this one focuses on the ridiculous idea of having the dumb teens skulking around Myers' childhood home in aid of some show being broadcast via webcam. The film ties in to previous Halloween films by way of Jamie Lee Curtis' character - an actress who obviously appears in the film for a big paycheck, and the fact that she won't have to be in any more Halloween tedium. The main reason I've never been a fan of any of the Halloween movies is because the murder scenes are never up to much; and indeed, all we have here is Myers slashing his way through kids with a knife, which doesn't take long to get old. Normally when a film stars a rapper, that rapper is the worst thing about it; but not here, as because the rest of the film is so dull, Busta Rhymes actually increases the overall entertainment value. Nothing about this film particularly stands out at any point, but Rhymes does have an absolutely hilarious line of dialogue towards the end. Overall, this, like the rest of the Halloween series, isn't worth watching and you'd do well to miss it!",

Jamie! How proud I was to see you return to greatness in 'H20' only to (literally) fall into this mess. I hope you earned enough blood money. And after you read your only scene, how on earth did you agree to this storyline? Absolutely the worst, uh, resurrection of any franchise killer since 'Jaws: The Revenge' which told us the original's long-dead shark actually lived and followed by ocean the Sheriff's widowed wife down from New England to the Keys?? In this, they attempt to make us believe Michael switched bodies in the end of 'H20' and she killed the wrong man. If that were the case, wouldn't the victim simply take off his mask or do the universal \"no\" movements with his hand since he couldn't speak? And then Laurie doesn't ask this Michael to take off his mask since he's playing the same prank. But, I digress, that's just the first 17 minutes. You have the rest of the movie to hate as well. Reasons: Busta Rhymes (enuff said, but\u0085) and his busta moves, a victim that's on the verge of death texts someone vs. dialing 9-1-1, an overbearing soundtrack and a normal human scream that breaks glass. Obviously they were trying to cash-in on the reality series/webcam boom of the time and bring Michael on camera for people at home (or in this case, just a party) to watch him stalk easy prey in a house that's insides seem like a 37-room mansion with enough hiding places for 6 killers.

The premise of this film felt like it could have been made now (which is 2022 when I'm writing this) because it was about a group of people who film a reality TV show about a serial killer, not realizing that the real serial killer was present. Charlie Brooker did something similar with the miniseries Dead Set which was released in 2008. There was potential with the idea because of manufactured reality TV and how audiences interact with these shows. It was a shame the writers didn't fully exploit the idea.It was ridiculous to think that a live online show would have been that popular in 2002 because the poor quality footage and slow internet speeds would have made it unwatchable.The reasons why Resurrection felt dated were its characters and its visuals. The characters were basic archetypes and most of them were just cannon fodder. It wasn't scary or atmospheric like the best horror films are. It got really silly when the climax involved the rapper Busta Rhymes battling Michael Myers. The visual problem was simple: it looked like other mainstream horror films of the era.",

The Story follows three years after H20 in which Laurie is now in Smithsgrove sanitarium for killing a paramedic in which she though was Michael. Michael returns and eventually kills off his sister, one year later a company called Dangertainment plans to have a internet live show in the Myers house which Michael returns to Haddonfield to kill off the unwanted guests. the acting in this film is horrible, and the character are a bunch of dumb pot heads, who are completely clueless of who Michael Myers is. Despite a well famous cast like Tyra Banks, Sean Patrick Thomas, Busta Rhymes, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Thomas Ian Nicholas the films suffers from many plot holes.

The opening sequence is so ridiculous, you end up hating the rest, just by thinking about it. I was in my teens when I first saw this in theaters, and of course, I thought it was fun. But did it have a good script? Certainly not. And now, almost twenty years after its release, more complaints ensues. The major one being, how old and tired the technology and pop culture references are. Never follow trends to the letter. The casting is mostly filled with nobodies, which is kind of depressing. Jamie Lee Curtis is back, but it felt more like a requirement, than a true commitment to her role. The editing, to create the feeling of an omen, and Michael Myers lingering presence, is beyond cheesy. And if there's something this sequel didn't need. It was more cheesiness. One thing I give it though, the jokes and one liners, are funny. Even when it's silly. And some of the death and chase scenes, are pretty intense. But the way they keep using the same scream effects over again, is distracting... Bianca Kajlich was a good finale girl for the film. But couldn't these actresses, including her, scream properly?...",

            "content": "When I heard this film was being made back in 2001 I was over the moon. The death of Michael in H20 was brilliantly done, but deep down I think all Halloween fans just wanted to see Michael back on the big screen! Who cared about plot I thought, they can bring Michael back anyway they liked for all I cared!!This was my first Halloween at the cinema so when the music began I was ecstatic! But 90 minutes later I was just so so dissapointed. I'd seen Michael back again, but that alone was not enough I realised, and wished this had never been made.**(Spoilers ahead)** There were 3 main things wrong with this film-1) Busta Rhymes (Freddie Harris)...for me this guy alone ruined this film. His character was so fake, his dialogue was pathetic, and his overall acting was atrocious. How could they allow a character like this in a Halloween film, ok if they want to kill him off quick to raise the death toll, fair enough...but as a main character!!!!2) The death of Jamie- I knew this was coming and I dont think its a secret to anyone, but its the way they did it, making Jamie look like a complete idiot. Ok she wanted to make sure, but who else was she expecting, he'd obviously killed alot of guards to reach her, so even if she did kill him- who cared!!! And her final words- 'see you in hell', call me crazy but don't we want to hear after all her suffering, she's finally being able to rest in the place upstairs, not down below!!3) All the characters were just truly annoying, you was just cheering Michael on wanting him to kill this irritating character in the goriest way! And when a film gets like this like the Nightmare on Elm Street films did, aren't they just pretty pointless?I thought they did the 'bringing back Micheal' without too much stupidity, but when you watch H20 you realise how daft it is. In that the poor ambulance driver survived a broken layrnx, going through a glass window, being hit by a van, and finally being crushed. And to top it off after being hit by the van, he did the classic Myers sit up. There were however cool deaths in this and Michael was truly brilliant and looked great. One bit where the director obviously went mad for a while was the scene where Busta Rhymes screams at Micheal. I was enjoying this moment thinking this is it, he's gonna really make him suffer now, and I waited...and waited, before Micheal obeys him! What the hell was that all about!! Overall the whole camera thing works quite well, a little daft but its a different approach. It's obvious 'innocent' Sara will survive but the whole Deckland thing was so lame!  When no-one believes the killings are real, the film got stupid, I know special effects are great these days but this was meant to be live, so how the hell would they do it!As I said before the main reason why I hate this movie is Busta Rhymes, he wasn't funny at all. You knew when Michael stabs him he'll still be alive. But I thought this was building upto a big kill between the two at the end, but I couldnt believe my eyes when it was Michael on the recieving end, not only did we have to watch Busta's awful martial arts, but listen to his pathetic one liners (Trick or treat mother fuc*er), these corny lines should not be in Halloween films!My only wish is please, please, please kill Busta Rhymes character straight away in the next Halloween, and my faith in the series will be re-stored! Overall I gave this 5/10 coz of the cool deaths, and quite simply Michael's back!!",

Will any of them survive the night & make it?I found the film to be not bad. Ok, it's not amazing & it's pretty samey as we've seen it all before, another sequel with some wrap around story to not only justify a sequel, but as an excuse to see Michael Myers knifing off his victims 1 by 1.The film for 81 minutes does move fast & does at least deliver unlike Ends did this year. The characters are thin, but are there for expendable purposes like any other slasher film of its caliber. The deaths aren't bad in this one & the idea of Michael picking people off inside a house makes for a simple cat & mouse type slasher which is not bad & pretty good.Overall, it's not as bad as it's being made out. While it's a sign the Halloween films are starting to run on petrol fumes, it does show they're trying to keep the films alive by having Michael Myers return to do what he does best. The kills & house setting make for a unique entry, along with the internet/digital age theme being laced into a franchise which at this point was nearly 25 Years Old. It's a good entry that's not bad at all. Give it a watch.6/10.",

Busta Rhymes was most entertaining. Michael on the whole was very effective. (Maybe too mush emphasis was used on him studying death).\nCons:The beginning was poor. Laurie Strode was too important for it end like that. I felt nothing for any of the victims. I almost felt sorry for Michael, having these idiots in my house would have driven me to murder. The end was awful.

Karate kicking one-liners through a major role in a Halloween film? I really don't need to say too much more after that. I consider this film fantasy land. If this is the modern Halloween movie, the original might as well have been made in the 20's. Thats how far removed it is from Carpenters (or even Rosenthalls!) film. Its not a real Halloween movie. It almost doesn't qualify as a movie at all. It looks a joke made by fans to spoof the series on you tube. Sets look like sets, nothing is believable from the acting to the lighting.

Halloween II was an unnecessary albeit mostly good sequel that introduced mythology to the character that they thankfully retconned with the most recent entry of the series. Halloween 4 did well with its source material, but was kind of bland and boring compared to the first two. Halloween H20 was good for its time, but it seemed like more a knock-off of Scream than a sequel to Halloween II. Rob Zombie's Halloween is probably the one I have the most mixed feelings about because of its depiction of the characters mainly. But then there's this. They had some good ideas for a film that was an otherwise bad idea in and of itself, but they were all poorly executed. With the advent of live streaming on the horizon, Resurrection has a neat plot, and it feels disconnected from the rest of the franchise because of its concept and characters, which I don't mind so much at this point. The original series wasn't that great to begin with. The kills are okay, and I like Busta Rhymes even if his widely hated karate skills were a touch ridiculous. It's certainly not a good movie, but it's not as terrible as I want to think it is either. Just a stupid movie that's pretty much harmless.",

            "content": "Picking up where \"Halloween H20\" left off, \"Halloween: Resurrection\" re-writes the previous installment's ending so that Michael has actually survived, via the ol' switcheroo. After a little detour to the local mental hospital to face off with his sister once again, Michael Myers heads home and is anything but pleased to find a group of college kids filming an internet documentary/web-cast on his turf. Quicker than you can say \"Silver Shamrock,\" Michael dispatches violently of the brain-dead, overly horny cardboard cut-outs in an attempt to clean house.To say this film is a new low for the series is an understatement. Fact of the matter, to this day, I cannot say why they even bothered making this film, assuming that it's sole purpose was to make a little money. Perfectly mirroring that theory is the complete lack of a soul in this film. Sure, in the '78 original, Michael was meant to be a blank slate without conscience or reason. But does that mean that any of his films should share those characteristics? The eighth installment in the franchise was surely the final nail in the coffin of what was a very troubled series. Despite it's various off-shoots and dropped story lines, the \"Halloween\" series always carried itself as a more intelligent, reasonable franchise. Not as outlandish and far-fetched as the Freddys and Jasons of the eighties, Michael and his films were more often than not, believable. As fans, we have weathered cults, curses, men in black, sisters, uncles, nieces, Marco Beltrami, characters and stories that constantly met dead ends and everything but the kitchen sink -- heck, even a film that had nothing to do with Michael -- so to say we were used the abuse by 2002 would be an understatement. But by insulting our intelligence with it's downright stupid explanation as to how Michael survived his last fling and then following it up with the lamest, weakest story of the franchise, it seems as though they genuinely didn't care about making a decent product this time.Basically, with this film, the intention was to create a fast-food version of Michael Myers. He walks, he stalks, and he slashes rappers, models and mid-20's actors trying to be teenagers. There is zero story to be told, as Michael basically takes a detour from the usual \"Halloween\" mythos to slice and dice some random meat. Despite the fact that Rick Rosenthal -- who also directed \"Halloween II\" -- can deliver a good looking film, there is nothing else of substance. No suspense, no scares. The characters -- even the intended survivors -- are paper-thin and uninteresting. Heck, they even got Michael Myers wrong. Aside from a completely disinterested Brad Loree, what was up with those eyebrows? Heck, they even butchered the Myers set...err, I mean...house. I could break it down for you some more, make it seem even more unsavory, but it would be pointless. Just know that any sequel bearing the name \"Resurrection\" is a waste of time. Sure, if you turn off your brain and forget Sam Loomis, Laurie Strode and everything else you came to know and love about \"Halloween\" and see this as a modern \"Friday the 13th\" with Michael doing the dirty-work, it can be enjoyed on a very simple level. Afterall, with so many bad characters to choose from -- most notably, a karate-kicking Busta Rhymes -- a little bit of pleasure can be derived from seeing their ultimate demise, a reassurance that they won't taint the \"Halloween\" name ever again. Other than that, though, there's nothing else to write about.",

No. Instead he stalks and murders a group of college students who represent a modern version of both the Breakfast Club and the original Halloween cast. The whole movie has no point and seems to completely give up within the last half hour of the movie. Not too different from Jason X (but not as bad). The lead is likable but they write her as if she has some hidden dark past. As if maybe she's met Michael before or possibly had something traumatic happen to her. But of course nothing comes of it. Now Michael is less PG - 13 returning to his bloody roots as is previous movies (head crushing, head stabbing, etc.) Unfortunately the writer didn't fully understand how to write the character of Myers and ruins it. The movie also continues to ignore pt 4 - 6 but making it more noticeable this time.

I wish they would have a film where no one is killed or everyone lives. This would be an original or the sleazy woman or the annoying prankster lives.  The film is scary, and does not pull any punches; except which character in what order dies.  The film hides what will happen next.  This film creates tension, and causes the viewer to jump unxepectedly.  This is what a horror film should do, and the second Michael Myers is perfect script writing.  Concluding, I like how they bridge the last film, with the present one.  Laurie Strodes kills the wrong person.

            "content": "*~*~*~ Spoilers Ahead *~*~*~Oh, this film is bad.  I'm a big fan of the 'Halloween' films, but there is absolutely no excuse for how terrible 'Halloween: Resurrection' is.I had been wanting to see this film for a while.  The previous movie, 'Halloween H20' was really good, so I figured that the scares would keep coming.  Well, I guess when it comes to an eighth installment (this is the eighth film!), the 'Halloween' franchise has officially gone down hill.\n'Resurrection' started off slowly and pretty much continued at the same pace for the entire duration of this nightmare.  Jamie Lee Curtis is killed within the first ten minutes, and that right there was enough to persuade me to turn the garbage off.  Seriously, Curtis is a favorite of mine, and was it really appropriate to kill her as soon as the credits stopped rolling? So, Jamie's dead, I'm mad, and 'Halloween', a once simple and scary film, is now buried in cameras that are hooked up to the Internet.  'Halloween' has now ventured into the dark side.  The change between professional filming and the personal filming gave me a headache for the whole 94 minutes (or so).  'Resurrection' drags on and on.  It wasn't scary, the death scenes were over in the blink of an eye, and every scene was predictable including the end.  Now of course, Michael Myers is still alive, which more than likely means that another 'Halloween' film is in the making.  What a terrible idea that is.The direction that this film was under was unbelievably idiotic.  Rick Rosenthal, who directed the wonderful 'Halloween 2', is apparently now under the influence of drugs.  His directing is half done and simply terrible.The acting is probably among the worst I have seen in a while.  I liked Bianca Kajlich on 'Boston Public', but she is not fit to appear on the big screen.  Katee Sackhoff, Daisy McCrackin, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Luke Kirby are also bad.  It's a shame that the film didn't even allow the audience to actually see them before most of them were killed. Maybe I would have liked them better in that case.  Busta Rhymes is ridiculous.  He obviously can't act, but he did manage to make me laugh a couple of times.  Tyra Banks' incredibly small role here is no big deal. Ryan Merriman is probably the best of them all, and I'm just saying that because I've liked him in previous movies.  Overall, the cast is awful.Everything about 'Halloween: Resurrection' is asinine.  The acting is horrible, the death scenes are silly, the writing is simple, and the film is just not scary in the slightest bit.  Most of the 'Halloween' movies ARE scary, but this one isn't at all.  I would say that it's a shame that 'Resurrection' is so short, but in this case, it's a relief.  Nobody should have to sit through this trash.",

It had a lot of potential but the director and producers took the franchise to the wrong direction (s).First, I know that the reality shows took by storm t.v. but it wasn't necessary to focus a HALLOWEEN movie on one of them. That was truly a bad decision. Michael Myers does not belongs in the new century, he's a slasher icon that should've stayed in the past. Or you could've used another character instead of Myers. I mean, the premise is really good but it didn't work with Myers. I watched the movie's premiere back in 2002 and I was very excited mostly because it was \"the new Halloween movie\" but soon after the great opening sequence, the movie goes terribly down hill.The second mistake was to include rappers and socialites in this movie. What do they have to do with Halloween? I mean, LL Cool J did a decent job in \"H20\" but it wasn't necessary to use new rappers. Rappers, Halloween, what does that have to do with Horror?! damn it.The third and biggest mistake was to kill Laurie Strode. She was the best thing about the movie but I'm sure that Jamie Lee Curtis didn't like the new dimension that the franchise who once she made popular was taking.Without JLC and Donald Pleasence, the series are ruined. And now that (sadlY) Mr. Akkaad is dead, I think that \"Ressurrection\" is a terrible way to end the series. If you are a newcomer to the genre, you might enjoy watching the movie because it has a lot of boobs, cheap gore, and false scares. But if you are a die hard fan of the series you might feel hurt.",

There are some genuinely funny moments with Busta Rhymes and it was good to see Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as Laurie. I'll tell you what disappointed me the most,  the ending.  I feel that every good horror movie has to have a good ending.  In case you didn't know, director Rick Rosenthal delayed the movie for almost a whole year because he wanted to re-shoot the ending.  He said that once filming was complete and went into post-production, and idea for a better ending hit him and it was so good that he had to call back cast and crew to redo it.  Upon writing this,  all I can say is, what the hell was he thinking? Ive seen this ending in so many other movies, there was nothing original about it.  Major let down.  I have seen Halloween 6:The Curse of Michael Myers and Ive also seen the unreleased Producer's cut of the movie and Im one of the true believers of the fact that it was better than what was released.

            "content": "WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.\nHalloween Resurrection sees the return of the director of Halloween 2, along with an introduction to the cast of Tyra Banks and a bloke out of American Pie. A satire of reality television, internet programming and horror conventions, it begins with Mike Myers not being decapitated after all, and ends with Busta Rhymes electrocuting his genitals after crying out \"Trick or treat muthaf**ka!\" The strangest thing is, the film is actually even worse than that description makes it sound.It seems odd that the somewhat limited Halloween franchise limps to its eighth movie (or seventh if you consider Season of the Witch was completely divergent from the Myers story), while its Xeroxed spawn of Jason Voorhees has reached new heights of mainstream popularity with its tenth and eleventh entries. Although Friday the 13th was never as satisfying artistically (though I always found John Carpenter's original hugely overrated anyway) it always seemed more fun, and Halloween movies have always left me a little cold.There's a scene where a character describes how camera positioning from high or low angles is scary, but face-on angles are \"dull\". You suspect that it's a philosophy Rick Rosenthal follows religiously, completely unaware of the fact that there isn't a single frightening scene in this entire movie, no matter how many clever angles he tries to insert. Ironic discussions on the staginess of horror films doesn't really hit the target, either, unless Jen's decapitated head really was supposed to look outrageously fake. Let's not even get into the internet transmissions, which are remarkably bereft of slow streaming times or people getting kicked off their connection. Okay, it's a movie, roll with it, but it's not a very good one.There seems no genuine reason for this film to exist, other than the fact H20 reinvigorated both critical and commercial appeal, to an extent at least. Yet even the curiously limited appeal of that entry is abandoned here, with Jamie Lee Curtis (commendably playing a highly unglamorous version of Laurie) killed during the first fifteen minutes. To fill the vacuum we get more of the same obligatory airhead teens, and a pair of ginger boobs to go into the mix. Season of the Witch may have been poor, but it was rarely dull, and this truly is the most tedious movie in the Halloween canon, a bona fide clockwatcher.The DVD release intrigues, with Mike Myers now being downgraded by the \"Theme/Contents\" description as merely \"moderate horror\". But best of all is the scene selection chapter titles, with such spoiler-heavy gems as Chapter Twelve, \"He's Still Alive!\" It is a nice package, though, with a range of extras that you would probably describe as \"impressive\" if it was actually a film you gave a toss about. I can't claim to have sat through the whole lot - a tour of the set I skipped, as well as a brief documentary where they all kiss Jamie Lee Curtis's ass.  With over half an hour of extras, then Alternate Endings reveals that another \"Mike gets an axe in his head\" ending was proposed, while the commentary tells us little, except for Rosenthal's lack of respect for the intelligence of his \"confused\" audience. Or maybe you really do have to be pig thick to enjoy a Halloween sequel? Certainly when wit is dredged up in the form of \"You have great legs - when do they open?\" (Followed up by \"one o'clock?\" as a rejoinder to the obligatory middle finger) and a man bleeds from his eyeballs as his skull is crushed, then I guess it never was highbrow filmmaking. The use of video inserts could be described as an innovation, but, like the rest of Resurrection, it never feels like something we haven't seen many times before. Promotion in magazines used a \"Big Brother\" style campaign, with the tagline \"Meet The Housemates... Who Dies? You Decide.\" Unfortunately, in a Trades Description-defying revelation, it turns out you don't actually get any say in it whatsoever, a feature that could have improved things no end. Still, who'd want to watch a DVD where the main feature finishes after only two minutes?",

I think I seen as many of these that is humanly possible before one self puts on a hockey mask and kills a few thousand people. It's time to put this series to rest. The formula is always the same, the teens who have sex and take drugs are the ones who get killed. Um perhaps Halloween is being metophoric...ah I don't think so.  And the reluctant or innocent one is the survivor.  In this case the Rap artist Busta Ryhmns lives too.  Michael Myers isn't even bad enough to kill a rapper.  It starts off with Jamie Lee Curtis fooling everyone into thinking she is nuts. She nuts alright..being in this movie.  in any case she has divised a plan to kill her brother.  Of course it fails and she is killed (smart move on her part),  now I'll bet she comes  back in another Halloween.  Donald Pleasence has had the good sense to really die so thankfully he will be spared another sequal.  Now we go to a college and the usual students getting on a internet live show.  And some teenager who is so addicted to the internet he foregoes his older sisters party to watch some girl he likes on the show.  Kind of like the typical smart wheelchair bound kid is in other movies like Dress to Kill who saves the day.  Now instead of a wheelchair genius we have internet geeks.  Tyra Banks and Busta are running the show.  Well of course the sex and drug students get it first. Now all that is left is the innocent and the Busta.  I want to know if Michael Myers is human?  If JLC is his sister he must be.  So why can't someone just kill him? I can see if a person cannot get close enough to kill him.  But he gets electrocuted,  burned  all kind of stuff that would kill the heartiest of humans.  No one sees this guy ever. This why this has got to stop.  You see it has got to end somewhere and I guess this is good as any time. I also get this mixed up with those Friday the 13th movies.  I can't remember which one was on that Space shuttle. In any case that is where they should put this Michael Myers on and let it drift into the big Black Hole in space where all bad movie villians who wear at their welcome should be.",

So I attended a sneak preview of \"Halloween: Resurrection\", and was somewhat pleasantly surprised.(Possible Spoilers Ahead)Jamie Lee Curtis makes a memorable appearance at the beginning of the film (though she doesn't stick around for very long), and from there we are thrust into the movie's main plot. A reality Internet show called Dangertainment has selected 6 teenagers to spend a night in Michael Myers old house, back where all the killings began in the original \"Halloween\", in the hopes of finding some evidence of what might have driven him to murder.It's here that \"Resurrection\" attempts to innovate, and nearly succeeds in making this an excellent little horror movie. Each person in the house wears their own personal camera, which allows for some interesting perspectives particularly when Michael is on the loose and doing what he does best. This brings me to another point in this film's favor. If you saw \"H20\", you saw a toned down version of Michael, he toyed with his victims more than he had in the past. In \"Resurrection\", however, he's all business. He has a job to do and he doesn't waste time doing it.With all of this said, however, \"Resurrection\" becomes just another horror film, falling into some of the tired cliches that we've seen ad nauseam over the past 20+ years. Also, I found the ending to be very weak, certainly nowhere near as powerful as the ending of \"H20\". Also, I wonder if this film signals a sort of passing of the torch from Jamie Lee Curtis to Bianca Kajlich (once you see the film you'll know what I'm talking about). With all of that said, however, \"Resurrection\" manages to be just another run of the mill horror film, although sadly it could have been so much more. 5 out of 10.",

The worst in fact is now a cult film. Will never get it \ud83e\udd23",

Things go awry.Halloween 4, 5 and.6 were awful. No question about it. They presented a storyline that nobody cared about and, despite their best efforts, failed to deliver anything more than a generic slasher formula.When the team decided to retcon themselves with H2O, they were on to something. They were able to bring Jamie Lee Curtis back on as Laurie Strode and, for that brief moment in time, all was well (well, as much so as things can possibly be when a mother/son duo are being stalked by the masked killer). H2O ended at the perfect time; the series was as good as it had been in a number of years....And then, this happened.This film is to the Halloween franchise what Hellworld was to the Hellraiser franchise, although this particular film is even more insulting because you have H2O directly before it which was a nice reset and brought things back to an enjoyable place, whereas Hellraiser didn't.This movie is so generic. These characters are copied and pasted from the book of horror movie cliches and they interact with one another in such a way that every single moment is nothing more than exposition. There's no humanity in the interactions. Every single word of dialogue is just rushing you to the killer so these kids can die off and we can go home, which is a real shame.Unfortunately, this is far from the first time that financially motivated decisions beat out intelligent creative ones. Halloween is a franchise that never seems to fail in the box office department, and the studios know this. By the time we hit Halloween: Resurrection, the series has been milked for more than it's worth, and this is really the final nail in the coffin. This would be like if Wes Craven's New Nightmare had a sequel after somewhat re-setting the franchise and Wes, Robert, Heather and the team had nothing to do with it.The best actress in this entire franchise, Jamie Lee Curtis, is brought back once again... and they wasted the opportunity. They gave her a throwaway role in order to be able to slap her on the cover without needing to worry about a false advertising lawsuit, give her a pay check and send her out the door. Sure, the decisions with the character may have been her idea, but that doesn't mean the viewer is required to be on board with them. This entire movie was just a rushed effort to bring in as much money as possible and, while it may have succeeded in that area, it failed where it really mattered. Not, of course, that the studio really cares about any of that.Oh, how the mighty have fallen!",

Unfortunately, these tense and suspenseful moments occur towards the last 20 minutes of the film.The story  revolves around a reality TV show, owned by Busta Rhymes and produced by Tyra Banks, that puts a group of college students in the old Myers house to unravel the mysteries behind Michael's killing spree. There are an abundance of limp thrills and cheap gore sprinkled with some genuine cleverness.  It was great to see Jamie Lee Curtis resurrecting her role as the homicidal maniac's favorite sister, but her part seemed to have been added solely to give credence that the movie is connected to parts 1, 2, and H2O.  So, if you are a true Myers fan, rent the video but don't bring out the expensive popcorn.\nAnd as for Busta Rhymes' performance... sadly, William Shatner's spray-painted, latex mask out-acted him in every scene!",

The film centers on a doomed reality show that happens in the Myers house on Halloween night. Of course Myers is there and systematically stalks and brutalizes the wannabe stars. Some of the entertainment is of the so bad it's good kind from Sarah shattering a glass with her powerful scream to Busta Rhymes entire performance. The kills are fun and Rick Rosenthal of 1981s Halloween II sets a decent atmosphere.

Early in this eighth Halloween episode, we learn that Michael wasn't decapitated last time, after all. Then long-suffering Laurie finally gets killed - though that's never stopped her brother showing up in the next film, so Curtis might not be as free of the series as she thinks...It surprises me that, after nearly 25 years, the Halloween series is still churning out new entries. (I will not use the phrase \"still going strong\", because it most definitely is not.) Like the main character, Michael Myers, Halloween appears to be unkillable. Since the films are fashioned on shoestring budgets with little care for quality, all they have to do is make back a little money and another installment is guaranteed. Obviously, there's an audience out there for horror - even bad horror. Of all the slasher franchises, none has a more bankable name than Halloween - not even Friday the 13th. Watching the seventh Halloween sequel, however, I reflected on how far this series has fallen. There's no evidence of craftsmanship or energy. Everything, from the plot to the execution, is plodding and obligatory. He only suspense in Halloween: Resurrection is in what order the paper-thin characters will be killed. Michael isn't terribly creative in orchestrating the slayings. This time around, he's a no-frills serial killer, relying strictly on knives. There is one decapitation, but it's mostly stabbings. Director Rick Rosenthal, the man who deserves a share of the blame for Halloween 2, is back at the helm this time around, and, if anything, his work is less inspired. He has a talent for shooting scenes in a way that sucks all possible tension and suspense out of them. There is one curious thing about this movie. The director seems to intend for the audience not to identify with the cardboard-cutout victims, but with Michael. Let's face it - despite the blank mask and zombie-like gait, he's the best developed character in the film. Pure evil is more interesting than a vacuum. Towards the end, when one of the survivors decides to go after Michael with a chain saw, I found myself rooting for the venerable villain to grab the saw and turn it on its wielder. Or, failing that, on the crew responsible for making the film. In the end, Michael \"dies\" again, but that's just a temporary inconvenience. In fact, just before the credits roll, Halloween: Resurrection offers its only moment of pure, unadulterated horror: the promise of another movie in this woebegone series.",

But, if you want a decent night in with a couple of friends, this isn't necessarily a bad pick... Starting off with a slightly ludicrous beginning, we see Mike Myers break into a hospital and gruesomely kill some innocents (police officers, etc.) Then, the scene turns to the obvious: a group of high-school kids, invited to stay in a supposedly haunted house by entrepreneur Fred Harris (yikes!...Busta Rhymes). Mike is not at all delighted about this, his house been filled with the terribly clich\u00e9d annoying high school kids, and sets about killing them once on for all. To shorten this down, Halloween probably should have finished after \"H20\" but it is slightly nice to know someone cares enough to do another (hopefully last!) one. So, to answer the question: no, this is not a good film. It's not particularly scary, clich\u00e9d and and dumb. But for a night in with some friends and a bag of popcorn, this might be the ticket...Overall: **/ out of ***** (2 and a half out of 5)",

I haven't seen Halloween: Resurrection in a very long time (it hasn't been long enough). I was unfortunate enough to see this in the theater when it came out, and now doubly unfortunate to sit through this \"movie\" one more time. If you had to say one redeemable thing about H:R is that it gives Halloween fans an opportunity to see what would happen if Michael finally gets his revenge and kills Laurie. But that's it - just 10-15 minutes of the opening with JLC. After that, it all goes downhill on a sled filled with dog poop. So let's rip this thing to shreds:-The retconning of a paramedic in Michael's place is so insulting to the audience and completely destroys what worked in H20. I totally understand why the franchise had to continue, but it should have been with Rob Zombie's remake (not that it was great either, but still). That way, we could have basked in the H20 \"chopped off his head, Laurie wins\" glow for a lot longer. And if they wanted us to swallow the paramedic garbage, how does a normal middle-aged dude survive being thrown through a plate glass window of a speeding vehicle, and then have that van crash land on his vertebrae, and he's still OK? Oh, and also the Michael pinned under the van at the end looks exactly like he did throughout the movie eye-wise.-Busta Rhymes is a very talented rapper, but one of the worst people to be on the silver screen since Sofia Coppola in Godfather Part III. He shouts all his lines, yells at Michael to leave a room (which he does!), and then karate kicks Michael in the finale, all while imitating offensive \"whaaaaaa\" noises that they do in martial arts films. Even worse, he doesn't get killed.-The whole \"Dangertainment\" concept might have been slightly interesting in 2002 when the internet was still becoming a prominent way people consumed information and entertainment. But oh my, the picture quality and concept have not held up well. You just know whoever brainstormed this thing thought they had a great idea on their hands. Nope. Even though the setting is the Myers' house, it is devoid of any connection that made other sequels any fun.Other than that, the plot stinks, no one is likable, Tyra Banks' death scene happens off-camera (?), Michael's mask looks like Joan Crawford, and you're not rooting for anyone. Not fun in a bad way. Not fun in a good way. Just awful, painful, insulting hot garbage. AVOID!",

Her presence in the lead role in H20 lifted that film above mediocre status. To kill her off in the first 10 minutes was inexcusable. She is the only one who can properly end the series hopefully with an assist from son John. Of course she IS the sister of the unkillable one. Maybe it runs in the family? The casting of Busta Rhymes is yet another screw up. He is nothing but irritating and his constant stream of M.F.s is tiresome and offensive. This is good dialogue?! They throw in a girl whose emotional extremes make things go haywire in the auditions, then do nothing with it. That at least could have been something different, but maybe they were afraid it would look like a ripoff of F13TH THE NEW BLOOD'S Tina. On the plus side it was good to see a reasonable facsimile of the Myers'house, not the more traditionally haunted house looking one used in H4 and H5. They got that right. What made the house frightening was its ordinariness. Also it was funny when the real Michael came mask to mask with the pretend Michael. A little more should have been done with that for comic relief. A time waster--nothing more.",

Given this is the eighth and last of the canon series, it seems fitting for the man that started it all returning to end it. Not Carpenter of course, but Rosenthal who directed the pleasantly fine second entry that helped popularize the killer that just refuses to kick the bucket.Also returning is finish things is Jamie Lee Curtis who firmly ended her relationship with the franchise by dying in the prologue. Much like the prior film of comically beating Myers' butt, Jamie is ready for round eight but shockingly, and rather limply, loses in a scenario reminiscent of Halloween 2.But here lies the problem, whether it be supernatural orders found in the dreadful and oft skipped 'Thorn trilogy' or simple cinematic storytelling, Michael Myers did it. He achieved his goal, his mission in life, his series story arc in murdering his entire family. In effect he has no meaning to exist, which cements him in the same position of Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger who were all having so much fun they forget why they even started.Who do we have now? Who knows, I sure can't remember the forgettable cast of fodder this time around. Save for Tyra Banks in a small throwaway role and Busta \"Trick or treat, motherf***er\" Rhymes as the man to canonically take down the Shape for the last time. No real threat since Paul Rudd also accomplished that. Those two (Banks and Rhymes) working together on an online reality show exploring spooky tourist attractions leads to uninspired and poorly directed portable camera portions that resemble the found footage craze that boomed before and then after this film.There also happens to be two characters that watch this at a Halloween party and aiding in the protagonist's survival, absurdly but entertainingly they wear Pulp Fiction costumes the entire film. As bizarre as it is to see a white guy try to act serious watching live murders while wearing an afro and goatee, it's pretty great to see recognizable costumes on screen.Mentioning Jason and Freddy before, it's strange to witness the ends of these franchises. Even with reboots and rebirths, it's still morbidly curious to see just how confident and desperate studios were to maintain a franchise with no regard to quality or quantity. Fittingly the franchises end up resembling the icons themselves, disfigured and devolved yet still lurching onward. But more so, that it's the masks that instilled that magic, like the people embodying those killers, it's the directors, actors, producers, and studios that regularly rotate to wearing them. Copycat killers trying their best, or not, to score their name crudely alongside the originators by rekindling the legacy.",

            "content": "Apparently the new way to kill a movie serial killer is to get some dodgy rap artist (in this case Busta Rhymes) to add some tension destroying quips and then perform some karate on the b****rd. But this is Michael Myers for gods sake...he's a movie legend. Come on, out of all the 70's generation slasher movies Halloween was the first and most powerful, mostly because of how *serious* Myres was about going about his business - he was the freaking BOOGYMAN! Resurrection follows on from the O.K.ish H20 (which managed to totally forget the other 4 sequels to the franchise after Halloween 2 (not forgetting the Michael-less III)) with a diabolical opening scene starring Jamie Lee Curtis. She gets the hell out of dodge and things go downhill rapidly. The excellent John Carpenter score is used in a completely cursory way once again - no one seems to understand how exactly it managed to add to the awesome tension in the first films closing sequence.Look, basically, it's a waste of a great movie serial killer legend. At the age of 14 Halloween scared the hell out of me, since then most Halloween movies (good, average or bad) have still chilled me when that blank masked freak hits the screen - Resurrection left me bored and oh so disappointed. Busta Rhymes versus Michael Myres...oh we all know damn well the rapper would get rapped.4/10",

            "content": "Halloween 8, I both love and hate this film depending on what level you want to look at. In terms of plot, it sucks heavily while it's littered with nice little perks and tweaks to the horror formula. Suddenly the motive behind Michael's reign of terror changes-now he's living at home when a bunch of teens break in on a reality show publicity stunt. Granted it is nice to have something different, but something else could've been done.All the previous Michael-included Halloweens are all but voided in this film; the hunt for members of his bloodline all gone. No more Laurie, or her son whats-his-face, and no more Jamie or her son (granted Jamie died in H6, but frankly that film deserves to be ignored.). Um, it's no secret Halloween Resurrection is a sequel to H20, meaning no mention of the events in Halloweens 4 - 6.The characters were all right, standard slasher fair, and of course Halloween Resurrection has its share of cheesy parts. Most of them involve Busta Rhymes, but one particular 'revenge' sequence involves the heroine.Enough of the bad, time for the strengths of this film. After five sequels, Halloween finally returns to its old-school feel as former Halloween director Rick Rosenthal takes the helm again. Halloween 8 easily has the most style points of any slasher that's come out in a long while. Jam packed with nods to Halloween 1 & 2, Resurrection brings back the creepy atmosphere, the lighting and camera angles that made the Halloween franchise what it is.As much as I liked John Ottman's orchestration of the Halloween theme in H20, it didn't feel right as the score. An orchestration would've been a great idea for just a CD release or something, but Halloween Resurrection gives the synthesizer the dominance in the infamous rhythm. Danny Lux took the best of Carpenter's creation and blends it with the best of Howarth and Ottman's variations, throws in a few twists of his own and delivers the finest rendition of the Halloween theme.Lastly, Michael Myers is downright vicious in this film. When he kills, he lets the audience know they're not getting back up. My only gripe is that when Busta Rhymes breaks out with his pathetic attempt at martial arts, Miky should have sliced the SoB to ribbons and have that be the end of it. The mask looks great, probably the closest to the original mask since Halloween 2 other than the opening scene where the mask has an afro thing going on. The bulk of the film though, that's remedied.Finally, the computer reality program setting does allow for a level of awareness of those being stalked. It's always a nice touch when the people in the films have knowledge of the situation, and come across as remotely intelligent. More could have been done with it, and the characters certainly could have been brighter & less clich\u00e9, but like I said I both loved and hated this film. Love its style . . . hate just about everything else.",

I was excited at the fact that Rick Rosenthal came to the helm, seeing that his direction in Halloween 2 was an exceptional feat in the heels of John Carpenter.This movie ruins everything! My understanding of the whole Halloween plot is that Michael Myers stops at nothing to rid the world of any bloodline that is his... ie Family. So they kill Lorie Strode within the first 10 minutes..... doesnt that leave her son, the Josh Hartnet character from the previous movie (H20) as the only one left? But there is no sign of him in this movie! Michael Myers has suddenly adopted a new purpose, to randomly kill anyone at any time, for any purpose. No no no, this is all wrong! It destroys all credibility!What a let down. They are bound to make more sequels (one is in production as I write)... and I really hope they can redeem themselves from this grave error. Give us fans at least SOME credit! If Michael Myers has no one left to kill... then let him rest in peace!I give this doosy 1 out of 10.",

That's what made \"Halloween,\" different. It had a good story going. I admit the opening sequence with Jaime Lee Curtis was good, as she always is, but the rest of the movie is nothing but a waste of time. The acting is horrible. Michael even gets to chop a head off with his butcher knife. How fake is that? Bascially, it's about a bunch of college kids spending the night inside the famous Myers house trying the find the reasoning behind Michael's madness. Something I thought we had already covered in Halloween 6. But as it turns out, it was all just a set up. The use of all the camera's (an obvious Blair-Witch rip off) is enough to make you want to vomit. This movie is a disgrace to the \"Halloween,\" franchise and to the fans.

SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN The explanation of how Michael Myers survives H20 is ridiculous.  Not only is the paramedic that Michael Myers uses as a stand in for himself the exact size and weight as him but he apparently also possesses Michael Myers' ability to survive being thrown out a car windshield, hit by a car and crushed by a car.  Granted the film makers of Resurrection took the time to explain why the paramedic doesn't yell out to Laurie Strode and tell her that he isn't Michael Myers (his throat has been crushed - again this would kill most people) but they don't explain why, after fighting his way out of a body bag he doesn't take off the mask he's wearing!!!!Okay, horror movies rely on suspension of disbelief for the movie to be enjoyed but consistency is still needed within the frame work of the film. I'm sure even die-hard Halloween fans would be upset if Michael Myers started to fly from place to place to do his killing.  Michael has the ability to survive extreme trama, but he usually goes into a coma or disappears for a long time to recover from his injuries, everybody else, like the paramedic, cannot have this same ability.That's my distain for the first 15 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie is just your run of the mill bad slasher flick.  There are a couple of interesting moments, one or two minor scares and a little bit of suspense but nothing really worth mentioning.  There aren't any characters to root for everyone is just fodder for Michael to slash through.  Actually Michael is the one to root for as he cleanses the vermin from his house, I really wish he had been more successful.  The movie would have ended better with no survivors and Michael walking off into the sunset then it actually did, perhaps he could be on his way to do away with his nephew John!  As it is, I was REAL shocked to see Michael wake up in the morgue, not!I love the Halloween films that feature Michael Myers.  I, II and H20 make a great trilogy.  H20 would have been a fantastic way to end the series (despite what some of the other reviewers say).  But the film makers got greedy and made this pile of crap suckering in the people who loved H20 and thought they were going to get another H20 but only got a Friday the 13th Part 8.Halloween: Resurrection gets a 2 out of 10 the full 2 marks go to Michael Myers the coolest of the big 4 slasher killers (Leatherface, Jason and Freddy)",

There's some good kills in this and solid camera angles to capture them. They also had a few solid jump scares. There was some funny interactions between Busta and Michael Myers.

            "content": "The general consensus seems to be that 'Halloween: Resurrection (2002)' is the worst entry in its series, as irredeemably bad as a movie has ever been. This, I must say, is a gross exaggeration; in some ways, it arguably gives the thing too much credit. Don't get me wrong, this is below average in every single regard. However, it isn't as bad as the similarly derided 'Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday (1993)' or 'Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991)' and it isn't even the worst in its series (that dishonour goes to 'Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers (1995)'). It's just boring, blatantly mediocre yet relatively competent. It isn't a blunder, it isn't a mistake, it isn't the result of an ill-equipped crew or an illogical writer; it's seemingly exactly what it set out to be, it's just that the result of that is completely inconsequential. That's not to imply it's intentionally poor, of course, just that those involved seemed to be working to the best of their abilities. In a way, it's kind of sad that this is the best they could come up with.Aside from its prologue (which functions as a relatively solid short film in and of itself), the narrative has no real connection to any of the previous entries in its franchise - aside from, of course, its antagonist. Instead, it focuses on a bunch of teens who sign up for an interactive reality show live-stream directed by 'Dangertainment' founder Freddie Harris, played by an entertainingly miscast Busta Rhymes who feels as though he's badly ad-libbing his way through every single scene. The teens are locked inside Myers' childhood home and tasked with investigating for clues as to his murderous tendencies, but little do they know he's been living under the foundations and is eager to show those tendencies to them first hand. There are a couple of semi-enjoyable wrinkles in the formula, but generally it's run-of-the-mill slasher stuff just set in a single location this time around. The direction by 'Halloween II (1981)''s Rick Rosenthal is decent, but the cinematography is too dark and the editing is sometimes confusing when it opts to switch back and forth between conventional shots and POVs of the characters' head-mounted cameras. It's not bad, just bland. Even a few moments of jarring gore can't elevate things to the level of excitement, never mind scares. The affair just lacks drive in its narrative and atmosphere in its aesthetic. It's very obviously an early-2000s horror film and it suffers from most of the usual problems associated with those, including but not limited to bland characters and uninspired visuals. There's just nothing to truly hold your attention. By the time Freddie Harris karate kicks The Shape out of a window, then bursts into a garage and yells \"trick or treat, mother******!\" before he fries his opponent's nuts with jumper cables, lighting the whole place on fire and creating the perfect background for yet another holiday-fuelled one-liner (\"hey, Mikey, happy ******' Halloween!\"), you'll be too disengaged to fully appreciate the absurdity of it all. Ultimately, it's pretty obvious to see why the franchise died here... at least for a little while. Still, if it could come back from Curse, it could certainly come back from this.",

The original is my second favorite film of all time and I own multiple copies of all the sequels.This particular installment was just atrocious. Being twenty-one, I really didn't expect this film to be scary, but I was really upset to see that it was trying to be funny. What has happened to Michael Myers? He used to be such a remarkable villain with all his subtlety and sparse appearances on the screen. In this film however he is constantly in front of the camera (both the actual and the Internet ones) skulking around the house, giving his knife to some human serial killer encyclopedia, backing off from a berating rapper, to name just a few of his unorthodox acts.I like most people, thought the first 15 minutes were relatively decent (except that bozo in the clown mask) as they put the puzzle pieces together pretty well (although that paramedic seemed to have some immortal qualities of his own), but from that point on, the film went straight downhill like an alpine ski course.Rick Rosenthal just didn't seem to be taking the film seriously at all. The serious and somber tone of the previous films was what used to set the Halloween series apart from the other horror franchises. I'm afraid that Halloween may be going the way of Jason X or even the dreaded Leprechaun series. I mean Busta Rhymes doing some kind of crazy Kung Fu on Myers? How do these people sleep at night? This one was full of uninteresting annoying characters that you didn't know much of anything about and couldn't have cared less what happened to them, and even the kills themselves were tremendously bland and unoriginal. Some of these deaths appeared to be homages to deaths in the previous films, but they just didn't work as well.Also, where were the traditional scenes of the Halloween series? There was next to no reference to the name Haddonfield save for a sign on the Haddonfield University lawn, no black screen with text notifying the date and town, the classic score was mutilated once again, and hardly  enough references to Autumn and the Halloween holiday itself. There was also zero interaction with Michael Myers and the local law enforcement. That for me was always one of the coolest aspects of Halloween, Michael Myers making mince meat of Haddonfield police officers. They are just more of a formidable stumbling block to Myers than a bunch of extremely inept teenagers.All in all, a very forgettable sequel. Hopefully next time whoever is in charge might have had some kind of passion for the series like a lot of us fans and turn out something which creatively emulates the original, but does not branch off into this nonsense. This is all just my opinion, however, I'm sure a newcomer to the series would probably enjoy it.

Rusurrection is no exception.I honestly had no intention of seeing this movie, but curiosity got the better of me (as well as my horror fixation) and so I finally broke down. Thank God I didn't spend a single penny of my hard earned money for this load of garbage.First off, they start it off ALL wrong by their explanation on bringing Myers back.  They did an AWESOME job of putting an end to it all in H20 and had they still wanted to do more movies, then a prequel could have sufficed. But noooooooo, they go n screw it up with this load of trash.*SPOILER*Their next big mistake was killin off our beloved Laurie Strode.  How dare they!?  Now, I'm quite certain Jamie Lee Curtis probably had something to do with that.  Probably a conversation along the lines of: \"If you MUST do another movie, kill my character off PLEASE cuz I don't want to be linke to what has now become crap.\"   I could be wrong, of course.

Michael looks awsome, the movie was awsome, scary and exciting with a lot of suspense!I mean the \"real\" critics for newspapers gave this movie a lot of credit, is with them being professionals they know what to expect from an 8th, and this must of really sparked them for giving it 5 positive headlines for this movie in the first week of it opening, and it came 4 in the box office, and thats how good this movie is for eighth in the series.so enjoy!",

If you think Lara Croft is getting old in video games then Michael Meyers should have been dead for decades. But no, he always shows up to kill some stupid and horny teen agers somewhere without any sense. Well, he obviously is a maniac but that is not an excuse for bad writing and directing.I think those who don't have any imagination shouldn't be in the bussines but actually in this bussines most of them are lacking any imagination. And most of those people decided to make another Halloween movie. This one isn't even scary and what kind of a horror movie isn't scary? Typical horror movie, of course. Silent Hill games are art, the plot is beyond our comprehension, it is scary as hell and leaves the player(s) to think and ask questions. During this movie my second question was, is it over yet?\nThere could have been an actual story in this one but I guess producers decided that there shouldn't be one so that their target audience wouldn't leave confused (they propably wouldn't be able to understand if the plot had an actual \"twist\").Michael Meyers is back again and this time he doesn't want to leave home so he decides to slaugther teen agers in his own house. Of course, these shallow teenagers don't know that. So, after special appearance of few dead bodies few of them decides to have sex and then they get killed. If you couldn't guess who are going to get killed and in what order, I strongly recommend that you won't watch any movies now on. This movie is too predictable to be interesting and too disgusting to be liked.And if you thought Michael is going to die, then you're wrong. That son of a teenage killer just won't die. Needless to say, the acting in this movie is bad and the dialogue is horrible and the movie looks like a b-horror movie anyway. If this gets you scared then you really haven't seen a real horror movie. This is total mess in any point of view and it should not have seen light of the day. But it did. However, the best thing is that you don't have to see it. That is indeed an accomplishment. Is this worse than other titles of the series? Hard to say when all of them are bad except the original.This really is one of the worse movies I have seen. This franchise really proves that people don't learn from their mistakes. The crew didn't, anyway. This series has faced so much criticism that it surprises me that they haven't done any improvements. Hopefully no one thought that they were making a good movie - that would be really scary!",

The plot is ridiculous -- it takes place in the Myers' condemned house with no electricity (hello city regulations?), the actors are obsessed with sex like they are in a campy movie -- the girl gets naked in the dirty a$$ basement before dead bodies fall all over her (Halloween is NOT Friday the 13th), and the worst aspect of it all is the editing. All throughout this movie the film is randomly slowed down. Why? Michael is walking too fast..... press the slow motion button. Jamie Lee Curtis is falling too fast.... press the slow motion button. Randomly things just slow down for a few seconds here and there all throughout the movie yet the film format can't handle these slow-motion effects, so every time it is slowed down the film becomes blurry. It is horribly distracting, all because the director couldn't direct the guy who played Michael to simply walk slower. Jamie Lee Curtis didn't want to be in this movie as she keeps trying to kill herself off in all the horrible remakes but Moustapha Akkad just won't let her! (Though it is relieving to know that Danny McBride is helping with the new movie, and clearly that is enough to get Jamie Lee Curtis back on board one last time).I did like Busta Rhymes though... he is a good versatile rapper slash actor.And I am glad they finally got rid of that whole Thorn thing. It was a horrible mistake that was forced into the franchise for no reason (look up the history of how that happened).",

Unlike the Jason and Freddy movies, Halloween is still a respected franchise that can get known actors and major releases.

            "content": "I read another reviewer's comments about Halloween: Resurrection, and one of the things that he said in his review is that hardcore Halloween fans will be disappointed. On the contrary, I think that hardcore Halloween fans, a brilliant group of movie buffs with whom I proudly associate myself, are among the few that will really be satisfied. The Halloween that John Carpenter released in 1978 is among the most well known horror films ever created, which is why people who are not so familiar with the series (and the fact that the original will never be topped or even matched) are the ones that will expect a horror movie experience of some incredible mangnitude, and when they realize that no sequel can never accomplish that, they'll walk away shaking their head in disillusionment.\nI, on the other hand, with the benefit of a very in-depth understanding of the Halloween series as a whole, realize that any sequel to a film as good as the original Halloween is made for entertainment purposes only, and for the most part, this kind of entertainment doesn't include many real scares. If nothing else, I enjoyed this movie just because of the film score, which remains one of the best and most powerful horror film scores ever recorded.Granted, the movie trips over itself almost immediately. It contains a scene very early in the film which is so ludicrous that it threatens to set the stage for an hour and a half of no-brain horror, but luckily the movie is able to turn itself around. There is a stereotypical scene in horror movie lore, and I don't know if it really has a name yet, but this is how it goes. There is some goofy and contrived conversation that leads to one person being in a high-risk room (this is a horror movie term) alone, while the other person (who SHOULD have been there at the time) lags behind doing something stupid (in this case, eating a candy bar from the vending machine).The moron finally catches up (I'll give a spoiler warning here, even though I'm only about to spoil a scene within the first ten minutes of the film), and notices that a running dryer is making a suspicious amount of noise. He walks up and finds a severed head inside the dryer. The problem here is that we know there's a head in the dryer as soon as the guard slows down and looks at it, but the dryer is drying a load of WHITES and there's not a DROP of blood on a single garment. I hope I'm not the only one picking up on the discrepancy here.I've gotten a quarter of an inch cut on the top of my head (from a water-skiing incident that I won't get into) that bled so much that it covered my face and chest and completely soaked my swimming shorts (the lesson I learned that day is that head wounds bleed a LOT), so I ASSUME that a SEVERED HEAD would bleed at LEAST as much. Okay, let's overlook the bleeding head thing (this is the kind of thing that comes up when you're analyzing a horror movie, so hear me out here), you still have to deal with the fact that, while the guard nervously creeps up to the drying machine that contains not a single solitary drop of blood, he evidently didn't notice the headless body of the other guard, which was so close to him when he was peering into the dryer that he tripped over it when he stumbled backwards in shock. Was this guy so curious about what was in the dryer that he stepped right over his friend's headless body?Before you answer that, let me just tell you that the rest of the movie doesn't operate at QUITE that level of sheer stupidity, so feel free to check it out. I was a little dismayed at first when I realized that Busta Rhymes was in the film, if only because he so viciously mutilated an Ozzy Osbourne song a few years ago, but he proves me to be an idiot by delivering an excellent performance as one of the heroes of the film. I'm a die-hard Ozzy fan, but even after Busta ruined one of Ozzy's songs, I am willing to forgive him after seeing his performance in this film.\nOne of the things that I liked about this movie, that I should have seen coming given the sheer magnitude of horror films that I've watched (REAL spoiler warning) is that Michael Myers was not brought back to life by some goofy Evil-Can't-Be-Killed crap, but by the simple fact that he disguised someone else as himself in the previous film, and so Laurie Strode decapitated someone who she thought was Michael Myers, but was really some poor guy with a crushed larynx and three kids. At this point, by the way, I'd like to point out that if you're revolted by the fact that a guy withthree kids getting killed is a RELIEF, you may not enjoy the Halloween films.I'm still a little confused by the fact that Laurie gets stabbed and apparently killed (I'd like to reiterate my spoiler warning here). I assume that her `death' (see my X2 review if you think I'm referring to an actual death here) is just another sign that yet ANOTHER Halloween film is inevitable, but I was expecting her to jump out at some crucial moment when some helpless teenager was about to get killed.Oddly enough, I think the internet portion of the film was remarkably effective, since I've seen total trash like Dee Snider's Strangeland, and realize how easily this kind of thing can be totally screwed up. The movie contains the obligatory element of romance, and like almost not a single other film that I've ever seen, the two characters involved in romance never meet each other. For that alone the movie deserves some commendation. There is a little bit of a Can't Hardly Wait element as two geeky freshman go to a party supposedly designated for people older and cooler than them, and they wind up heroes without forcing us to suffer through any cheesy romance scenes beyond the heroine thanking her hero on television. When was the last time the hero and heroine made contact only through television? Am I wrong to think that the movie deserves to be rewarded for at least trying something new?I am not a fan of endless horror movie sequels. I have yet to see Jason X, but having seen all 47 or so sequels of Friday the 13th, I know that unless they come up with something as fresh and entertaining as Halloween: Resurrection, the series has long since passed away. I am also, I might mention, not at ALL a fan of rap musicians covering classic rock songs, but even though Busta Rhymes did that and screwed it up just as badly as they all do, I really enjoyed Resurrection, as well as his individual performance in it. It is Halloween 8, a sequel number that holds no distinction other than the fact that it is the only one in years worth watching that goes beyond being worth watching just because you're a fan and are obligated to see them all. This sequel undoubtedly stands above the rest, I can only hope that it sets a trend.",

It takes some stupid twists and turns here and there that prove to be frustrating, Busta Rhymes is in this movie for some reason, and the look of the mask is again just horrible (did they not learn anything from last time). Not to mention that in addition to that, we have some incredibly bad acting- which can honestly be quite hilarious at times. I mean this is a movie where we have *spoiler alert* Busta Rhymes doing kung fu to fight Michael Myers- how can you not enjoy watching that with a smile on your face. Its relentlessly campy, and although I took almost none of it seriously, I do feel like they could have had a great concept out of this film. The plot with the reality tv show and the cameras inside Myers house is rather interesting- although a bit forced the way they do it. The major problem is, it just doesn't feel like a Halloween film- and rather seems like the start of potential for a completely unrelated horror flick that just roped in Myers for the thrill of it.

Although sequels were planned to follow HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, Dimension Films decided that it was best to later reboot the film series with Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 of the original HALLOWEEN film.The film is set three years after the last film with Laurie being put in a psychiatric hospital after mistakingly killing a doctor who she thought was her brother. Laurie sets a trap, but successfully, after twenty years of tracking her down, Michael eventually kills her.The following year, the movie goes from here. It continues with the masked serial killer Michael Myers continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield, but this time, in his old childhood home, now derelict, which is being used for a live internet horror show. Just like the last film, Halloween: Resurrection insists that the fourth, fifth and sixth installments are not canon.I don't hate this film, but I can see why other people do. I will not explain anything bad because everything about this movie is so great.The acting is fantastic, but I will say, I was sad that Laurie Strode was killed off at the beginning of this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is good in the screen time her character has and she does an incredible job in her last appearance as Laurie Strode.Bianca Kajlich plays Sara and she is amazing in this film. Daisy McCrackin plays Donna and she is just dreadful and she is the only one who does not try in this film. Luke Kirby, Katee Sackhofff, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Ryan Merriman and Sean Patrick Thomas are all good in this film and they deliver some good acting skills. Busta Rhymes in this film, a lot of people did hate, but I like him in this film, because he is funny as heck. Tyra Banks plays Nora and she does good in the screen time she has.Brad Loree plays Michael Myers in this film and he is just good, if not better than the other Michael Myers actors that has came before him.The musical score by Danny Lux is just phenomenal and iconic and he created a genuine score to the original film instead of generating something new. He goes crazy for this Halloween picture's musical score with an electro-acoustic feel that dates back to the synthesizer scores of the 1980's.The kills in this movie are way too out there in a few areas, but I can still manage to sit through this movie and still get some very good scares out of this film and really like this movie, unlike some fans and critics and audiences who won't take this film nicely, unlike some of the other \"Halloween\", \"FRIDAY THE 13th\" or \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film sequels in those three franchises.My favorite part of HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION is when Busta Rhymes does his freaking karate, \"Trick or treat, motherfreaker\", dressed up as Michael Myers and super-kicking him out the window. I know people hate that part and would rather see him die, but I loved that part. I just teared up laughing and cheering for that part. He is a good rapper and an actor and I don't think he's bad as every one says, but as much as I love this movie, there is only one complaint.They had to kill Laurie Strode in the first 10 minutes of the film and I admit, it is sad, but Jamie Lee Curtis wanted the studio to do that because she didn't want any part of the new Halloween sequels.Overall, I love HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, sure it is stupid, but there is a reason why I like this movie at all costs.8/10.",

            "content": "In Halloween: H20, Michael successfully tracks down his biggest adversary and opponent, his own sister Laurie Strode and the two go head to head in a battle of wits resulting in Laurie walking away the victor when she faces the fear of her brother and kills him with a swift axe blow to the head, decapitating him; a fitting and epic ending for an iconic horror villain and beloved horror heroine.So then, how is it that Halloween: Resurrection exists?Well, it turns out none of the above actually happened.No, it turns out that Michael switched places with a paramedic at the scene of his murderous rampage, crushed his larynx so the man couldn't speak and walked away undetected. Overcome with guilt at murdering an innocent man, Laurie is subsequently committed to a mental institution where she patiently waits for Michael to find her again, which he inevitably does.Laurie manages to trap Michael on the roof of the institution but terrified of killing the wrong person again, she falters at dealing the final blow and Michael is able to exploit her moment of vulnerability to stab and throw her off the roof to her death; a feeble ending to her character in stark contrast to the triumphant ending at the conclusion of the last movie.With Laurie finally dead, Michael is free to return to Haddonfield, where he lives under the foundations of his old, abandoned childhood home - presumably to live the rest of his life in peace.Unfortunately for Michael, a reality TV producer (Busta Rhymes) has commissioned a live internet broadcast to take place on Halloween night inside the Myers house, where a group of college students agree to be filmed spending the night at the scene of Michael's first murder as a child, completely unaware that the man himself still lives there. Cue a new murder spree, broadcast live on the internet to an unsuspecting audience not realising that they are witnessing real - as opposed to scripted - deaths.This film is entirely pointless, and yet I can completely understand why it exists. Made in 2002, reality TV and the internet were still relatively new and innovative commodities that hadn't been used a lot in horror movies at that point. In fact, one of my favourite (and arguably, best) parts of the movie is where the main heroine, Sara, receives instructions of Michael's whereabouts in the house on her palm pilot via her friend watching the broadcast on the outside world.I feel as though the script would've fared better as an individual horror movie, not as part of the Halloween series. The retconning of the events of the previous movie and opening sequence with Laurie feels forced and Michael could've been replaced with a new horror villain and serial killer. After all, no-one wants to see their favourite horror icon karate chopped through a window by Busta Rhymes. Yes, really.",

Myers is just an evil killing machine in this movie, the way it must be. The only problem with the film is busta rhymes, he kind of spoiled it with his terrible humor, but myers makes up for that. I hate all modern horror flicks like scream and urban legend, but this movie is beautiful because it worries more about the main man of the film, Myers, and not the teens. Kill Them All Myers!!!!",

Their rivalry comes to an end, when Michael finally kills her. Then a few days later... the reality programmers at Dangertainment (Busta Rhymes and Trya Banks) selects an group of college students (Biance Kajlich, Sean Patrick Thomas, Luke Kirby, Katee Sackhoff, Daisy McCrackin and Thomas Ian Nicholas) to stay one night at the infamous house of brutal killer Michael Myers for the internet and for Halloween. But what Dangertainment or the College Students didn't realized that Michael Myers is in his house and there's living there for years. Michael decides to kill them off, one by one.Directed by Rick Rosenthal (American Dreamer, Bad Boys, Just a Little Sex) made an lively but certainly silly and oddball sequel to the popular Halloween franchise. Although \"Halloween H:20\" was the perfect way to end the series and the battle between Laurie & Micheal in \"H:20\" was effective. But Miramax/Dimension Films didn't think so. Which \"Halloween:Resurrection\" was certainly made for the money. Which each sequel of the series was certainly profitable enough. The story is quite dumb for this sequel but it is also fun as well. There's good performances by Kajilich, Thomas and Ryan Merriman as Kajilich's internet buddy.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an commentary track by the director and the editor of the film. DVD also has Web Cam Special with optional commentary by the director. Which \"Web Cam Special\" offers some alternative scenes and deleted footage wasn't used in the theatrical cut. DVD also deleted scenes, featurettes and more. Perphas the dumbest thing in this film is the Character of Rhymes. Which he's an OK character until he fights Michael with his Kung Fu Skills!. Which it seems out of place with the rest of the film and sadly Rhymes has an few unintentional laughs as well. Probably what makes this film fairly entertaining is directed by Rosenthal. Which he directed the violent, respectable and underrated \"Halloween 2\". Executive Produced by the late Mousapha Akkad (Who's been involved with every \"Halloween\" movie until the recent remake/prequel of \"Halloween\"). Super 35. (*** \u00bd/*****).",

So how is Michael looking after 23 years of taking out teenagers and chasing his sister Lori? Michael looks pretty good, but not great. I wish I could say I loved \"Halloween Reserection\", I really wish I could say that I had a great time sitting through the 85 minute film, but again, I'm at a loss for words. As I was at a loss for words the first few minutes following the first viewing of \"Halloween:H20\", on the big screen 3 years ago after the thrilling ending that made up for the first hour and 15 minutes of re-hashed \"Scream\" formula that was already killed by such rip offs as \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". Unfortunately \"H20\" would become a silly romp that should have been spanked and sent to the corner, for doing exactly what all the films have done since the original \"Halloween\". 15 minutes after 20 years is not even worth the other 85 minutes in \"H20\", so does \"Halloween Reserection\" follow suit? No, but there's a different kind of wrong here. We are given an opening that hasn't been this fun since \"Halloween 1\". But we are shocked and shook and fed an unbelievable explanation for all of the events that happened in \"H20\" and then the film goes farther down hill from there. This film suffers from the same problem that Director Roesenthall's \"Halloween II\" had, no character development of new characters. We get to know them well enough to know who they are when they're butchered, and that's about it. You've heard that from critics since the beginning of the slasher days, but what's wrong with that? Everything, for all the reasons that makes \"Halloween\" stand out above the rest is the characters, we knew them, we cared about them. In this film they follow that formula, but they really don't let us in on who these people are. We don't even care about the female lead enough to care if she gets out of the house alive anymore then the rest of them. Busta Rhymes has his moments, but you can't let him carry this movie with Michael alone. So, I guess what I'm saying is this, good idea, bad presentation. 6 out of 10, only because this Michael is more believable then \"H20's\". Let's make \"Halloween 9\" a little better than this, but better than the derailment of \"Haloween III, 4, 5, and 6\".",

It's dark, even a tad bit spooky, and highly reminiscent of part 2 (which was also directed by Rick Rosenthal).  We're watching as Michael Myers is stalking the long hallways of a hospital for the mentally insane.  We see him make quick work of the security guards.  We know who he's after: Laurie Strode. He finds Jamie Lee and chases her out onto the roof, slowly hunting his prey.  And then he kills her.  Woohoo!!  He finally got the b*tch.  Okay, now turn the movie off.  Trust me, turn it off.  It's okay.  Or don't listen to me and watch this miserable excuse for a Halloween movie.  You could possibly argue that I didn't like H20 because I'm simply a purist of the series.  You cannot make that argument for Halloween: Resurrection.  It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  There's no point to the movie.  First off, he's killed Jamie Lee, he has no more purpose.  He's no longer hunting his family and I no longer care.  Now, maybe the character name Moyer will turn out to actually be Myer in the next installment (if there is one), but for now it doesn't hold water.  Even if it did, how many unknown family members can one guy have.  Secondly, the entire storyline is dumb.  I don't want to see any of this cliched Blair Witch Project stuff; it's a Halloween movie!  You don't need it.  And lastly, it has Busta Rhymes kung-fu fighting Michael Myers.  I was soooo upset at this.  They turned Michael into a p*ssy.  I could go on and on, and onward still...but just read some of the other reviews.

See what I mean.Over all a step down from H20, but right on par for the series over all. Resurrection is an apt title as it brings back series vet director Rick (Halloween 2) Rosenthal. He knows the tricks and is ready to employ them. Sadly, this old dog is lacking in new treats.An internet video site wants to set up a Halloween night web-cast from the abandoned Myers house. They enlist the services of several fresh young faces to explore the house and uncover it's \"secrets\". This would happen to be the unfortunate evening that Michael returns home. Needless to say, a body-count ensues.Interms of how the film is shot, Rosenthal employs some nifty camera switches; cutting back and forth from the omnipresent audience view and the cameras set up for the fictional web-cast. It's a nice touch to the overall look of the film. Were he falters is in the scare set-ups. He uses every trick you've ever seen before in a slasher; some of the set-ups are lifted strait off of the original Halloween and H20. As such, the film is never as scary as it ought to be.On a more positive note, the cast is more likable than the usual cannon-fodder. The females especially come off very well and the men manage to be less obnoxious than slasher fans have come to expect.The whole package is worth a view. It's better than about 90% of the slashers on the market these days, but it never hits the horrific heights that this series is known for.7/10",

Later on, a group of college students are gathered to partake in a reality show where they have to survive in Michael's house. They have no idea he will show up. Aside from the bad beginning, the whole movie really wasn't bad. I guess you could say it is like when somebody likes Hanson's song MMMBop. The acting is mostly bad and the people are dumb. However, the death scenes and suspense are good. Combine good deaths with bad acting and you will laugh. You wait and hope Michael will kill everybody and are happy when he does. He is really cool in this. Also, I found the house and general filming to be pretty good. I was very impressed to see how spooky the house looked and how good the filming techniques worked.

One of my favorites, but it's still flawed to death. It's rumored that Carpenter had to do a lot of re-shoots to try and salvage something from Rosenthal's shoddy work. This should have told us something. Rosenthal just showed his lack of talent for directing. He had a good premise and blew it.

There are many other more interesting dvd's out there that I should have watched before getting around to this one: \"Traffic Lights - A History in black and white\", \"The Art of Watching Paint Dry - Part 2\" or the classic \"Toe Clippings - A Collectors guide\". All of these would have been preferable to having to endure such intelligence-insulting rubbish as this.I am now obliged to write \"SPOILER\" in large capitals, so I don't give anything important away. But I really shouldn't have to...1. Michael Myers is not dead. Plausibility Factor: 8/10. So far so good...2. Laurie actually killed a pre-(Semi)strangled security guard in H20. Plausibility Factor: 4/10. Oh dear.3. Michael Kills Laurie in (almost) the first reel of the film. Plausibility Factor: 3/10. And sliding...4. Busta Rhymes is the hero. Plausibility Factor: 1/10. And, yes, it CAN (and does) get worse.5. Michael is still not dead at the end of this movie. Plausibility Factor: 10/10. Aaahh. That's better.Take your average horror film IQ, halve it, then divide by 4, then subtract the average age of your expected viewer demographic and you'll be close to the number of brain cells used while pitching this idea to the studio. Halve it again and that's about how many seconds it took the studio to split their sides laughing at the idea before cashing the cheque.\nIt also seems that the makers of Halloween Resurrection have had to sink to an even lower level: Copying Friday the 13th movies! Note the Jason style head-squeeze and the scene where Myers is hanged/hung/whatever. Pure Friday the 13th Part 3. Perhaps Michael will come back in the next film wearing a hockey mask...One final note: The 5-10 minute scene with the mobile phone and e-mailed warnings was actually surprisingly good (If under-used).

I certainly didn't find the premise appealing (bunch of kids spending the night in the Myers house as part of a reality TV programme). But Halloween:Resurrection was a pleasant surprise. The original Halloween movie was a horror masterpiece. The sequel was also very good. Halloween 3 had a different plot so I won't comment on that. Halloweens 4 and 5 were okay but nothing to shout about. Halloween 6 was mediocre. Halloween H20 was a fantastic movie easily on par with the original. This movie was awesome.It is possibly the most violent of the series but it isn't all gore. There are a few shocks as well and it is interesting. Michael really seems to creep up unawares each time just like in the original. This Michael Myers was just like the one from the original film-SCARY!Throughout the Halloween series we have learnt little bits about the man behind Michael. Throughout the movies, there have been hints as to why Michael is the way he is and hints about what motivates him. There are a few in this movie too. I don't think it would ever be right to make Michael fully human but at the expense of sounding ridiculous, I think we have gotten a closer look at Michael's soul throughout the series and I hope the next film explores it a bit more. Character development in film series are important-even when dealing with 'demons' like Michael Myers. It also made me think more about life. When we see murderers on TV news programmes, we tend to judge them. In no way can murder ever be condoned or justified as it is wrong to take another persons life. Anyone who does take a life should be punished but this film made me wonder about why people become murderers? What motivates them and could things have been different if a murderers life had turned out differently? I never usually scrutinize films in this way but Halloween:Resurrection did get me thinking about things.\nHalloween:Resurrection was a pleasant surprise. I look forward to Halloween 9.",

Of course, it is not without faults, especially in terms of cinematography, (as every time the camera switches to the point of view of the \"Live\" internet camera's the quality of the picture decreases and turns grainy and almost unwatchable), and in relation to rebooting the events of the previous film via unnecessary exposition and a completely not-believable situation. However, I really think this was the only way of making another installment to the series without creating a full reboot or remake, and the filmmakers really redeem themselves after that weak set up.\nThe film is paced really well, it has some tremendous suspense, amazingly gripping and chilling scenes (such as Busta Rhyme's one on one encounter with Michael Myers, both with the mask on or Michael Myers' second murder by attacking a victim through a mirror), it stays low on the cheap scares, and makes it work by setting its story within the internet world of the early 2000's, complete with instant texting, live internet reality TV, and much more.\nMichael Myers is as menacing as ever, and Busta Rhymes, the main protagonist, becomes Michael Myers the first worthy adversary in the history of the film franchise, beating him mercilessly without the need for any tranquilizer or firearm.\nThe film is wildly entertaining and it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. In short, the filmmakers found a way to create a new refreshing version instead of yet another overly formulaic sequel. One of the best Halloween films ever made.",

I mean, the first one was good, I'll give them that, and Halloween H20 was pretty okay... but this... bleugh... I think what stunk most about this film was not only the ridiculous plot, but the dialogue was unintentionally hilarious . I can't remember the last time I laughed during a scene where someone was being brutally murdered.\n***SPOILERS***Okay, so the writers thought up a way to bring back Micheal Myers (and I have to say... ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!). Apparently, that WASN'T him that got his head chopped off in H20... oh no it wasn't... in a Hannibal Lector style face swappy thingy, it was actually a police officer wearing his white mask. Aha!! And we have a film ladies and gentlemen! A crappy one at that! And guess what? You know what else they're going to do? They're going to get a big group of actors in their late 20's to play some teenagers staying in Micheal Myers' house! And there you have it. The entire plot in one sentence. That's what you get.So, you have a group of teenagers staying in Micheal Myers' house making a 'documentary'. Hmmm... guess they couldn't think of any other excuse to get a couple of teens hacked up. They've all ready done the baby sitter thing, just put them in his house with some cameras, and there you go! A plot! Kind of... The only decent scene in this film is the part where one of the 'kids' dresses up like Micheal Myers to scare the others, and the real one is walking behind him through the house. Both funny and a bit confusing there for a second... although not enough to save the movie.\nWhat got me the most was the scene where that guy was talking to himself in the mirror (or whatever he was doing - I don't really want to think about it) and Micheal shot through the mirror and killed him. Erm, excuse me, is the entire house sound proof or something? How did no-one hear that? And Micheal has got to be God or something - apparently being hacked at numerous times by a chainsaw, thrown out the window, stabbed, hit over the head and set on fire doesn't kill a man nowadays...This wasn't even scary either - the first one and H20 had it's jumpy moments, but this one you could see the so-called scary moments a mile off. Who couldn't predict that girl getting it when she went behind that wall into his 'secret' place or whatever it was? They might as well have put up a neon sign that said \"Death this way >>> \"Basically, I think the writers should have quit while they were ahead with H20 - left the damn thing dead.",

Of course, the only reason it is held in such high regard is because it was a novelty. Nowadays, if a film like this comes out, it is filled with \"cliches\".HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION has a bad opening. The beginning sequence and explanation as to how Michael Meyers survived it totally rediculous and is not very far from the dumbest thing I have ever heard in a movie. Jamie Lee Curtis who supposedly liked the script looks like she is high on drugs during her scenes and her acting abilities look like they worsen with age. The beginning is just bad, bad, bad, bad.The story is very good, on the other hand. I like the whole concept and the characters are very likeable. The credit sequence notes a \"special appearance by Sean Patrick Thomas\". Well, I don't see what's so damn special about his role. He is a main character like everyone else and there is nothing special about his appearance in the film. Busta Rhymes tries his best to be very 'action hero' and screams things like \"trick or treat motherf***a!\" and \"happy f***in' halloween\" and he runs around like he is a complete badass. I like it. A lot of his scenes were funny.Other cast members are potentially there just to die. Whenever you think someone is going to die, their either die now or they survive that situation, move on and get killed a few minutes later. HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION packs on a lot of those kind of scenes. Daisy McCrackin, Luke Kirby, and Katee Sackhoff take some of the better roles as some of the more diverse characters in this mess.I must admit, I liked this movie to a degree. The film is very, very, very, very cliched and keeps the story simple and traditional. It is just not a good movie. I liked it. HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION gets 3/5.-This is evolution: the monkey, the man, and then the gun.",

Well then he hunts down his sister Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is now in the loony bin to kill her. These opening minutes in a dark loony bin are actually very good, Jamie Lee is outstanding again as Laurie Strode, and the atmosphere that director Rick Rosental presents in outstanding.  *SPOLIER* Then good old Mike kills Laurie and the movie becomes a lame Blair Witch Project copy after that. My main reaction to this movie is that killie Laurie was a mistake because the movie actually is pretty good when she was in it, after that it turns to ville brainless crap. Maybe they should have taken John Carpenter up on his offer to write and direct the final instalment of this mess, and do all of us a huge favor.  There is clearly gonna be another one of these movies and they have killed the most fascinating relationship in slasher films, Laurie and Michael were a classic without them the movie just like parts 3-6 are pure drivel.

Halloween:Resurrection (it's not really a resurrection because Michael Myers never died) starts with everyone's favorite scream queen confronting Michael for one sad, final time. We are then introduced to a group of teens who are selected to spent he night in the childhood house of Michael Myers and have it broadcasted live over the internet on Halloween night.  Needless to say, after offing Laurie Strode (his lifetime ambition) Michael returns home and is not a bit happy to find these pesty kids intruding his home.  That is where the murder and mayhem begins.  Each of the characters are stalked and slashed on the live webcam broadcast via \"The Blair Witch\" style.  I found this movie to be incredibly gory, which surprised me with how strict the rating system has become.  The sound is excellent and there are some genuinely creepy moments.  Let's face it, nothing will ever live up to the original, but this is a well directed, honest effort.  Really, the only complaint I have is the performance of the lead heroine, Bianca Kiljach towards the end of the film.  Her fear is not believable for me and the ways she delivers her lines during the chainsaw fight is almost laughable.  Other than that, a solid effort that will past about 90 minutes.

No matter how hard it tries to be creative, modern, and self-referential, the movie self-combusts. \"Halloween Resurrection\" bankrupted the \"Halloween\" franchise of creativity so much so that Dimension Films' only recourse was to reboot the series in remakes in order to continue collecting money from Michael Myers' profitability.

Turns out Jamie Lee (who's character is disappointingly dropped after only a few minutes) chopped off the wrong guy's head at the conclusion of the last chapter paving the way for Mike to stop by his old haunts.  The murders are blase (he only carries a butcher knife) and the point-of-view shots of the characters gets very annoying.

This has got to be the most stupidest horror film I have ever seen(on TV one Saturday afternoon to be precise). With a bunch of flat, uninteresting characters whom I didn't give a rats ass if they lived or died, I didn't care for the whole film either. It's not enough that the actors suck but putting celebrities in a horror movie?!?!?!?! How freaking stupid is that? Are they expecting us to believe that they can deliver a good acting performance? Well, they failed miserably at that and I'm glad GLAD for that. The funniest part of the whole film is Busta Rhymes going all Bruce Lee on Michael Myers in one of the most laughably stupid and illogical pieces of \"comedy\" in film history. Busta kicks Myers out of a window? HAHAHAHAHA!!!! I would love to do that to the makers of this film.",

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection takes place 3 years after H20. It is discovered that Laurie Strode beheaded the wrong man, and Michael Myers is still on the loose. Michael ends up finally killing Laurie, and the story moves on. A group of eager college kids join a reality web cast to spend the night in the house of Michael Myers. Unbeknownst to them, Michael is living under the house, and he doesn't want them there. This sequel sucks because it doesn't even fit in with the rest of the movies. Every movie was about Michael Myers' quest to kill all of his family members and those who get in his way. Nothing happens in this movie that's important, except he finally kills Laurie, which was a BIG mistake. The rest of this movie is filler. Michael Myers killing people just to make the audience cheer. And the audience doesn't cheer, trust me.The acting in this movie sucks. It features the corniest acting I've ever seen on film this side of Friday the 13th Part VII. Busta Rhymes lacks any acting talent whatsoever. Every time he opens his mouth a stupid line comes out, and it's actually annoying. I also hated how his character knew karate just from watching kung fu movies, and he beats the crap out of Michael Myers. I have to say though, the reason this movie gets a 3 instead of a 1 is because it had one memorable scene where Michael is facing Busta Rhymes dressed as Michael, and Busta Rhymes mistakes Michael Myers for someone in his staff, and he reams Michael out. It gives you a bit of a laugh. The female lead in this movie lacked everything needed for a female lead in this type of role. She wasn't a good actress. She was completely unable to react to situations.You might as well just skip this Halloween movie since it has nothing to do with the rest of the series and probably won't be mentioned in any subsequent sequel.3/10",

There was also some stupid scenes like when Busta Rhymes managed to kick Michael Myers through the window. I liked the first part when Michael was searching for Laurie and he killed her. But the stupidest thing about this movie is the ending of Halloween H20. Michael switched bodies with a paramedic and strangled him until he broke his voice box but Laurie slammed him through the windscreen of the van she was driving and when the paramedic got up, he just waited there and didn't move out of the way! But this gets worse, when Laurie rolled the van down the hill and the van ended up slamming Michael against a chopped down tree and the paramedic was still alive!

The very idea of playing death and the subsequent first-person show look interesting, but the implementation itself is lame and in the end we get Halloween: Resurrection which was crushed by critics, and for the audience it came out a very weak average quality film.",

What is confusing is Laurie Strode tries unmasking Michael Myers to confirm his identity, wait a second didn't he break into your room five minutes before trying to kill you? The Halloween story centers around the Myers house and at least this movie tries to recreate the house closely to the original. In almost all the sequels the Myers house isn't even close to the original house. Seems trivial but John Carpenter went a long way with a shoestring budget, these other studios with much bigger budgets didn't even try to make the house look like the original.The lead character in this movie is likable and you want her to survive most of the other characters you could care less about, but like the original movie you had someone to root for.

Outside of Curtis, I knew no one, and frankly believe they'll never amount to anything anyway. Though I understand the first 10 minutes were there to establish a link between this piece of trash and H20 -- I disliked it tremendously. The set up -- a bunch of mindless students share Micheal Myer's house on Halloween with cameras in every room, and no one on the outside sees anything weird until well into the third reel. It is sad that such a great franchise has finally -- and again -- scrapped the creative bottom of the peanut butter jar. I rented this for a buck, along with some good movies.

After all the Hellraiser series is also reviving with the releases of both H5: Inferno and H6: Hellseeker so there's no reason why the Halloween series couldn't take a turn for the better.The start of the movie actually got me excited but after the first 20 minutes or so the quality of the plot dropped rapidly. Resurrection's plots exploits 2 completely different ideas. On the one hand it tries to make some sort of ethical statement about reality-TV and the TV-stations who are exploiting people for pure profit, on the other hand Rick Rosenthal just tried to put in as much gore as possible to keep the fans happy. The plot stays very superficial throughout the movie and for those who have watched their fair share of slasher movies it isn't hard to predict the outcome of the movie when you're not even halfway trough it.The man with the white mask has a lot of screentime in this one which isn't bad at all. Without his regular appearance you wouldn't be able to know if you were watching Resurrection,Scream 4 or I still,still know what you did last summer ! The whole movie is just an average teenage horror movie. Scream was exciting but after all the ripoffs and spinoffs we have seen it all. Teenage horror is just as dead as it was before Scream's release and the fans are desperately waiting for some fresh ideas.The cast is young,enthusiastic and trying to make the best of it except for Busta Rhymes, who is the perfect example that not all rappers are also good actors. His performance is an absolute joke; was it that hard to find somebody with at least some talent ?Those who are looking for some easy entertainment can't go wrong with this movie. There are body-parts,enough blood and a few twists to keep those who are new to the genre on the edge of their seat. The diehard fan will be disappointed however and it's once more the proof that legends like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees have become pure cash-cows for Hollywood. I can only advise the people who plan to spent cash on this one to look around carefully if they can't find any of the true slasher-classics (from the 80's) before you take Resurrection to the checkout-counter.",

Of course, his sister Laurie, the psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis, his niece Jamie, and neighborhood boy Tommy. The three most vital of those characters are now dead and we were left with Bustah Rhymes to duel with Michael Myers??? GIVE ME A BREAK! The writers and producers of this wretched film have slapped all of the true Halloween fans across the face. They seriously messed with horror history here in favor for Bustah Rhymes and all the other dreadful actors/characters in this film. Halloween: Resurrection was not made for the fans, it was made for the studio.

            "content": "Well here it is. The long-waited 7th sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 classic about an escaped mental patient searching for his sister on Halloween night. Over the past 10 years I have watched the series grow from a simple indie horror flick to a complex epic horror story. For me, Halloween was the perfect horror film series from I & II to 4-6. Then in 1998 came Halloween: Twenty Years Later(I choose not to acknowledge that ridiculous H20 part), a decent yet disappointing sequel that broke the continuing storyline we had and tried to get us to believe that 4-6 didn't happen.That doesn't mean that things couldn't be fixed in a later sequel, so I had hope for 8. From 1999-2001 Dimension put the film together and several different ideas came across and then were dropped or debunked as rumor. Finally on July 12, 2002 it hit theatres. Today me, my dad, and two of my friends went in to see this film. I was really excited especially after having seen the cool trailers many times. Now here it, my review of Rick Rosenthal's Halloween: Resurrection...!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER OR 2!!!Plot:3 Years have passed since Laurie Strode decapitated the man whom she thought was her brother, infamous serial killer Michael Myers. Turns out Myers switched clothes with a paramedic, crushed his windpipe, and left. Laurie was locked up in a sanitarium and now Michael has found her. After finally ridding himself of his sister, he returns to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill off any other surviving relatives. However, he learns that 8 people are locked up in his house holding a live webcast. There they will search for clues as to why Myers does what he does. Michael doesn't like this idea, so he locks himself in with these people and kills them one by one.The good:A pretty good pace through most of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis, Bianca Kajilch, Brad Loree, and Ryan Merriman give good performances. The whole webcast things is pulled off really well, so the story is pretty good. We also get some great kill scenes, and a great dark atmosphere to go along with all of it. Not to mention a pretty good score.The bad:Aside from the actors I mentioned above, the rest of the cast is forgettable and I could care less about them. The pace does lag at times, but not for a big part of the movie. There is no character development or suspense whatsoever. That's not te worst thing about it though. The #1 one bad hing about this film is that like H20 it tries to get us to believe that 4-6 never happened, but it doesn't completely erase them eighther. Oh and two more things: What's with the connection between Sara and Miles? It doesn't go anywhere and is not needed. Finally we get a lame explanation for why Michael was supposedly missing for 20 years, but I won't spoil that one for you.Overall:Despite it's flaws, Resurrection is a pretty good addition to the Halloween series, but is still nowhere near as good as parts 1-6.\n***1/2 out of *****",

Killing of Laurie Strode the way they did was stupid and very disrespectful to the character.\nI think the movie would been better they set in the hospital and Michael was hunting Laurie all the way through movie and kills her at the end that would been awesome.\nBecause untill he kills her that opening scene is really effective and really well done he's dark and definitely feels more like Halloween.\nAlso the Michael looks in this movie is garbage he and in my opinion the worst he has looked in the franchise in my opinion.\nBuster Rhymes sucks he just sucks he made of Michael Myers and that's just something you do not do the martial arts scene is just laughable and so cheesy.Apart from that I do have fun with this movie it's definitely a guilty pleasure and I do respect it for doing something different in the franchise getting Michael away from killing his family members and him being getting back to killing random victims was a bold move that I respect and enjoy its alot of fun.\nThere some cool kills and the scenes in the house are really interesting bringing in the found footage was different for the franchise at the time and I respect them for trying it.Now I do like the way bring Michael back the fact that it wasn't him in the mask which if you watch H20 it does sort of hint at when he touched his face looks like he's scared so it makes sense that he swapped masks with someone and got away I like that.My favourite scene in the film is In the opening when Michael gives that mental paitent his knife and he explains who Michael and says now he's come back and the music plays it's always been a bad ass scene Michael looks bad ass when he's walking away.Verdict 7.1/10 has a lot of problems but definitely a fun movie and a guilty pleasure in the Halloween Franchise.

            "content": "It is so sad to see that the Halloween has bogged down into a never ending story of bad film making.After the highly praised and indeed brilliant first installment by John Carpenter the film have gone from reasonably okay (part 2), to bad and even worse (the next sequels although I must say that I've never seen part 6).No it has never been good news since 1978 when Michael Myers is concerned and that's a pity.The first film that had all the great stuff a good slasher should have (except maybe for the supernatural ending) was never equaled,not even close.Even part 3 that tried to give a new non-Michael tail to the story was pretty disappointing if you ask me.Not to mention the stories with Michael's niece.H20 brought back Laurie but with no good effect although we all thought that Michael was dead by now (hey,his head got chopped off).In Halloween:Resurrection (lame title) the first thing we hear is that Laurie killed the wrong person cause Michael put his mask on a father of 3,poor Laurie now she is a killer.In the opening she is again stalked by Michael who tries to kill her and seems to succeed when he stabs poor Laurie several times after we see Laurie fall down (but is she really dead,that's something for everybody to discuss about,I'm not really sure).Anyway,in the rest of the movie she won't be bothered again.The rest of the film is an unmotivated and uninspired follow up of badly shot death and mayhem in Michael's old house in Haddonfield.The attempt by Rick Rosenthal (who actually made the first sequel) to recreate some of the tension and atmosphere of the original fails entirely because of the bad story,bad cinematography and bad acting.The story is full of flaws (why does he go on killing after Laurie's death what he sincerely believes and why can he simply kill people without anyone noticing it on the web cams,it's too accidental),the cinematography is not any better (the small cameras make for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience and the slow motions are very annoying not to mention the full view shots of Michael as he comes storming towards someone,which is totally against the great first person view of the original) and the acting is inert especially by Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes although the rest of the cast isn't much better.The characters are too standard to give any depth.No,this Halloween installment again fails to compete with the original or with any good or even decent horror movie for that matter.Myers becomes more and more some kind of immortal godlike (or Satan) creature who refuses to die as we also see in the ending of this movie sadly enough.Another sequel seems to come although thanks goodness none has arrived yet,maybe Hollywood has come to senses and Michael laid to rest.Poor Michael (or poor Laurie) does not deserve another hellish Halloween sequel.",

No, that's an understatement, it's a terrible film. It is so full of horror cliches that it's as if \"Scream\" was never made. Halloween Ressurection follows the rules set in \"Scream\" exactly: Those who have sex die, take drugs etc. die. This could be forgiven if the film was actually scary, but it's not. There is one scare at the start, but from then on it is so obvious what is going to happen, that the film quickly loses all credibility. And the ending is unbelievably predictable, and in the end gives the audience the scariest thought: That there will be ANOTHER Halloween film. There are a few redeaming features, such as the Blair Witch style cameras and the homage to Pulp Fiction, but it cannot be forgiven for it's stereotypical nature. 1 out of 5.",

            "content": "\"Halloween: H20\" was as natural a conclusion as the series could ask for. It, also, made lots of money. Naturally, another sequel had to made, even if it meant undoing a satisfying ending. The public demanded more Michael Myers, they got more Michael Myers.\"Halloween: Resurrection\" spends its opening minutes undoing that satisfying ending. Which isn't easy. Michael was super-dead at the end of \"H20.\" In order to get around that, the screenwriters cooked up an absurd solution. Michael Myers has always been a thoughtless force of nature. The opening retcons the previous ending by having Myers suddenly develop a sense of cunning. He switches places with a paramedic, making sure to crush the guy's larynx so he can't scream, and walks off, leaving Laurie to murder an innocent man. This contradicts 24 years of history. The manslaughter causes Laurie to crack, placing her in the loony bin. This is conveniently explained by two nurses. After three years of twiddling his thumbs I guess, Mikey tracks his sis down. The final-final confrontation between brother and sister is underwhelming. Laurie ensnares the Shape with a remote-control pulley she set-up at some point. Once again defying characterization, Michael tricks Laurie into (stupidly) stepping into his kill radius, ending their sibling rivalry forever. Because the movie hadn't trampled over his personality enough all ready, Myers makes friends with a fellow inmate before walking off. Jaime Lee Curtis only returned so she could die, insuring no involvement with future sequels. This is very obvious. She sleepwalks through her five minutes of screen time.Despite conceiving an ending even more final then the previous final ending, \"Halloween: Resurrection\" continues onward. Two internet reality television moguls dream up an event, a group of photogenic college students left in the abandoned Myers house with camera's strapped to their heads. Their experiences are streamed over the internet, despite this being 2002, when high-speed internet wasn't widely used. Michael shows up, of course, slashing his way through the generic slasher bait. He spends most of the movie standing in the shadows, waiting for his queue. The life of a slasher must be so ho-hum\u0085 When I say generic, I mean it. The characters of \"Halloween: Resurrection\" are by-far its worse attribute. Bianca Kajilch's Sara is the virginal final girl, shy, reserved, and an attentive student. Best friend Jen, played by pre-fame Katee Sackoff, is her bubble-headed best friend. If this had been made in the eighties, we definitely would have seen her boobs. Speaking of boobs, redhead Donna pretends to be smart but is your typical slasher movie slut. She bangs a guy she's known a few hours and thinks a dusty basement is an ideal romantic spot. Jim, who has no further development beyond \"the horny guy,\" goes for it. Bill fills the obnoxious prankster role and, thankfully, dies early. Token black guy Rudy seems reasonable but even he lights up a bong for no reason. You'd think a post-\"Scream\" film wouldn't partake in clich\u00e9s. Such blatant throwbacks might have been charming if it had been intentional. No, \"Halloween: Resurrection\" is just badly written.Those characters are thin and terrible. They're not the worse. Busta Rhymes plays Freddie Harris, the man behind \"Dangertainment.\" Rhyme is obviously not a trained actor. He mugs furiously and it gets worse the longer on camera he is. He shouts all his dialogue in a macho brogue. Early on, he watches a kung-fu movie in his hotel room. This is meant to set up a later scene where he ninja-kicks Michael Myers through a window. As big as an indignity as that would be for a once-feared horror villain, \"Resurrection\" goes lower. Freddie returns to save the day and puts the monster down. How? He shocks him in the balls with a live-wire. Rhymes destroys every scene he's in. I hope he ad-libbed lines likes \"Trick or treat, muthaf**ka!\" or \"Like some chicken-fried motherf**ker!\" No screenwriter deserves the indignity of writing dialogue like that. Terrible human being Tyra Banks plays another terrible human being, one who ignores someone being murdered on camera twice. At least the movie has the good sense to kill her.The movie can't even get Myers right. Yeah, he looks okay. The mask is a better sequel example, though the hair is still off. However, the killer's behavior is completely wrong. He puts a knife down in the heat of the moment to kill a dude with his hands. After stabbing someone, he gets more knives just to decorate the corpse. Most egregiously, he lets Busta boss him around in a scene that recalls \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy.\" At this point, I can only assume that Michael truly did die at the end of \"H20\" and this character is an impostor. That makes more sense.The high-tech angle rarely comes into play but still ends up being one of the movie's better attributes. A group of partiers watching the live feed recreate slasher movie audience. They yell at the people on-screen and cheer at the death scenes. Sara's internet boyfriend texts her helpful hints. These might have been comments on slasher movie formula. If they were, any further commentary is lost amidst the sea of clich\u00e9s.Part 2's Rick Rosenthal returns to the director's chair. Any talent Rosenthal might have is over edited, as \"Resurrection\" features grainy flashbacks and flashing white lights. Danny Lux's score is generic though makes good use of Carpenter's original theme. John earned his musical royalty check on this one. The movie is packed full of lame jump scares and unintentional hilarity. For these reasons and more, it is the worse \"Halloween\" film, outpacing even part six. Six was a mess but its badness was ambitious and audacious. \"Resurrection\" is boring, lazy, stupid, and pointless.",

            "content": "*** SPOILERS *** I've enjoyed many of the Halloween movies, especially the first one.  I saw H20 back when it came out and thought it was a good way to end the series. H20 satisfied the following...Michael Myers met his doom.  An ending which completely wraps up the saga with Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers. \nNow comes this film which, literally, lies to the viewer.  There is really no other way to put it.  To say Michael Myers was not killed at the end of H20, that it was somehow another man who survived being pinned against a tree at high speed, is tantamount to the most foolish storyline I can imagine.  Not so much because it is ridiculous but because it's a complete lie.  The film was ruined for me right there.  I couldn't believe the writers actually expected the audience to believe such a thing.  A total insult the audience's intelligence.The rest of the film just never worked for me.  Busta Rhymes.  Man, I don't know what to say.  Worst actor of the year award?  And the whole reality TV angle with all the Myer props in the house, which had nothing to do with Michael Myer's real childhood, was absurd as well.  Just a bad, bad storyline.  I read an interview with John Carpenter a long time ago which stated he never wanted a single sequel made with Michael Myers.  The first movie back in 1978 was it.  A great open ending but the Michael Myers story was complete.  Carpenter actually wanted other writers to write stories under the name \"Halloween\" each year with different characters and story lines each time.  It is past time for that to happen.Please.....No more Michael Myers.  The man is gone...Dead in H20.  Burn this installment of the Halloween series and start with a fresh story line.",

            "content": "I'm really starting to think Moustapha Akkad is losing it in his old age. First he gives us HALLOWEEN: H20, a sequel that insults us by asking us to ignore the events of HALLOWEENs 4-6 and is more like SCREAM 4 than HALLOWEEN. Then he gives us HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, which seems more concerned at being BLAIR WITCH 3 than HALLOWEEN. Thanks to screenwriter Larry Brandt, gone are the intriguing characters and any attempt at continuity. Films 4-6 steadily built up a solid story that was continued and built upon further by each subsequent film, something not every horror series can claim. There were characters intent on discovering the secret of Michael Myers and how to (if at all) stop him, and there were characters you cared about and found yourself rooting for. Here, we're given a bunch of characters who just want to make some quick bucks by staying the night in Myers' house.The characters are all paper-thin, whereas even in the previous films (except for H20) we had strong characters. Here, everyone just hangs around waiting to get hacked, in death scenes that seem more like FRIDAY THE 13TH than HALLOWEEN. For the most part, the actors are unknowns in stock roles--they're able to scream and shout on cue--but that's about it. Busta Rhymes wasn't quite as bad as I was expecting him to be, but he seems to have been cast more because of his own popularity than anything else. Tyra Banks, also, is cast simply to draw a crowd, and she really does nothing but sit in front of a bank of computer monitors and drink coffee for most of the film.There are some minor highlights, but not many. Brad Loree does an excellent job of playing Michael Myers the way he should be, making up for the awful Chris Durand interpretation in H20. The mask is about as close to the original as we're likely to get, but still has some problems with it, mostly a little too much hair and the fact we can see his eyes, a part of him that was very rarely seen in the previous films and helped generate a lot of mystery. But he has the menacing walk down perfect. Danny Lux's musical score returns to what made the previous films' scores work, by underlining the on-screen events instead of highlighting, like with John Ottman's overblown H20 score. And the atmosphere is terrific. As he did with HALLOWEEN 2 twenty-one years ago, director Rick Rosenthal brings a great sense of atmosphere to the film that menacingly exploits pools of light and shadow, and several shots of Myers hiding in the dark are truely creepy images. The sequence involving the one girl finding Michael's lair in the sewer underneath the house is very nicely filmed. So the film at least looks nice, which is not something that can be said about H20. And the Myers house itself, from the outside, has been recreated very much like the original, though the interior is (to fans) noticeably messed up.But for the most part, it was another failed attempt. I fear the glory days of the HALLOWEEN series--when they had characters you liked and stories that were simple yet helped the films develop more than other horror series--is over, having ended with HALLOWEEN 6, and now the films are turning into just pail SCREAM wannabes. The rights should be taken away from the Weinstein brothers and given to an independent company, like some of the previous ones, a company that will respect the fans and the previous films in the series.",

            "content": "Halloween H20: 20 Years Later ended up being the best of the sequels in the Halloween saga. Around the release of H20, the horror industry was in an interesting time. Scream had reinvigorated the slasher (and horror in general) film at the box office. Horror movies were making money and doing well and being talked about. But unlike the original era of slasher films, where they dominated the box office for over a decade, the slasher as king didn't last nearly as long.In 1999, one movie came out that reshaped the face of horror. And like the original Halloween in 1978, it was a low budget independent film that went on to break box office records. This movie was The Blair Witch Project and it scared audiences to the tune of $140,000,000, an unheard of number for the type of film it was.Blair Witch was a found footage, faux documentary horror film. The camera was hand held and shaky and was controlled by the characters in the film. It was shot on film and video and it had a simple story. And like 1978's Halloween, it had no gore, no special effects, a simple story and about an hour and a half of sheer terror. That's not to say the slasher film didn't play it's part at the movies. A new Friday the 13th (although now they were 'Jason' movies) film was released, a third Scream came out and a new original slasher style film came out called Final Destination. Horror was doing well and on July 12th, 2002 Halloween returned to the big screen.Halloween: Resurrection follows the continuing story of H20, and like that film it ignores parts four to six. It turns out that Laurie had chopped off the wrong person's head, not Michael's. Technically this doesn't make sense based on the behaviour of the man behind the mask in the last 10 minutes of H20, but as a Halloween fan, sitting in the audience, one can let it go.Resurrection goes on to wrap up the story of Michael and his sister and introduces a new story line. Michael returns home to Haddonfield, to his house and finds a reality game show being filmed there. Hence he has to knock off the people in his house, one by one and in increasingly gruesome ways. The reality game show allows for Resurrection to throw in a bit of a Blair Witch influence. Each character in the house gets their own camera and thus the view switches back and forth between shaky, video style footage and nicely framed, smooth film footage.This makes for an interesting idea, and some cool scenes with Michael making his way through the halls and not being noticed by anyone except the audience, but overall Resurrection fails as a movie. First and foremost it fails because it is not scary. Myers himself works pretty well, he seems looming and scary, he walks the right way and he has the creepy head tilt, but once again he no longer looms in the background for very long. He's always clearly visible and ready to strike. Technically, for Resurrection's given story, this makes sense, but it doesn't work for the scare factor.Like Halloween II, this film is directed by Rick Rosenthal. When he made part two he had taken Michael Myers and made him less of a realistic monster. He made the second Halloween a film filled with jump scares and didn't capture the tension that the original did. And following H20, he does the same thing here. But it isn't only the lack of terror that makes Resurrection ultimately fail. The story is plain and generic (although the first 10 minutes with Jamie Leigh Curtis are pretty good) and the dialogue is pretty poor. Most of the actual dialogue sounds fake and expositional, where the characters instead of sounding like they are talking to each other end up having conversations that spell out the story for the audience.The acting for the most part is okay. The acting by the staff at the hospital is sub par but all the leads do a pretty decent job. Although his performance isn't bad, Busta Rhymes does end up sinking the movie some what. His character says some really stupid things and in one scene he does some really cheesy and out of place kung fu poses and noises before he drop kicks Michael Myers. What was Rosenthal thinking when he included that?Another really strange omission is a wide shot of the Myer's house. Although it sounds small, a wide shot to show the outside of the house would of helped the atmosphere of the film in many ways. For example, seeing the Myer's house in a wide shot, establishing to the audience that they were back to where it all began could of built up tension, but for some inexplicable reason, all the audience ever gets is interior shots and quick close ups of various outside features. The film is rather well shot, with great choreography and editing, especially when you take into account that in addition to the film cameras, there were the six or seven video cameras that were used throughout the film. So the film does flow nicely and never really leaves the audience bored. But when all is said and done, and the end credits start to roll, especially after H20, Halloween: Resurrection sadly end ups leaving one with a strong and overbearing feeling of disappointment.Film Rating: 64%Breakdown (How Halloween: Resurrection scored 64%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 7 out of 10 Re-playability: 6 out of 10 Originality: 6 out of 10 Costumes: 7 out of 10 Directing: 6 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Music: 7 out of 10 Script: 4 out of 10",

Although sequels were planned to follow HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, Dimension Films decided that it was best to later reboot the film series with Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 of the original HALLOWEEN film.The film is set three years after the last film with Laurie being put in a psychiatric hospital after mistakingly killing a doctor who she thought was her brother. Laurie sets a trap, but successfully, after twenty years of tracking her down, Michael eventually kills her.The following year, the movie goes from here. It continues with the masked serial killer Michael Myers continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield, but this time, in his old childhood home, now derelict, which is being used for a live internet horror show. Just like the last film, Halloween: Resurrection insists that the fourth, fifth and sixth installments are not canon.I don't hate this film, but I can see why other people do. I will not explain anything bad because everything about this movie is so great.The acting is fantastic, but I will say, I was sad that Laurie Strode was killed off at the beginning of this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is good in the screen time her character has and she does an incredible job in her last appearance as Laurie Strode.Bianca Kajlich plays Sara and she is amazing in this film. Daisy McCrackin plays Donna and she is just dreadful and she is the only one who does not try in this film. Luke Kirby, Katee Sackhofff, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Ryan Merriman and Sean Patrick Thomas are all good in this film and they deliver some good acting skills. Busta Rhymes in this film, a lot of people did hate, but I like him in this film, because he is funny as heck. Tyra Banks plays Nora and she does good in the screen time she has.Brad Loree plays Michael Myers in this film and he is just good, if not better than the other Michael Myers actors that has came before him.The musical score by Danny Lux is just phenomenal and iconic and he created a genuine score to the original film instead of generating something new. He goes crazy for this Halloween picture's musical score with an electro-acoustic feel that dates back to the synthesizer scores of the 1980's.The kills in this movie are way too out there in a few areas, but I can still manage to sit through this movie and still get some very good scares out of this film and really like this movie, unlike some fans and critics and audiences who won't take this film nicely, unlike some of the other \"Halloween\", \"FRIDAY THE 13th\" or \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" film sequels in those three franchises.Overall, I love HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, sure it is stupid, but there is a reason why I like this movie at all costs.8/10.",

Done right, it could be genuinely terrifying and memorable. Myers was always scariest when blending in with the background, only illuminated with brief flashes of light. If done right, it could have been one of the best entries in the franchise. Unfortunately, much like Rob Zombie in his Halloween remake 5 years later, the film wants to have things both ways; it wants the fourth wall breaking immersion and realism of found footage, but doesn't want to alienate its audience who want more big stars and less shaky cam. So, instead, the film is part found footage and mostly traditionally shot. Does this contribute to the themes? Does the benefit the story in any way? Is this important to the characters? Do I even have to answer these questions?When Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks are among the acting highlights of your movie, something is seriously wrong. I suppose Sean Patrick Thomas does a servicable job, but everyone else embarrasses themselves. Bianca Kajlich is one of the worst leading actresses I've ever seen in a Horror film, especially in the few scenes where she genuinely does try to act. Her \"badass\" moments near the end when confronting Michael Myers legitimately feel like something out of a sketch comedy show. I found myself leaning back in my chair every time she began to open her mouth. Thomas Ian Nicholas too, trying to prove that he can have a career beyond the American Pie movies and that you don't need to actually act-and-react if you have a nice smile. He fails at both of these, but at least he gets killed off quickly (In perhaps the only scene in the film that comes even close to genuine terror.)One thing that never seems to get brought up is how ugly this film is. I'm not talking about \"Rob Zombie ugly\", where it's an intentional stylistic choice. I'm talking bland and dirty and dark to the point where you can't see anything. I understand that a dark and shadowy atmosphere makes sense for a Halloween film, but the lighting in this film occasionally Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem levels of incompetent.If H20 wasn't proof enough that the Scream formula doesn't work for Halloween, Halloween: Resurrection ends the argument immediately. Comedy can work in a Nightmare on Elm Street film or a Friday the 13th film or even a Hellraiser film if done right. It does not work in a Halloween film. Halloween's thematic darkness and serious, adult stories are what set it apart from other slasher movies as a long running franchise. They had themes, they had commentary, they had characters that were made to be invested in. Halloween: Resurrection has none of that. It almost seems ashamed of being a Halloween film. It does, after all, kill off Laurie Strode in the most unmemorable and disrespectful way possible. A stab in the chest, a throw off a building and that's the end of Laurie Strode. One of the most iconic and enduring scream queens of all time going out like a fart in the wind. Without even the hint of an attempt from the screenwriters to find a genuine worthy replacement.I go back and forth on whether this or Halloween III: Season of the Witch marks the worst film in the Halloween franchise. For now, this one takes the urinal cake. While Halloween III was just a convoluted and deeply misguided mess from the very first draft, Halloween: Resurrection had potential. But that potential only makes the weight of its overall failure all the greater. That's the biggest sin of all.",

            "content": "Why do I keep watching slasher movies?  For nearly twenty years now I've been seeing basically the same movie.  Sure, the wardrobes change, but they're almost always filled with the same characters making the same stupid mistakes that are accompanied by the same scare tactics we've all seen a million times.  I'm beginning to curse that day in my twelfth year I bought a ticket to FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI - that was my first slasher, and I've been hooked ever since.  Sure, I may not see these in the theatre any more, but I still rent them all the time.  Hopefully, HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION will perhaps break this genre's hold on me; I'm getting tired of constantly questioning what I'm supposed to just accept in these movies.H20, the previous chapter in this series, was a wee bit better than average, with a satisfying ending; in my IMDb comments about it I wrote, \"I couldn't ask for a better conclusion; very chilling and appropriate (and it means they'll be no more sequels, I hope).\"  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I guess I deserve what I got.Let me understand how H:R picks up after H20.  That was a medic whom Jamie Lee decapitated at the end of H20?  His larynx was crushed, so he couldn't save himself?  Riiight.  Do EMTs usually zip victims up in body bags before checking for a heartbeat?  Why didn't the medic just remove the mask before Jamie Lee separated him from himself?Besides the opportunity to shoehorn Jamie Lee into H:R, I cannot see the reason for the prologue with her character in the hospital.  No mention is made of her son, or where this hospital is.  Is it in California (where H20 was set) or Illinois (where H:R takes place)?  Or is Haddonfield now like the Simpsons' Springfield, existing wherever the plot needs it to?  Cut out the pre-title sequence, and the movie improves.And I don't get Jamie Lee's final line - one that's got so many whiskers on it that I thought it'd been retired.  She says to Michael, \"See you in hell!\"  Why would her character, Laurie Strode, believe she's going to hell? This exit line is the lamest I've ever heard for such a long-running icon, and the writers should be ashamed of offing her in such a routine, blas\u00e9 and unceremonious way.  It was very disrespectful to both Jamie Lee and fans of the HALLOWEEN series.Moving on.  The plot of a horror sequel is of no consequence, so I'll ignore it for the most part in these comments; I'll just make note of other questions I pondered throughout this movie.  For example, I noticed that the email address of the heroine was \"Sara@HaddonU.org.\"  Just \"Sara\"?  Should we assume she's the only student at her school with that name?  Lucky her.\nIs the Myers house public property?  Who okayed this \"dangertainment\" to be webcasted from this house?  And wouldn't the police raise objections?Yeah, what about the police force in Haddonfield?  With all that's happened in this town over the years, one would think that the PD would be on extreme high alert every October 31, but they don't arrive at the Myers house until long after a 911 call; it took a deadly inferno that burned a building to the ground for them to respond.  If I lived in this town, I'd demand to know how my tax dollars were being spent.I'm also wondering why there was no reaction from the peanut gallery at the costume party to Henry Rowengartner's death.  It was clearly on camera; did the partiers take a mass bathroom break at that moment?I know, I know:  I shouldn't ask questions like this during these types of movies.  I was occasionally able to put my complaints aside and enjoy some of H:R.  Some of the suspense was actually pretty creative; I dug the idea of placing p.o.v. cameras on the actors, which produced some interesting shots.  The premise of the movie, unlikely as it may be, worked for the most part, as long as I didn't think too much about the logistics of it.As for the acting, the cast, with one exception, was adequate.  The one exception is, of course, Busta Rhymes. Why did the Razzies snub him?  Not since that bitch with the pearls in F13 PART VII have a wanted a horror movie character to die.  But did I get my wish?  Of course not.  Why, like LL Cool J in H20, does the has-been rapper survive?  When did B-level hip hop artists become our slasher saviors?  Weren't they usually the cute guys the heroines wanted to make out with?Maybe this was done intentionally, since H:R sometimes seems to mean HALLOWEEN: REVUE.  Although Parts 3-6 are ignored again, parts of this movie are lifted from the other sequels.  Besides the rapper/hero surviving Michael's wrath to reappear at a crucial point in the final showdown, we've got Michael burning up like he did in Part II.  Is this homage, self-plagiarism, coincidence or laziness?I hope that if they must make another sequel, they go back to PART 5 and explain what happened after that man in black broke Michael out of jail. Bring back Danielle Harris' character, and pick up the series from there. Or, hell, make a HALLOWEEN III PART II, detailing the aftermath of all those kids' bug-infested noggins.  H:R, while not the worst of the series (that dubious distinction goes to Part 6, THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS), has led it down a dead end.  It's time to again reimagine the franchise. And time for me to quit renting these movies.3/10",

After having Laurie escape death after numerous encounters over a twenty some odd year span it was quite heartbreaking to see her character meet her end, and such an unceremonious one at that.Once its established Laurie is dead and she's not coming back, there's really no reason to continue watching the film. The rest of the movie focuses on a group of teenagers who after winning a contest must spend the night in Michael Myers' childhood home while being broadcast on the Internet for the entire world to see.Among the weakest entries in the series, the only films worse than this are Rob Zombie's new remake and \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch\".

As the eighth installment of the fairly successful 'Halloween' series it's terrible.*SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW* Firstly the viewer is insulted before the creepy Halloween theme music even plays. It consists of psychiatric nurses discussing how Myers survived having his head chopped off in H20. It wasn't Myers you see, no, he'd torn out some policeman's voicebox, and put his own mask and suit on the poor bloke. So, Laurie Strode only succeeding in killing a law enforcement officer and not her psychotic brother. Myers has once again got off scot free. This in itself is laughable but what's even more shocking is that Jamie Lee Curtis' appearance in the film is nothing more than a cameo, yes she's hacked to pieces within minutes.Therefore an audience is left wondering what direction Halloween: Resurrection will take, now Loomis, Lloyd and Strode are all dead. Does Myers have any more family members to hunt down and kill? Apparently not.The deranged killer instead takes it upon himself to kill teenage interlopers who have taken up residence in his old house on Halloween night for an internet reality show.So, after bludgeoning to death most of Haddonfield for over twenty years and surviving more physical harm than Rasputin, it seems no one can end Myers tyranny. All except, Busta Rhymes? Yes, after conquering the music world, Rhymes almost single handedly conquers Myers and puts an end to his latest killing spree.This is a sequel we could have done without. H20 seemed a relatively fitting end to the series and if they needed to follow it up, they should have tied up the loose ends from parts 4, 5 & 6, instead of wasting time on this rubbish.With Halloween 9 on the horizon, Michael Myers is in grave danger of becoming a parody of himself, much like Freddy Krueger did. Hopefully, the writers and film makers will see sense and give the Halloween series a fitting finale, (maybe by reintroducing Lloyd's baby) while it just about maintains its credibility as a superior horror series.",

I was thinking - this movie is going to be S$#^!But once it got into the swing of things in Michael Myers'childhood house - it gets fairly lively.  Busta Rhymes is well cast as a internet show host/entrepreneur - he's fairly livid and has a few great lines and moments (ie: trying his kung fu out on Michael - kewl!).  It was obvious who was going to die and who was to survive - this movie tends to follow all the horror rules (as described in \"SCREAM\").Go see this movie - don't have any expectations that this is high art or anything.  See it at the cinema (it was great as there were a lot of teenage girls at my session - who provided a bit of a \"scream\" soundtrack at the right moments - great fun!).Although a bit of a warning - the violence in this movie is a tad on the extreme end of things - a lot of gory butcher knife action which made me flinch a bit.  ;-)I give it 3 and a half victims out of 5",

            "review_title": "What Makes You So Sure It Is Over?",
            "content": "The Following review will contain spoilers.Halloween: Resurrection is a widely hated movie amongst the Halloween faithful. Some, like myself, do consider it to be an above average film, and not one of the worst of the series. While the film has it's faults, the storyline in this film is frankly better than those used in Halloween 5 and Halloween 6. The problem with this film mainly was that it was ahead of it's time. If Halloween: Resurrection was released within the past five years(of writing this review) it would have been better received, I have little doubt about that. The following is my review of Halloween: Resurrection.The film was written by Sean Hood and Larry Brand. The story on this film is pretty straight forward. It takes place about 3 years after the events of Halloween: H20. Laurie is now in a mental hospital as she went crazy after she found out that Michael didn't really die at the end of H20. Michael actually killed one of the paramedics on scene and crushed his larynx so he couldn't say anything. Laurie then killed this paramedic by accident. She is haunted by this and is now in a mental hospital waiting for her real brother to come and kill her. We are then shown the night Michael Returns, but Laurie is ready this time. She has a trap for him on the roof of the building, but it backfires when she needs to remove his mask to make sure it is him. Michael then is able to turn the tables and finally kill his sister. Michael then goes back to his home in Haddonfield. He comes home to realize that an internet reality show is filming in his childhood home, and of course he will murder everyone in his house. As I mentioned above this story was ahead of it's time in regard to the reality programing. So many of us are use to seeing many horror type shows in famous houses that is first person based trying to find hauntings. Which is why I believe if this film were released in say 2012 instead of 2002, the film would have been a bigger hit and been more well received. I personally believe the story is not that bad. It is certainly not the worst of the franchise, and it moves nicely. Hood and Brand get a thumbs up in my opinion.The film was directed by Halloween 2 director Rick Rosenthal. If you have read my Halloween 2 review you already know I hold the opinion that that is the best sequel in this franchise. Rosenthal brought a more scare based approach to this film, which is what the franchise needed. Sure, there are still some over the top kills in this film that I could do without, but it wasn't as bad the previous film in this series(Halloween:H20). The acting is another big talking point about this film. Busta Rhymes is basically the star if you will. Many believe this was an awful casting decision, and I do agree. However, three years prior to this film another rapper(LL Cool J) starred in a Halloween film. The outrage against him is basically slim to none. The decision to cast Rhymes is a bigger role was not wise, but it certainly wasn't the worst thing in the world. However, I will admit that this is probably one of the worst acted films of the series. Jamie Lee Curtis phones in this very short part and acting legend Donald Pleasence had already passed about seven years before this film was released. Rosenthal delivers some nice scares that are a throwback to the original film more so than some of the slasher type sequels this franchise has turned out. I enjoy that and I think Rosenthal deserves credit for this outing.Danny Lux was the composer of this film, and he is mostly doing television shows these days. The score for this film has a John Carpenter feel to it, whereas some of the other sequels tried to change too much. That means the originality is at a low, but the film goes by nicely hearing that fantastic score we are so use to hearing in this series. Lux doesn't knock it out of the ballpark or create anything original, but he brings us that great classic Carpenter score that we all love.This film also marked the final effort from longtime series Producer, Moustapha Akkad. He was sadly murdered about three years after the release of this film in a terrorist bombing. Those hardcore fans of the series know him, and know his thoughts and opinions on the entire franchise very well. He didn't want Michael to die in any of the films, and just like Donald Pleasence, he wanted the series to continue as long as possible. He didn't want it to end. I love Moustapha for holding that for many decades as I myself never want to see the series end.Overall, it is not the best nor the worst film in the Halloween franchise. Sure it probably receives the most hate, but I can think of one or two films in this series that are worse. While it may not be the perfect way to have continued on the franchise, that really didn't matter as the series was rebooted entirely in 2007. The original franchise ended with this film, and while even I admit it wasn't the best way to end the amazing run, it was still an enjoyable way to end it's original run.7/10",

Now she's spending her life on a sanitarium, waiting for Michael to get her again. Finally, Michael accomplishes his goal to kill Laurie (isn't he?). And then the story goes to a bunch of teenagers that plan to spend a night to the old Michael Myers house in Haddonfield, to fulfill the challenge of Freddy Harris (Busta Rhymes), the owner of Dangertainment, an internet real time show. Everything goes terribly wrong then, when Michael Myers is back for his bloody rampage.\nOkay, we thought it has end on the H20, but the producer had a second thought. The result is one of the bad sequel ever made. Actually, the first 20 minute is great, and does a decent contribution to the Halloween saga. We easily presumed that the series was over. Think again! Michael is still alive and still blood thirsty. It's like that Resurrection is divided into a two movie. One is the Laurie Strode saga and the other is a plain slasher flick. Rick Rosenthal (Halloween II) did succeed to entertain us but with the clich\u00e9 mandatory and a lot of rip off from another movie like Scream and Blair Witch Project made the second part as the bad one. The plot is pointless and does nothing except just for a fun watch to the audiences. What a pity that Halloween series fall into those typical slasher flick.\nWell, at least for a true Halloween fans or slasher fans, you won't miss this.

I can honestly say that I am a true Halloween fan, and that I was hoping for more in the 8th episode in the series.  I thought that the movie started strong and came at the viewer with a furious pace.  They tried to make sense, the best way they could, as to how Michael Myers could possibly still be alive.  I guess there is always a way.  After that there seemed to be a series of agitating happenings as the movie progressed.  For instance, I didn't like the fact that the entire Myers house escapade was broadcast over the internet.   Obviously there is going to be an IM buddy to help save the day, right?  The most annoying though, has got to be that PDA that she was holding throughout the movie.  She even spoke to it once and the message got through to Dekkard.  I guess voice recognition on PDA's is fairly common nowadays.  I will stop here because I don't want to discuss the fact that they have a rapper as one of the main characters.....trick or treat busta.I had to walk away from this movie for what it was worth.  It was a sequel that I had to see because I call myself a Halloween and a horror movie fan. I was excited to see more slicing and dicing.  But next time, do all of us a favor.  Get back to the basics.  People come to horror movies to be scared and possibly to see the characters that have become horror icons.  A solid plot and a few decent actors are all you need to make a sequel in which the storyline is basically already set.  Michael is bad, Michael will kill people and Michael will never die.  We all know this.  After all this complaining I am going to do something that will offend many people.  I will recommend this movie if you are a fan of the series or of the genre because, well, I have to.",

In this eighth installment of the famous `Halloween' series, thought to have died three years after Laurie Strode `assumed' that she hacked her brother's head (we learn from flashbacks that she killed an innocent paramedic), Michael Myers returns to where the killings all started---home. Six teenagers have won a contest, sponsored by Dangertainment, where they must spend Halloween night inside the Myers' residence. They are unaware that the ultimate evil lurks in the house. It is wonderful to hear the theme song, or variations of the John Carpenter theme made popular in 1978, and its always a treat to see Jamie Lee Curtis on the big screen, once again playing Laurie Strode, whose role in this is reduced to nothing but a cameo. Better than your usual slasher flick, one might think, but this is not the best movie or worst movie of the year. Ending leaves door wipe open for `Halloween 9: How Long Will Michael Myers Kill These Innocent People Before He Gets Tired And Gives Up, He's Basically In His 40s By Now.'OK, maybe that's that the APPROPRIATE subtitle. Speaking of subtitles, they should've stuck with `Halloween: Homecoming'. One reason why they got dinged of the three-star category.Stars: 2.5 out of 4 (Grade: B-) Grade on IMDb: 7.5 out of 10",

Anyways, if he wasn't ever killed, why this movie is called \"resurrection\" ? Is it like resurrection of the series? What's up with the crap in the beginning about doors to heaven/hell then? The main plot about teens investigating the Myers house however has nothing to do with this and, despite horrible acting, works pretty well, if you'll ignore the fact that this movie is ripping off too many horror flicks to count, that is.

The script was elevated from a few clever ideas, but most of it didn't have anything fresh, and the treatment was bleak and ugly, but not scary; most likely they didn't have a screenplay at all. Add in some cardboard-character teenagers who are portrayed by some twentysomethings who can't act (I blame the director who doesn't give them even a chance!) and could have well been cast in the last minute from some shopping mall. Halloween 2 was watchable, how can director Rosenthal go downhill?? Shouldn't he have gained some experience on directing? How come Resurrection looks so... well, bleak and ugly. Low-key, low-budget. Reminds me of Blair witch 2.Things Rosenthal should have done: 1) Bailed out. We really didn't want another Halloween. Not after H20. In my opinion, the only reason Curtis was in this was that SHE at least could finally bail out of the series.or 2) Even so much as try! A couple of re-writes and especially re-casting! Busta has one hilarious moment and one cool one-liner to Michael and that's it! The rest of the movie, he just sucks. And that blonde who gets her head chopped off was esPECIALLY annoying! The rest of the cast is, as I said before, just your basic gore fodder. Weren't we supposed to care for these people...?Sadly, I could have done this better. So could have YOU.",

            "content": "As with any movie franchise that is nearing the double-digit mark, it proves tougher and tougher to try to bring something new to the table. Filmmakers, writers, producers, etc., seemingly are always deemed to add another notch to all ready squealed-to-death series'. Such is the case with the classic 'Halloween' franchise.However, instead of attempting to put Michael Myers (aka: The Shape) into such silly realms as outer space (a la 'Friday the 13th's' Jason Voorhees-in what turned out to be nothing short of pure embarrassment for both the producing studio and fans alike!) 'Halloween 2' veteran director Rick Rosenthal decided to take a more modern-day, practical approach. Using what every American all ready knows all-to-well about: reality television.For some, this may have been the final straw that broke the camel's back; using what most moviegoers would consider to be unprofessional, low-end methods in an attempt to revitalize an ailing series. Such, were my thoughts! It seemed an odd attempt, this guerilla style film-making, in what is usually such a technically sterile environment that is Hollywood.Guerilla style film-making or not, Rosenthal manages to pull off the impossible; not only using the consumer digital video format but learning to integrate it with the professional look of 35mm film! Some are quick to state that this has all ready been done via 'The Blair Witch Project' but that would be a false assumption. 'Blair Witch' used 16mm film and DV, both which were later blown up to a 35mm format so it could be viewed in theaters. Therefore, 'Halloween 8' is unique in it's mixing both formats simultaneously.Rosenthal and company were looking to create a more 'documentary' type feel to the latest installment in the series and they managed to create just that. This proves to be vital to the film since, at this point in time, there is little left to reveal to the audience, at least as far as it's main characters are concerned. Probably, more people know more about Laura Strode and Michael Myers than they do some of their own family members! Having said that, what else can one do to try to still maintain the audience's interests in these all ready exhausted characters? Gore will only carry you so far and big names will only cost your production a heck of a lot of money. Neither is a guarantee for success. So, what do you do? Why, you must reinvent! 'Halloween 8' is like a phoenix rising. And, while it is not perfect, it does manage to spark interest again. There are some 'name' actors (or, at least, some familiar faces running around) that kill the suspense of the film. Those being Busta Rhymes, Thomas Ian Nichols ('American Pie' veteran), and Sean Patrick Thomas. And, while I find all three of these actors superb in their own right, I feel that their presence here is disingenuous and distracting. Whenever I see Mr. Nichols running frantically about, I keep waiting for Stifler to show up! These celebrity faces just produce the results a good horror film should not.Pretty faces aside, the rest of the film generate some heart-pumping thrills. Rosenthal and director of photography, David Geddes, keep light levels low. And, as mentioned in the commentary, almost to the point of being dangerously low that should a mere candle have been blown out the picture would have gone entirely black! Video footage shot by the actors themselves is integrated with the look of professional film. Giving the overall production an 'edgy' feel with its digital glitches sprinkled throughout partnered with the imperfectly framed DV shots. Surprisingly, it works! Musically speaking, Carpenter's original main score is still recognizable but little remains of it. Composer Danny Lux does a descent job combining the past with the present. The 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is also very active and effective enough so that you'll be snapping a few quick glances over your shoulder to be sure the Shape himself isn't standing behind you! Unusual as it may seem, Dimension Home Video has packed this disc full of fun, informative bonus features. First, a must listen to commentary track by director Rosenthal and Editor Robert A. Ferretti. Like Carpenter, Rosenthal is quick to point out his 'areas of improvement' and even goes as far as to point out a crew member lying on the floor holding a flag in the film! Mostly, his self-critical analysis is typical of any director and it just goes to show how much of a professional Mr. Rosenthal is and how he has evolved over the past 20 years since his having helmed the 2nd entry in this series.Topping off the disc are such gems as a deleted scenes section (with commentary!) as well as a 40-minute webcam special (also with commentary) which gets to be so slightly nauseating after awhile. There are numerous featurettes dealing with set design as well as Jamie Lee Curtis's thoughts on finally killing off her much admired and loved character Laura Strode. Also included is a very healthy Stills Gallery.With a clear conscious, I can state that 'Halloween: Resurrection' is a welcomed new entry. Having said that though, I'm not sure where the ol' Myers kid is to go from here. For the next director that should dare to helm yet another entry, I can only state that the Shape needs to stay put at home. Avoid the wackiness of space and ignore any high-flown ideas that would make our beloved Michael into something he's not; such as an angry spirit or evil alter ego via Martha Stewart. Keep him grounded safely in his roots. Just another deranged serial killer, who as Rosenthal jokes, is getting ever so closer to collecting his social security! And, at this point in the franchise, that may not be such a cursed statement. After all, if I see Myers terrorizing a retirement home, I'm definitely throwing in my 'Halloween' towel!",

Most people are asking, `But didn't he get decapitated in the last one?' Yes, but they find a way around it (of course). And, `Isn't Jamie Lee Curtis done with these already?' Yes, it seems that she will be now. With those questions answered in the first few minutes, the movie rolls along a lightning fast ADD-friendly pace. Although not the best sequel in the series, it's not the worst either. It's probably the most interesting one since `Halloween 2', which also had director Rick Rosenthal at the helm. He has since honed his craft in television, which is obvious in the directorial style. Most people predicted this to be a hip-hop flavored installment with Busta Rhymes as the main star, but it's pretty straight-ahead slasher flick. Although too silly at times, Busta provides some much-needed humor to the campy tale. In fact, he has one of the funnier scenes in a horror movie in quite some time when he's in the Michael Myers costume yelling at the real Myers. Just to hear his gravely voice come out of the costume is worthy of a good chuckle.  Trying to give Michael Myers an update seems to be the reason for making this one. The internet, palm pilots, and reality TV are major plot points. Even `The Osbournes' get a mention. The `Fear Factor' meets `Blair Witch' angle gives the series a newer feel, even if it isn't a terribly original idea. It's exactly what you'd expect: blood, guts, and a high body count. If that's what you're looking for, then it will be worth it to you. If you're not a fan of the genre, then it wasn't made for you anyway. Michael Myers fans should be pleased with this one.",

HALLOWEEN has taken a new dimension and Michael is ready for it. This is a good slasher/horror movie compared with other movies from the genre in the last 3 years. The HALLOWEEN series needed a new plot after HALOWEEN 4 : THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS.   The stupid explanation of his origin damaged his image. Until part 4, Michael was an unstoppable killing machine; he was scary, he had his own style, he wasn't just a brutal killer with no common sense, in fact he was clever. If you are a fan of the series read. If it's the first HALLOWEEN movie you've watch then you can't say something bad about this one.THE BEGINNING          -SPOILERS- The first 15 minutes of H:RESURRECTION have the feeling of the previous HALLOWEEN films. The first death scenes show that Michael is really MAD, and he is blood thirsty.  Then, the confrontation between Michael and Laurie opens the chance for a sequel... The point is that the first minutes of the movie pay tribute to the old HALLOWEEN style, introducing Michael Myers as the main character of the movie. This has to be the best opening sequence in the HALLOWEEN series just after the original. The explanation of how Michael survived works very well...MICHAEL MYERS Michael returns bigger, bader, and meaner than ever. Michael's brutality when committing murders is something to be scared of. I can't remember other HALLOWEEN movie where Michael stabs his victims with such anger. Brad Loree gives a personality to Michael in this film, and that makes him scary. This is Michael's movie, let him have fun.DIRECTION Rick Rossental proves to be one of the best directors in the genre. Now, this movie has a great direction. It can't be compared with the Blair Witch movies! The moving camera shots are great, and work perfectly for some scares. Rossental did a great job in HALLOWEEN II and he returns to make a better job in this movie. You can't complain with the good direction. H:RESURRECTION looks impressive.ACTING/CHARACTERS Well, this time we didn't get Jaime Lee or Donald Pleasence but the main characters are not that bad. I know, Busta Rhymes has zero experience in acting, but his character is likeable. Maybe his kung-fu imitation sucks, but he beat the hell out of Michael -something that just Donald Pleasence done. Talking about Dr. Loomis, he has really missed this time. Specially when it is mentioned that Michael has been living in his house without being noticed. Even if parts 4, 5, and 6 are ignored we know that Michael's been around every Halloween night, and now it's explained where he's been hiding. Dr. Loomis' character is severely missed, and it's a lack of respect that he's not even mentioned in this one. The main characters in the HALLOWEEN MOVIES are Michael, Dr. Loomis, and Lauire Strode. As it's impossible to bring Loomis back, at least his obsession, and research about Michael should be considered. Talking about the characters here  their acting is regular. There's something that the HALLOWEEN movies need and it's character development. Seems like we get the Friday the 13th camp counselors, because if the die or not doesn't matter. A new character linked to Myers needs to be introduced.-BIG SPOILERS- **************** STUFF TO THINK ABOUT... -Do you REALLY think Laurie died? -Will Michael return for a sequel? -Was it Michael the villian in this movie? Now, what's Michael's purpose?? Is he trying to be like Jason Voorhees just killing because he wants to?",

            "content": "First of all, i'm gonna say what i liked in the movie. That would be Laure Strode's death. I wasn't expecting this, it was about time, the kiss for goodbye was cool. Another thing i liked was... wait.. that's about it.Basically i HATE this movie for two main reasons. 1.It's supposed to be a horror movie, a horror movie is supposed to be scary, and this movie is far far faaar from being scary.2.The creators trashed Michael Myers character.Oh sorry, one more :3.Busta Rhymes.Halloween: Resurrection is predictable, boring, the storyline seems like it was written in .. 10 minutes, and the acting is horrible. But believe me. That's not the worst thing about it. This movie killed the legend of Michael Myers, and it's all thanks to Busta Rhymes and his Freddie character. So far Michael Myers was a personification of evil. Unstoppable killing machine. After seeing the first Halloween, i often thought, what would i do if one rainy night i would look in a window and see Michael Myers standing outside looking at me ? I would crap my pants and kill myself before he could do it, because there would be no way i could escape him. No way i could beat him. It would be just easier to give myself up to him. Now, after i saw Halloween: Resurrection, i would think : Michael Myers ? Don't just stand there, come upstairs so i can kick your ass.Why would i think so ? Simply because this movie made him look like a complete looser, a weakling who stood no chance against Busta's character, while Freddie is a brave hero,who literally beat the hell out of Michael, and didn't even break a sweat. He used all kinds of lame phrases, showing, that he is absolutely not afraid of Michael Myers !! Michael Myers - the pure evil, a devil's spawn who should be scaring the crap out of everybody ! Busta was just running his mouth on Michael, using kung-fu moves like some goddamn action hero, and he crushed Michael Myers in combat. Perfect Victory. Oh wait.. Mike did stab him once, but this doesn't count since Freddie was surprised, and in the movie it looked like Michael just got lucky. I almost cried when i saw that. I almost forgot to mention, that Freddie ruined the whole movie. Mainly because of the fact that he wasn't even close to be afraid of Myers. It's one of the elements of a horror movies, if a victim is afraid of the killer, the viewers are more afraid. Of course there was a lot of \"tough guys\" in horror movies, but that was the idea - they act like heroes - they get killed, therefore people watching the movie are even more afraid of the killer. Freddie however, is not only brave and tough, but he also, as i already mentioned - beats the crap out of Michael... easily, which is unacceptable. Also, some of Freddie's kung-fu moves and sounds making while performing those moves, made people laugh. Every single person at the cinema was laughing (except for me, they just wanted to be entertained, i however, am a big fan of Halloween series, so instead of laughing, i cried). This is also unacceptable. The guy who came up with this was either drunk or retarded. Probably both.Actually, to be honest with you, this whole thing with Freddie p***ed me off so much, and it was so incredibly ridiculous, that even if the movie was scarier than all the other sequels (heellloooo creators of H:R - that's the idea with Horror movies, they're supposed to be S-C-A-R-Y, i can't believe nobody told you that) i would still consider it a bad movie, and the worst of all Halloween titles (yes, even worse than Halloween 3).",

We get to see Laurie Strode battle it out with Michael Myers one last time.The story of Michael Myers should have ended with H20, which while not great, at least added something to the story. So what do we get with Resurrection? Well, as with Halloween 5, Michael's \"death\" is retold to show that he didn't really die; that he in fact traded places with a medic, going so far as putting his mask on the guy after crushing his larynx...because, obviously Michael knew that Laurie would steal the ambulance and decapitate the body.So Resurrection gives us the last battle between Laurie and Michael and ends with Laurie's death. Apparently, Jamie Lee Curtis would only reprise her role as Laurie if they killed her off...a rather smart move on her part because she could see where the franchise was headed. After this 15 minutes, the movie has no point. Busta Rhymes and Tara Banks (I really don't care enough to look up their character names) are looking for a pay day and decide to host a live \"ghost hunter\" show at the Myers house on Halloween night. They get a bunch of college kids to enter the house and explore it all night. Predictably, they all split up and are murdered by Myers. Here's the thing: the Myers house isn't that big...it's not like you could just spend hours exploring a relatively empty house. How do several people wander around getting \"lost\" in a house this small?Oh and Busta Rhymes is in this movie...he's the next biggest \"star\" after Jamie Lee Curtis. There is no Dr. Loomis equivalent here; no real talent. I failed to mention that Busta Rhymes is - in this film - a karate fan, and he fights Michael Myers using his Bruce Lee moves...yeah, that's actually in this movie.Probably the most cringe-worthy part was the ending, after the two survivors have burned down the garage with Myers inside. Busta Rhymes and the girl that survived are interviewed by the media and it was just so terrible. Then there is the part with Rhymes mocking the burnt \"corpse\" of Myers.I don't know what else there is to say about this film. It shouldn't have been made. It didn't need to be made. Even if there was a poll of fans who wanted Myers to return, you don't necessarily have to do what \"fans\" want. Certainly, fans didn't like this movie, and no one else did either.",

Well I can actually say I wasn't missing much. I had heard alot of bad comments , read alot of bad reviews , but shrugged them off because I am the type that can sit and watch anything..I even loved Jason X which got the same treatment.\nHalloween:Resurrection however is just too difficult to really get into. I sorta enjoyed H20 ..wasnt my favorite but it was tolerable , this one is like a horrible unfunny parody on the internet and reality tv. I don't think the writers were intending on a parody on these because this is after all a slasher movie so the writing is never expected to be that deep and clever , so what we get it is an exploitation of the internet and reality tv.\n*Spoilers* What really got annoying was how the modern world and technology is the key role in Resurrection. The previous Halloweens and slasher movies in general rely on the tired but very pleasing formula of nudity & sex , gore , and creative murders. Thats all folks...thats all it takes to make a Halloween movie and it works. Now props for them wanting to do something different , but it's just annoying..I mean c'mon the finale where Sarah is receiving help from text messaging?..How bad have people and movies gotten when you can't even survive a slasher movie without help from a computer.\nAlso the death scenes seemed tired and boring , no real excitement in the murders. Halloween has just become a boring series of which was once a great one. It's still ok but I don't think i'll add it to my series collection 5.5/10",

            "content": "Just to let you know, this is being written by a huge Halloween fan who's seen all the movies at least 3 times, has the soundtracks, and has every sequel on DVD. I'm not some person who saw this because it looked good, I am a fan, so this is a fan's review.Anyways, I just got back from this film several hours ago, and while I'm not disgusted (like with Jason X), I'm not that overwhelmed. At no point in the movie was I ever bored or thought that the movie sucked, it was good, but as a die-hard fan I was ultimately let down.The beginning of the movie is great, in which Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode for the last time. But after that, the movie falls into that little area where you don't really not like it, but you don't like it like you want to (confusing you, am I?).Basically, Michael, having offed Laurie, heads back home only to find it being invaded by college kids participating in a Halloween webcast gag being broadcast live. So of course, he dusts off the knife and gets right to it. But as if everyone doesn't know that the whole reason the webcast and the kids exist are to get killed. Like every Friday the 13th sequel, any excuse to get those kids into the woods worked. The same goes for the Myers' house here.Anyways, I thought Rick Rosenthal did a good job with this one. Several moments have some weird slow-motion thing going on with it, and the angles are all pretty good. The lighting was very effective and looked like the best thing about the production. It didn't look cheap. But speaking of cheap, this movie is so full of cheap scares that you can't count them on all 10 fingers. WAM! SCREAM! Oh, wait, that's just Rudy! Please...spare us the jolts, they're tired already. I thought the new, much darker twist on the music was good, but it was never played loud enough for me to fully enjoy it. At times, the character's breathing was louder than the music. They really needed to take advantage of the Dolby speakers, here, I want my Halloween music cranked up loud. As for the acting...let me say I didn't HATE it. To put it bluntly for a fan, it was slightly better than Halloween 5, but somewhat less than Halloween 6. I never thought they were doing a bad job, but they were just...decent. As for our heroine, I think Rachel from Halloween 4 was better. I never actually believed she was scared. She didn't seem to be. Tyra Banks wastes a lot of screen time doing NOTHING. Busta Rhymes was good, but the jokes were coming from all over the place and laughing at a scene where Michael is slicing and dicing is not a good thing. The acting was good enough, though. At times, the dialogue was very cheesy, however. Especially Laurie's lines. Let's just say her character would have had more dignity if she had become mute. Some jokes spurted out by the kids are corny and don't make you laugh. And they don't deliver lines that great, either.All in all, I should be praising God that this film was as good as it was for an 8th film in a series. But this movie no longer keeps the franchise together. Michael is done with killing his relatives (well not Laurie's son, but Josh Hartnett isn't gonna come back anytime soon, so...). Now that the relatives are gone...he pointlessly slaughters college kids, an ex-rapper, and a supermodel? The series used to have 2 things that balanced the story: Michael and his family. The family is gone. It's just Michael killing a lot of annoying kids whom we have never seen in any other movie and have no connection to. You can't just have Myers kill, what matters is WHO he's killing. And let's face it, half the time we want these kids to die.If all this sounds like I am putting the movie down, don't get that impression. I think fans and even non-fans will get a kick out of this. It's not creepy like Halloween 2, another Rosenthal installment, and Michael has pretty much stopped being scary, but it is the most ENJOYABLE film since the 2nd. This is like a party version of Halloween. It's very fun to watch, but that's only because there's nothing to it. Go see it to have a great time, I did. It's not bad at all, I just feel like the series premise is going down the drain. I will buy this film when it comes out, so let that tell you it ain't a bad movie. My only REAL complaints? At SEVERAL moments in the film, Michael stands in front of one of the characters while they (thinking he is the fake Myers) talk to him, even hit him on the head, and he WALKS OFF. Seriously. One time someone cuts him down and tells him to leave and HE TURNS AND WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. I could not believe my eyes. Then, another thing, THEY BURN THE MYERS' HOUSE TO THE GROUND. NO! It was the last part of the original series that was in the movie! And the last groan: THE ENDING. I have never seen such a stupid ending in a Halloween movie. It was flat out embarrassing. The ending of Jason X was better.Anyways, go see this, it's not bad at all. But this \"Resurrection\" feels more like a new beginning, as if the creators are saying \"Hey this is what Michael does when he's all out of blood relatives to hack up!\" Well, if I want to stay close to the roots of the series, I'll go with another installment. If I wanna see Michael brutally slaughter, then I'll watch this one.",

            "content": "***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** I know that you simply should not and cannot compare a sequel to its original. I get that just fine. Sequels are made for two reasons: Either the creators still have a story to tell, or the producers wanna make some quick money. Well since this story has been stretched over 7 sequels, which reason do you think this movie was made for? The only reason I saw this, and all the other sequels, is because no matter how bad they are I have a soft spot for horror. At least the good stuff. This is not good stuff.\nJamie Lee Curtis returns for 15 minutes as Laurie Strode, her character ruined over 2 sequels already, to set a trap for Michael, whom she knows is gonna come back once and for all to get her. I loved Curtis in the first Halloween. What I am left wondering is why the hell she was acting so bad in this one? She was overacting so much, it stung my eyes, and my ears were ringing from the sound of the horrible dialogue she was given.\nOnce she's gone, Michael knocks off idiot college kids who are so smart, they agree to spend the night in Michael Myers' childhood home equipped with cameras to broadcast it all over the Internet, even though Laurie has just been murdered and no one even knows the whereabouts of Michael Myers. Unless you know for sure that a serial killer is locked up behind bars in a federal prison far away somewhere, you don't enter his house, no matter how much you are being paid.What follows is an unstylish borefest. To top it off, the film is as scary as Scooby-Doo. The tension and moody atmosphere from the original is now so diluted it is replaced by shots of Michael walking through the house with his knife. One by one, we get to watch as they venture off on their own and meet up with Michael. Even the deaths are so tired by now that you can almost yawn. It's boring. Michael hides in the shadows. Wow. He kills someone. Wow. And as always, one girl lives to escape it all. It fits every cliche right down to the cheap scares that pop out everywhere in this movie, polluting the screen with unbearable garbage. There is basically no story in this movie at all. Kids enter the Myers house. They die. End of story. It's not even a movie. It's an excuse to pack kids into the theater to see Michael slice-and-dice undeveloped, annoying teens and then roll the credits. That's it. The first movie doesn't deserve this. They kept Michael as \"The Shape\" lurking in the darkness, preying on the teenagers in America's suburbs with cold, unfeeling expression. Here, they try to \"explain\" why Myers is such a psycho. It was better when we didn't know. I'd like to think of Michael as evil, rather than tortured and in turn starting to murder. If I had a dime for every time someone said \"Michael Myers\" in this movie, I would have the amount of my admission ticket back. Could they humanize him anymore? Could they have worser actors? Could they have more bad dialogue? Could they!? You might find yourself asking this. Even attempts to inject humor into the movie are so laughably bad, they expect to charm us with Busta Rhymes pretending he is a martial arts expert and whipping Michael's butt. What a way to make us fear him.\nThe only things I liked were the lighting, which I thought was great, and the music. The director is not to blame for this, however. He did exceptionally well for what he had to work with and generates a tiny drop of interest before it evaporates into pure junk. The movie is over before you know it, and you're thinking why the heck you even sat through it. It provides nothing to the viewer expect bad jokes and gore.\nI heard this movie went through several re-shoots. Maybe they can feature the original cuts of the film on the DVD and let us compare. I will buy this when it comes out only because it has Michael Myers in it and I simply cannot keep the Halloween collection incomplete. And judging by the way this one ends, I'll be buying another one before long again, too.",

            "content": "\"Halloween H20\" was the 20th anniversary of the original masterpiece, \"Halloween.\" Time had gone by, but Jamie Lee Curtis returned to the role that made her famous, scream queen Laure Strode. It followed along with post \"Scream\" thrillers that came out a few years ago, most of them hopeless garbage such as the film \"Urban Legend.\" When you thought it could not get worse, almost twenty-five years later, \"Halloween Resurrection\" reduces the series to a biter false alarm and Curtis can't seem to make up her mind and leave the series behind.It's about Freddy Harris (Busta Rhymes), who is a Reality TV programmer at DangerTainment, and he and his crew of internet streamers descend into the childhood home of Serial Killer Michael Myers on Halloween night. Michael has survived his last attempt on his sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who has since gotten locked away in a mental hospital. Freddy and his crew set up cameras in the Myers house and attempt to broadcast a live feed from his home, but what they don't know is that Michael has come home to Haddonfield to crash the party.\"H20\" was another attempt to revive the \"Halloween\" series that gave us Michael Myers. Jamie Lee Curtis was the one who got that movie of the ground, no doubt, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original. It was not a terrible film by any means, but it followed the teen slasher revival a few years ago and therefore was nothing special. Instead of being scary, we knew what was going to happen, but it was a fun movie, and at least we got to see Curtis again. Well, she has returned, yet again, in this unnecessary sequel that is devoid of any human feeling, story, characters or inspiration.Twenty-four years later, Laurie Strode is middle-aged and still running crazy down hallways and corridors when Michael shows up to break the door down. It seems she can never get away from him, and he always knows where to find her. At least in \"Halloween H20\", we saw how he tracked her down. This time, he shows up at the hospital Laurie is in because writing how he found her would be too much of a task. She is a long-suffering basket case until Michael shows up, and she leads him to the roof when she has a trap set to capture him. Of course, it doesn't go as planned, and she dies within the first twenty mins of the film. How despicable!Michael somehow makes it back to Haddonfield after a lazy excuse lets him live at the beginning of the movie. There is no real effort here to make a decent film, tell a story or even a make a believably lousy movie, this sequel is the bottom of the barrel for a cash grab and an insult to the series. It's just as bad if not worse than the \"Friday the 13th\" sequel, \"Jason X\" that came out back in April. That film was an unnecessary nail in the coffin, and so is this embarrassing junk. Speaking of embarrassing, I haven't even got to the Busta Rhymes character. He takes over the role of LL Cool J as the token rapper because putting another one in this sequel was necessary for some reason?Three years have gone by since \"H20\" and college student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich) wins a competition to appear on the DangerTainment show. Freddy runs it with his fake fruit loop assistant, Nora (Tyra Banks; she can't act either). Sara is the main character of the movie and the heroine with somewhat of a head on her shoulders. The kids that get chosen are all dumb slasher bait, and none can act. One of the worse offenders is Jen (Katee Sackhoff), and she is the typical dumb blonde. Imagine this; she attempts to pull a prank on the teenagers, thinking she is funny, and Michael ends up cutting her head off at the top of the stairs. Her head rolls down the staircase, and three of the kids look up in horror as Michael slowly descends the stars before they stop starring stupid and realize they are in trouble.Michael picks of all the dummies in slasher form, and it's all getting watched by a kid, Deckard (Ryan Merriman), who is watching via the internet from some party he is attending. By the end of the film, half of the party is watching the carnage unfold. Sara realizes Michael is in the house, and she tries to escape, and the kid watching attempts to tell her where Michael is via email messaging so she can stay alive. The camera work attempts to stand out like the \"Blair Witch Project\" did with the found footage aspect, but the camera is so shaky, you can't see anything, and when the cameras are down in the basement, it's even worse.Busta Rhymes was no doubt cast so people would see his face on the promotional art, but this guy is a horrible actor, and his character is remarkably stupid. Imagine this, Busta Rhymes breaks through a wall in the garage and starts karate kicking Michael like a complete buffoon. Did the producers think this was funny? Even worse, he begins Kentucky Fried Chicken jokes at Michael's expense when the movie is over, and we can finally go home.I put \"Jason X\" down something awful for all the right reasons, but \"Halloween Resurrection\" makes Jason's garbage sequel more watchable. There is nothing in this film that is memorable, Busta Rhymes is a pathetic joke and the fact that it is what it is and that the producers were seemingly okay with the finished product says a lot about ripping audiences off with no shame and no care. Jamie Lee Curtis is insulted as Laurie in the film, and she looks like she does not want to be there for all the right reasons. If this is the end of the \"Halloween\" films, It's a sad and painful journey we spent from sequel to bad sequel up to this incompetent trash being the seemly end of Michael's legacy.\n0/10",

All these Halloween and Jason movies are for brainless people who like watching pure garbage and teens getting killed. Yes, I did rent Halloween Part I-can\u00b4t-even-remember, but I could watch only the first 15 minutes or so. Now someone thinks I was scared... Hmmm, in a way I was scared: scared of what this kind of crap could to my mental health. Halloween Part One was good, Part Two was okay and H20 was surprisingly good. I have no interest what-so-ever to see Parts 3-6. Once I actually saw some parts of Halloween 6 on the German RTL and I must say it was pretty awful. So, as Halloween Resurrection begins we are told that it wasn\u00b4t Michael Myers who lost his head in the end of H20. Oh really? What an original plot twist. Now Michael\u00b4s back for Laurie who (finally?) gets butchered. I feel sorry for Jamie Lee Curtis whom I\u00b4ve always found a decent actress, to say the least. But to see her in a crappy film like this shows that she\u00b4s really in need of (good) movie roles. Why did you do this, Jamie?Michael Myers isn\u00b4t scary. Jason Voorhees isn\u00b4t scary. Freddy isn\u00b4t scary. Those people who saw this movie in a theater, now those guys are scary! And guess what, Michael\u00b4s still alive! I can imagine the screenwriters trying to come up with a surprising ending: \"Hey guys, I have an idea... What if Michael didn\u00b4t die in the end? Now wouldn\u00b4t that be cool and spooky?\" And one one saw it coming, honest! I just came up with an idea... We could put all the people responsible for stupid brainless scary movies in a house, lock the doors and put all the lights out. Then we could give knives to folks who like quality stuff and let them butcher every single horror freak in the house. That would be so much fun and we would be praised by the following generations who were saved from having to watch horrible movies. I\u00b4m willing to pay for all the knives. I really hope that all those who were involved in Halloween Resurrection never get to work again, unless they manage to do something well. Which is very unlikely, judging from the work I just witnessed. I guess they are all like Michael... You can run, but you can\u00b4t hide from them. Oh crap.",

            "content": "Say what you want about \"Halloween\"s 1-7, while some installments weren't exactly horror classics, they were at least respectable, well-made sequels. The great thing about the \"Halloween\" series was how true to its roots it managed to stay. Every other horror franchise from \"Friday the 13th\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" sold out long before they hit a number 5. Freddy Krueger suddenly became a comedian and Jason did the same routine in every movie with a different cast. The beauty of \"Halloween\" though was that it managed to stay scary and not turn Michael Myers into a joke.This film destroyed all of that.The biggest mistake is in the writing. The main arc of the entire series was Michael and his family. This movie focuses on that part of the story for maybe 15 minutes in the beginning (with Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Michael's unlucky little sibling), then veers so far off course it makes you wonder how a franchise can go down the toilet so quickly. The rest of the movie is just about a bunch of (annoying) college kids running around in a booby-trapped Myers' house with cameras as part of a reality show broadcast on the Web. Of course the kicker is that the REAL Michael Myers has decided to come back to his childhood home, and doesn't exactly like his new guests. We can't blame him.Every character here is stock. There's the goody goody you just know is going to be involved in the final chase scene, the sick perverted boy we all know is going to bite it, etc. They're the same characters from every other bad horror movie ever made. The previous \"Halloween\"s at least took pride in having good characters you actually cared about. It meant something when they died. Now all you can do is cheer Michael on as he slashes his way through some of the most annoying characters.The acting isn't nearly up to par, either. I realize this is the 8th film in the series, but who are these people? They can't act their way out of a paper bag, did the casting department just stop trying, or did these people win their roles through a contest or something? I'd like to know. Whenever the characters scream or try to show fear, it's so badly acted you just have to laugh at the comedic value of it all.In fact, at the halfway point of the movie you'll be laughing (or crying possibly) at how easy it is to take a respectable series and drag it through the mud.The only saving grace is Rosenthal's direction and the oddly good cinematography. Rosenthal does his best with the crap script he's been given, I doubt anyone could have improved upon it. And the cinematography is really quite great...the lighting and color of some shots are outstanding for a film of this type and the whole movie is bathed in orange and blue hues. I like it! Good stuff.Unfortunately that can't save this movie.This is basically just \"Friday the 13th\" in a house. Kids come around, masked killer shows up, kills them all of one by one. That's it. This movie alone managed to turn a once clever and meaningful series into a standard run-of-the-mill slasher movie. The main focus of the entire series is gone. Now we get hilariously bad acting, cheesy scares, and nauseating one-liners (the previous installments never resorted to comedy).Busta Rhymes steals the show though, with acting so bad it makes you afraid for all the wrong reasons.Just pretend this franchise ended with the at least respectable \"H20\" and forget this travesty ever happened.R.I.P. \"Halloween\"...your \"resurrection\" was also your death. No one will take this series seriously anymore.",

Audiocommentary, deleted scenes, Jamie Lee Curtis interview, web-cam feature,etc. You'd think this disc has it all, but it's missing one major thing:the original opening with the Myers family having a get-together in thebackyard of the house shown in grainy Super 8 footage!! Unfortunately,the only way this can be seen is via the bootleg video of HALLOWEEN:HOMECOMING - check eBay for it. Otherwise, the ending of that bootleg isavailable on the DVD (CSI Hand In Tunnel). I'd have to give the DVD 93/4 out of 10 stars. ALSO: I almost forgot - they changed the titlesequence on the DVD from what was shown theatrically! The originaltheatrical titles were very bland - just a bright orange, basic font.This time, the font is one of the Copperplate fonts (think Halloween:Curse of Michael Myers logo) backed by red-orange. The actual titledoesn't appear until AFTER the Tunnel/Laurie scene. In the theatricalversion, the title appeared right at the very beginning of the filmalong with the rest of the credits. Dannie Lux's excellent reworking ofthe Halloween theme is intact, as is the rest of the theatrical versionfootage. Check it out, though - this slightly new intro is at least alittle more appealing that the theatrical one (it's so subtle, only aperson who'd seen the film several times theatrically, such as myself,would know the difference). Still, 9 3/4 stars out of 10!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "I am a TRUE Halloween fan. I own all of the original video releases, as well as the laserdisc, video and DVD rereleases. I own all of the soundtracks and movie novels. I own the Don Post mask as well as the Cinema Secrets mask, neither of which compare to the actual Captain Kirk mask I own and am currently in the process of converting to look like the mask used in the original Halloween. I even own the crappy teen novels. Clothing, posters, bootlegs of all of the different cuts: Halloween is ingrained into my life. The way I feel about Hallwoeen: Resurrection is that it is one of the legitimite sequels. The only legitimite films are those which contain Jamie Lee Curtis portraying the character of Laurie Strode. Halloween 4, 5 and The Curse of Michael Myers were all discredited upon Jamie Lee's return to the series with H20. Come to terms with it: 4-6 are basically rumors of what COULD have happened, but aren't what ACTUALLY happened. The only films that count are  Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection.On to the critiquing: Halloween: Resurrection should have stuck with its original title of Halloween: Homecoming. A lot of people who have posted their opinions are conveniently ignorant of the fact that this film is MAKING FUN OF \"reality\"-based TV shows (i.e. - MTV's Fear, which was a horrible idea SEMI-ripped off of Blair Witch. Resurrection has no direct correlation with Blair Witch and should not be compared). Rick Rosenthal's direction was a nice touch, but the actors were not really up-to-par (except for Jamie Lee, who, let's face it, only did this film due to the fact she was contractually bound - upon viewing the film, you'll see why she wanted to end. H20, for her, was meant to be the ending of it all). The way Michael is desribed to have made it into this sequel is laughable, but at least they TRIED (unlike the last two Friday the 13th entries which give no explaination of how Jason returned - but who cares? Jason's a blatant rip-off of Michael to begin with). Yes, the first 15 minutes of this film are the best. However, the Danny Lux's version of the Halloween theme deserves commendation - it's the best reworking of the theme since Halloween II! The score itself could have used redone versions of Laurie's Theme and \"The Shape Stalks/Lurks,\" all of which Alan Howarth included in his score contributions. It was nice to see the Myers house again, even though it was NOT the same one used in the original and part 2. The landing was too long; Judith's room was on the right at the top of the stairs, not the left; the entire counter in the kitchen was different, and there was no pseudo pantry or spice rack; there very well may have been a basement, but there wasn't a way to get to it from the kitchen. The mask could have been better, but that can be said about all the masks from Halloween 2 on. At least the actor portraying Michael in this one ATTEMPTED to get the walk and killing style, UNLIKE the Chris Durand in H20. The Halloween party and internet additions were hokey, but seemed to fit within the story-line, so why not? Why is there this sudden trend of adding bad rappers into the Halloween mix? Last time we were forced to put up with LL Cool J, now it's Busta Rhymes. Some of his stuff was interesting, but he could have been done without. Tyra Banks had a bit part, and she wasn't really annoying, so she was tolerable. The neck-slitting was WAY over-the-top in this film - the original had little to no blood in it at all. There's no reason to resort to excessive gore (the blood looked like melted Jello - way too irridescent and slimy). Anyway, if you really are a TRUE FAN of the series, you'll give this film credit where it deserves it, namely Jamie Lee, Rick Rosenthal directing, Danny Lux's rendition of the theme and the basic re-institution of the Myers house (although what happens to it leaves much to be desired). Check it out, if you really are a Myers fan. If not, this film is not meant for you - don't go to see it for Busta Rhymes of Tyra Banks or that kid from American Pie - they're insignificant. 8 1/2 ............................................................................ ........",

            "content": "It was just simply because it was titled 'Halloween' that I decided to show respect for John Carpenter's excellent opening 2 films. Boy, was I dissapointed. For a start I wondered how the hell they were gonna make serial killer Michael Myers come back for another killing spree when he was decapitated in H20.I thought that they actually would have had him walking around with a bit of glue stuck on his neck to signify him sticking his own head back on!. That probably would have been more plausible than the explanation of his come back. He dressed up in a paramedic's outfit, then just so happened to crush the innocent man's larynx?!. Gimme a break!. Bit of a coincidence then that the innocent paramedic dressed up in myers' clothes and mask would answer to the name 'Michael' when Laurie Strode speaks to him near the end of H20.What mainly lets the film down are the terrible actors. They are just so typical of a horror flick nowadays. In the Myers house we get the usual:1. Doing drugs - means they are gonna die2. Sex scene - means they are gonna die3. A typical hero (Busta Rhymes) who just happens to be a Bruce Leeand down right stupidity for going back there.Busta Rhymes is an absolute joke in the movie, every other word that he says is a swear word, what is the need?. As for him doing a Jackie Chan and kickin' Myers' ass, well as I watched it with my brother, we both erupted in laughter. It's hilarious.I've already voted for this film and yes, you've guessed it, gave it a 1 rating. I am a die hard fan of the 'Halloween' series but could simply could not rate this film at all. Why Jamie Lee Curtis wasted her time doing this is beyond me, she must be buying a new house in real life or something and needs a bit of extra cash.Hopefully this is the last we see of Busta Rhymes (except if it's in a comedy, which, after all, is the way I look at this film, as a joke)Rating 1/10.

A few problems I have with this movie is they changed the ending in H20 to make this movie work and this movie keeps tripping over itself because of it. Laurie Strode didn't actually behead her brother it was actually a paramedic gagged and wearing a mask. When Michael is on the roof hanging upside down Laurie wants to unmask him and says \"This Time I have to be sure\" before she kills him. Did he not break into her room just minutes before and try to kill her, C'mon. And this film further deviates as many of the sequels do, Michaels sole purpose was to kill his sisters, he killed the older sister in the original and kills his other sister in the opening of this movie further undermining the original story.

This is quite possibly the worst of the lot, and that says a lot considering how bad the last 4 of these movies have been. This film makes Season of the Witch seem like a cinematic masterpiece. The first 16 minutes of this clunker serve as a sort of prologue. In this part we see Jamie Lee, again proving why she is among (if not THE) worst actresses ever. The premise in which we discover why Michael still lives is laughable...come on, watch the paramedic walking around an accident scene while brandishing a large knife and tell me you didn't laugh at it. I'm guessing her appearance semi-served to identify this movie with the rest of the series, to \"validate\" it if you will. All it did was bore me.Then we get to the main premise which is actually something that showed promise: put some people in the Meyer's house on Halloween and do a webcast. But right away we get your generic ensemble of victims thrust upon us, and you find yourself not caring about them a bit. Why? Partly because you know nothing about them. Upon viewing the deleted scenes you see an extended version of the scene where they're all introduced, but as the director explains he felt it was too long and that he could more effectively introduce them with the scene used in the movie. He was wrong. The deleted scene, while a bit draggy (could've been streamlined though), actually was much better than what made the final cut. You end up not being able to get a clear feel for anyone in this film, and you honestly could care less what happens to them. Yes its a horror film, but some type of character development/introduction is still necessary for the film to work. Another shortcoming was the reasoning for them being in the house. I think it would have been suitable for them to be there as a publicity stunt, to put them in a scary place and see if they \"survive\" the webcast. Instead we're told that they're in there to \"find the truth, to find answers\" of why Mikey went bad. Bah. Anyway, the movie has its generic kills and a really uninspired ending.The whole concept of what Michael Meyers is/was (and why) has been misused, abused, and generally distorted. This movie, like most of the sequels, has no style and no sense of what the franchise should be. Its easily among the worst movies I've ever seen, a list that includes H2O as well.

But, sadly, the genre seems to have taken a powder over the past 10 years or so, particularly the last 5, I'd say, and this \"film\" is a perfect example: by now, one expects lackluster direction, lousy acting, and derivative storytelling but this one hits an all-time low, for it's a million other movies you've already seen, thrown into a blender, and left to stew in the sun to spoil even further. Worse still, for those fans of the \"Halloween\" installments, except for the opening sequence featuring Jamie Lee Curtis, this film bears little real relation to any other film in the series. The recycled ideas provided here as \"entertainment\" are nearly endless: teens being stalked by a killer? Too many other movies to count but let's start with \"Scream\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", to name a couple. Teens staying in a haunted house over night? Saw that in \"House On Haunted Hill\", \"The Haunting\", \"Night of the Demons\", you name it. Stupid people doing stupid things that cause their own deaths, or aid in it? Or horny teens getting whacked for doing what comes naturally? How 'bout \"Friday the 13th\"? Helpless, screaming, white heroine who can't do anything without a man around to save her? In this girl-power age, we don't see that much anymore but just about every older flick has it. A group investigating weird happenings while capturing it all on video? \"Blair Witch Project\" all over again. And, just like \"Blair Witch\", this is an unmitigated disaster all around. There isn't a single scare or moment of tension throughout, \"helped\" neither by a director who'd be hard-pressed to successfully direct a grammar-school play, let alone a big-budget film, nor a cast of unknowns who greatly deserve to stay that way. They're awful. Not one of them has any screen presence, or creates a character worth caring about (though of course there aren't any characters written, just stock figures from any other horror film). The only \"names\" of note - besides Curtis, who has little more than a Drew-Barrymore-in-\"Scream\" cameo - are model/\"actress\"/talk show hostess Tyra Banks and rap \"artist\"/\"actor\" Busta Rhymes, and when Banks and Rhymes are your biggest names, boy, are you in trouble! Imagine the producers talking this one over: \"Okay...the last installment had Michaael Myers killed in a very satisfying wrap-up of the series. How can we bring him back AND upset everyone who loved the films? Maybe we can kill off Jamie Lee Curtis! Yeah! But who to replace her with...? Hmmm... I know! Busta Rhymes! When I think of horror-movie legends, I think of Jamie Lee Curtis and Busta Rhymes. And maybe we can get one of those Victoria Secrets models? Any one of 'em will do. Let's get one who THINKS she can act but really CAN'T so we can kill HER off, too!\" Banks IS a bad actress (not Cindy-Crawford-in-\"Fair Game\" bad but close) and disappears, thankfully, about halfway through. Unfortunately, that means we're stuck with Mr Rhymes, whose idea of acting is screwing up his mouth and face in attempt to come off as 'street', with some out-of-nowhere Jackie Chan moves thrown in for the \"big\" finale. (Yes, you read right: Busta - taking himself seriously - breaks into pseudo-ninja action, complete with the vocal sounds you'd expect. He's so impressed with himself, and it's all so ridiculous, that you've just gotta laugh out loud.) Oh, and did I mention that for a physically huge and powerful, unstoppable killing machine, Michael Myers has the lithe grace and body control of a dancer because AT NO POINT IN TIME does his hulking presence on the steps or floorboards of a decades-old house create ANY noise whatsoever? I wasn't sure if I should be scared for the characters or impressed with the carpentry. Goodness knows the carpentry would be the ONLY THING to be impressed with.

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I have seen H8 and I must say \"Poor John Carpenter\".As many know, Carpenter will rarely divulge into a conversation about the sequels that followed Halloween.While being interviewed by John Stewart, for plugging Ghosts of Mars, Carpenter shrugged off the question of the numerous sequels that followed Halloween.Also, all the DVDs that are released of John Carpenter films, they have audio commentary - except Halloween. Not to mention that Carpenter turned down an offer to direct H20 because he felt that there was no reason to re-visit the film ... again.And with H8, I understand his apparent bitterness and annoyance with the many of the sequels that followed Halloween III.Halloween: Resurrection is a disgrace to Carpenter's 1978 classic. The film ignorantly (SPOILER ALERT)kill off Laurie Strode in such a non-suspenseful, quick fashion. But yet Busta Ryhmes schools Myers in a good ass whooping. Not to mention the film has no sense of - nor no attempt of - character development. You know absolutely nothing about their characters. Nothing. They are just there to be cannon fodder. H20 which took place in California, Myers and Laurie are back in Haddonfield (?)... which also inexplicably has it's own college university(!). The film also had no respect of Michael Myers, as Busta Ryhmes shoves a electrical wire into Myers' crotch. I won't even mention the film's loopy logic like the indestructible behavior by Michael (consider that this film picks up from H20 - which ignored all sequels after Part II), or characters who are strapped with cameras (with a worldwide web looking on) partake in sexual activities and smoking a bong. I know \"it's only a movie\". But why insult the viewer by trying to rationalize the film's incoherence.\n(END OF SPOILER)I am ashamed that Myers character is so poorly handled and that this cash cow is having its udders bruised. It's a shame that for those who complain of the stupidity of horror films, fans can not argue with such films like H8. It is simply idiotic. Apparently, even the studio thought nothing of this film because they did not allow a screening for critics. Logically handled because the studio don't want horrible reviews to affect potential box office grosses. The critics will have to pay to see the film like everyone else and will feature their review in Monday's paper. By then it's too late and H8 has already had a successful weekend. Take in mind that all of the prior Halloween films, NOES films and Jason films (yes, even JASON X) had a screening for critics. The studio obviously smelled a stinker with this one - which also explains a 1900 theater release as opposed to H20's 2600 theater count. And it's all deserved. H8 is a stinker - by far one of the worst sequels in the series. But those who like gore instead of a cohesive storyline and any sense of character development will enjoy it. Others beware. H8 is not awful, but it's not good either.And who do I blame ... yes, Moustapha Akkad who has apparently gone to the well once to often.And I also blame Kevin Williamson for rejuvinating the series with the ultra successful H20. He should've just not have made the film. Now, Akkad has a few more movies to rinse out of H20s success. It's a shame. Poor Carpenter. A great classic is being dragged through the mud. 3/10 or *1/2 out of 4 or D+. However, you rate it - it's just not good.",

But this movie is so bad even I cannot like it.Never has a movie productions company's financial motivation for the movie production been so glaringly obvious! Horrendous acting, an utter lack of respect for the most important character of the series by killing her off so quickly. The whole explanation of Michael Myers survival after H20 will have have you crying with laughter at its glaring unstated translation and who is actually saying it \"the last movie mad far more money than we expected, and we want to make more money as easy and quick as possible\"The camera work and lighting are terrible, the Michael mask abysmal, and a subtle as sledgehammer in the testicles attempt to be perceived as a \"modern\" movie by thrusting hand held PDA's time-after-time DA into the camera.The movie is like a parody of earlier 80's slasher movies (I kid you not, but a character finds a working chainsaw in the cupboard of an abandoned house!!!!!!!) if the film makers had an ounce of care about this movie they would never include such a horror parody in the movie, and would at all costs avoid including a chainsaw in the movie at all HALLOWEEN MOVIES DO NOT HAVE CHAINSAWS IN.I must have groaned at least 30 times watching this film.If you have not seen this film, no matter how much a Halloween or slasher movie fan you are I absolutely 100% guarantee you are going to hate this film. It is that bad. Avoid like you would do Leprosy.",

Cool J. in H20 over Busta Rhymes in this one, but that's not too problematic. Aside from Busta Rhymes, I liked the people in the movie, and the characters were fun. There were a few jarring moment, but those weren't that bad. Anyways, this one is a good movie and a fine addition to the Halloween legacy. 8/10",

This movie told what \"really happened\" at the end of Halloween:  H20 and updated us on what is currently taking place (three years after the last events occurred).  I thought the beginning was good.  I mean, where Laurie Strode ended up really shocked me.  What happened to her really shocked me. There were a lot of things that really shocked me.  There were a couple parts where it got sorta boring, but, I think the only reason I felt that way was because one of the people that I went with isn't really in to horror movies, and I didn't want him to be bored..lol, so in a way I was bored with him.  But, if i would have went by myself, I would have loved the entire film.  Anyway, I thought the ending was good, but what happened wasn't really surprising.  You wanna know my thoughts on making another one?  Bad Idea!  I mean, there is really no need to make another one, is there? Michael finally accomplished what he set out to do twenty four years ago. There isn't any reason to continue this franchise.  End it while it was good.  We don't want to ruin a good thing.  But, in conclusion, this was a good movie.",

            "content": "Oh boy! Yikes! Halloween Resurrection we got some serious reviewing to do.\nHalloween Resurrection is the eighth entry in the Halloween franchise following up three years after the events of Halloween H2O. At the end of H2O we see Laurie chop Michael's head off, well in the beginning of this movie they explain that Laurie accidentally killed the wrong person. Before Michael's body was loaded up into the van at the end of H2O, Michael chokes a paramedic and crushes his vocals, Michael does the old fashioned switch a roo stunt where Michael dresses up in the paramedic uniform and puts the now mute paramedic in the macanic uniform and mask. So apparently According to Halloween Resurrection, Michael escaped and never died and Laurie is placed in a mental institution for killing an innocent man. So that's how Halloween Resurrection was set up!. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, Michael finally kills Laurie Strode!. Sad day. From that point forward the movie is then carried out by a whole group of worthless idiots who all deserve to die!. On Halloween night, Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks host a reality TV show called \"Dangertainment\" where they put a group of contestants into the old Myers house where they must wander around with head wearing cameras and flashlights for the whole night. Well Michael decides to come back home and finds all these kids wandering through his house with cameras and flashlights and Van's all outside his house. So of course Michael picks them all off one by one.\nThis movie is probably the weakest of the franchise, not putting a whole lot of effort into making this a good Halloween sequel like H2O. This movie had ZERO scare factors and the acting was horrific. I'm highly surprised this movie was actually released in theaters!. This movie is so corny and low budget material that it should have been a straight to video release. There is a few scenes where Busta Ryhmes tries to do karate moves against Michael Myers and I legitimately couldn't tell if this was a REAL Halloween sequel or a SPOOF. Really Busta? Karate moves on Michael Myers!? Lol that's absolutely atrocious. This movie was so poorly done that it's a laugh out loud comedy. I'm a HUGE fan of Michael Myers and the Halloween franchise but this one ranks very low on my Halloween ranking scale. Even the mask in this movie was poorly made, I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a Michael Myers mask or a white chimpanzee face. Halloween Resurrection without a doubt has the WORST Michael Myers mask I've seen in any of the films. Even the Halloween 5 mask was better than this one. You dont care about any of the characters in this movie and you pretty much just want Michael to kill them all so the movie can end already!. Jamie Lee Curtis only lasted 15 minutes of this film and theres no Dr. Loomis or Marion Chambers. All of the original cast members have been killed off by this point of the franchise. So it's another reason the original Halloween series should have ended at H2O. This film has no true meaning to the franchise and is a very UNimportant sequel that doesnt need watching. But if you're a HUGE Halloween/Michael Myers buff like me then maybe check this one out at least once. I do own this movie on DVD and in my Halloween 10 disc set bluray collection but its STILL apart of the franchise so if you own all the other movies then you better pick this one up too. It is a fun cheesy guilty pleasure type slasher movie but nothing too impressive like Halloween 1 and 2 and 4 and H2O. Other than hardcore Halloween/Michael Myers/Horror fans I wouldn't recommend this to regular movie goers.My final rating for Halloween Resurrection: 6 out of 10",

Also the movie had so humor in it and I think Holloween shouldn't be about funny parts, that just makes it look like all the other horror movies out right now..

Its just more evidence that the genre is dead and it doesn't look like it will ever be the same again. I mean, I know a sequel never, or sometimes very rarely, will live up to its original. This one lived up to the 6th installment in the series, because I didn't find there to be much different from eachother. I mean, the characters were just awful, as well as the acting. And I have to wonder why Tyra Banks would EVER be cast in a horror movie, especially a Halloween film. Her character had almost no point, I mean all she did was sit there in front of the camera setup. But I was kind of relieved to see the end of Laurie Strode, but kind of sad in a way. I personally think she was an important part of the series. I don't think the rest o the sequels will be the same without the chance of her being there. She kinda made the films she was in complete. But, anyways, I don't have much more to say about this movie. Reccommended for Halloween fans. 5/10",

            "content": "This is a loose follow-up to H20 from 1998, a spin-off for want of a better word. It's not terrible, but it is fairly cheesy. As a fan of the Halloween series, I must say that this is an unnecessary addition to the series- not unWELCOME, but there just doesn't seem to be any reason why it was made. 1,2 & H20 focused on Michael vs Laurie, and 4,5 &6 focused on Michael vs Jamie. This is Michael vs bunch of disposable teens. Greed obviously led to the making of this film (duh!), but I'll get off my soapbox and review the damn thing.The opening scene with Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) felt very short, and it was OK. Her death cheapens H20, but I liked the fact that Myers was built up as more menacing in this film, as opposed to the watered down H20 version (no pun intended). Good throat-slash w/ the guard and a rather strange angle as Myers frames a mental patient for Laurie's killing. Why? 2 things bugged me early on:A) no mention of John (Josh Hartnett)- a passing reference would have done.B) the explanation for how Myers isn't dead was ludicrous (even for a fan who suspends disbelief for most of these films!) So Myers switched clothes with a paramedic and Laurie killed the medic- how could the medic NOT be dead after (1) having his larynx crushed, (2) being hit by the coroner's van [and sitting up immediately after- H20] and (3) being crushed by the van after it rolls down the hill!! Bloody hell!Besides this, the rest of the film is very average. The kills are very good (knife through skull, impalement on spike [a la H6], the rip-off/homage to 'Peeping Tom'- the tripod leg through the throat, etc.) and, like Valentine, is almost the best part of the film. The characters are criminally underdeveloped, even lead girl Sara (Bianca Kajlich- Boston Public).This may sound unbelievable, but Busta Rhymes saved this film from being TOTALLY crap. His jive-talkin' face-to-face w/ Myers was just ridiculous, but also amusing at the same time. He delivered the two best lines of the film: 1- \"Trick or treat...[LOOKS MYERS UP AND DOWN].. Mothaf**ka!\" and 2- \"Hey Mikey, Happy f**kin' Halloween!!\" The fact that they had to resort to the comedy speaks volumes, but it was very funny.Michael makes his obligatory return from the grave at the end (of course) opening the door for Halloween 9. (If they cast Nelly in that I swear to god..!) They should only make a ninth if Josh Hartnett returns.I liked the opening credits (it was cool to hear the theme for the first time in a cinema) and the theme was done very well.CONCLUSION: Laurie's exit isn't memorable, the teens aren't written well and the number of jump moments was a bit OTT, but the kills were good and the Sara-'Deckard' thing was done well from a tension point of view, and Busta Rhymes was hilarious. 6 or 7 out of 10.",

They really tried to shoehorn it all in to this film.It's just so damn silly. And you have to consider what we've gotten out of a lot of slasher sequels. But it has such a cornball plot and flimsy dialog. Interspersed with shakey, grainy cam footage, which is really just pretty obnoxious. If the reality show, the unwitting viewers and participants weren't enough, we get actual kung fu. Which is one of the silliest and stupidest action scenes in a Halloween movie.This is the sequel that nobody wanted, and I see why. It was so unnecessary. Everything about it was the image of a Halloween movie trying to be made for MTV. And to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of H2O. This entire canon didn't need to exist. But that was still a much better movie than this.That being said, it's still not my most hated Halloween film. I'd rather watch this again than Rob Zombie's Halloween II.

Putting Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in this film...fail. Busta Rhymes brings two aspects to this film that do not belong in a Halloween film...hip hop arrogance and kung-fu. I like hip hop music, and I sure as hell love to see kung-fu. However, I do NOT want to see kung-fu in a Halloween film. I don't want to see Busta Rhymes making his stupid @$$ comments in a Halloween film. Tyra Banks: a role model to many. Personally, I just think she's annoying, now. She certainly has no place in a Halloween film. What else about this film shoots itself in the foot? Sean Patrick Thomas is a good actor. He was great in movies like The Barber Shop and a lot of teen movies during the '90s. Where he does not fit in is a Halloween film. Just, no. I can't explain it. Thomas Ian Nicholas is a similar situation. I thought he was hilarious in the American Pie films (and I love the original three American Pies), and he was good in Rookie of the Year. Does he belong in a Halloween film? No. He just didn't fit into the whole equation. I think one shining performance, which isn't saying a whole lot, because the acting in this film is not convincing, comes from Bianca Kajlich. She's good at being absolutely petrified and running from Michael. However, who the hell decided that it was a good idea to hire an actress for a leading female role in a Halloween film when she can't scream? That's right. She can't scream. So they had to ADR screams into the film for her in post production. In retrospect this film should never have been made. Halloween H20 was where it should have ended. Laurie beheaded Michael, and that was that. However, they just had to go back and use the holes in the time line between Michael falling through the table after being stabbed repeatedly by Laurie and the time that he gets tagged, bagged and put into the meat wagon as a means to come up with a very shaky situation to explain how Michael had survived that night. It's all bull$hit. Apparently an EMT went into the school, got his larynx crushed by Michael, and Michael switched clothes with him. So in all the confusion, Michael walks away, free to kill again, and a helpless EMT gets beheaded by Laurie. She gets institutionalized, and ultimately gets killed by Michael after a botched attempt to kill him when he finally decides to come after her. Horrible, just horrible. You know when the PC freezes because Windows f-cking sucks, and then finally it just crashes? Well, that's what this movie is, pretty much. However, there is one cool thing about this film. The use of webcams adds an interesting aspect to this film. Rick Rosenthal directed this, and he also directed the original Halloween II. So, he recycles some gags and features that he utilized in Halloween II. The webcams are very reminiscent of the security cameras and monitors in the hospital in Halloween II. Bianca Kajlich (Sarah) slips and falls on a huge puddle of blood, much like Lance Guest did in Halloween II. There are others in the film, but I thought I'd just mention the two most prominent ones. Overall, this film is very ineffective and weak when compared to many of the other Halloween films. I give it a 3 out of 10.",

I don't mind a little humor mixed in with a horror movie but we go to get scared. Every line that Busta Rhymes spoke made we want to projectile vomit onto the screen. He was absurd and had no business in this movie. The producers just sold this series out to the teenagers because they know they don't have an original idea left in their puny brains.Busta Rhymes made an a$$ out of Michael Meyers (and himself).

I did everything I could to keep from throwing up when he spoke. I got a stomach ache every time Busta Rhymes entered a scene. Then Busta Rhymes scolds Michael and Michael cowers down and leaves. Michael Meyers, the psychotic killer, is afraid of a rapper with a big mouth. Yeah, right. This is an obvious sell-out and the producers should be rewarded with bankruptcy.

            "content": "\"Halloween: Resurrection\" has the wrong title, first of all. The original title, \"Halloween: Homecoming\" would have better suited this movie. Second of all, the lead girl (played by Bianca Kajlich) was woefully miscast (her acting is fine until she starts screaming, it was some of the most unrealistic acting I have ever seen in a horror movie). Third, the whole reality concept was fun about two years before this film got made.I am not sure what the filmmakers were thinking. Rick Rosenthal, who directed a flawed but decent \"Halloween II\" in 1981, doesn't seem to have a grasp on what makes a horror movie work. Though I liked the camera effects used in this (FINALLY, Michael Myers is walking in slow-motion), I felt that the characters were poorly written (almost to an extreme) and the character of Freddie Harris played by rapper Busta Rhymes was particularly annoying.The ending, while predictable, made me laugh because it almost fooled me into thinking that he would NOT open his eyes. How lame of me!",

But we have to stop some day because, you know, I have other films that I have to review. So, without further a 2002, this is 'HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION!' PROS: The best thing about this film is the premise; a bunch of sexy teenagers (lead by Bianca Kajlich) who are chosen to star in a reality show where they have to stay the night in Michael Myers' house. Awesomeness! This is the last one that included Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), as she is killed off early in the film. All the actors in the film were good but not great. Tyra Banks has a small part as a character named Nora Winston, but I'll get to her later. The mask was pretty good, it seemed like the costume supervisor was more professional than the idiots who did the rest of them. They even managed to fit the original theme in! That's mostly what I can talk about, there wasn't any drama or anything. But, still goooooooooooood.CONS: Tyra Banks, in this film, she wasn't really needed. She was just there probably for market value. You don't even get to see her death. Busta Rhymes, again, should have been replaced with a REAL actor. Get this straight, Hollywood... RAPPER'S SHOULDN'T ACT! And neither should rabbits! They just ruin the film with their urban bullshit! Some of the dialogue was stupid. But, it's the best of the sequels to me.See this mo' fucka!

            "content": "Halloween Resurrection is the eighth film is the Halloween franchise, it's one of those that's been going on a long time such as 'Nightmare On Elm Street' & 'Friday The 13th' but like the latter these films are just about drying up.Resurrection finds a group of teens entering the birth home of Michael Myers for a special web-cast that will be broadcast live. The teens are to spend the night there and find answers to the big mystery of Michael Myers. But Michael intends to crash the party LIVE.This film i enjoyed and i cant understand why so many people hate it, i found it to be a good way to spend a couple of hours with a classic icon that is Michael Myers.The opening of this film is quite interesting, and opens with Michael trying to kill Laurie something he's been attempting to do for quite sometime. The opening to the film i thought was great but just a little too short to give me the satisfaction of ending that particular era of Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a good performance as this battered, beaten down woman and i think she can be satisfied with the performance as can the viewer.The film then turns to a different level with the film turning into one of those teen slasher films, now while usually this would be a terrible route for a horror film with Halloween in the title, it uses story as reasoning for Michael killing people. These teens have come into his home and so that is the reasoning for killing the teens.The acting is mediocre at best, the best performances have to go to Jamie Lee Curtis and Brad Loree who portrays Michael. Loree really gives a performance to Michael that we really haven't seen since the original, he also looks menacing which always helps, he should definitely be considered for future Michael outings! Busta Rhymes definitely puts in the worst performance of the entire cast, he portrays a guy that in his words \"just wanna give America a good show' well Busta you didn't so don't bother doing it anymore.The set design is creepy and the darkness throughout really makes you cringe not knowing if Michael is in the shadows waiting and i think that is such a clever usage of the lighting.Now this film does something interesting as far as cinematography is concerned. The story has the cast wearing head cams that films everything they see and a lot of the films footage is this sort of stuff with the head cam. I liked that idea and thought it worked quite well throughout the film and made it much more interesting, as though you were there with the actual characters in the film.Of course deaths are always important in a film like this and Michael has his fair share in this outing. To name a few, Decapitation, Stabbing, and a clever use of a tripod. The deaths are really what we've seen before so don't expect anything original here.The direction is all over the place with some bits like the opening done well while other seem like like he has let the cast run wild.So what's bad about the picture then? well i think the main problem has to be that Michael just keeps coming back and i think that is a real problem when they kill him off in one film and then decide hes not for the next film. Also this film seems to ignore Halloween films 3,4,5,6 which seems pointless but hey this is Hollywood.Overall i enjoyed this film, it had some good scares in places and the opening really intrigued me and sit up and pay attention. While the acting is sour and Busta Rhymes is just the most annoying guy in the whole film, this picture works and i think if you're looking for a little piece of horror to get your teeth into then look no further than this, its no masterpiece but its no piece of crap either.****** out of **********",

Wasn't this so called \"imposter\" trying to kill Jamie Lee in that whole end sequence that lead to her axe swing? Does a crushed larynx suddenly turn one into a crazed copycat killer? The gore was as minimal as all post scream horror. Since when do people die the very second their throat is cut? I would like to have seen some twitching at least. The nudity was also as minimal. The girl who briefly loses her top never even faces the camera! Is this a slasher flick or an after school special? If you're going to make a suck horror film at least give us lots of gore and gratuitous nudity. I couldn't get anyone to see this with me, so I went alone.

Let's start off with the good stuff-Michael himself: 1st off- The mask is awesome, & that is OH SO important to me! (you can imagine my dislike for the mask in part 5 UGH) 2nd- Brad Loree. I've read in the latest FANGO that he watched all the Halloween movies to prepare for his role as The Shape and good god does it show! My hat is off to him! He was amazing! DEAD ON! He delivered perhaps the best Michael in 20 some odd years. Brutal. Machine like. Unstoppable. This man did his homework. Thank you Mr. Loree, you have ALL of my respect! Michael's @ his \"head tilting, admiring his handiwork, hiding in the shadows\" best!Jamie Lee Curtis: She is wonderful! Her + Myers = Magic! No question! The onscreen time that they share together, (even though its not very long) ignites the screen. Memorable to say the least!\nThe Music: I want to personally thank whomever was responsible for the decision to use not just the main theme, but to use almost ALL of the original music! It's just about all there & sounding better than ever!Rick Rosenthal: He brought all of his tricks with him from part 2. There's is NO question in my mind. This man knows how to do Halloween. Some really smart camera work & GREAT usage of the internet theme (something I was REALLY worried about btw) makes for a VERY entertaining bit of film making! The last half an hour of the film is fast paced & as intense as you could possibly get. Great job Mr. R! Please continue your work in the genre!The Killings: Brutal, bloody, fast & furious! \"The Rage\" Michael has inside of him has NEVER been more apparent. The blood flows freely but is in no way overdone.The Opening Scene: For a little over a minute long opening sequence it manages to somehow tie the series together in a very pretty package. Again, great stuff from Rosenthal.\nNow the not so good-Busta Rhymes: While for the most part he pulls it off, there are some lines that he flubs horribly, & his fighting scenes with Michael came off kind of Goofy at times. This is due to him making these kind of mock Bruce Lee fighting screams during the fight. Although i'll say this, Michaels reaction to Busta's posturing is priceless! The two also share one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series together.\nThe storyline: The Laurie Strode stuff aside, this is without question one of the weakest plots of all of the Halloween films. Yet, IMO it's still way better than the silliness of parts 5 & 6. I never dug the whole Michael is the enforcer of some druid cult thing. The makers of those movies went out of their way to explain why Michael was evil. Why he was evil never mattered to me. I like it better just having him as a killing machine without the backstory. As I stated before Michael is back in TOP FORM!The script: Some lines in this movie are PAINFUL! I needn't quote any, you'll hear them for yourself!All in all, a worthy entry in the series & easily one of the best sequels to date. Halloween fans will not be disappointed by this one, although i'm certain some will find alot more things wrong with it than I have. You can't please everyone. Once again, Michael has come home. More vicious than ever. I'm putting out the Welcome Mat & running for my life!",

I said a couple of those during the film, but I also scream a lot too. The scene with the guy in the clown mask scared the crap out of me, and Jamie Lee Curtis in her that's it your going down act was awesome. She played a crazy person quite well and Bianca Kajlich; even though I've never heard of her she's a really cool scream queen. One thing I wish they had answered was. Why is Michael like that? They sent 6 people in his house to answer that question but they never did. Oh well I can wait for the next one. I hope there'll be a next one it needs to live on. I was introduced to the Halloween series through one of the 3-6 ones but I wanted to know the origin of it, now I can't get enough of it. So I think the teens of my generation who are into this genre would like this series. I know lots of teens that like these kinds of series like Jason, Freddy, and others but Michael Myers is the one who scared me the most, it's the white face with the dark eyes.

Although, I watched H20 again and saw that it was highly unlikely that that actually DID happen in the world of Michael Myers. If it truly was like that, he would have taken the mask off at the end of H20. Would anyone NOT notice they have a f***ed up Captain Kirk mask on them?

Also, as far as the improbability of Michael getting into his old house unseen, there are a lot of nut-jobs who were probably walking around Haddonfield with Michael Myers masks on. After while it becomes old hat. Ole' Mikey wasn't seen for 23 years (or so they say) so I doubt the cops would be on 24/7 watch on the old Myers place. You'd be lucky for a 2-3 times a night drive by with a flashlight out the patrol car window \"surveillence.\" For example, look at that idiot Busta Rhymes during the film walking around in HIS M.M. wardrobe trying to cash in on a cheap scare or two to boost ratings for \"Dangertainment.\" For the record, I found the explanation for Micheal's survival at the end of H2O very plausible & ditto with Laurie's death in H.R. Afterall, it really wasn't Michael that did Laurie in (she had him dead to rights), it was a combination of HER uncertainty & his cunning. The camera on the heads of the would-be victims was a nice touch. And in regards to their poor acting, I think that this was intentional because they're reflections of most of the real life wannabes we all see on those crappy \"reality shows\"-no real talent & can't act worth a damn.

From now on, I will ignore any instinct like the one I had tonight.  I knew something good was happening when the first show we went to see was actually \"sold out\".  We ended up having to catch the latest possible showing of this movie, and hey, better late then never!This was the greatest Halloween movie since the first one.  They should have just skipped over the travesty that was Halloween 2-7 and just jumped to this one.  This movie had everthing that was missing from the other ones. It went back to the old days when horror movies were actually about scaring the hell out of people.  There hasn't been a movie that has been able to actually make me jump out of my seat and scream since Friday the 13th, which I saw 10 years ago at the ripe age of 9.  Yes, the plot is a little worn out...spending the night in Micheal's abandoned house, Micheal's there, blah, blah, blah.  But honestly, when was the last time a truly original plot has been seen in movies, be it action, drama, comedy, etc?  The one thing that this movie had that previous horror movies didn't was smartness, and of course, great jump out of your seat and scream scenes.  (The one that got my friends was the flashback in the beginning).  It also had some pretty funny scenes too.  (My favorite, along with everyone in the theater was the whole \"Micheal meets Micheal in the hallway\" scene :0D)  All in all, without giving away the plot, this movie is excellent and you should go see it riiiiiiiiight now :)",

They tell how laurie strode decapitated a man that (get this) WAS NOT michael myers. As it happened, michael myers took a paramedic, disabled his trachea by halfway choking him, so he cannot talk,  and put the mask on him, outfit and all, gave him the knife, and gave him a little push in lauries direction. If youve seen h2o, you know what happens. She kills him. Now she is in a mental hospital. Michael shows up, yadda yadda yadda, tried to kill her. She has an elaborate scheme fixed up to kill him. She leads him to the roof, ,where a rope and crane lift him up. Preparing to cut the rope to make him drop to his death, laurie sees michael trying (fake, obviously,) to get his mask off. Thinkin again, she might have gotten the wrong man again, she goes to take his mask off to check if its him. Big wow. He grabs her, and they fall of the roof. What follows is she gets stabbed, and dies. Michael is once again on the loose.\nSix kids get the chance to spend the night in myers house. They all go in, expecting nothing bad. Well, they get killed off one by one, by michael myers. People are watching all over the internet. One boy, Deckard, who is watching, and knows the one girl in the house (the only girl that survives) delivers messages to her, through her palm pilot. Messages like HE IS IN THE HOUSE. Or MICHAEL IS IN THE BEDROOM. Or even the spine tingling HE IS BEHIND YOU or something like that.Ever wonder where michael stayed all this time?? Well, turns out, there was a dungeon like room in  the basement, hidden by lock and key, and, well, concrete. Turns out michael has been hiding out, down there. Wanna know how he survived?? He ATE RATS!!!The inevitable cliff hanger ending left it open for a sequel, which in no question WILL be made. Not worse than Jason X, thats for sure. Some people actually tried fighting michael. Like, one guy played a game of swords with butcher knife, against butcher knife. But in the end, only two survive. Busta is one of them. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

The ingredients must be of the following.1. Dean Cundey\u00b4s art of cinemathography 2. Rosenthal or Carpenter\u00b4s direction 3.The same creepy facemask, which Michael Myers used in the first and second Halloween, the modern mask doesn\u00b4t measure up. 4. Let Nick Castle or Dick Warlock play the Shape. 5.Finally make it a bit more brutal and graphic,I gave it a 8 out of 10",

Like the makers of Jason X, The creative force behind this latest frightfest have tried rock the boat by bringing the Myers saga into the twenty-first century by putting him into Reality Television, does it work? Hmmm, herein lies my bug bear, you see i'm the kinda guy who'll go to see a movie, if it's written by a certain someone or likewise directed.Homecoming was written,including the original story by Larry Brand, Now he was the man, who in a former life, who remade the Roger Corman remake of the \"Masque of The Red Death\" starring if memory serves Adrian(Highlander & Highlander Endgame) Paul plus the Miles O'Keefe psycho thriller \"The Drifter\" now both the film's linger in the mind for the one simple fact that both were made with a snail's eye view to pacing and storytelling.This however cannot be said to be the same of the eighth incarnation of terror, a lightning fast paced story, which if i was to be honest, when you watch the opening, you feel like you were watching the ending, which brings back Jamie Lee Curtis if only briefly, Plus it also allows time for those who might have forgotten how H20 ended, with a brief recap, although within that brief interlude the writer somehow as he does manages to tell us the viewer that Jamie Lee did not infact decapitate her brother Michael, but some other poor unfortunate.This for me had me groaning as indeed was the fact that the Tick Rosenthal, than man behind part two had returned to the director's chair for this one. If anyone out there remembers the opening credits of the second one, the old time song Mr Sandman played at the beginning, it also turned up likewise at the start of H20.It has become apparent that with Rosenthal, that what you see is what you get, just like Halloween 2, Halloween 8 is a rehash of the do's and don't that should not apply to the horror film, specifically Rosenthal's film. Although in fairness he didn't write the film. However anyone thinking that putting this writer and director together on this particular film, should only take a quick glance at their respective filmographies, not a single winner between them.But hey! This is a horror film with an already established franchise, and yes thei idea of reality t.v. is a winner, the execution is very tiresome. Incase i forget, for fans of Italian Horror, In Particular Dario Argento, listen out for periodical outbursts of the child like theme that was present in Argento's \"Deep Red\"P.S Should i rate this film something out of ten, Hhhmm, 7/10 for the story but -0/10 for the execution.",

We see the Myers in a typical family barbeque with Judith hoola-hooping, Lori a newborn and Michael by the back door with his body turned away from the camera. As he is ignored to get away he turns around staring at the camera with a homicidal look in his eyes, we go closer into his eyes to a black tunnel and Lori's introduction.

            "content": "I remember when this movie came out a lot of people including me were excited but wondered how it could even be possible. Considering the events of H20 with Michael Myers getting killed due to decapitation. I thought this would be very confusing and would need to be explained. I was glad that the Laurie Strode character was braught back and they explained the whole story that it wasn't Michael Myers but a paramedic that Michael switched places with. And Laurie Strode was put into a insane asylum. But then when she was killed off too easily by Michael Myers in the beginning of the film no sooner did the film go downhill.The opening story goes like this. Some teenage kids are picked in some contest to spend the night in the Myers house where Michael Myers once lived. It was some goofball reality show decided to hosts the contest and pick teenagers to go into the house. Needless to say this was a early silly plot. While the Myers house did look slightly dark and would fit almost with Michael Myers being a killer, I just couldn't see the logic of this story. This film has way too many downsides to it.1. Weak plot. I never could understand why Michael Myers killing Laurie Strode was at the start of the film. In H20 Michael had to break into someones home and find the info on where she was located and living. In this film he just shows up at the hospital where she was. No explanation as to how he did this. And Laurie Strode got killed way too easily. I think she should had been more active in the film considering she was traced back to the very first film. And to kill her off that easily and that quick just didn't do it for me. And while the back story to Michaels survival was interested and it did show Michael wasn't just a killer in a mask but very smart and cunning, why didn't the guy who he switched places with just take off the Michael Myers mask and reveal himself to Laurie before she killed him? Yeah he couldn't talk but he still could remove his mask. Couldn't he? 2. I never saw the logic how Haddonfield would let some reality show let kids into a killers house like that. And there were no police officers there to keep things safe. I thought with a well known killers past, their would have been tons of police outside the Myers house. And did you notice house the house was so easily axcessable? People could just walk into the house. 3. I didn't like Michael Myers in this film. He didn't have the dark creepy presence he did in previous films. He was just a guy in a mask. That's it. It didn't have the same feel. 4. Busta Rhymes. Up until this film I didn't even know who the hell this guy was. But I found his character really annoying. The whole using kung fu on Michael was so stupid and pointless and made Michael look very stupid. This was a attempt by the film maker to add comedy to Michael Myers. In other words it made fun of him. This is a rule you never break in a series because it makes the killer look very weak and foolish. This is why Paramount Pictures said to the director of Friday the 13th part 6 Jason Lives. The director was told do not make fun of Jason by putting him into situations of comedy and corniness. And that's what the director of Halloween Resurrection did with Michael. 5. And during the scenes where people were watching the whole thing in the Myers house go down and people getting killed why didn't anyone try to call the police? Or how no one in the neighborhood even heard what was going on.This movie just didn't do it for me. I thought with Jammie Lee Curtis in the film it would be more exciting and have a Halloween feel to it. But to kill her off and mislead the fans was just insulting. This movie didn't have the Halloween feel to it. They could have done a better job with this film but failed. I don't know if this film is worse then the Rob Zombie remakes but overall it wasn't a good film. Pass on it",

However, the rather flimsy and implausable reason given for Myers' 'resurrection' is by no means the most offensive flaw in the film. No, that would be the casting of rapper Busta Rhymes. Playing a cunning internet entrepeuner who plans to show a live webcast of a group of students exploring the house where Michael lived as a child, Rhymes displays a complete lack of talent and ability to act. The inclusion of a rap icon proved successful with LLCoolJ in H20 - who brought humour to the role and provided the script with a carefully limited dose of comedic value. However, Rhymes is annoying, loud and very rarely talks in comprehensible sentences. He gurns his way through the film, performs an embarrassing display of martial arts against Myers, and generally smacks of the producers attempting to include as many aspects into the film that they deem popular with the audience - thus gaining maximum box-office returns.It has been clear that producer Moustapha Akkad sees the series as nothing more than a sure-fire way to pay the mortgage, but never has it been so evident as in 'Resurrection'. Without giving anything away, the first ten minutes of the film are completely unnecessary and poorly executed, leaving what should be the series' most poignant sequence looking like the most amateurish and embarrassing; in what is supposed to be a steady tracking shot down a corridor, the camera actually wobbles.Rick Rosenthal (who more than competently handled 'Halloween 2') however, can not be entirely blamed for the film's downfall. The script is uningaging and often embarrassing and sorely missing any of the psycho-babble that Donald Pleasance used to spout in the previous films. That - the only adult or intelligent aspect of the previous films which set the Halloween series apart from its evil cousin 'Friday the 13th'- has now completely disappeared, replaced with a focus on a bland, indistinguishable group of teenagers being methodically buthchered in 'inventive' ways.\nHowever, the film does manage to create a few moments of well crafted suspense. Although the whole intenet aspect is a naff attempt to bring the series into the 21st century (previously failing in 'My Little Eye'), the sequence where one of the characters must follow instuctions from an internet user who can watch Michael's every move is genuinely tense. For a moment. The final scenes are also well carried out - were it not for the presence of Busta Rhymes. The setting of the house proves to be quite spooky at times, although when it is realised that all the scary artifacts from Michael's childhood have merely been set up, any potential for an exploration of Michael's evil is immediately lost.Of course , for general horror fans, 'Resurrection' will still prove entertaining, though not at all on the same levels as the first two outings or H20, but for die-hard fans of the series, the half-hearted execution of (practically every aspect of) the film (even the music is dire) and undoing of the perfect conclusion to the series in H20, will cause serious frustration.",

Then again, who else but a fan would have seen the film or be curious enough to read reviews of it?The first Halloween was brilliant.  Definately one of the best horror movies ever and a very entertaining and creepy movie.  I guess it hooked me for the rest but one of the cool things about Michael Myers is the fact that he is fairly \"real\" for a slasher movie.  He is strong and hard to kill but human and he has an M.O.  He wants to kill his family and anyone in his way.\nAnd that's my biggest problem with this sequel.  He's hunting people that are doing an internet show from the house he grew up in (yeah, that'd be real popular - the sad fact is most people don't have broadband connections at home, so why not just make it a tv show?  Not a big deal though). There are several instances in the series where Michael ignored people who aren't in his way so this seemed fairly gratuitous.  Also, the six kids who are doing the show are just plain boring.  Not likeable, not annoying, just THERE.  The kills are what you expect out of a horror movie - brutal.  Not many \"false scares\" of people bumping into each other fortunately.  Still, the kills aren't very inventive.  There is nothing here you haven't seen before.I personally was a little annoyed that it ignored Halloween 4-6.  H20 didn't refer to those but it also didn't contradict them.  This one has two or three small references that infer that 4-6 never occurred.Anyway, this one's totally a filler.  Nothing significant is added to the mythology in any way.  It's just a guy killing people for no real reason. Decent acting and directing, just... no real reason for any of it.  I give it a generous 6 out of 10.",

This is an absolutely putrid excuse for a Halloween film, and this is coming from a life-long fan. The original is my favorite film of all time. To say that I am disappointed by Director Rick Rosenthal (who also directed the best of the sequels, Halloween 2) is putting it lightly. The casting is just ridiculous. Busta Rhymes?! WTF is he doing in a Halloween movie? No excuse for it, none. Bianca Kajlich has to be the most boring female lead I've seen in a long time. You never learn enough about her to care and she's never convincing. The rest of the cast has so little personality that they are hard to remember after you see the film. I know they are simply there for Michael to kill, but can they at least be slightly entertaining? Can I care about somebody? Even H5 had better characters and that's saying something. I never missed Loomis more than I did watching this trash. The only upsides to the film are Michael himself and Jamie Lee's cameo. Michael's mask looks better than it has since 2, and he keeps the more aggressive style he had in H20. But other than that this thing sucked up one side of the hill and down the other. I can't believe that H6 is widely considered the worst in the series when you have this and part 5. 6 has much better acting and characters in one frame than this garbage. And it's scarier. Where were the scares beyond the first ten minutes? It's way too dumb to be scary. Donald Pleasence must be turning in his grave.",

Although I cannot say whether they leave the ending open for a further film this is a character that I find appealing in that he is genuinely scary and therefore I hope the films continue.I like the fact the he is now older where as in the first one I think he was in his early 20's. For some reason older people are scarier in films, I do not know why, perhaps because we cannot see ourselves as old, even if we are.The next film after this one needs to be better written with a more involving plot. Perhaps he could be in an institution, an isolated patient, wearing his mask because he freaks out if he takes it off. They need to make him a little more human and a little less like a cyborg.

Of course, Myers is alive after H20, and returns home to find out that his house has been occupied by a group of teens holding an internet webcast. This movie continues along the lines of H20, assuming that the house has been deserted since Myer's childhood. But in Halloween 6, remember that members of the Strode family move in the Myers house and refurnish it. But I guess that is getting into too much detail for a 7th sequel. Above all, Busta Rhymes gives a great performance and would recommend seeing it for some good scares and some good gore. **+ out of ****.

            "content": "As a major horror fan I've seen a lot of crap in the past but crap horror is certainly a genre that can be tolerated and enjoyed in the right frame of mind - there's no way I'd own all the Friday the 13th movies on video if not.Over the years I've been particularly forgiving of the \"Halloween\" series mainly because I think the first movie is an outright classic and the characters it created were certainly good enough to continue as a franchise - the series since then has had it's ups and downs but Halloween:H20, the 7th sequel was in my opinion a great film - it captured the mood of the original, brought back important members of the original cast and the ending was an absolutely perfect way to finish the franchise - with this in mind, why go on?Well as fat execs sat around the table the thought of an 8th sequel popped in to their brains. Clearly by this time nobody could care less about the movie anymore because nothing decent story-wise could be further developed - no, this time around money was clearly the only motivation.SPOILER! In my opinion Halloween:Resurrecion makes two fatal errors {or rather director Rick Rosenthal who should have known better does}. For starters, and simply put it's just awful. The set-up is far too gimmicky and sets the movie in a very limited time scale {clothes aside Halloween could have been in any era}. The film's characters are a horrible bunch of charisma-free smart arses who spew a lot of cultural references that are obvious now but in just a few years will mainly be rendered obsolete. I'm afraid to say I cared not an iota about one single character in the movie and could certainly remember only a few of their names just a few moments after leaving the cinema. They're all horror movie cliches which I thought we'd done a long time ago - post modern 90's horror belongs in the nineties.Characters aside though is the movie scary? A resounding no on that scale - for one if your characters are unlikeable then you'll be rooting for them to get it not to run away. Deaths are unimaginitive, lots of them are offscreen {not a bad thing if done with suspense} and most shocks are achieved with musical stabs and characters jumping out on each other. Secondly, I thnk an attempt at humour was made during filming but somewhere it got lost - what may have seemed a cool idea in production just doesn't work on screen - Busta Rymes character for a start practising Bruce Lee-style kung-fu on Michael Myers. I also hear that the ending was re-shot to make it better - if this was the case then I dread to thnk what they rejected - I'm afraid making the audience believe the killer is dead and finishing with him opening an eye is so hackneyed - I think they used that one in a Friday the 13th fifteen years previously.To it's credit the film does have one great scene when the Rymes character is dresed as Michael Myers only to encounter the real killer - this flash of ingenuity only depresses you further as you think what could have been.Man more questions go unanswered? Why do the group all end up alone in such a tiny house? Why does nobody hear anyone else scream? Who's controlling the net cameras that follow Michael around the house {and why don't they tell anyone about it?} and why seemingly is only one group of teenagers watching the damn broadcast in  the first place? {Oh yeah I forget so the contrived \"text messaging\" ending can take place}Most importantly and I'm sorry to go on is the lack of respect the film displays for the previous movies {specifically 1, 2 and H20}. By killing Laurie Strode they're messing with a formula - one that has been around since 1978 when Halloween 1 came out. To simply kill off a lead after so long changes the way you see the original because no matter how much you root for her you know that ultimately Michael will kill her. H20 wrapped things up so perfectly and so satisfyingly that there was simply no need to continue. At least a decent justification of the sequel would have sufficced but Resuurection's explanation of \"oh it was someone else\" just does NOT cut it.I can only hope now that either a Halloween 8 will be made {because Resuurection has no number as it were} to wrap things up properly again. If not however I will simply block this film from memory and assume H20 was the end of the saga.Dimension Films, Rick Rosenthal and Moustpha Akkad - hang your heads in shame for the irony of making \"Resurrection\" the complete opposite!

The movie was good i think the begining was kind of cheesy but a nice ring to it because after Micheal killed Lauri that one patient that Micheal gave his knife to and told Micheals biography made the beginning more spectacular and the key words NOW HE'S BACK and the laugh and then the music made the movie good. Probably the most violent and yet funny halloween i've seen but probably the script out of the series. In the past Halloween movies after the 1st and 2nd the Myers house always looked different but this movie brought back the original house which made the movie better.

I have nothing against him as an actor. But he should really stay out of horror films. Every line he said had Mutha in it and well it just stunk. If the line itself didn't stink then his delivery ruined all hope of it making sense. Script. The dialogue stunk most of the time. It seemed forced. Also the characters didn't seem nervous enough about the things they found in the house. I know I'd have been jumping at any sound if I was in the house of a murderer. Overall I give the movie a 6/10. A must see for horror fans. But a sickening display of artistic license for Halloween fans.",

Halloween 6 was utter rubbish, saying goodbye to the legendary Loomis who is killed in H6. I then watched H20 and quite frankly the only thing good in the H20 was Jamie Lee Curtis. Then I found out about this \"Halloween 8\" coming out and since Jamie Lee Curtis was on top of the credits list, I went especially to the premier. Halloween Resurrection starts off well with Laurie Strode (Curtis) in a mental hospital trying to keep safe from the evil Michael Myers who has SURVIVED yet again in the Halloween H20. Michael kills numerous guards of the mental hospital including drowning a man by locking him in a washing machine which in my opinion is just pathetic, finally after the almost-funny murders, he get's to the room of Laurie Strode and here comes the worst part of all! He kills Laurie! It is with out a doubt the worst thing that's ever happened in the Halloween series. I thought I'd seen it all when they'd killed Loomis back in H6 but no they have to kill the main source to the series.Right now that they've killed all the original characters, it's not even worth watching. Mike Rosenfeld (director) has tried to bring the Halloween series to a new generation by casting \"cool\" characters. The first is the ridiculous Busta Rhymes who's acting was truly awful and supermodel Tyra Banks who in my opinion was just casted to promote the film and not that she could act (well she can't act so there!) Then the plot goes so stupid that I was actually considering leaving the premier half way through! I admit it was kind of a good storyline bringing six young wannabes into the childhood home of Michael Myers and making a reality show, but they made it funny. If it was a separate movie altogether I would consider it being good but it's not a Halloween movie. It's cheap compared to the original Halloween, it's more of a comedy than a horror!The director then tries to \"scare\" us by Michael Myers killing everyone in the house but the murders are so predictable and is a trillion miles away from scary.And just when you think the worst is over at the end, Michael opens his eyes after being hung, stabbed, burned, electrocuted, blown up and thrown of buildings, and then it's the end of the movie. I felt violated! Now that all the original characters are dead, God knows what Halloween 9 will be like and after all the Halloween movies I've seen, I am seriously considering not going to see Halloween 9 because it's probably going to have Christina Aguilera and Xibit or some other \"new\" characters in 2007!",

But, here we are. Jamie Lee's fourth Halloween movie, and Michael is up and well again. It`s all explained at the beginning of the film in the old style: fob us off with 10 seconds of implausible plot explanations just to get back at the box office and for us not to think you`re a bunch of wankers for bringing him back to life. And they NEARLY got away with it. Personally, I don't buy the explanation of how Michael is alive, (did you see the way the ambulance flattened him against the tree at the end of H20? Did you see the way she belted into him, knocking him down the bank?) The \"replacement\" Michael, if he still had his head, would apparently be as indestructible as the man he was disguised as!This film is OK on the whole. Personally, I do love the series; and, as always there are hits and there are misses. Part 6 was an unqualified pile of poo, and let`s not even mention part 3. But 8 is in between. Not a bad entry, with a good degree of violence and THANK GOD we had Jamie Lee, if only for a bit. After the beginning, it slows down a great deal, and when it does pick up it's OK, just not wonderful. And do we believe he's dead? The freakin` ambulance driver who got decapitated could have survived Michael's fate at the end of this film! It`s not very often that a series of movies can get better after a naff and embarrassing entry (part 6). But when H2O hit our screens, it picked up the whole Halloween series, and that film SHONE. If I had a choice of make Resurrection, or leave well enough alone, I`d have been happy to end my Halloween collection with Part 7.",

Not having seen the other Halloweens I don't know what this Thorn thing is all about, but having read on a fanpage that H20 dropped the concept of the Thorn and ignoring everything since 2, I was kinda disappointed. The only thing that was good for was luring Dawson's Creek-fed teenagers into the theatres to watch a nice not-too-far-from-the-Scream-formula slasher movie they could all enjoy. Is that selling out or what?If I went in to watch H20 and I didn't get Michael's origin or whatnot, I would actually have rented the other movies to find out what I didn't get! Bad business, you say? Well, it's number 7 of a slasher-serial! Let's keep this in the B-movie realm where it belongs (note: in this I do not include 1, which is a classic)! So I actually didn't see that because it denied it's own B-movie roots. How hypocrite!But then I found out about Halloween: Resurrection. What do you say? Reality-tv? Busta Rhymes? Why, this sounds like pure exploitative schlock to me! Off to the video store! And by golly, I got what I (minimally) paid for! From it's great opening in the sanitarium to Michael opening his eyes on the morgue table, this is a beautiful walk through B-Park.\nI'll admit it, Busta is a crappy actor. But who cares? How many buxom blondes in so many slasher films were? I, for one, think his performance was hilarious. It was his one-liners in the \"memorable quotes\" section of the H:R page on imdb that got me renting this video. I didn't see Freddie Jones on screen, I saw Busta Rhymes. Freddie's over-enthusiastic personality is actually Busta's shouting out: \"Oh my God! I landed a major role in an A-list flick! This could mean a significant increase in bank account size!\". Well, funk that up a bit and you might have an idea of his train of thought.\nBianca Kajlich was an ok actress, I guess (at the very least she was a super funkin hot one!) and she played an unnoticeably written part unnoticeably (if you catch my drift.The kills were cool, *SPOILER* though the One Who Showed Her Breasts might have a tad dull one *END SPOILER*. Also, my sister wished Jen (The Slutty One) would die by decapitation and *SPOILER* 30 seconds later, she does. *END SPOILER* We all had a larf.The ending, *SPOILER* where Busta barged in and did the kung fu and the one-liners and the genital-frying *END SPOILER* were gut-wrenchingly funny (and gut-wrenchingly agonizing for true Halloween fans, who want these films to be still scary, like the first one, probably). Welcome to prime time, Busta!Also, loved those two guys at that Halloween party, dressed as Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction, great nod there!The only cons of this movie (well, for me) are the ones flowing forth from H20. There's no Killer Mythos, Michael still seems to kill for no reason except for that half-asked speculation by The One With The Breasts. All that stuff they find all over the house that turns out to be fake stuff placed there by Freddie and Nora (I don't count this as a spoiler as it pretty much leads to nothing) works really anticlimactic.If you go to \"alternate versions\" on H:R's imdb page, you'll find that an intro was shot but discarded showing a Myers home video in which the Dad's filming everyone on a summer's day, but Michael keeps turning away his face. At the end of the intro, we finally get to see it and it turns out that Michael's eyes are completely black. That would at least have been SOME Killer Mythos!But ah well, I digress. If you want two hours of pure, unadulterated schlock and have nothing against loud-mouthed rappers, rent Halloween: Resurrection.You want horror, rent Halloween: Period. ;)",

            "content": "Alright I saw Halloween Resurrection yesterday, the day of release in the UK. To be honest, after reading the verbal slammings it got from other IMDb users, I wasn't expecting too much. But in the opening 15 minutes I was pleasantly suprised. The dark corridors in the Sanitarium gave an eerie and suspenseful feel, the same suspense which made the original Halloween movie such a success. When watching a Halloween movie, you must NOT perceive it as being realistic. You have to realise that Michael Myers isn't really human, and no matter what you do, you cannot get rid of the guy. Move onto the new segment with the students. To tell you the truth, although I don't think the whole 'webcam internet show' idea worked as it was intended, I applaud the originality of it. How many other horror movies have done this? None. It is inevitable that people will say the Blair Witch Project did this, but the only similarity is that both movies used cameras. With Halloween Resurrection it was live instead of recorded. I congratulate the writers with the originality of this concept. Unfortunately I found the whole 'internet geek rescues online-girlfriend' plot stupid. The scenes inside the Myer's house were good, with lots of nice dark shots, but frequent cut-shots back to a teenager in a tuxedo in a living room surrounded by student cretins distracted from the narrative of the movie. In fact, the movie would have done better had Sara NOT had the assistance of her geeky sidekick. Never mind. Busta Rhymes was awful, the guy can't act at all. Also I believe he set a record for using the 'MF' word most times in an hour period. Busta, stick to scratching and rapping, at least that sort of thing doesn't require much talent. At least the end of the movie ended on a high note, which of course I won't tell you what it is...but it definetly was a VERY good ending. I have seen ALL of the Halloween movies (including the bloody awful Halloween 3), and I believe that this is the 4th best. I'd say Halloween 1, 5 and 6 out-perform Halloween 8. Percentage score? I'd give Halloween Resurrection an 80%.",

He switched places with an EMT? Michael Myers has been a personification of relentless unstoppable evil, not one who fakes his own death in order to fool everyone.  He just simply disappears, and returns later to finish his hellish work.  Then the inevitable battle with Laurie Strode, contrived and predictable at best, unbefitting Curti's character at worst.Then came the predictable \"reality TV\" approach, set at the old home of Michael Myers himself.  Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks made the movie even worse, neither one can act.  The contestants were killed off one by one in a predictable manner, all in all, I give this movie a 1 out of 10.  The only reason it rates a one is I couldn't go any lower on the voting scale.The three \"true\" Halloween movies sent chills up my spine, and were excellent, ones I enjoy watching over and over.

The plot moves along quite quickly and mixes the laughs you have grown to expect from modern horrors with the good old fashioned shocks.

How to begin counting the ways?First of all, the music, the name \"Michael Myers\",  and Jamie Leigh Curtis are the only things that bare any resemblance to the first Halloween - Oh, and the executive producer Moustapha Akkad, whose bank accounts are surely solely responsible for bringing the series this far in the first place. There is this ridicules subplot at the beginning which is over in about five minutes, and has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the story (I use that term as loose as possible). Characters appear and disappear, having left no clue to their significance at all whatsoever (Including Jamie Leigh's character!!!).Busta . . . Oh, Busta . . . Actually, thank Buddha for Busta, because not only did he steal the film from Michael Myers, but he is (if you can find a reason) the only reason to wake up from time to time.There is - albeit a pretty stupid one - some assemblage of a plot. It is all-interneted and Mtv'd out. I never thought of the 21st century in terms of youthful cliches, but this film definitely put them out there. The Internet, the palm pilot, voyeuristic entertainment: they all show up to provide future generations with the ideal image of the most cliched 21st century American (And what the heck was the point of the motorbike? I've never seen anybody riding a motorbike around campus.) .Subplots appear seemingly out of nowhere. There is absolutely no consistency. You hate every character except Busta. There is no humor except Busta. There is no suspense, but that of the cheap Haunted House variety. When I saw Rick Rosenthal's name (director of \"Halloween 2\") during the opening credits, I actually thought for a spilt second that there might be some redeeming qualities to this film. I was wrong.Okay, it's a \"Halloween\" movie, why be so analytical about it? Perhaps, because the first \"Halloween\" was such a cool, well made film. Sure, some of the sequels have been pretty dumb, but for the most part they've been entertaining. This one is a conglomerate of stereotypes and irrational nonsense.This film would serve perfect usage in a film school, under the chapter on how NEVER to make movies.On a side note, the formula (which Akaad certainly understands, because he obviously knows NOTHING about quality storytelling) is pretty obvious: young characters (including the obligatory \"boob shot\") with all the typical cliches, a popular rapper and a sexy model. He can't go wrong. I fully understand his motives, but there is just something repulsive about associating this garbage with John Carpenter's classic. It is a tragedy - the proverbial dead-end - that it should have been the spark from which this latest piece of undeniable trash is descendent.",

It had a purpose in bringing back the savior of the franchise (Jamie Lee Curtis). Most importantly it tied the story up all the way and there was no need for another one.Enther Halloween: Resurrection in 2002. Originally slated to be released in 2001, rewrites and re-shoots caused a delay which was not for the better. The idea was to bring Michael back and explain he was not the one who got his head chopped off in 1998. Well, nobody ever said horror films had to be taken seriously but as the events unfolded in Resurrection none of it could be understood or explained.Laurie Strode was a vital character to the franchise. Every I repeat every horror film franchise needs one survivor from the previous installment to come back, kick butt and get out. During her short 10 minute appearance, we see how badly the producers wanted to make it work. Yes, we see a stronger Laurie. Yes, we see a passable explanation for what has happened and the spook factor is at an all time high.Reportedly, Jamie Lee wanted out and did not want to see Laurie alive because that would mean another return down the line. Smart girl. Badly written exit. Here she is about to kill Michael Myers and she thinks he has somehow pulled a fast one on her again? Please. This guy WANTED to kill her. He chased her around the building. Tore in her bedroom. And she thought she \"needs to make sure?\" 10 minutes and we are out people. No more Laurie. No more excuse to witness the tragedy about to happen to out eyes and ears.Nothing can save the viewer from this badly written script and one dimensional idiot characters. The camera idea did not work. The jokes were funny for all the wrong reasons and Tyra Banks along with Busta Rhymes need to be reminded they are not actors. While some parts entertained me, the fact that I felt less smart coming out of the theater is a red flag people. Should have waited for the DVD. Oh well.*/4",

This is 2002 & those Fans are in their 30's & 40's now. As you walk up to the theater to see (insert name of quality movie here), you think back to those glory days and instead see HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION. This is your (and my) fatal mistake! Another crappy, cardboard sequel that offers virtually nothing. Even on the basic levels (nudity, violence) it is cut back and reserved. *SPOILER* From a pathetic rip off of PEEPING TOM (tripod point of view used to stab victim) to heavy doses of the worst film of all-time BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (H-A-N-D-H-E-L-D!), there is nothing original or new here. There are however plenty of continuity problems (Michael gives his bloody knife to the psych hospital moron only to show up at the house with a new and already bloody knife). *END SPOILER* To address the race issue (and yes, it is a big issue with this series)- The African-American characters are given all the \"hero\" bits and the African-American audience member's yelled and cheered them on. So, on one level I guess it succeeds. Miramax clearly knows this and the re-shoots bare it out. For a $15 mil budget, it is technically passable. Acting is EXACTLY what you would expect (BAD!!!). You'll go anyway, and you'll be let down....again. At least it will be a while before HALLOWEEN 9: MICHAEL IN SPACE!",

Why this flick was not a \"straight-to-video\" release is a small wonder to me, as the overdone ideas and choppy acting add nothing to the series, along the  same lines of 'Bloodsport 2+'.Halloween had attained a level not unlike the Exorcist to many moviegoers, appealing to not just a B-movie horror crowd, but the vast majority who were wanting a good scare.  Michael Myers was unstoppable, the boogey man in your child-hood nightmares, the enemy who could not be beaten.\nFast forward to present, and the current release tries to capitalize on a teenie-bopper scary movie crowd that sprang up with 'Scream' and 'I know What you Did Last Summer', with modern technology, cameos from has-been musicians, and not-so-dark humor, not to mention a more mortal Michael Myers.  As I grew up, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhies were the characters that kept your eyes open on your pillow and second-guessing shadows way past bedtime.  Now, the scream character from 'Scary Movie' is more terrifying. Busta Rhymes vs. Michael Myers? Please. This should've been one hit. Period.  There is no integrity left to this series, and it should've ended with H20.The concept of this flick is not innovative by any stretch of the imagination.  Internet Broadcast gone awry? Try 'Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal'. It did it first to the best of my knowledge, and was innovative at the time (even if it did deal the death-blow to Rutger Haeur's career).\nHalloween had attained a level not unlike the Exorcist to many movie-goers, appealing to not just a B-movie horror crowd, but the vast majority who were wanting a good scare.  Michael Myers was unstoppable, the boogey man in your child-hood nightmares, the enemy who could not be beaten.\nThe horror movie crowd that grew up with Jason and Michael is gone, replaced by kids whose idea of cold sweat inducing terror is 'House on Haunted Hill'. Do not try to appeal to this crowd; Halloween will never be a 'Scream'. Leave the classics as they were, unstoppable and terrifying.",

It's no where near as good as the first(casue the first is a classic)but it is better than Halloween II, and it's close to Halloween H20. The franchise is ready to go into diffrent directions I think (As long as they dont go back to the Senseless story line of 4,5,6). The movie stars Bianca Kajlich,Busta Rhymes, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Jamie Lee Curtis. They all do a great job, especially Curtis. Of course the Halloween franchise will keep going on. You know there will be a Halloween 9 and so on. Halloween Resurrection and Jason X are the slasher movies so far this year. Both franchises went into diffrent directions and only one pulled it off good. Jason X is pointless dribble, When on the other hand Halloween Resurrection intrigues you, scares you.

The Halloween series has become a horror film legacy and rightfully so purely on the basis of the first 2 films alone.

However, the Halloween legend has been tarnished in the past by poor films in the series, Halloween 3 and H20 spring to mind. Sadly, carrying on from H20 in more ways than just plot (ie. it's poo on a stick...), Halloween Resurrection is nothing short of a joke. It's original, (but then so was Scary Movie once, and that has 1 decent gag in it...) but flawed. Terrible acting from no-hoper teen newbies, no suspense and/or terror and laughable special effects make this one of the worse horror films of recent years. Avoid.",

I must say i am very very unhappy and very dissapointed at dimension films and at the writers and director for doing something sooo dissapointing and killing off The Original horror movie Herione. shes survived this long,why kill her now?? it makes no sense. and For Jamie Lee Curtis her self to have had let this happen after she has said in many interviews that Laurie Strode Was her Favorite character until she did \"True Lies\", is just unbeleivible. i my self have met Jamie and she was the best but now ive lost some respect for her because of this. But The movie was scary and entertaining and interesting despite these short coming. i mean, its not as bad as some of the other sequels to halloween so ill give it that much. i may be unhappy but im still an optimist and must be fair.

I also like that it took the character Laurie away form the horror that this series became. But on the other hand Laurie should not have died and this piece of crap should never have seen the light of day. The movie starts based on the worst premise ever having had Michael switch places with another person in H20 so he didn't actually die. That doesn't really explain why he would rise up in the back of the ambulance, attack Laurie and be able to stand right up after a car hits him. After that we get a little Laurie vs Michael, Laurie dying, then Michael killing a bunch of college students on a reality show. The performance of the movie is made by Busta Rhyms. He yells things like f*** and motherf***er and it's actually some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. He then Bruce lee battles Michael myers complete with Bruce lee sound effects and ninja kicks.( I am actually being serious this really happens!!) All and all one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wonder why the director from Halloween II would come back for this. I always felt the second film could stand up almost equal to the first.

To think that the producers, directors, and everyone associated with the \"Halloween\" series would even attempt another movie after H20 boggles the mind. I assumed that the Laurie Strode/Michael Myers conflict was resolved, and that Laurie would get on with her life, which has been put on hold for long enough. The acting - a term I apply VERY loosely - was deplorable. The plot - if there was one - was ridiculous. In the quest to cash in on \"reality entertainment\" which only reminds us that our TV networks don't think that actually hiring writers, producers, directors, and actors is important, this movie ranks down there with \"Fear Factor\" or \"The Real World\".... The ONLY saving grace of this movie was over in the first twenty minutes. To FINALLY bring closure to Laurie Strode's life was a very welcome event. Unless, there will be some Halloween Part 25 where she actually is still alive and simply dreamed up the whole thing.... who knows? Thumb's down.... WAY down.",

The previews for it just made it look like a joke. Like really ... 6 people staying over night at Michael Myers' childhood house? Come on, who is going to buy tickets for that? Well I did, and I don't regret it. Even though I had my doubts as to another Halloween sequel (being as all the sequels stunk, with the exception of H20, which was acceptable), I thought, its Halloween, the classic of all classics, so I have to go see it. So as I bought my Mr. Deeds ticket (Yes, lets remember that the movie was foolishly rated R, so minors like me can't get in legitimately) and went in the Halloween Resurrection theater, I sat down prepared for disappointment. But when it was over, my expectations were blown away. It was scary, exciting, and had a breath of fresh air with its one original idea (which for those of you who watched the movie will know what I'm talking about **Deckard**). So as I write this review, I will tell you that if you are turned off by the previews, don't be, because it was pretty good and worth the 10 bucks. And, well, let's face it, it's a Halloween movie, you just HAVE to go see it.Grade: B+",

The mask most likely. With the latest installment of the series which I thought ended with H2O and I would have been OK with, we find ourselves back in Haddonfield for another night of carnage. The idea is quite good if not acted all that well. Still horror films don't tend to get the most credible actors in them to start off with. The idea of everyone being locked in Michael's childhood home is rather cool. The clues that were left in the house which I think were all planted because you don't see them in the first film. The house is almost completely empty in that film. One thing I would have loved to seen would have been for Michael to take one of the houseguest's cameras so that even the internet people watching would see his point of view. That would have been quite cool in my opinion. One thing I loved and it was just about the only thing that reminded me why I like the first film so much is the way Michael admired his work after killing someone. In the 1st film he takes a step back and tilts his head from one side to the other. while we see it in a side view shot. In this film he kills someone and because they are wearing a camera on their head you see the shot head on. It looks great. The mask is altered a bit in this film and it looks great. There were also lots of shots of MM that were excellent too. Overall this movie didn't really scare all too much . It was enjoyable though and wasn't all that bad. One of the better sequels. Mind you don't expect any Oscar worthy performances.",

The rest of the movie is set in Haddonfield with Busta Rhymes entering the Myers home on Halloween, with a little help. His part is a little bit too hyped with way too much cursing on his end. But Bianca Kajlich, Katee Sackhoff, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Ryan Merriman give the most layer preformances of all. This seems to do wonders for the series in general. Very cool, sharp, and scary.

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection is a decent film and better than H20, but I think many people agree that these present day horror films don't compare to the originals back in the 1980's and early 1990's.  This film was pretty predictable since it flows the standard rules of the horror film genre. Since Rick Rosenthal directed this one, it felt very similar to watching Halloween II.     There are only a few moments where the film is scary, not because of Michael Myers but because of Busta Rhymes!  What a mistake it was to have him in the film.  He is a fine rapper and actor in some other films but he was terrible in this film.  The Kung Fu stuff he did was pretty cheesy, it laughed pretty hard and had to rewind the move a couple times to laugh at it.  If I want real Kung Fu action, I'll watch, Bruce Lee or Jet Li.  The important point is this; when Busta Rhymes is scarier than Michael Myers, it is time to end the franchise!  I really miss Donald Pleasance, he was awesome, and he did a much better job of being Michael's foil than Busta.  There should be an ending when Donald rises out of his grave and pulls Busta underground, akin to Freddy's claws dragging Jason's mask underground in The Final Friday.  As for Michael Myers himself, his look in this film is the worst of all the films.  The mask seems to get worse with every movie.  However, he made up for his look with some good scenes, like the scene with the mental clown man in the hospital, the scenes with Jamie Lee Curtis, and his running around the house.  I think he himself was in disbelief of Busta's acting because sometimes I swear his face mask transformed and made the \"What the heck?\" facial expression.  The killing were done nicely, a fair amount of blood, but some more would have been better.  As for the other players, Bianca Kajlich did a good job with the lead role.  She's sexy yet innocent, reminding me of Jamie Lee Curtis in the first two Halloween films.  I could watch this film just for her and the other female leads aren't too bad either.  It was nice having Jamie Lee Curtis again although I will admit, I do not like how H20 started a whole new direction, skipping Halloween 4-6. Personally, I'm glad they finally got rid of her, but you never know, they could always bring her back somehow.  As for Tyra Banks, all she really did was shake her bum for the camera like she did in Coyote Ugly, which takes a ton on talent.  Other than that, she didn't add anything to the film. \t Like I said, this is a decent film, it could be better and it could be worse.  I recommend watching the first six Halloween films, much more enjoyable, and most of them have Donald Pleasance!  As for the future, I don't know where they can go with this series now, so maybe this will be the last one.  However, with the horror genre, we never really know.  I wouldn't mind seeing Michael Myers again though because he is a legend of horror, he just needs a better story to work with than the last two entries. \t On a final note, the music was great.  I love that classic Halloween theme! Can't get enough of it!",

Does he want an autograph by Busta Rhymes? Not at all, the writers have not had to do with Myers, a music lover. Let's go to Busta Rhymes, therefore, is very excited to be part of, but whose performance is not at all enthusiastic. Basically the character of Busta Rhymes is a manufacturer and a fan of Bruce Lee, it is almost the only features of his character, but surely the role of composition in his eyes.Other casting error, with a role which slows the film more than anything else, namely: Ryan Merriman, in the role of Myles, Myles so that at a party disguised as Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction, one of the best ideas of the film, making a nod to Pulp Fiction (because we said to forget what turnip Halloween Resurrection, may have always admired what's masterpiece Pulp Fiction), Small problem Ryan Merriman did not have the charisma of John Travolta.Bruce lee,Pulp Fiction longer a reality TV show ....

Watch for several interesting visual references to the early films in the series, especially the last shot of the original. We then return to Haddonfield and the original Myers house where a group of college students are spending the night armed with webcams. Bianca Kajlich is quite good as the new heroine, Sarah, probably the best since Curtis herself....there are quite a few gruesome and memorable deaths, and some entertaining scenes. Perhaps my favorite moment of the film comes where we finally see where Michael spends his time on the other 364 nights of the year. The films only big problem is the casting of Busta Rhymes as the hero...but at least his annoying kung-fu fightin' antics are kept to a minimum until close to the end.

The setting was scary and the acting was decent, especially from Jamie Lee Curtis. She's not afraid of Michael and that's what we love to see. Also, this movie has a really great intro explaining the events at the end of H20. I think that the reality tv setting in this movie works as well. The death scenes were good but maybe a little too much decapitations. Severed heads always look fake to me. Other than that it follows horror guidelines, including nudity! -SPOILER- And like Jason X, this movie leaves room for another sequel, hopefully to be directed by John Carpenter.

The only highlight from what i have read is Mia Farrow's( Rosemary's Baby) performance as one of Damien's nannies. Otherwise its a poor imitation of a great horror film. Halloween Resurrection is inconsistent, poorly acted, predictable,boring,and full of every clich\u00e9 you can imagine.

Michael puts on the paramedic clothes, and then walks out of the school, right past all the cop cars and paramedics, and into the woods. When cops find who they thought was michael, they loaded him into a van. Laurie steals the van, and kills the wrong person. Three years later, we find Laurie in a mental hospital, as a beaten down disturbed woman, Michael comes back. But a contest to spend he night in Myers original home, brings ina group of loud mouth collegians who must broadcast there documentary over the internet. When Michael returns, he has his hands full, with these teens, who soon discover Michaels been hiding, which are the sewers of Haddonfield, where he survived by eating, RATS! he really is a psycho. I can't say this movie was very good, because of the annoying teens, and the plot, as well as the acting, AND michaels getting his ass kicked karate style. This movie is basically house on haunted hill in Michaels old home. I have heard news of the ninth Halloween, intitled: Escape From Haddonfield",

In fact, I left it for dead after seeing that god-awful \"H:20\". But this....this is truly a new beginning, even if in some ways it does reinvent the wheel. I've always applauded the series for keeping up its continuity better than Nightmare of Friday the Thirteenth. There's a SAGA at work here. And in this one, a whole chapter is closed at last: Laurie Strode bites it; kudos to Jamie for knowing when to throw in the towel. But now, we seem to be developing a whole new arc...though I can't really tell where this one could go. Adding the \"Scream\"-ish touch of the whole web-cam idea (reality/fiction line blurred) is cute, but I don't know if it really fits the feel of the Halloween legacy. There's not a lot to surprise slasher fans...in fact, it's more or less standard fare. But it is entertaining, nonetheless. That notwithstanding, I'd be happy to see this series come to an end with dignity. There's nothing left of the original franchise, save for...well, Michael. Everybody else is gone, in one way or another. It's time for the final curtain before this does indeed drag on into Friday/Nightmare territory. Personally, I even thought 2 Scream sequels was overdoing it. On a side note, to DVD fans, check out the webcam feature; it's a cool new way to watch virtually the entire movie.

What I got was easily better than H20 and most likely better than \"Halloween II.\"I never expected the movie to be as good as it turned out to be. H20 was scary and suspenseful. \"Resurrection\" is twice as scary and twice as suspenseful. Michael Myers continues to be clever and more than a mindless slasher. The mask is clearly the best one since the original.My only complaint about the movie was the lack of an explanation concerning Laurie Strode's son, John (played in H20 by Josh Harnett). Myers whole motivation for killing is the pursuit of his family and while I thought it was excusable for him to clear the invaders from his home as a means of plot, I think we need to know what happened to his nephew, John.\nFrom the conclusion of \"Resurrection\" I would gather that there could, and I hope will, be a \"Halloween 9.\" Now that this little side journey of Myers has been catalogued we need to get back to his primary target, John Tate. I only hope Harnett doesn't think another \"Halloween\" is below him.",

Not only did the producers finally give us a good looking mask, Brad Loree's potrayal of Myers is the best to date, even better than Nick Castle in the first film. The walk and pace is right, as is the head tilt (finally returned from the first film). This film may lack some qualities, but it is nice to see Rick Rosenthal return and give us a worthy sequel.

Laurie is all beat up, dirty, and basically in bad shape knowing her brother, THE SHAPE, is coming for her again. We find out that the man whose head was chopped off was really a paramedic who had his larynx crushed by Michael before they got to Laurie. Back at the sanitarium, she sets a trap for him in her room. She puts a fake her inside her bed and when Michael gets to the dummy, Laurie hits him with a lamp and shocks him a little bit. She hides and sends him up to the roof, her following. She says some strong dialog (rewritten since the internet draft) about how he has failed (although not said, she gives you the idea). He is lifted by his ankle upside down with this crane thing. He drops his knife. Laurie picks up the knife and goes to unmask her, to make sure it really is Michael. He grabs her and brings her off the side of the building. Michael's knife goes into her gut in the process. She does something really sweet before Michael pulls the knife out and she falls into some trees below (really cool shot) and then Michael does a really shameful thing. Now we're at the Haddonfield University where we meet our six main characters, Bill, Jim, Rudy, Jen, Donna, and Sara, who are six teens who are going to go into the Myer's house for a internet thing with Dangertainment, entrepeneur Freddie Harris' company, along with his \"assistant\", Nora Winston. Halloween arrives as they explore the house. They all have mixed opinions about the house, but they can't leave till the next morning, and they get scholarships for doing this. That night, after we get to know more about our characters, Freddie plans some Michael Myers fun, with his own costume and mask. When the real Michael Myers shows up and everyone sees both of them, something really funny happens. The real Myers begins to kill most of them, and only a few get out alive. When Sara escapes to a shed outside, she cuts some electrical wires and cases a big fire around the Myer's house. Myer's gets tangled up in some electrical wires. I'm not going to spoil the ending, so go see the move. It's one of the best Halloween films ever (although there are some points they could have worked on a little stronger), and anyone, even those who haven't seen any other Halloween movies should see this (they explain most things in the opening monologue over the credits).",

The writers appeared to go out of their way to make them so unappealing, that the audience can't help but root for the psychotic killer. Note to the writers of future installments: If you allow the viewers to care about the protagonists, the next sequel may regain some of the tension and suspense that made the first movie a classic.The direction was awful. A good portion of the film is seen through \"state-of-the-art\" camera equipment mounted on the heads of our witless heroes. The image quality of these cameras is terrible and the actors jerk around so much it's often impossible to tell what's going on.\nA horror film doesn't have to be gory to be frightening (i.e. \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"The Blair Witch Project,\" etc.). But when you're making a slasher film, the fans expect to the special effects make-up artists to pile on the blood and guts. Fans of classic slasher films like the original \"Halloween\", \"The Burning\", and \"Friday the 13th\" will be disappointed. There's hardly any gore in this crap-fest. Most the special effects shots are destroyed by poor lighting and/or shoddy camera work.Horror films, in general, have been in a state of decline since the early 1990's. But the slasher film sub-genre died in the mid-1980's, when the MPAA finally squeezed most of the gore out of them. \"Halloween: Resurrection\" does nothing to bring it back from the dead.",

Dr. Loomis is dead, everyone is dead.  There is Josh Hartnett but we all know he will not be in another Halloween film because he is too big of a star now.  So for the rest of the series we are going to be stuck with idiotic college students who have nothing to do with Michael Myers's past.  H20 had the perfect ending to the series, Laurie got her revenge and Michael finally was dead.  But that idiot MOUSTAPHA AKKAD got money hungry again and greenlighted this piece of garbage.

I know Jamie lee Curtis did not want to be in this film, and you know what I do not blame her one bit!  Look who she would have been acting with, BUSTA CRAP and TYRA BANKS.

To true fans who have seen this movie, don't be let down by what has been shown. Remember when Dr. Loomis and Michael in Halloween 2 when Loomis exploded the operating room which both were in. Remember October 21, 1988 when they were both back in Halloween 4. You draw your conclusions. The new setting of broacasting university students to be in the Myers home is excellent. Once again, the writers of this movie take the audience to another level. They are using the concept of the popular reality shows and using it as a background for the film. Michael is at his best in this film. Brad Loree (Michael Myers) is very haunting and very strong as Michael. He is an excellent actor and never laid the rest of \"Who's Afraid Of The Boogeyman\". Jamie Lee Curtis is still and always will be the \"Scream Queen\". Even though she is in the movie for a short time, you can feel the pain and torment that her character, Laurie Strode has endured for 24 years. She strong and it all runs in the family. Jacinda Barrett is excellent as Sara, Busta Rymes is Excellent as businessman Freddie Harris, and Ryan Merriman is excellent as Dekkard/ Myles. This movie is excellent and a must see. when viewing this movie, get into the feeling of the \"Halloween \" story, feel what the actors in the movie, are feeling especially Michael Myers and Laurie Strode and pay attention to every part of the movie you will hear the story set though Danny Lux's excellent adaptation of John Carpenter's theme. A true Halloween fan will be proud. The storyline is excellent and this movie tells you why it exists with the excellent flashbacks to Halloween H20. See it and to Moustapha Akkad, keep doing your thing, to all the directors of the series, John Carpenter, Rick Rosenthal, Tommy Lee Wallace, Dwight H. Little, Dominique Othenin-Girard, Joe Chappelle, and Steve Miner, writers, John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Tommy Lee Wallace, Alan Mc Elroy, Dhani Lisipus, Larry Rattner, Benjamin Ruffner, Michael Jacobs, Shem Bitterman, Dominique Othenin-Girard, Daniel Farrands, Robert Zappia, Larry Brand, Sean Hood, keep doing the best. Music is always the best John Carpenter, Alan Howarth, John Ottman, Marco Beltrami, and now Danny Lux, thank you for scaring us and please in the future. See this new movie 5 out of 5 Stars.",

            "content": "I suppose the explanation for how Michael could have survived his beheading in H20 is passable, and the final showdown of Jamie Lee Curtis and her homicidal brother that opens the new film is indeed quite strong, shocking, and oddly moving.  Unfortunately, once the new story gets underway 20 minutes into the film, director Rick Rosenthal can't build suspense thanks to the choppy, annoying \"reality TV\" approach that owes more to Blair Witch 2 than Halloween. Worse, aside from Jamie Lee Curtis, the film is poorly cast, with Busta Rhymes giving an embarrassingly unfunny and stereotypical performance as the ringleader that brings all of his scenes to a screaming halt. The rest of the cast isn't really bad, just knife-fodder, though admittedly they haven't been given characters to play.\nThough Rosenthal can't build much suspense and proves, as he did in Halloween II, that he doesn't know how to time his shocks, he does create some creepy atmosphere and a couple of scenes toward the end do build some excitement.  The film is admittedly clever in spots, and mostly entertaining, though it never comes close to topping the opening sequence with Jamie Lee, and even as films in this genre go, it's mostly just unnecessary.It isn't the worst of the series (that honor goes to Curse of Michael), and I wouldn't say it was a really bad film (I WAS entertained)...but it's not much of a compliment when the first thing you can think of as the end credits are rolling is, well, at least it was better than Jason X.",

            "content": "Michael Myers, one of the original boogeymen of our time is back for more in this pointless and disgusting sequel, which is the ninth one in the series. Many will agree with me that this series should have stopped after H20. H20 showed a whole new side of Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, as she stands up to her brother after 20 years of running away from him. The movie ends with her giving up, what is believed to be her brother at first, and chops his head off, eliminating the terror and overcoming her fear. Halloween Resurrection completely kills that psychology as it is explained that it wasn't Michael Myers' head that was chopped but one of the paramedics, whom Michael put his mask on. Michael comes back after Laurie, after she was put in a mental institution.The first ten minutes of the movie are good, full with suspense and tension, as Laurie runs away from Michael again. The reason why H20 was unique is because it was one of those rare movies (the Alien franchise, just to name a few), where the women is not represented as the sensitive damsel in distress, and she is the protagonist in the movie. Halloween Resurrection brings back that mentality as Laurie goes to take off Michael's mask to make sure that it was him, as she cries and shakes with terror. Michael then grabs her and pushes her off the building, where our hero dies. All these movies where there are more than three sequels grow worse as the movies go on. They are riddled with sex, drugs, alcohol and grown men and women playing teenagers, who can't act for s**t. They are pointless and are not worth $10 for a movie ticket or more than $20 on DVD.",

Someone who flew out of a car window, got hated by the van and then squeezed between the van and a tree. And he survived. But only Michael Myers would survive that! What a terrible excuse to make another sequel. And all this happened in the intro. Jamie Lee Curtis accepted the movie just to make sure that she wouldn't appear in any other sequel. Why didn't she just reject every other sequel, and live happily ever after? We were all so happy when she survived in H20, but she just had to die in this movie! I got very angry!

            "content": "HALLOWEEN: H20 was the best ending that could ever reach the screen without John CARPENTER on board and after the great Donald PLEASENCE's disappearence. Although it was a great movie,it lacked Donald PLEASANCE's presence (who is to me more essential to the series than Jamie Lee Curtis) but he wasn't forgotten as the opening credit was a moving tribute to his character. Without LOOMIS, the series had to end and Laurie was the only character that could finish the doctor's job: killing MYERS. I thought the producers had a wise idea that respected the memory and work of the greatest actor of all times. But now comes HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION that wants to bring the series in a new era and gets rid of Laurie: bad idea as HALLOWEEN films were so great because Michael MYERS always came with at least one of these two strong nemesis that could preserve all the interest when the killer wasn't not on the screen and enhanced his impact.RESURRECTION falls into two different movies: an opening sequence for true HALLOWEEN fans and the rest of the movie that represents a new beginning.This opening sequence finds the spirit of the previous movies and is made as a farewell to an entire age and maybe an entire bunch of fans too: those who, like me, believe that Michael MYERS' nothing without Laurie or LOOMIS.This sequence was both moving and a bit annoying as it ruined H20's great final scene. And now starts the \"new\" HALLOWEEN...When you watch the rest of the film, it confirms how essential Donald Pleasence and Jamie LEE CURTIS were and the mistake the producers have made by deciding to continue the series without them. Take the first movie for example: LOOMIS' dialogues presented MYERS has pure evil and were so effectively performed that they gave a new supernatural dimension to the killer, enhancing the audience's fear. Now we only have silly dialogues and neverending explorations of the empty rooms: quite boring. The attempts to create the suspense of the previous movies are all failures and you wait for MYERS to show up and chop all these hollow characters.Hopefully, anytime he's on the screen, it's obvious that Michael MYERS hasn't lost his power of fascination: he's threatening, brutal, scary, invincible and save the last part of the movie. After JASON X, RESURRECTION is another proof that the 90s haven't created any slasher icons: killers from SCREAM or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER never have JASON or Michael MYERS'charism and are bound to oblivion through the ages. Here, Brad LOREE delivers a great performance.The last 30 minutes are pretty nervous and show a few interesting ideas that, if better exploited,could have bred real and original suspense, for example the fact that Sara's informed of Myers' position in the house with her electronic agenda. This final part saves the movie by compensating for the lack of scares by a breath-taking pace and intensity: you finally leave the theater on a positive feeling. Of course there are still a few bad points: Busta RHYMES' Bruce LEE-like screams in the kung fu sequences are a bit ridiculous and so are his one liners, especially after Jamie Lee CURTIS' last words in front of MYERS. Also, the way they get rid of MYERS seems a bit easy for an invincible killer. And there's also something quite shameful: they have chosen to ignore part 4,5 and 6 but they don't hesitate to copy entire scenes from those movies. There's a HALLOWEEN 4-like roof sequence and a murder that really reminded me HALLOWEEN 6.As a conclusion, I will say that even if I was pleased to see Michael MYERS again and there was excellent opening and an entertaining last section, this movie should never have been made. Myers is a fascinating character but can't support a movie on it's own. Next chapters will always lack LOOMIS and Laurie and will only be interesting when the Shape's on the screen:just like this one. Furthermore, I insist on the fact that such a legend could only die from his two nemesis' hands, it will now be impossible to have an ending that equals H20. In this movie, we have Laurie's last stand and Donald PLEASENCE is totally forgotten (what a lack of respect for such an actor and for all he has brought to the series!): HALLOWEEN enters a new era, but I won't follow him there. For me,Michael MYERS died in H20, the only possible ending of a great series.",

That was a great finish to the best horror series ever. Laurie killing Michael should have closed the book on the story, but no..... Hollywood had to keep going with it, turning it into a soap opera of a horror series. How many times in soap operas is someone suppossed to be dead, only to come back later because they somehow escaped, or somebody else got killed who looked just like them??When the series was going into film #4,#5, #6, and so on, the one thing that made the films more entertaining, and believable, was that Michael never actually died. As to where Jason dies and comes back, and Freddy and Pinhead are already dead, the thing that makes Halloween so scary is that Michael was never dead to begin with. But now the series is as laughable as the Friday The 13th's, Elm Streets, and Hellraiser films.Simply put, this film should not have been made.

And yes, I was sad to see that Jamie Lee Curtis/Laurie Strode would no longer be involved with the storyline...but it wasn't that damn bad of a movie.  Lots of gore, which is always nice, and some pretty good scares make it very watchable and entertaining.I do have complaints, much like everyone else who has commented on this film so far.  The one thing I never cared for in horror sequals was the notion that \"this sequal never took place\" and \"forget that last two sequals\". According to H20, we were supposed to only remember as far back as the second film, and forget about Halloweens 4-6.  So now that Michael has eliminated Laurie, does he have 1 or 2 blood relatives left?  John Strode would be relative #1, but do we still keep Jamie Lloyd's baby in mind or not?  They try to forget so many movies that it never makes sense. Michael's gonna need people to go after in the next films (cause you know this one's gonna make $$$ and Dimension will just keep pumping them out until they either run out of ideas or Michael gets sent into space), and Busta Rhymes and the character of Sara just don't cut it.  The other major complaint I have always had was how the survivors acted at the end after your friendly neighborhood serial killer (Jason, Michael, etc etc) was supposedly \"dead\".  Let's see a sole survivor laughing and crying at the same time, eating their hair and talking in gibberish.  Their friends were just slaughtered before their very eyes and they were stalked by a murderous maniac, yet they have time to make a statement or be calm, cool and collected.  Give me a break.  The only instance I can remember where that final survivor is totally f---ing nuts is at the end of the 3rd Friday the 13th where the girl is screaming and laughing in the back of the police car.\nI spent the 80's growing up on the Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street films and I'm a true fan.  I'll be sitting in the theaters on opening night for Jason XXIV, Halloween: Michael Myers Runs Out Of Oops I Crapped My Pants, and all the rest with a big smile on my face.  You know why?  Because I'm a fan, and even the loss of a major character, or a rapper for a lead or bad acting/dialogue/plot won't change my mind.\nYou want a fun night out this summer??  Go see Halloween:Resurrection and have a good time.  4 out of 5.",

There was a excellent creepy atmosphere to the film. The camera work was the best since the first two.  Michael was played really well by Brad Loree.  I would say his performance was the second best behind Nick Castle's chillingly effective performance in the original. The was a nice build up to the carnage with scenes where Michael stalked and teased but did not kill.  And when the killing started Michael was both creative and traditional.  Busta Ryhmes brought a charm to film with his character that was refreshing.  The plot of the film was original and not just someone killing people.  The plot had a modern twist to it that brought suspense and excitement; something that has been missing from the series since Halloween 5.  Rick Rosenthal did a wonderful job with this film and it was just as good as Halloween II.  Which was also directed by Rick Rosenthal.  The acting was bad either.  I mean the acting was not amazing but it was just the right kind of acting that film needed for it to be effective. Overall, this installment in the enormously successful franchise is creative, suspenseful, exciting, fresh, fun, and most importantly scary.  Even if your not a fan of the series or only saw the first two or just the first one GO SEE IT!! You'll have a great time.",

For one thing, they never mentioned her demise during the rest of the film, which can mean she may have survived. She may have fallen and knocked herself out! Michael didn't get good leverage hanging upside down. A little blood transfusion and recovery time and she may be back for the next sequel (dare I say it). Anyway, alot of Busta Rhymes' dialogue should've been cut, it affected the mood of the film, I for one wanted to see Michael shut him up for good. The acting was fair and the 'Blair Witch home-video camera' touch made for some interesting suspense along with the new facts about Michaels' whereabouts when he ain't slicing and dicing.",

            "content": "This entry follows the events in H20, which is a sequel to Halloween 1 and 2. This is interesting for the fact that Rick Rosenthal directed this, and he was also the director of the original sequel, Halloween II. After that film, his feature debut, he received a lot of criticism for supposedly not being up-to-snuff, and having to have his work finished up by the original film's director, John Carpenter (this rumor was actually substantiated by Carpenter in a recent interview). So it was going to be interesting, going into Resurrection, to see if Rosenthal would go all out to show what he's learned directing TV and films for the last 20 years.The result is an entertaining entry, but an overall average movie. The plot revolves around a group of college students being locked in the Myers house for a live internet webcast. Bianca Kajlich is the reluctant protagonist and Busta Rhymes is the web entrepreneur behind the whole thing. They are surrounded by the typical assortment of \"slasher fodder\" obnoxious teens. Inevitable, Michael Myers starts methodically killing people, and there are the tired slasher clich\u00e9s of a person being pulled through a bathroom mirror and a decapitated head in the clothes dryer.There are some redeeming qualities, including a subplot involving a group of kids at a high school party watching the webcast, who sort-of mirror the theatrical audience and provide comic relief. Also there is a funny scene where Rhymes, dressed as Michael Myers, encounters the real Myers and mistakes him for somebody else in a costume. Also they finally got the Myers mask to look like it did in the original (how did this take 7 sequels to get right?).The most redeeming quality about this movie, however, is the attempt to use shadows and light to create atmosphere. This was what made the original Halloween so great- it was all about lighting along with atmosphere, slow ominous pacing and, of course, music. Carpenter has said over and over again that Halloween was an Expressionist film. Unfortunately, contemporary Hollywood does not know how or is not willing to support this format. It does not \"gel\" with the young, raised-on-MTV audiences that are accustomed to stereotypical, wisecracking characters, break-neck fast editing and contrived, predictable plots.The result is a series that, since Halloween 4, feels uninspired. Where is the suspense? Halloween H20 was the exception, thanks to Jamie Lee Curtis's participation, and Resurrection is worth it, if for no other reason, than to see her cameo. Her character is given a dignified swan song, and Curtis plays it very well. I just wish the music during her scene didn't felt so un-Carpenter-like. But really, after her scene, there is no reason for the series to continue. It just seems pointless... Unless Myers goes after Josh Hartnett.",

The opening sequence in the sanitarium was brilliant, but sadly marked the end of Jamie Lee Curtis' involvement in the series. The internet gimmick was alright, but the film seemed to be missing that ingredient that makes most of the Halloween movies enjoyable. This installment was probably one of the goriest, with decapitations, slashed throats and knives through heads. The characters were average, with a few funny lines of dialogue. I have one major complaint however-Busta Rhymes. He ruined the film with his martial arts sequence. Why didn't Micheal kill him and put us all out of our misery?! The ending was pretty good with Micheal going up in flames spectacularly, but yet again he is alive at the end. H20 would have been a great end to the series, and they were really pushing it by making this one, but if Halloween 9 comes out then this series will lose the credibility it has taken so long to get. Even though I'm a huge fan, they should kill Micheal off and leave it at that. Overall I would give this movie 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "First off, I enjoyed the movie, but comparing it to the original is a crime. Halloween 8 had its moments and a pretty scary ending. But then again, it had its bad moments. Busta Rhymes' looked like he was actually reading cue-cards when acting. His performance was a major travesty. The scenes were great and creepy. However, it didn't FEEL like it was Halloween, no titles saying, ex. October 31st, 1978, Haddonfield, Illinois, Halloween, etc. **SPOILERS** The beginning might be the best of the sequels with Jamie in that creepy hospital. I like the flashbacks to Halloween H20 and how Michael escaped. What I find weird is the part where Michael gives the knife to Harold meaning that he is framing him or \"retiring\". I thought that the part after that was boring until they went to the Myers' house. Brad Loree played a great Michael and could have played the best Michael since Dick Warlock, from Halloween 2. The ending ranks up there with Halloween, 4, and 7. Real great work. I also like the references to the previous movies. EX. Remember Dr. Mixter from H2, a reference to that, how about the clown mask from Halloween 1, which was what Harold was wearing.Only hardcore Halloween fans will know what I'm talking about.**END SPOILERS** The movie is not as good as 1,2,4 but beats the hell out of 3,5,6. It is on par with H20. Acting: Best was is Bianca Kajilch with the amazing set of.....eyes. Worst was Busta Rhymes. Funny moments but his acting is not fit for a horror movie. Plot: Good, not great, not bad. I was hoping for Michael to kill them all really, except for Kajilch. Out of 10 stars.......********(8).

What other movie in 2002 can say they used modern technology (internet) to lure kids into wanting to see this film?Michael Myers (to me) is the scariest killer/murderer ever created in time. He doesn't need to say a word... he walks like he knows he's going to kill the next person he does, which scares me even more. The classic mask, the classic suit.

When H20 came out, the film makers threw out the storyline concerning parts 3-6. (part 3 had nothing to do with the franchise anyway!)  That's why H20 was \"TWENTY YEARS LATER\".

Unlike Jason Voorhees (which really has no plot to it) Michael has a reason to do what he is doing (its a psychotic reason though). SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!The movie starts out with a bang, first with the series signature theme (composed by John Carenter) than showing a tunnel as Jamie Lee Curtis gives an insight on life and how its like a dark tunnel, anyways we than see Jamie Lee Curtis in an assylum. We see two orderlies talking about what happened in the events of H20, It turns out Michael wasn't the man behind the mask when Laurie chopped his head off, it was an ambulance driver whose vocal cords were crushed by Michael (explaing why Michael seemed so disoriented and confused at the end of H20).As the orderlies enter than leave Lauries room (they gave her a sedative) we see that Laurie isn't comotosed like everyone thinks and has actually been hiding pills in her doll. We than see her looking out the window and staring down at Michael as he looks in. Apparently for 3 years she's been waiting for him, after Michael kills two guards and breaks through Lauries door she makes a run for it towards the roof. Michael makes it up the roof to find Laurie gown hanging from the roof and Laurie no where around, Laurie then appears behind the door and put Michael in a rope trap. It appears that Laurie has won and is ready to end Michaels reign of terror, but as Laurie starts to cut the rope Michael smartly re-enacts the gestures the ambulance driver gave in H20 and tricks Laurie. Laurie concerned that it might be a fake goes to take the mask off, but suddenly Michael grabs her and both go over the roof. Unfortunately, Michaels hangs on to the rope and Laurie lands on the knife that Michael is still holding. Laurie kisses Michael and leaps to her death....Thus ending the epilogue and Lauries fear of her brother.\nAfter seeing this film I knew that Halloween is a series that no matter how many are made, or even if no more are made will never get tiresome. Unlike the other films Michael isn't going after relatives to satisfy his rage, he goes after a group a group of six teens, who have decided to do a live internet broadcast inside Michaels house (since Halloween 4-6 never happened, the Myers house is still condemned) this isn't something Michael agrees with and he goes on his usual killing spree. The movie isn't just another horror/slasher film to me, because it deals with todays technology (internet, portable organizers).Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes star as Nora and Freddie the two people who put together this event and now must deal with the consequences. Also starring is Sean Patrick Thomas (Save the Last Dance), Thomas Ian Nicholas (both American Pie movies) and Bianca Kajlich as Sara Moyer.After the nationwide media coverage from H20 for featuring LL Cool J, Dimension decided on another rapist, it certainly worked at least Busta Rhymes kiss butt, all LL Cool J did was get a bullet across his head.Now for my rating: I'm saw two versions of this film, the one that was shown theatrically I give 3 out of 5 stars.The other version (still entitled Halloween: The Homecoming)I saw was an early screening version with an alternate beginning and alternate CSI ending that one I give 3 1/2 stars out of 5 because the beginning of the film was better. The ending however, the ending although a jolting ending isn't as good as the ending that is shown.",

I'm sure the director was looking for a gripping opening in explaining how MM survived H20 (yeah, because no-one would see an infamous brutal killer removing his mask and swapping clothes with a paramedic....)but he failed miserably!! Killing Laurie just put the nail in the coffin of this already tired series - and this was just the opening twenty minutes!! I had to laugh when the students participated in a \"Dangertainment\" (catchy name...really) production.  If you think about this for a second: This is a psychopath killer who is feared by everyone, he is as real to them as a killer in reality is real to us.  This production company wants to glorify the past of such a killer as Michael Myers- yeah and nobody blinks an eye - they just walk into a house, and then die (deservedly of course!) Anyway thats enough of that (and hopefully the series!)

Even low budget horror films should have standards, and this film is so bad, it makes some of the worst 'Friday the 13th' movies look good. John Carpenter's original film is rightly considered a classic, and one of the most influential films in the genre. The sequels have been a very mixed bag, but I never thought it would get this bad. Other reviewers have commented on the fact that this movie is atrociously poorly made, so I won't repeat these charges, except to add that the musical score by Danny Lux is like everything else about this film: way below standard. My main gripe is really this: To me the 'heart' of the Halloween series was always the character of Laurie Strode, played wonderfully by Jamie Lee Curtis. The fact that they chose to dispose of her in such a casual way within the first 15 mins. of the film does simply not ring true with the continuity of the original storyline of 'Halloween', 'Halloween 2' and 'Halloween H20'. Not only is the proposed explanation of how Michael Myers survived his decapitation in H20 completely unbelievable, even for a film in this genre, but the way Laurie Strode meets her doom is utterly ridiculous and beyond 'suspension of disbelief' if you consider the way the character developed through the previous films. I can't understand why Jamie Lee Curtis would ever accept having Laurie Strode written out of the Halloween series as if she were a character in a day-time soap opera, but maybe she just finally wanted out of the franchise. In sum, any fan of the original 'Halloween' film should feel offended by the low quality offered us in 'Halloween Resurrection': The movie is so bad that I consider it an insult to the audience.",

Like many horror films, it has blood, guts, a psycho killer who won't die, and his victims stupidly running upstairs, into corners, and separating themselves.  On the upside, Busta Rhymes has a great comedic performance as the webcast's producer, the plot flows smoothly, and at least 75% of the hour and a half film was filled with action and suspense, which keeps the audience entertained.  I haven't seen any of the other Halloween movies, so I can't compare it to them, but if you like the typical horror film, I would recommend seeing this, and the sooner the better, as the packed opening night crowd in the theatre I saw it in definitely added significantly to the atmosphere of the movie.  Expect a fun, exciting, and suspenseful 90 minutes, but nothing out of the ordinary ... 7/10",

The first twenty minutes are great, but that is as close to the original Halloween that the film gets.   Now before I go off here, I'll admit that there are moderately suspenseful moments in the movie, and a bunch of red herrings, most of which can be spotted but some that can't.  It's not that this movie is short, even though it is a short feature.  It's that there are too many characters.  Actors with some name value such as Tyra Banks and Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie, Little Big League) are left to do nothing but smirk.  Oh, I'm sorry, Tyra Banks gets to shake her groove thing for a few seconds.  Thomas Ian Nicholas just stands there, well, smirking.  They must have five lines combined.  And meaningless lines at that.  They just serve as more prey for Michael Myers.  The screenwriters appear to have been very uninspired for this script that they had to meld different horror movies into one.  The hand held camera gimmick is straight out of The Blair Witch Project or a couple of \"reality shows\" that have aired at some point on MTV and Fox.  Than there's the show within a show and the killer shows up at the place where the show is being made. This has been done in Scream 3, and in Robert Bloch's novel Psycho 3.  In any case it's a used plot device.  Busta Rhymes is alright although it started sounding like he was using the f-word for comical effect, like he thought he was in some buddy comedy with Martin Lawrence.  Busta Rhymes even gave away his fate in the movie while making an appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment's Smackdown.  I won't tell you what he said but that was the worst thing about the movie. Come to think of it Busta has the acting skills of a professional wrestler. The dialogue isn't too bad, but it can't help but be stilted at times.  And there's the gang of kids who can't wait to get it on with each other, all except for the virginal one.  I have one question.  People do really brainless things in horror movies, but if you were spending time in a mass murderers home, I would thing that sex would be the last thing on your mind.  But that's just me.  Is Michael Myers really this indestructible?  In the first one, it worked because  he hadn't cheated death so many times yet.  They're turning him into the undead. Overall Jamie Lee Curtis has turned this series into her own, by appearing in four of it's movies, like Sigourney Weaver did with Alien.  It might as well have just been four movies in the series, Halloween 1,2,7, and now 8. And like Alien 4, Jamie Lee's fourth installment is the the least worthy of the bunch.  But let's face it, if Jamie Lee Curtis finds herself still doing phone commercials in four years, Halloween 9 won't be far away.",

The movie contained plenty of TERRIBLE acting, so it actually made Busta Rhymes look like he could act.  He impressed me quite a bit, but I'm sure it was because his acting was a \"lesser of two evils\" thing.  I don't know why people get upset when there is comic relief in horror movies.  The movies shouldn't be taken so seriously anyhow.\nThe main problem I had with the movie was with how they made Michael Myers a bit too intelligent.  In the previous movies, Myers was diagnosed as having Antisocial behavior, which according to psychology, means that he does not care who he kills, etc etc.  He never worried about getting caught before, but in this movie he hides and worries about getting caught, which is unrealistic (yes, so is having an unstoppable killer, but at least stick with the creator's formula).  There were obvious references to Jason and Freddy movies in the movie.  Busta Rhymes was named Freddy and dressed as Myers in the house.  Is that some sort of subliminal message saying Freddy Krueger wants to be like Mike...Myers?  Maybe they took these shots at the Freddy and Jason movies since those two are seen as the two premier horror characters and they're supposedly going to have that showdown.\nWell, I would give the movie 7 out of 10 stars",

The very first was (and is) a landmark to the horror genre that has been scarcely surpassed to date, save for two of it's sequel.  Halloween 2 did every thing a sequel should, including succeeding where the previous had failed.  Then, John Carpenter made a gross error and misjudjement that resulted in, not one, not two, but four, yes four even more brutal mistakes and death-nails to the series. Then, a saving grace.  I go to the theatre one evening to see I-don't-remember, and a preview comes on with the scream queen doing what she does best and pronouncing the name of that oh-so-wonderful knife wielding mute, \"Michael!\"  Halloween: H20, breathed new life to a series of movies which had run aground in the mid '80s.  It also reaffirmed Mr. Carpenter as one of the pivitol names in horror.  The storyline offers a credible response to the three prequels by forgetting them.  And the ending, the perfect cap on the trilogy.  Needless to say, I was a happy camper. Then, like any good horror fan, I sat in a darkened theatre expecting to see Jason Vorhees hacking up the usual trollops and teens with their pants to their ankles.  What I got, however, was a preview I would not soon forget. It began as a fairly typical late nineties teen horror flick about some kids trapped in a haunted house, until a figure flashed before the screen toting the aptly named \"butcher's knife.\"  After being shushed for a rather girlish scream, I found that they were in fact releasing another film and I was pleased as punch to see Michael back in his blue jumpsuit.  After seeing the actual film, I was somewhat less impressed with how it had related to it's prequels.  I didn't feel the story was as developed as it could have been. That being said, the rest of the film was amazing!  I loved the camera work (a theory I had considered).  I myself have always been a Rick Rosenthal fan and this is not one of his works to be taken in stride.",

With \"Halloween: Resurrection\", producer Moustapha Akkad has taken the most celebrated series of its genre and upped the ante.[Warning: SPOILERS]Like many viewers, I concluded at the end of \"Halloween H20\" that Michael Myers was finally gone.  How could he possibly survive decapitation?  At the beginning of \"Resurrection\" we see the shocking explanation, and discover that he really is still alive.  In retrospect, how could it be otherwise? Mind and body are inseparable.And when one of the young women quotes Sartre for her boyfriend (\"Existence precedes essence\"), I knew I was in for a philosophical thriller of unimaginable depth. According to Sartre, human consciousness is pure freedom, but with freedom comes anguish.  It is in this role that Michael Myers is at his most terrifying.When a group of college students explores the childhood home of Michael Myers, we're not just inside his house; we are inside his mind.  The students are outfitted with miniature cameras, and the information age allows them to broadcast whatever they see over the Internet.  Anyone on the planet can tune in.  This is universal consciousness.  Michael Myers is everywhere; he is in all of us.Earlier in the film, a psychology professor lecturing on Jung tells his students that everyone has a dark side, or \"shadow\".  Now, in what is perhaps the most chilling scene in the history of cinema, we see a man dressed as Michael Myers, walking slowly through a dark corridor, stalked by the real Michael Myers.  He turns to face him, innocently believing it's one of his friends in costume. Michael Myers is confronted, for the first time ever, with himself.  And he turns away!Sartre explains:  \"The possibility of falling from the precipice can no more produce the fall than my horror of the fall can determine me to avoid it. It is this counter-anguish which generally puts an end to anguish by transmuting it into indecision.  Indecision in its turn calls for decision. I abruptly put myself at a distance from the edge of the precipice and resume my way.\"And so, after hesitating, Michael Myers turns and looks for another victim.Then we receive a shocking twist: One of the camera-toting adventurers (Sean Patrick Thomas) discovers that the house has been artificially stocked with various props, designed purely to elicit fear.  The youths confront the organizer (Busta Rhymes), saying, \"None of this is real! You set us all up!\" But he explains, \"America doesn't like reality.  Nobody wants to see you running around an empty house.\"Is all of our anguish self-induced?  Look closely enough inside the conscious self and you find... nothing!In addition to the mind-bending philosophy, this film brings a taut construction and a welcome modernization of lighting and color composition. And with an outstanding -- I would say Oscar-worthy -- performance by Busta Rhymes, \"Resurrection\" is a tour de force all the way up to its spine-tingling and unpredictable finale.",

I am a die-hard fan of the series (and of the other horror maniac series), and I must say that this is the 1st sequel I've seen in YEARS that has actually COMPLETELY fit together with its predecessor such as H2 fit with H1!  Although the opening sequence was disturbing (expected however), there are a few key elements that have returned to the series that I have sooo missed!  The first element is the actual house itself!...it LOOKS just like the original house from parts 1 and 2! (and please don't mention part 5 where they used a CASTLE for Michael's house!!!).  This was very pleasing to a die hard fan such as myself.  The 2nd element is that Michael FINALLY not only looked half way decent (mask wise)...but the whole \"HEAVY BREATHING\" element has returned!  It gives the creepiness back to the character the way it was originally intended!  Next element, Michael has found someone new to stalk like he did with Laurie Strode...CREEPY!(the character Sara, nobody knows what connection he will have to her in future sequels!)  Last but not least, He is back to strictly doing his thing...he doesn't play games with the characters like he did in H20.On a final note, I am very disturbed that the storyline from parts 4-6 have still been completely ignored..(I was under the impression that part 8 was going to repair the damage that H20 did to the previous storyline regarding Laurie's daughter Jamie Lloyd & her baby)...but apparently I was wrong! :-(On a positive ending though, this was an EXCELLENT movie that was much better than H20 or any other recent horror movie sequel...so my hat is off to you Mr. Rosenthal!!! :-)  Please return to the series!P.S.

            "content": "Halloween: Resurrection is the eighth installment in a series started by director John Carpenter with his sinister and ground-breaking 1978 film Halloween. The first film, was a milestone in horror. Then it got stuck with a long line of sequels - some good, some awful. The last entry, Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later was a pleasant surprise. It was both clever and suspenseful.The Halloween franchise was supposed to end in 1998 with H20. The cast featured original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in the first two movies. Her character, Laurie Strode, sister of Myers, resurfaced as a divorced, alcoholic headmistress who stopped her homicidal brother, once and for all\u0085or so we thought.In the prologue that gets adrenaline pumping, the long-suffering Laurie is catatonic and locked up in a sanitarium after having decapitated an innocent man at the end of H20. We discover Laurie hasn't been taking her medications and is ready for an escape or a showdown with her brother.Myers has tracked her down and enters the building. On the run, Laurie lures him up to the roof, where she lays a trap and has him dangling from a rope by one foot. In a twisted gesture of sympathy, she attempts to unmask her brother and he seizes the opportunity for freedom.Then the real movie starts. Six Haddonfield University students, Sara (Bianca Kajlich), Jenna (Katee Sackhoff), Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Jim (Luke Kirby), and Donna (Daisy McCrackin) have made the cut to appear in a live Internet broadcast.Dangertainment - the online company's concept is based on a combination of familiar reality TV shows. The students are locked in the childhood home of Myers on Halloween night and wear cameras so the viewers at home can see everything that happens.The show is run by Dangertainment's proprietor, Freddie (rapper Busta Rhymes), who has the place loaded with hidden cameras and fake props. Although the reality thing is pretty much burnt out at this point, the whole Internet angle and webcams were cool.There's also a subplot involving Sara (Bianca Kajlich) and a teen, Myles (Ryan Merriman) flirting via palm pilot (it ends up being an awesome plot device during the tenser stalk sequences). The broadcast is being watched by students crowded around a computer at a costume party.  Soon, Myles begins to suspect the murders are not staged but real.Screenplay wise, this has to be the scariest of most Halloween sequels. The dialogue isn't lousy, but the lead characters are a bit underdeveloped, but not a screenwriting crime. Why is Tyra Banks' character Nora, Freddie's assistant, in this movie? She's absent most of the time.At least our heroine, Sara (Kajlich), is vulnerable, yet strong. She's likable and a worthy predecessor to Curtis' Strode. To be honest, I dug Busta Rhymes' Freddie. I enjoyed his performance that gave the movie some comedic relief. He did some over-the-top martial arts gestures and also had a few tough guy lines. Brad Loree (Michael Myers) comes on strong as the masked maniac. His subtle moves and his eyes projected evil. \u0085the man is scary!The original film built suspense by revealing emptiness where you thought Myers might be. Halloween: Resurrection has fast paced editing, the on-screen presence of computer technology and multiple views of stalking and murders. It gives the series a modern feel and makes it enjoyable.Halloween: Resurrection also marks the return of Rick Rosenthal, who directed the thrilling second installment in 1981. Rosenthal does a solid, impressive job and generates tension in many scenes. He handles the web cam P.O.V. (Point of View) shots well, the murders are slick, and he manages to intensify the screen with the shadows of the dark location.\nIts premise is smart, and the final scene is frightening. Halloween: Resurrection delivers suspense, many creepy moments, the murders are gruesome, Myers is an unstoppable killing machine and the pace is quick at 85 minutes.I can't say that I was bored one time. Fans of the horror genre, the Halloween franchise and Michael Myers should be pleased with this one.",

They should have brought Hartnett back and had Myers go after him, since that is his only family member left alive. I don't know. Just never watch this movie.",

Halloween Resurrection is by far the most superior Halloween movie ever made. No story line, just people being slashed to death on live feed over the internet. Completely original horror scenes, such as one where this girl goes looking around even though she doesn't want to be there at all, and gets slaughtered because she did something dumb. Brilliant writing. I couldn't have planned it better.How about the acting, and BUSTA RHYMES!!! WOW!!! Who cares about the previous movies, this one is all about the hip hop and the shiz niz on the diz wiz! SHANIZZLE! What a wonderful touch to the movie. Something the original writers wouldn't have ever done (what with the time they spent trying to create a plot and all that stuff).There are other scenes where people get killed, and act with only the up most skill and ability they possess. The acting is simply something of true wonder when you watch it, and you'll be saying to yourself \"Oh My GOD, What the-\" because its that good. The same goes with the unpredictable plot, MAN was it something...Yes, Halloween Resurrection should be viewed by anyone who wants a new Halloween movie.",

It's now reached a point of desperation where the concept of the first film has been thrown out the window.  When you see Michael walk through a thick concrete door, as if the door was made of tissue paper you'll see what I mean.  Michael Myers is a human being, catatonic and psychotic.  He is made of flesh and blood and other systems that make up the body and can be shut down like anyone else.  He was not suppose to be inhuman and have superhuman strength.  The concept of him being a normal person made the series work.  They only mention two parts in the series in this film and use an ending that is very reminiscent of  a sequel that was not mentioned.  That's sad.  The movie is not scary, it's not funny and not very gory.  The webcast is a bad idea and makes it look very grainy and jumpy and difficult to watch.  All in all I have to make a plea to anyone involved in this project to not make another sequel.  It's been exploited enough and it's time to call it quits and leave the memory of the first film intact rather than drag it through the mud with another atrocious, unmemorable sequel.

Second, the girl who escapes learns that the stalker is her brother, third (20 years later, which is the best idea), you learn that this virgin (not anymore) get into alcohol problem and she became stronger than ever. And then, the final chapter, the girl that we loved during 25 years, the girl we wanted to protect....is killed by her own brother. Ok, I admit, the rest of H8 is not the story of the century, but for a fan like me, I could not ask for better. Curtis accepted one last time to play Strode if she get killed. She got what she wanted. For me, there's not gonna have other Halloween movies. Even if they make another one. Micheal is still alive but I don't want to know more.

On a brighter note the slaughters were good and Michael went back to his roots (Halloween I, II, 4 (6 was good too)) with his slow and perdition killing ways, unlike in H20.  I did however like a lot how the beginning of Resurrection summed up the end of H20.  They did that very well.  But once again like in H20 the whole coming down from the ceiling with one arm was retarded.  The whole Laurie Strode thing upset me, but I won't go there.

For this being a low budget film it sure seems they tried really hard to make it look good and in my book they did it.  The start of the movie kind of surprised me but then again who knows, (cant say what happens).  Only thing i wish was a bit better were the death scenes but we all know if a movie is to violent they may not allow it to go to theaters. Overall i give this movie an 8.5 out of all of them.

The acting becomes comical, there are huge gaps in the sequencing logic and the final weapon chosen by the writers is a joke. Three stars is a bit high. I will vote 5 on the 1-click.",

Michael looks Great (The mask looks very much like the mask used in parts 1 and 2-AWESOME) and it's so cool to see the masked-boogeyman slashing victims in the old Myers house!  Rick Rosenthal, who directed HALLOWEEN II, does a great job once again with the way he captures Michael on film. NOW let me tell you why I was disappointed...SPOILERS BELOW (Don't read from this point if you haven't seen the film yet and don't want certain aspects ruined)!!!The main storyline To the HALLOWEEN series is that MICHAEL MYERS will stop at nothing to kill his sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  Laurie's survival is the ONLY reason to keep the series going...it gives THE BOOGEYMAN a PURPOSE and a REASON to go on!!  The opening of this movie is great, with Laurie now in a Mental Institution (nice twist)...and Michael obviously pursues her!  He breaks into the Institution and goes after his sister one more time. The first 15 minutes of the movie are awesome! However, the BIGGEST Mistake of the series happens at the end of this sequence... MICHAEL Kills Laurie!!!  He stabs her and she falls to her death (well...I suppose there's a chance she didn't DIE since no further references to Laurie or the beginning are made in the movie- Hey, Michael keeps coming back, so why not!)  But the point is, that's it!  The story ends there!  Michael accomplised his goal...Then we go into a whole new story about a group of people spending HALLOWEEN night in the Old Myers home as part of a live Web-Cast. And of course, Michael goes HOME and takes turns slashing them off one-by-one!  I have to admit, that was cool- There are some cool gore effects in this entry as well. BUT, as mentioned before, The story ENDS when Laurie dies.Series producer, Moustapha Akkad once said in an interview that they never should have KILLED off Rachel (ELLIE CORNELL in HALLOWEEN 4 and 5) in HALLOWEEN 5.  The FANS liked her character and didn't want to see her die! She didn't deserve to get killed...especially so soon.  WELL, knowing this, Why did he let our HEROINE, Laurie, bite the bullet!???  BIG MISTAKE!!! She was the last glue left to hold the series together.  Without her or Donald Pleasance, the series just can't be the same.  Well Moustapha, I hope you're reading this...And I hope that LAURIE survived that FALL...otherwise, the fans are gonna be LET DOWN big time.The rest of the cast is good, but Busta Rhymes gets a little silly with the kung-fu crap.  Why do the rappers always survive gun-shots and stabs anyway?? (laughing)!So, in summation, the movie is fun...Michael looks and stalks as cool as ever...BUT Laurie must Go On for the series to go on!  Remember that...because the FANS won't forget.",

If the film had ended at the the sanitarium perhaps because Laurie was'nt at home in Haddonfield as Michael may have expected where a web cam debarcle was taking place after slicing and dicing all the twits at the Myers house, he may have tracked her to the sanitarium where a showdown could have been staged... For someone who has been living in fear for twenty three years of their brother..it was a rather quiet ending for Laurie Strode.... As it was for Jamie LLoyd in H6.Apart from the opening scene of this movie.overall the movie lacked substance.. Why did Michael go home?

I now have the soundtrack to the film because of the new Halloween theme. It was awesome. It wasn't to orchestrated and kept the score easy and quick. The film was actually funny at a certain extent. I honestly thought that Busta Rhymes would mess up this sequel, but I was wrong. He did pretty good and made me laugh espescially the one scene when he and Michael are face to face and he tells Michael off. The entire theatre laughed at that scene and myself as well. The death scenes were pretty cool and not to gory. I had heard that one of the reasons of the re-shoots of this film was because of some of the over-the-top cheesy death scenes and the ending. But really the death scenes and ending were fine and pleased me very much. Some of the dialogue is cheesy but oh well. It didn't bother me that much.

It's Halloween's 8th installment what did you really expect? Were you expecting the Excorcist or The Shining? No, you get what you expect from a movie like this, silly entertainment.

Even though, I must admit that most of the acting in the movie was poor, the story was ok. I must admit it was bad to kill off Laurie Strode at the start of this movie, but I think that one of the strengths of the movie was Brad Loree, I thought that he was one of the most intimidating actors to play Michael ever since Nick Castle and I think he was definitely better than Chris Durand in H20.

Those responsible sold out big time and the true roots of the Halloween films (which were laid superbly by John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Jamie Lee, and the late Donald Pleasence) are nowhere to be found in this movie.  The town of Haddonfield, in previous installments, seemed like a character in and of itself.  You would see Michael lurking into people's houses, backyards, and hospitals in the town, which makes the audience feel like they are a member of the town themself.  In this installment, Haddonfield is nothing more than your regular, run-of-the-mill, city in America.  It has certainly lost the charm it once had.  In addition, you never understand why Michael goes home and with the bad dialogue and acting, you don't really care, either.  The same goes for the Myers' house.  While it may look like Michael's home, it doesn't feel like it is. The only good thing the movie had going for it was the various ways you could view events that took place in the house thanks to head cams used by the actors.  In all, those responsible took the true meaning of \"Halloween\" and turned it into a summer slash fest.  They should have stopped at H20 (which did not follow events of previous sequels, but was in and of itself a good movie) or at least thought of something more clever to revive the series.  There are no surprises in this movie, and that includes the very predictable ending.  There is nothing left for the true Halloween fans to come back to.  The original characters are gone, Haddonfield is no longer Haddonfield, and as you will see, Michael's house is no longer Michael's house.  Halloween used to be the night HE came home.

I can't believe Jamie Lee Curtis decided to do that.  It ruined all the other movies; her surviving in all the other movies means nothing because he actually did kill her now.  H20 was SUCH a better movie; the plot meant something to the series, the characters weren't all just a bunch of horny teenagers (although some were), and the overall direction and music was better quality.  I can't believe that the guy who did the 2nd movie directed this one, too.  Micheal has NO purpose for existence now that he's killed his sister.  It's what he's been trying to do for 23 years and now he's done it.  There's no point now.  And did anyone actually think he was dead at the end?

This was a joke and an embarrassment to everything the old movies were.  Right of the bat, the 'explanation' for how Michael Myers survived H2O made me want to leave.  I guess it wasn't him, it was a paramedic who had his throat crushed by Michael Myers, so he couldn't talk, and Myers just dressed him up to look like him.  Absolutely brilliant. Never mind the fact at the end of H20, 'Michael Myers', oh yeah I mean 'the paramedic' was trying to kill Laurie Strode.  I guess the paramedic decided at the end of H20 to act like Myers and try to kill Laurie for the heck of it.  The writers of this movie must've forgotten about that.  Let alone the fact that Laurie was dead within the first 10 minutes; forgetting the fact that the woman survived every single attack by Myers in the other movies, and we are to believe she just gets killed like that?  Not likely.  Even more so, any fan of Halloween knows that burning Michael Myers alive, will not kill him.  It didn't work twice before, and watching this movie I knew it would not be over, when he was 'dead'.  I guess the writers figured that if a capable guy like Dr. Loomis couldn't kill him, a shot in the testicles by Busta Rhymes would definitely take care of him.  Anybody that enjoyed this pile, is a testament to how easily amused people are these days. What used to be an original series of movies, turned into a mockery, and a prime example of how bad horror movies have gotten.  Gone is the intelligence, and good storylines, and in are really bad lines, a plot full of holes, and really bad camera work (it was horrible as well).  Whoever OK'ed this movie, should be fired, and what's even worse is there has to be another one, Myers is still alive.

The cast is seriously deprived of talent. Busta on screen for more than 10 minutes? Please! And did Tyra Banks serve a purpose other than being eye candy to help you forget how awful this movie was? Even Rick Rosenthal, who directed the often over-looked \"Halloween II\", could not help this paper thin, thoughtless, meaningless, pile of tripe. (He can only direct what's written.) Even the cast seemed to be uninterested, if not just plain bored by the story. It's always hard to resurrect a character for a sequel, especially the sixth (\"Halloween III\" not included), but the explanation they give is just insulting.

This movie did poorly and thus the reason there hasn't been another sequel made since. You can now see why they thought it would be a good idea to revitalise the series by Re-Making the first one but this isn't about that so lets talk about the movie itself.The first point I am going to make is what I made at the start of this review. How can Michael Myers still be alive after we presumed it was him that got his head cut off. This was the worst thing that put me off this movie when watching it. I do agree that the idea of which it was executed in order for Michael to still be alive was passable but there are so many reasons to explain why the paramedic, who was dressed by Michael, didn't just take the mask off and run away but I guess this is a movie and that does not count.....The second part is the demise of beloved Halloween star Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis). When first looking at the DVD cover which shows the actors and of course Jame Lee Curtis, I presumed that Jamie would have a larger role in this movie. The idea of killing of the most important character in the franchise right slap bang at the start was a terrible move. This not only wasted peoples anticipation to see how she and Michael would unfold in the movie but also wasted peoples money who actually bought a ticket to see this on the big screen(who i feel sorry for). Why didn't they just have her in the whole movie and then died at the end because at least this way it shows that she put up a last ditch effort..does it not it?! Also I am led to believe that somewhere along the line the franchise has to move on. We cant and couldn't have the same protagonist always escaping until Halloween \"H30\" because that would and did get very old. From H20 to Halloween(1978) and Halloween 2(1981) she had a good run but it was time to move on because after time the audience would start to question Michaels ability to kill just one primary person after chasing her for a long damn time (Story time) In my closing I would give this movie a 4 out of 10 because I am generous and didn't think this movie was that bad, it was just not everyones liking and I wouldn't recommend watching it more than 2 times.Thanks for reading! :)",

The beginning was one the the best sence, *spoiler* but unfortunately the ending left it way to open for the next movie.

They should have ended with H20. It was a decent finale which brought Jamie Lee back with dignity and closure. Or so I thought. The way her character, Laurie Strode, was killed was cheap and rushed. She went through so much and to end up dead in such a ludicrous and quick way is beyond words - really. The other factor in fast resolution was how Michael Myers remained alive. What a bunch of garbage, switching place with a paramedic? What?absurdity. It would have been believeable if the killer in H20 were an imposter. Which would have been easily explained by his lack of burnt hands. Did someone forget that Meyers somehow survived a fire? This fact was evident in the now disgarded and lame sequels 4 and 5. It made sense. Now it is overlooked. Another fact that has always bothered me  - why cant they ever get the mask right? I have a mask that is an exact replica from the early 80's by Don Post. Why cant someone in Hollywood find one that is suitable?John Carpenter must be laughing at what they have done to his original masterpiece. Exploited and twisted his creation into a money cow for profit and a level of low entertainment. And Jamie Lee Curtis surprised me the most with her performance in this film. In interviews regarding her appearance in H20 she spoke of her characters dignity and purpose. To let Laurie Strode die without dignity, locked in an asylum after all that she put into her character is sad and a letdown. Moustapha please dont make another one. As a fan I feel cheated and will not purchase the film upon video release for it is an embarrassment. The only films in the series worthy of the titles Halloween are the original, part 2 and H20. I dont think anyone can dispute this. Micheal close your eyes and dont open them again.",

            "review_title": "The Night HE Sold Out.",
            "content": "The following contains SPOILERS, so beware.I can't say too much here about Halloween Resurrection that hasn't already been said, but I certainly can reveal a TRUE Halloween fan's reaction to what I consider the worst installment of this franchise.  It should be said that the original Halloween is my favorite movie of all time, so perhaps I am a bit biased here.  Yet Halloween 8 stands as a prime example of a studio (shame on you, Dimension) catering to the largest audience possible to maximize profits.  The filmmakers have clearly lost the heart and soul that made the original so effective.  What worked for the first Halloween was SIMPLICITY.  Realistic characters, the setting of the small town (go back and watch again and see how deserted, how HAUNTED Haddonfield feels in the first one), and a simple story.   Now, all of a sudden we have heroines attacking with chainsaws and Busta Rhymes doing karate on what was once a no-nonsense killer.  Please!  Back in 1978 Michael NEVER would have put up with this guy!The movie starts off fairly mediocre.  Having a remix of John Carpenter's classic theme over the Dimension logo got me pumped, and putting Laurie in the same mental state as her brother (loved how she stares out that window) was a nice touch.  I'm mixed on Laurie being killed off.  On the one hand, at least her torment is over for good (or so we think).  But on the flip side, a legendary character of the horror genre has been disposed of.  Wow, all those years of happily seeing Laurie survive so much torment just went down the drain.  Kinda feels like a waste of time rooting for her knowing that in the end she falls victim to the knife.  I'm still not quite sure how she thought hanging Michael and dropping him a few feet over the roof would finally kill this guy once and for all.  I mean, let's face it: the guy's a monster.  He's survived God knows how many beatings, and this is gonna be his ultimate demise?  Come on, Laurie, you're smarter than that.\nThe rest of the film I could really care less about in terms of story.  For me, the Halloween series ended when Laurie falls off that roof (actually, I previously thought it ended with the exciting finale of H20, but so much for that conclusion.  Thanks again, Dimension).  It's obvious that the producers are taking the films in a different direction now, and that's fine.  I can accept the fact that these movies will never be what they once were.  But goodness, can us die-hard fans please get a little respect?  Comedy has NO PLACE in a Halloween film.  If so, it should NOT come at what is regarded as the `climax.'  That's what separates the Halloween films from other milked horror franchises- Michael Myers is one of the few killers left we aren't yet rooting for.  Self-parody belongs in movies like Jason X and Bride of Chucky, NOT Halloween!  Can you imagine, in 1978 at the climax of Halloween, Laurie Strode dancing around Michael, poking him with that coat hanger while making Mr. Miyagi noises?  Sheesh.  I will admit that the scene with Busta Rhymes in costume mouthing off at the real Michael had me in stitches. There's just something about picturing Michael, with all his inner rage bottled up over the years, finally getting it all off his chest that puts a smile on my face.  But that's AS FAR as the humor should go.  When the comedy is PART of the scene, not the RESULT of it.There were a few things about Halloween Resurrection that I liked.   Aside from the atrocious script, bad one-liners (oh God, make it stop), and bland characters, much of the technical side of the film was impressive.  Danny Lux's score, while unfortunately not including many of the themes made popular in the original, was certainly a step-up from H20's overdone mix and Halloween 6's grating guitar rifts.  I appreciated the minimum use of locations as well, and for the Myers house being such a tight set, the cinematography and lighting were effective.Rick Rosenthal was an interesting choice as director, and as long as he didn't linger on Busta too long he did a good job.  While he handled the mix of the actual film with the Dangertainment footage appropriately, I still couldn't help but be let down with the lack of a Halloween night vibe to the movie.  Halloween II is a pretty mediocre sequel, but the one thing Rosenthal effectively captured in that film was a sense of doom threatening the entire town on an otherwise quiet evening.  Watching that movie, you start to believe that Michael truly could be in your backyard, staring at you through a window.  Here, the town of Haddonfield does not at all seem like the character it has been in previous installments.  As an audience, we're hardly ever pulled into the dark history surrounding this town's past, and for me that definitely took away from the movie.  And the film LOOKS like it was shot in the spring or summer, which proved to be quite distracting.There is one small sequence where Rosenthal brought me back to that unnerving feeling of 1978.  The camera booms down from a tree branch fluttering in the wind to a group of trick-or-treaters running down the street, as they place a jack-o-lantern on the front porch of the Myers house.  There's just an eerie combination of the way this sequence was shot, the innocence of the children against the evildoings inside the house, and Lux's ominous music that, for me, was the most effective part in the movie (albeit a small one).  That one tiny moment was enough to take me back to when Halloween was about atmosphere and the shadows of the night.  THAT is the Halloween I grew up with, not the rest of this horror-inept, audience-pleasing sell-out.",

I can't believe that Jamie Lee Curtis had the nerve to express her disgust with the other Halloween movies(4-6)and then does this to her career. May you get what you deserve. You may think I am being harsh, but Michael Myers was the BOOGEYMAN that scared me when I was young. I remember watching the first two Halloween movies every Halloween. It was such a great experience to be curled up on your sofa in the living room, everyone else was asleep or out. The fear was so incredible, and so great at the same time. You just knew Michael was waiting in your kitchen. I hate to see that destroyed just to make a quick buck. I will never watch another new Halloween movie again. Thanks for nothing, Rick.",

The movie definitely had a more creepy vibe than any of the previous sequels, making good use of the darkness in the house and the restricted views of the webcams. The acting wasn't brilliant, but when is the acting every brilliant in a slasher movie? There weren't really any big scares, but a few moments came close to making me jump, which is about the same as any other horror movie made in the last 20 years. Busta Rhymes was good in places, but also contributed to the worst scene in the movie, where he fights Michael with his bad kung fu. It's easy to see that some of this movie was ripped off from Halloween 1, including an obvious death scene (you'll know which one i mean) and various \"now you see me, now you don't\" scenes, but seeing as how the original came out 25 years ago, it could be seen as an homage rather than a rip off. To sum up, i would say that this movie gives the Halloween series a well needed change in pace and direction, especially after H20's minimal body count and teen flick approach to the series, and hopefully it will lead to Halloween 9 (yes, it will happen, it's inevitable) becoming a tense chiller like the original.

            "content": "(Written 7/16/02) **CONTAINS SPOILERS** Personally, I am a die hard horror fanatic..anyone who knows me should know this by now. They should also know that before I go see a sequel, I see all the movies prior to just to make sure they actually make sense in the connection. This 8th installment in the \"Halloween\" series does do a pretty okay job of picking up where the last one left off and explaining how he came back after he was supposedly decapitated in the last one (MUCH better continuity than \"Jason X\" had), but it was a crappy way of having Michael Myers just appear out of nowhere 3 years later.As far as scariness goes, this movie only proves that to get the TRUE effect of scary movies, you have to see it in a theater..widescreen, surround sound, all that stuff. Because if you see such a movie on video or DVD (or worse, cable), you're getting SOME of the great effects, but not the best. Anyhoo, I say this because its great to hear the footsteps behind you, the creepy breathing on your right, and of course the famous \"Halloween\" Theme (thank you John Carpenter for such brilliance!). Other sounds that can be heard around you are the sounds of dogs barking, crickets, and other night creatures that were added for effect. But as far as the scariness of the movie...I personally think it lacked individuality. It was obviously a cross between \"The Blair Witch Project\" and \"House on Haunted Hill\". There was even a scene where the girl puts her camera up to her face and goes on about how scared she is (JUST LIKE IN BLAIR WITCH!). That must've been intentional..I can only hope and assume. And the whole 'staying the night in a haunted house' deal was done in \"House On Haunted Hill\"...twice. And this movie did give in to its classic serial killing based movies..killer jumps out of closets, appears out of nowhere, is standing behind an unsuspecting victim, etc. No surprise there, but due to the fact that the volume was so loud, everytime something or someone did jump out, the sound of the shrieking and whatnot would pierce my eardrums..maybe that was the theater screwing up or maybe just another way to give the movie extra pizazz in the scariness department..it wasn't scary..it was annoying and painful..but if it makes you happy, I will admit that I did jump because of such events.And now of course, we move on to blood, gore, killings, nudity, and all that great stuff that makes a horror movie great. Well, there was REALLY nothing more outside of the classic stabbing. Obviously, Michael Myers is not as creative as Jason Vorhees when it comes to murdering his victims. Stab here, stab there...maybe a hanging over here..a body crushing over there...more stabbing..in fact, it got really old..but then again, after seeing all 7 of the \"Halloween\" movies (even the ones that didn't have Michael Myers in it), stabbing is pretty much all you got (except in the second one where Michael burned the skin off of a nurse in a hot tub..that was pretty good). As for the blood and gore...eh, not too much of it, which I think is a good thing. Its a bad idea to overdue with the blood and stuff because then it doesn't look that real. However, there is only so much blood that can come out of a person's eyes, nose, and mouth...I guess. Not like I've ever seen anyone get murdered in such a manner before, so I don't know..it just didn't look believable anyway. As far as nudity goes..thankfully, it was kept at a minimal. There wasn't really any at all. This is good because I think that nudity and sex in horror movies is part of what makes a horror movie a horror movie, but its not necessary at all. Lets just stick to the basic goal of scaring people, not arousing them (but if sex and naked women do scare you, then I guess there is no problem then).AND NOW, THE ENDING...now, anyone who watches horror movies should know that they can get pretty ridiculous with the endings as well as leaving leeway for a sequel. Example: In \"Jason Goes to Hell\"..Jason basically, well, went to hell. That was SUPPOSEDLY the end of the 'Friday the 13th' saga...of course he came back in \"Jason X\", but they did a very CRAPPY job of picking up where the last one left off. They didn't even bother to explain how the crap Jason got from underground to a confinement prison! I guess that was the best move to make though considering that they were taking a chance by making another sequel to something that was supposedly over anyway. They would've gotten ridiculous with the explanation of how he mysteriously returned from the dead. Now, as far as \"Halloween: Resurrection\" goes with its ending..I'd say 'been there, done that'. I don't want to spoil it, but I have to if I want to get my point across. In order to 'destroy' Michael Myers for the umpteenth time, the victims who managed to survive burned him alive..doesn't that sound a little cliched? Well, it is. IN FACT, thats the EXACT same way Michael was \"killed\" in \"Halloween 2\"...they poured gas on him and burned him..did he die? NO! SO WHY ARE YOU GOING TO TRY AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING AGAIN? Maybe the writers forgot about that or didn't care. I guess they figured, who actually pays attention to stuff like that? Well, news flash, its one of MY many passions of life to criticize horror movies. So, like I was saying..the ending was really redundant. As far as leaving room for a sequel, they did do that. Of course, we all know that Michael isn't REALLY dead (and I still am not sure why the people of Haddonfield haven't figured it out either that he ain't gonna die!). The last scene of the movie shows him in a body bag in a morgue..the coroner unzips the bag (ever so slowly for suspense reasons) of the supposedly dead serial killer (and guess what, I think they actually show his face..or maybe thats just the charred remains of the infamous mask). After a few seconds of the camera focusing on his face...BAM! His eyes snap open, and then the screen goes blank signaling the end of the movie and possibly the beggining of the 9th installment in the \"Halloween\" series. The whole eye snapping thing has been overworked in horror movies, but it actually seemed to fit in this one. Though the morgue scene made the movie go on longer than it needed to (it just seemed like they were trying to kill time by having it), it did make for a better ending.All and all, this movie was alright for a film that is doomed to bare a \"part 8\" at the end of its title. It had its bad points, as well as some good. It had its points where you can tell whats going to happen next without a doubt...seriously, in one scene I thought to myself \"she is going to open the door and he is going to jump out with the knife and stab her\" and behold, I was right. I had to chuckle at myself for that. And also as predicted, there were 3 black people (or African Americans to be politically correct, but why should I be when its my own race I'm talking about?) in the movie. Its been said and joked about many a time how black people never survive in such movies. Well, that was proven wrong in \"House on Haunted Hill\" when Taye Diggs character survived in the end (along with his white female entorage). And just as \"Halloween: Resurrection\" stole \"House on Haunted Hill\"'s plot..it stole its ending. One black guy survives (Busta Rhymes's character), along with the white female lead whom which the little subplot there is focuses on. I did, however, catch myself doing something that I know shouldn't be done in a horror movie...I yawned during this movie. Maybe it was because I didn't get enough sleep, or maybe it was because it felt like the movie was just dragging along..it didn't have a real good pace to it...nor a real good plot, but thats automatically forgiven in the horror genre. I predict that if there is a Halloween Part 9, NONE of the surviving characters that were in this one will be in it. I've noticed that trend with horror movies. Example: In \"Halloween: H20\", Jamie Lee Curtis's character, Laurie Strode, had a son (Josh Hartnett's character). Well, we hear NOTHING about this son at all in this movie. We assumed hes moved on and doesn't care that his mother was murdered in the insane asylum she was sent to for 3 years. This also brings back the fact that in \"Halloween 4\", Laurie Strode had a daughter and not a son. I'm not sure what they did with that whole situation, but I've read somewhere that the producers wanted to forget that the movies \"Halloween 3-6\" ever happened in order to focus on the Laurie Strode aspect of the story. That is understandable..we all make mistakes.",

You could hear the rats running round you, and great use was made of the subwoofer channel, you could almost feel Micheals breath. Mediocre films can be greatly saved by a great soundtrack.\nVisual, and storyline 6/10 Audio 9/10",

            "content": "Let's face it, this was a bad movie. This could have been pretty decent had they used the \"web cams\" only. On the DVD there is an option to watch the movie only from the web cam views. It's much scarier this way. I wish they had put the movie in the theatres like this, it had a blair witch feel to it. If you happen to rent this, I suggest checking out this option...much better than the movie itself.",

            "content": "Yes I admit I liked it despite the tech flaws and mostly flat acting. Busta Rhymes wasn't the best but hardly the bomb some would say. If he is, then blame the director who needed to do just that; direct. As it seems, its like he made the film by consensus. Second; fire the continuity person, he/she did a terrible job. Big diff between continuity and editing. Bianca Kajlich (?) while pretty was wimpy at times with her inexplicable screaming but did better when she summoned up some spine. Someone said there was a prob when Michael impales Sean Patrick's character. I took it for granted that the knives went in when Michael lifted him off his feet jammed the knives through the door then picked up the third knife. He didn't grow a third hand lol. Next was the scene where he's shown not to have been decapitated was a very good way to 'resurrect' him, as opposed to Jason and Freddy. Crushed voicebox was a good way to explain it but dumbed down as who wouldn't notice a paramedic carrying a knife around? So much more could have been done but still; an enjoyable timewaster. Didn't expect the bust through the mirror scene which actually made me jump, lol. A ninth? Only if it is a final movie with Michael hunting his last living relation; his nephew John. And only with Josh Hartnett signed on.",
