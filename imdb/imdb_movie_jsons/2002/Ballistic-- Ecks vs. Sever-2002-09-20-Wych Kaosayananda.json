            "content": "Let's be honest with ourselves for a moment. In a movie like this, the producers don't pay expensive actors to act or to create realistic performances or to use their talents to win our sympathy. No, they pay these actors for face and name recognition, so when a movie like Ballistic: Banderas vs Liu comes along we don't have the inconvenience of learning about characters and plot. Hell, we don't even have the inconvenience of wondering, \"Is this actor hot while all this excitement rushes them by?\" Name recognition, baby, it's all marketed by name recognition.And why should they let actors acting take up precious moments from the rooftop chases, the explosions, the gunfire, and posing like models? Everyone already knows these actors right? No need to develop anything more than flimsy excuses for action/motivation, right? Sarcasm aside - I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I think Ballistic would have been a better, more sophisticated, film if they scrapped the plot and clich\u00e9 character developments and just went for 90 minutes of uninterrupted Banderas and Liu gunning at each other backdropped by a slow-mo explosions.This film would have to scale a cliff before reaching the level of plot intricacies and intelligence that just thrive in Michael Bay films.We get a crappy plot and crappy characterizations anyway just in case we don't have a favorite actor to root for. We get ultra clich\u00e9 scenarios that anyone who has been to a theatre in the last fifty years will pick up on. Oh no, a child's been kidnapped \u0096 we're supposed to sympathize with the boy. There's the old (young?) has-been former cop (FBI guy in this movie) who lost his motivation \u0096 we're supposed to sympathize with him and the loss of his family. And then there's--oh, but wait? What are these plot revelations? What are they pointing towards? Gasp! They're making the already obvious villain even more obvious! Me? I was rooting for the aliens from Independence Day to come down and blow them all up, but the bastards got stuck in traffic.Somewhere in the movie is a subplot about a nano-assassin, but I cared about that as much as the movie does.And since we're being honest, I admit this is a great film to watch after a night of provocative and cultured cinema to recalibrate your personal scale to the realities of the industry. Like I explained to the guy at Blockbuster, \"I just got a box-set of Hitchcock, been watching those back to back, and the other day I watched De Palma's Femme Fatale. I need something trashy before I become a full-blown film snob.\" So I walked out with Ballistic and Shark Attack 3, went home, and turned off my mind for a marathon of stock footage and needless gunfire/explosions . . . and all was well.",

            "content": "`Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever' has been saddled with not only one of the worst movie titles in recent memory, but one of the worst screenplays as well. The film's third-rate espionage plot makes no sense at all and serves basically as a lame excuse for endless explosions, shootouts and double-flipping car chases, which have become the standard accoutrements for virtually every action picture since `Bullitt' in 1968. \nThe problem with `Ballistic' is that the viewer can never tell who is doing what to whom or why \u0096 and we never care.   The film is really all about style anyway.  How else to account for the rather ludicrous image of Lucy Liu - looking more like a fashion model out on a shoot than a trained killer doing the shooting herself  - strolling in elegant slow motion through the streets of Vancouver, wiping out what seems to be an entire hit squad with a combination of superhuman marksmanship and Matrix-like kickboxing moves? With her ankle-length designer coat and her icy-cool demeanor, she looks like Calvin Klein's idea of what the well-dressed assassin should be wearing this season.  It's enough to reduce the whole enterprise to the level of comic absurdity \u0096 and, indeed, I often found myself laughing out loud at many of the ostensibly serious shenanigans occurring in the film.  The flashbacks, which are obviously intended to clarify the characters' relationships, are so poorly done that they actually end up making the whole story more muddled and confusing. (And, although the child-kidnapping scenario is never as offensive in this film as it is in `Trapped,' one can still question the propriety of filmmakers running to this theme with the kind of frequency they seem to have been doing of late).\nAntonio Banderas makes up the other half of the film's title (he is Ecks, she Sever), and one only wonders what he could have been thinking about when he signed on to co-star in this particular project.  `Ballistic' is utterly dispensable moviemaking:  here today, forgotten tomorrow, a film utterly without distinction, conviction or purpose.",

Rumor has it that the film makers know a thing about movie making.

I'm told that this has something to do with two assassins  fighting each other after some one is kidnapped, but I'm not certain since things just sort of happen for no real reason. I would like to think that this movie was a big joke on the movie going public but no one would want to spend what it cost to make this movie as a joke, especially when there was no hope of ever getting the money back in ten thousand life times.

Sometimes logic is defied in such a way as to make you question the mental state of those involved with giving this movie the \"greenlight\". This is not necessarily a good thing. This movie hurts on so many levels that it could be considered a cruel and inhuman torture to be made to sit through this. Everything about this movie screams bargain bin. With the exception of one scene (see below), this movie pretty much blows. Antonio Banderas is absolutely useless in this picture. You'd think from the ad campaign, let alone the fact that the movie is titled \"Ecks vs. Sever\", that he would be more of a serious ass kicker. No, no. The only one who gets to do any serious ass kicking is Lucy Liu and I'm 100% positive that she did this one only to pay the bills. Even with that revelation, she still sucked in it. The direction is pretty much what you'd expect from someone who goes by the name, \"Kaos\" but sometimes I'd like a little order to my chaos, ya know? I read a quote somewhere, where they said, 'who knew so much action could be so boring?' That's definitely the case here. Yeah there's a lot of action but it's of the direct-to-video variety. God, help me but this movie sucked. It wasn't even of the \"so bad, it's good\" type of flick. The story is incomprehensible, something about microscopic termites and little babies blown to smithereens and wives that bounce on you and the guy from Payback and.... AARRRRGGGHHH!!! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I can't recommend this to anyone. I'll give it a 1/2* out of ***** ONLY and I repeat, ONLY because of the aforementioned scene where some guy is knocked off of a rooftop by a grenade launcher and is shown falling to his death onto a parked car.

            "content": "I gave this movie a 3 of 10 which, I guess, makes me one of its biggest fans in my age group(I'm 41, and the highest ratings for this film averaged 2.5 at the time of my writing and were limited to sub-18 year olds).Banderas and Liu saved this film from deserving the rating it got here on IMDb. The film is certainly pointless, loaded with ridiculous plot twists and absurd action sequences, but how many action films don't fit this description? Seriously, if you want to see what two entertaining actors and a lot of wasted film can do together, this film is worth a look. it's plot heavy, bit soul-less and clich\u00e9d, but entertaining nonetheless.I turned it on at 3AM one sleepless night because I wanted to see what the heck Liu and Banderas were doing in a direct to video film. Expecting a thoroughly dreadful film, I was pleasantly surprised, and found the film to be entertaining. The film views like a series of strung together early-80s MTV videos with a contemporary hard rock sound track, plenty of loud noises and explosions, and, thankfully, few words.To the extent that I remember it, the plot was about Banderas trying to rescue his wife and son from the clutches of some very evil super-secret spy types (who are nevertheless apparently exceedingly inept). A lot of stuff got blown up - in fact most of the sets were heavily rigged with explosives which seemed to go off at random intervals. Of course there were a lot of gunshots, fists, and kicks. I don't recall any swords or phasers though. If I say anything about Lucy Liu at all, I will give away the rest of the plot (which ought to tell you something about the quality of the script and the complexity of the plot) Lighten up! It's bad, but it's just a B movie. And this is what B movies are supposed to be about. By the way, a better choice for an utterly stupid action/violence flick is the masterpiece of violence surrealism \"Mean Guns\"",

And cool slow motion flips through the air Matrix style and explosions - lots of them - are not going to change that. I have no idea what the background is between the two adversaries, no idea what makes the bad guy a villain, and no idea how they can spin this into a warm family drama, which they attempt to do at the end, I am just supposed to forget about all of those charred bodies left behind in Vancouver.The director of this film goes by \"Kaos\".

All the main characters are current or former US federal agents, presumably to keep it interesting, but all the action takes places in Vancouver, BC, which, last time I looked, was not in the United States. The basic storyline was fairly straightforward (and rather hackneyed), but the motivations of the various characters were utterly incomprehensible. The film was somewhat on the short side, and I couldn't escape the feeling that the three scenes which might have tied together the loose ends inexplicably ended up on the cutting room floor. Banderas phoned in his performance (for God's sake, enunciate, man), and the musical score was just irritating. The only two things \"Ballistic\" had going for it were the presence of some rarely-seen hardware (fun for you firearms buffs) and some spectacular action sequences (though these were plagued by some annoying clich\u00e9s, such as a protective vest preventing all injury to a character, and henchmen showing complete disregard for personal safety), and these were simply not enough to save this turkey.

I find it difficult to express why I disliked this film as much as I did without expressly pointing out key scenes and events that made me cringe while attempting to enjoy a thoughtless summer film. I did approch this film as just that. I am a guy who likes a thoughtless action film more often than not. I love thoughtful ones but the thoughtless ones can truly be fun. xXx comes to mind. I was expecting something along those lines when I came to see Ballistic. What it turned out to be was a number of explosions that seemed to occur for no reason what so ever. To say there was little plot bringing these explosions together is a given. That comes with the territory, but in this case the reasons are even below the lowest C movie in quality. No one reacts to an event the way you'd expect a normal human being to react. In fact the two main characters were so devoid oh personality I have come to wonder whether or not they were both blackmailed into performing the roles. I'm used to Lucy Liu not showing any on screen personality but Antonio consistently show's his \"Latin Lover\" charm. Not here.* spoilers begin below *Everyone is out to get Lucy Liu. No one seems to know where to find her. In fact they need to draw an FBI agent 7 years out of retirement to capture her. His groundbreaking method of investigation is to sit in a car listen to a radio and carry on dull conversations with secondary characters. Meanwhile across town Lucy Liu is walking in circles for no reason in a coffee bar. The bad guys know this and have snipers set up all over the place that would make the Kennedy assassination look like amateur night. How is it that they don't know where she hides out but knows when and where she's going to walk in circles? After giving the order not to hurt her immediately all snipers try to kill her and  an overly armed SWAT team hit's the scene. By overly armed I mean they have grenade launchers and heavy machine-guns all designed to kill as many innocent bystanders as possible. In fact the FX crew even botched the way rifle mounted grenade launches work and turned them into mini rocket launchers. But fear not, they don't use them. They are just there for Lucy to pick up and level 12 city blocks with. I often wondered how it is if she were so professional she'd stand in one place and take on an army rather than just slip away in the crowd.Once the mayhem is complete Antonio arrives glances at a few bullet holes and declares that the FBI should pick up and not investigate the devastation because `she's not done here.' I was able to relate to the FBI assistant directors baffled expression in this scene because I wouldn't know what to say to one of my agents who asked me to pull out all of my investigators cause the criminal might be coming back. Wouldn't you want to catch her?\nSkipping ahead to what I assume is the largest injustice here. Antonio finds his wife to learn that for the past 7 years she was in bed with the big bad guy of the film. Married to him in fact. He confronts her in an aquarium while she is contentedly looking at whales, which must be where she goes whenever her son is kidnapped and threatened to be killed within 12 hours. And she also proceeded to have Antonio's son, who has been raised by her and the man who;1) Tried to hill Antonio's character.2) Faked the death of himself and Antonio's wife in an effort to `have her to himself'. Which evidently worked for 7 years.When confronted she reveals that she had knowledge that Antonio was not dead and in fact always really loved him and not the big villain. She only stayed with him to `protect their son'. By having the son live with this guy? Give me a break! But what's worse is Antonio's reaction. He instantly understands and forgives her. No anger, no slap for her lack of logic. It's all OK. Lets go get the bad guy now. Honestly that ended the film for me. I was through.",

Everything in every area of filmmaking is wrong with Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. Even the title as Banderas and Liu are not in competition with each other.\nHere's the plot. Oh, wait a minute, I can't tell you what the plot is because it doesn't exist. It just a massive load of old cobblers. And what's even worse is that the nonexistent plot is full of holes. Make sense? No didn't think so. It's not even worth watching to see what I mean.The dialogue is the truly worst ever. At least the bad dialogue in movies such as Dolemite is eternally quotable. Ray Park's 'acting' makes Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal on their worst day look like Laurence Olivier. The 'action' is so basic it feels like a made for video production, it lacks anything resembling sophistication and excitement.\nI'm surprised Alan B. McElroy wrote this. He's done some good stuff (Wrong Turn, Spawn Animated Series) but this must have been something he wrote without much inspiration. Every writer comes up with a turkey but WHAT a turkey this is.

Ballistic fails to follow even that, which explains why the film bored the hell out of me.  I'm almost hesitant to say this, but the latest straight-to-video Jean-Claude Van Damme schlock might actually be better than Ballistic, which was arguably 2002's worst film (I've never seen Rollerball).There's something of a plot here, but I'm not entirely sure what the hell was going on.  Antonio Banderas plays FBI Agent Ecks, Lucy Liu is Agent Sever, and the two of them are duking it out because they somehow have crossed paths with a wealthy man (Gregg Henry) who is determined to smuggle a small electronic device that can assassinate its intended victim via heart attack.   Mixed up in it all is Talisa Soto as Banderas' supposedly dead wife, only she's not really dead.  Much mayhen ensues.Ballistic is directed by Kaos, a Thai filmmaker who apparently wanted his movies to live up to his name.  This is his first American feature and he shows almost no ability in crafting an action sequence.  Martial arts fights that should get the adrenaline-pumping are so stiltedly choreographed, it'll inspire either laughs or yawns.  Kaos also goes overboard on the slow motion, ensuring there's never an opportunity for the fight scenes to build momentum.  And this is the only film I can think of where the people involved in a car chase actually follow the speed limit!I feel a bit sorry for the cast here, particularly Lucy Liu, whose martial arts talents are squandered here.  To date, she hasn't been much of an actress, but she looks and convincingly acts tough so such a role here must have seemed like a good idea.  For Banderas, this is the third film where he has trouble with mysterious women.  I've heard of typecasting, but never to such a ridiculous extent.  The only thing keeping this guy's career afloat is Robert Rodriguez and that Spy Kids franchise.",

Really, the \"plot\" of this movie is just a cover so they can have some really cool explosions.And that's not a bad thing.Because explosions in movies are cool.Also,the fighting sequences and shootouts are really cool too.Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu do a fairly good job here,but the plot is beyond what their acting can save.Even though they are the 2 big name stars in the movie,the real stars of the movie are those oh so cool explosions!I'm going to give this movie a 6 out of 10,which is way more then this movie really deserves.If I was judging this for for it's plot,it would be a 1 of 10,because the script is on the level of \"Glitter\" or a Joel Schumacher Batman movie.The reason my rating is that high is simply  because I like the explosions...the explosions are cool!",

It's the sort of horribly written film chock full of non-stop action that seems to be written for folks who found the Rambo films too intellectually taxing. One stunt after another after another after--all strung together with conspiracy film clich\u00e9s--that, in a nutshell, is this film.The film starts with the jaded FBI agent (Antonio Banderas--who seems half asleep in this role) being forced to rejoin....oh never mind, you know how this crappy clich\u00e9s will go. And ultimately, he'll be force to join his old nemesis, the super-dangerous Lucy Liu (!!) to fight the powers of not-niceness that threaten to control the destiny of the Free World. And so, to do this, they punch and kick, blow up stuff and kill. This is punctuated by kidnappings, mayhem and conspiracies--none of which seem anything more than plot devices.Overall, not a lot to provide interest to anyone--even stupid people. Silly--just the sort of action film you might expect Jethro Bodine to make--if he was real and had his uncle's millions to finance this dud. I could imagine him directing this thing and shouting \"Hoo-Wee--we gots lots of double-naught spies!!\".",

The same people that gave \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" close to six stars gave this only 3.6? Ballistic was disjointed, over-edited, shallow, and cliched, but it was at least entertaining, unlike the barely-watchable \"Charlie's.\"Lucy Liu was the only bright point in \"Charlie's,\" and as such is, in my opinion, completely under-utilized in this film. While she is given a chance to look great, she has few lines and little character building. She does the best she can with what she's been given. Banderas also does a good job with his stereotype character and manages to make him a bit less of a cardboard cutout than he what he started out as. Liu is very believable as a badass. She doesn't even blink when she fires a weapon and does a decent job of fighting in the non-stuntman scenes.The blame for this movie's weak points rests mostly on the director. It seems like anything of any substance was cut in one of the \"artful\" cuts of current and past exposition that seem spliced and blended together almost at random. A good editor could probably fix some of this damage, dropping at least 5 minutes of run time, but another 10 to 15 minutes of footage would have to be added to give the story a hint of coherence. On the plus side, some of the photography was beautiful.Bottom line: good action, crappy plot, looks cool, the two main character(s) are babes (depending on your gender/orientation). This is an average action movie that I probably will watch again sometime when I want something that doesn't engage my brain but has pretty things to look at. With explosions. Lots of them.",

            "content": "Thailand-born film director Wych Kaosayananda pulls out all stops in his first English- language actioneer \"Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever,\" a fast-paced, slam-bang, high-octane, revenge-thriller that pits Hispanic heartthrob Antonio Banderas against Asian beauty Lucy Liu of \"Charlie's Angels\" fame. Kaosayananda, who made \"Fah,\" the highest moneymaking movie of all time in Thailand, has since slashed his multi-syllabic moniker to Kaos. Not only does this talented Asian action helmer live up to his alias, but also \"Ballistic\" traces the trajectory of its title with a pyrotechnical frenzy. Our clench-jawed hero, our long-haired heroine, and a multitude of disposable but dastardly SWAT-style villains brandish a formidable arsenal of firepower, ranging from auto pistols to submachine-guns to rocket launchers, and unleash inexhaustible barrages of bullets in slow-motion for more than an hour with barely a word of dialogue. Moreover, when these one-dimensional archetypes aren't shooting up everything in sight, they resort to either kicking butt martial arts style a la \"The Matrix\" or demolishing dozens of cars, buses, SUVs, and railway freight cars. Although none of this nonsense remains remotely original, \"Ballistic\" delivers more than enough gunplay to compensate for its prefabricated, cookie-cutter plot about rival assassins.Cast as a disillusioned but fashionably disheveled ex-G-Man named Jeremiah Ecks, Antonio Banderas wears a single expression throughout \"Ballistic\" as nondescript as his rain-sodden trench coat. According to the melodramatic, bullet-riddled screenplay by Alan McElroy, whose credits include \"Spawn\" and \"Rapid Fire,\" Ecks quit the Bureau after his wife died in an explosion seven years ago. Ecks nurses a drink in a dimly-lit bar with rain dripping off his trench coat when his former Agency boss Julio Martin (Miguel Sandoval of \"Mrs. Winterbourne\") drops in and informs him that his dead wife is alive. Martin refuses to divulge the details until Ecks retrieves a microscopic assassination device from bad guy Robert Gant (\"Payback's\" Gregg Henry) which can be injected into a person's bloodstream and kill them when activated. Meanwhile, Gant faces troubles of his own when Sever (Lucy Liu) abducts his young son Michael (Aidan Drummond) and spirits him off to her Batcave of sorts where she hordes more hardware than most women have shoes. As an ex-DIA agent trained as an assassin because she was an orphan, Sever bears a grudge against Gant for killing her only child. When Gant isn't dodging Ecks and Sever, he contends with his grief-stricken wife Rayne (Talisa Soto of \"License To Kill) who fears for her son's life.\"Ballistic\" doesn't pretend to be anything more than a $70-million B-movie thriller. McElroy and Koas waste no more than a minute or two on expository dialogue before they load up this ode to the NRA and open fire. The taciturn cast spends more time ducking lead and spinning drop kicks than they do acting. One interesting shot shows a wounded villain plummeting backwards off a building to smash into a car beneath him. What makes the shot so fascinating is that we get to watch him as he falls without any cuts. As Gant's second-in-command, Ray Parks shows off his considerable martial arts expertise. Previously, Parks appeared in George Lucas's \"The Phantom Menace\" as Darth Maul and as Toad in \"X-Men.\" Round for round, \"Ballistic\" contains more than enough violent action and plot reversals to keep its audiences enthralled during its lean, mean, 91 minute running time.",

            "content": "Mystery Science Theater 3000 was a show dedicated to making fun of really bad movies. If it were still around today, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever would be the perfect candidate for the cast to tear apart limb from limb. It's that bad. First off, let me just mention the director of the film. His name is Wych Kaosayananda, but he calls himself Kaos. Ooh, real cool, dude. Hey, my last name's pretty hard to pronounce too, but you don't see me walking around calling myself Pern. Anyway, back to the movie itself. What the overly complicated plot boils down to is a custody battle, but if I wanted to see that I would watch Divorce Court and be better off. Oh, and there's some inane babbling about some microscopic assasin robot that can get into your bloodstream and give you a heart attack, but considering that this multi-million dollar virus looks like Frogger armed with a syringe and an Inspector Gadget claw you can't take it too seriously. And you know you're in trouble when the scenes of people parking their cars and making cell phone calls are more exciting than the 'action' scenes (if, by more exciting I mean how dancing with an empty Pepsi can is more exciting than trying to shove it in your eye). Ya know the classic movie disclaimer, \"No animals were harmed during the making of this film\"? Well, Ballistic needs a disclaimer that says something like, \"Exactly 1,587 cars got real blowed up during the making of this film, along with a black bus and some train boxcars.\" There are literally so many explosions in this piece of junk that it seems like the director (who, remember, calls himself Kaos) thought, \"If all else fails, BLOW IT UP!\" And there are far too many moments that reminded me of The Matrix, a movie that is ten times more intestering than Ballistic. There are gun fights galore, wire-assisted kung-fu battles, and an insane amount of slow motion that pops up at the weirdest times (look, Antonio Banderas is walking in the rain...in slow motion! And they're shaking hands...in slow motion! WHY?!). Now let's get to the acting. The story got so boring at one point that I actually played the Let's See How Many Lines Lucy Liu Has Game. Turns out she has 32 LINES, none of which exceed four or five words. And she can't even pull off those measley 32 lines with any sense of credibility! Here's one of those golden lines right now:Agent Ecks: Where did you get all of this artillery? Agent Sever (Liu): ...Some women buy shoo...She's supposed to have said the word 'shoes' but since the woman mumbles all of her 32 LINES it's hard for the audience to tell...or care. Antonio Banderas doesn't come out of this looking great either. He has one facial expression, and that's Dazed. Oh sure, he tries to get all emotional like in the scene where he meets his long lost wife at the local aquarium (I kid you not), but he comes off very robotic. As for the rest of the cast...ditto.It's too bad that Sweet Home, Alabama was sold out, because if it had not been, you would be reading a totally different review, no doubt. As things stand, however...well, here are some MST3K quotes to express my thoughts on this blasted piece of crap-tastical junk:\"To be dead. To be nothing. To watch 'Ballistic' no more.\" \"Who would this film appeal to? Elderly squirrels? People without heads? Little pieces of material that fell off of plastic trays?\"And finally, I have an idea for the title of Ballistic's sequel, which, if there truly is a higher power, will never actually be made. Seeing as how the filmaker were so stylish as to spell out the letter X as the needlessly complicated Ecks, how 'bout this:Ballistic II: Ecks vs. WHY?!My score: 0/4 Do not see this movie. Ever.

But it is very rare that I can say that even the music score annoyed me. Not that it wasn't good, the music didn't even went with the film. I had the impression of listening to a very bad video clip that only had explosions in it.Dialogue 0/10 I think Lucy Lu had 3 lines in the movie. One of Banderas line was: \"Don't worry, I found you...I'll find him\" Wow, I was flabergasted. Unless you prefer...\"What do we do now\". I have nothing against one liner who doesn't love classics a la Clint Eastwood or Arnold great lines. But this...it's not one liners it's one line because they have nothing else to say.Direction: 3/10 Ok fights were fine, but aside this I could \"hear\" the director say to the actors place yourslef there and say this. There was NO direction plain and simple. All you see is a bunch of clips glued together with static caracters almost reading their 5 words line.Ho I forgot the camera, closer than this and I could have counted Antonio's nose hair. This is just too close man..up in my face.All in all really it is one of the worst (I'm in my 40's) Even if you love Banderas and or Lucy please do yourself a favor don't go spoil your image of them. Both have made a big mistake accepting to play in this \"thing\". I don't even know how they got the money to shoot that thing.",

            "content": "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever starts as Rayne Gant (Taliso Soto) arrives back home in the US after having been in Europe with her son Michael (Aidan Drummond), however her husband & his father ex-FBI turned freelance baddie Robert Gant (Gregg Henry) has secretly used his son to smuggle a small robotic device into the US in his bloodstream. Unfortunately it's a miniature electronic assassin which will kill it's target from the inside... Things get even worse when Michael is kidnapped by ex-FBI agent (ex-FBI agents grow on trees in this film) Sever (Lucy Liu) & holds him for ransom, meanwhile burned out ex-FBI agent Jeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas) is called out of retirement by agent Julio Martin (Miguel Sandoval) to find Sever, the kid & the robotic assassin. At first Ecks refuses but when Julio says his supposedly dead wife Vin is still alive & he can find her Ecks has no choice...This American German co-production was produced & directed by Wych Kaosayananda under the silly & somewhat childish name 'Kaos' so not only does it have one of the silliest & dullest titles in action film history it was directed by someone with the worst pseudonym in action film history. While many seem to think Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is the worst film in history I didn't think it was too bad, I mean what did these people expect exactly? The script by Alan McElroy moves along like an absolute rocket & clocking in at about 90 minutes it doesn't outstay it's welcome, in fact one might say it moves along too fast & while there are plenty of large explosions, fights, chases, shoot-outs & action scenes the actual story is severely lacking as are the character's & dialogue which amount to virtually zero. Ecks & Sever are each given a clich\u00e9d background where someone they love was killed & despite the 'vs.' in the title they don't actually end up fighting each other at all & in fact start working together fairly early on the film to take out Gregg Henry's dull ex-FBI villain Gant. The story just doesn't hold up & is given so little attention that Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever ends up feeling like a collection of unconnected set-pieces albeit fairly impressive ones. I didn't think it was boring that's for sure & there are enough bangs & guns in it to pass the time harmlessly enough but just don't expect anything particularly memorable or deep as this ain't it.Director Kaos (please) does alright & there are some spectacular action scenes like when Banderas flies off a motorbike & two cars crash & flip over his head or a scene when a prison bus is attacked on a busy freeway while on the other hand some of the action scenes are a little dumb like the amount of time the prison bus skids for or how Lucy Liu can just disappear after shooting up an entire shopping centre & then freeway. The explosions are big, the martial arts fights are decent, it has fast paced dance music to accompany the action scenes & there are plenty of futuristic looking weaponry which get lots of use, on a dumb action flick level Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever on the surface is as good as anything out there but it just doesn't quite come off & is strangely lifeless, it doesn't have much energy & apart from the impressive set-pieces there really isn't anything going on at all.With an astronomical sounding budget of about $70,000,000 I'd have thought the executives at Warner Bros. sh*t themselves when they saw what their 70 big ones brought, I don't think it did anything at the box-office which isn't a surprise as bad word of mouth probably killed it. It's certainly well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish about it though, it was mostly shot in Vancouver in Canada. The acting is rather flat & nobody seems that interested in it, I will mention Talisa Soto though as I've always liked her & she's looking as hot as ever in this.Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is a loud, fast paced action packed flick that could have been great if the makers had actually bothered to give it some sort of interesting story which they didn't so it isn't. I quite liked it if only for the explosions & action though & I certainly don't entertain this idea that it's 'the worst film ever' because it's far from the worst film ever.",

Well, there is one interesting and noteworthy thing to this: One particular stunt, which I'm not sure has been seen elsewhere. Apart from that... oh dear. You know those movies where you're just thinking \"how on Earth did this get made\"? Not so with this one. I know why it was done, because it's actually got a concept or two that could be amazing, if someone with talent had been handling it. No, we're looking at wasted potential, and so much of it you have to be astounded that they managed to fit it all into one 90-minute package of crap. In case you have heard a description of the music herein: Yes, it's awesome, and completely fitting for a flick of this type, however, every single piece is ruined and misused(is it too much to ask for that they at least *try* to make what happens on-screen follow the tunes?). In fact, all of the editing is pretty bad(have you ever wondered how one would go about messing up *flashbacks*, on the very basic level? Look no further). The plot has silly twists and doesn't all make sense... honestly, this whole thing is powerfully unengaging. Thus, not even the action gets the audience going, in spite of it not sucking all of the time. It is over the top once or twice, and someone needs to teach whoever put all those explosions in this thing the meaning of the saying \"less is more\". The martial arts are fairly cool, save for a couple of clumsy moves, and a general tendency to film it in what may be the lousiest way imaginable. Acting is nothing special, then again, they had nothing to work with. The DVD holds interviews(all four are brief and not that worthwhile) with Banderas, Liu, Soto and Park(best thing about this, in my opinion), trailers(...no, they're not the exact same, I swear) and something called \"B roll\", consisting of a behind-the-scenes style look at footage being shot, and it's... cut? No, that's not it... \"thrown\", that's it... together casually. I recommend this... hm... I don't know... to people I don't like, maybe. 1/10",

If only more attention was spent on the script as the detail and focus on the rain drops, then we would talking about a genre definer. Gregg Henry still can chew a scene like it was Body Double again. Ray Park proves he can butcher an accent like anybody else can but at least he puts forth an effort to stretch the limitations of the script and make something unique. Best of all is the shoot out in the Mall which can be placed amongst any popcorn flick and excel, and that scene should actually be studied and broken down to the blue print because I wouldn't have minded 2 hours of that instead of a thing called PLOT intruding itself in this movie.

The clich\u00e9 about Lucy Liu (`Charlie's Angels') is that as his talented martial-arts rival Sever, she kicks every guy's butt, including his.  Right again. The ultimate clich\u00e9 would be that they become cohorts, driven together by corrupt agents in their organizations. Of course.In addition to ignoring any logic in many of the motivations, Thai director Kaos says they used minimal green screen and no miniatures to create a noirish environment.  He failed to remember that noir depends on complex characters and motives, both in short supply here. Banderas and Lieu should cash their checks, talk little about this project, and Kaos should start a `Miami Vice' show in Thailand.  The rest of us can wait for another `Die Hard,' looking quite good next to `Ballistic.'",

Antonio Banderas actually seems to play second in this movie. The chase scenes are not completely stereotyped.

And never a hair out of place. And great looking clothes, just like Dr. Watson.And yet in scenes with the kidnapped boy, she almost seemed compassionate. At least she seemed somewhat caring. Not the monster who all the cops wanted to take down.Also worth mentioning is the overly confident billionaire bad guy from \"Scandal\". Here, Gregg Henry played a character who was merely rich, but didn't quite achieve that character you love to hate (except I only hated the man in \"Scandal\"). Later in the movie, he showed signs of what he could do.I thought Antonio Banderas was considered a quality performer, and he certainly showed his talent as Puss in Boots last night on \"Jeopardy\" (assuming that was him). Here, he seemed bored and tired.So is there anything about this worth seeing? Well, I didn't pay for it, beyond what I pay each month to get a dependable signal and the ability to record.

Agent Ecks is a widowed (he thinks) FBI agent who has gone all to hell and is gradually sliding away into his tough form of alcoholism. The FBI bring Ecks back into service to track and capture Sever, using the information that Ecks' wife is very much alive as a hook to draw him into the game. Gant charges his men to bring back his son and kill Sever, with Ecks eager to keep her alive to learn the location of his wife; as time goes on he starts to wonder if there isn't more to this than his superiors have been telling him.The people who make trailers don't get enough credit but many of them do great work to take a poor 90-minute film and produce a fantastic 90 second trailer. So it was with Ballistic etc which did enough to get me interested in a product that totally failed to deliver anything other than the very, very basic genre requirements. Those slating it are perhaps being a bit unfair because it isn't awful \u0096 if all you are looking for is things going bang then in fairness it does deliver that. However it doesn't even do this very well because it lacks any actual excitement or tension and all the \"action\" scenes are just a formulaic load of noise with lots of obvious genre touches (slow mo etc) thrown in to complete the \"I have no imagination\" delivery from Kaosayananda (who gave me more pleasure by spelling his name correctly than he did with this film).On top of this the film has bigger problems which include plotting, character development, script and so on \u0096 in a nutshell all these things have been forgotten about in the rush to deliver the pyrotechnic goods. The story is about as basic as it could have been and includes no subtlety or development, thus the alliance of the two main characters has no background and no gradual coming together. The characters are equally poor, contributing to the feel that the film has nothing of interest to say and had no intention of giving anything for my brain to do; the visuals may suggest that this film is aping The Matrix, but the material proves that it is not even in the same sport, far less ballpark. The cast can do nothing to improve the situation and they are totally dumped in a visual world by a script that doesn't care about them one jot. Banderas is simply told to do that \"steamy Latino thing\" while Liu is just stuck in a tight pair of trousers and somehow managed to sort herself out. They both move through the film doing as asked but it is not her fault that they are asked to do almost nothing of value. Henry adds nothing in a weak role, although it was nice to see former Bond girl Soto looking good. Park shows why he is a stuntman rather than an actor by delivery even the simplest lines in a clunky way, although his one fight scene is good if too brief. 24 regular Cross makes a small appearance.Overall then a poor genre film that'll probably not even do enough to please those looking for easy action thrills. The stupid plot is one problem, as is the total lack of characters, character development or indeed anything to distract or engage the brain, so generally the film is weak. Perhaps only marginally worse than some of the summer dross that tops the box-office the last few years but still not really worth a look if you can find an alternative to watch.",

There were even a few things I hadn't seen before, which is tough to do in this crowded space. The action was entertaining.Unfortunately, everything else was a waste of film. Incomprehensible story, pointless dialogue, no character development, intrusive music, who-cares scenes that fizzle into nothing. Antonio is talented but hopelessly miscast. He gave it a valiant go, but I'm sure he had words with his agent each day after filming as he saw what he'd been thrown into. The rest of the actors looked bored and confused.This is one of those movies where the scenes could have been edited in any order and it wouldn't have made the slightest difference.8 stars for the action scenes, 2 for any scene with Lucy, -4 for the fast forwardable filler scenes. 6 stars.",

Its score is zero on RT, and by gosh, I'm telling you that zero is well deserved.This is one of the most excruciating messes I have ever sat through. The plot revolves around the kidnapping of the head of the DIA (Gregg Henry) young son by a mysterious agent named Sever (Lucy Lui). Enter Ecks (Antonio Banderas), who is forcibly recruited to the FBI after learning that his wife is still alive. He must track down Sever in order to get some microscopic weapon planted in the kidnapped boy in the midst of an action sequence between the DIA, FBI and the invisible Sever. Sever cannot be stopped as a well-trained assassin who uses every weapon available to thwart the DIA agents led by Ray Park's character. The incoherent plot and action sequences are both as confusing as each other, and neither do you care for either Ecks or Sever's as characters. The plot twist that occur are predictable and riddled with holes, and of course, there is no pretensions that Gregg and Park are really the bad guys from the onset. We know Ecks will eventually team up with Sever to fight them. The actions sequences are god-awful with the exception of one shot in the entire movie. Things just end up happening in this movie with no apparent reason. After all the big explosive gun battles, and lame motorcycle chase sequences, it's no surprise that the when the rivals square off that they throw away their weapons for some badly choreographed uneventful hand-to-hand combat! It doesn't matter if it's Ecks versus Sever, or Sever versus Ray Park- those guns get ditched regardless.When the plot and action are incoherent, it's bad enough that the dialogue and obvious exposition are as well. Antonio Banderas gives one of his worst performances of his career, as he seems to slur his lines consistently. Ray Park acts badly too, and is neither scary nor menacing like he was with make-up as Darth Maul and as Toad in the Star Wars and X-Men franchises But it is Lucy Lui who takes the cake of worst performance in this entire movie, and she proves to be one of the most boring kick-ass women in recent cinema. She should have had a Razzie for worst actress, cause her performance stunk and displays that she has a long way to go without a solid supporting cast.In conclusion, this beats 'Crossroads' as the worst I've seen from 2002. And, although, many of you will wonder, \"what did you expect?\" from one of the most panned films of 2002 or from a film directed by a guy named Kaos. Let's just say, that some things are forced upon us, and like my equally frustrated mate said during an extremely long explosive action-sequence, \"God, I wish I was a part of that explosion, instead of watching this movie!\". That pretty much sums up the overall badness of 'Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever'! A big fat zero from me!No score. 0 out *****!",

The critic in me looks at this film and gets an instant headache but the teenage in me looks at this film and has the time of his life. The first twenty minutes of this film are dedicated entirely to story. But the story is just plain bad. Antonio Banderas, still struggling with English to a point where it is unable to be understood, is Ecks , a former FBI agent who is sent out on a mission to track down a high powered criminal with a stolen device that is implanted inside his child. For his participation in the mission, Ecks' boss will give him information on the where abouts of his supposedly dead wife. But there is a huge obstacle in the way. The child which carries the device has been kidnapped by Sever (Lucy Liu), an unknown war machine. The script is weak in that none of the characters are given any development there for it is almost impossible to care for any of them or the situation they are facing. But after those somewhat boring first twenty minutes of story establishment the story is almost totally thrown out the window and replaced by endless amounts of explosions and shoot-outs (my personal favourite things in action flicks). If the story wasn't so bad I may have minded this, and even though the critic in me told me I shouldn't be liking this, but since it was action I was looking for this didn't bother me one bit. Of course there is still purpose in the action. Every once in a while the script throws in an unexpected plot twist at the audience to let us know that the plot is still progressing. I have always had a spot in my heart for films like this. Films that have unbelievable bad stories and scripts, but are saved by their non-stop violence. Films like Broken Arrow and A Better Way To Die that give us a healthy dose of what mindless violence that we have been missing in action these days. Director Wych Kaosayananda, credited here as Kaos, seems like he is trying to recreate John Woo by throwing in some poetic symbolism like having opera music playing while Sever takes out a shopping mall full of soldiers while not even breaking a sweat. He also elevates everything to a \"kick-ass\" level by throwing in a bunch of techno gadgets and huge weapons. Supposedly this film is based on a video game, and although I have never heard of it before, I did notice that the plot progressed like one would expect to see during the cut-scenes of a video game. My main complaint for this film is that the title is very untrue to the actual happenings in the film. I think that name should be scrapped and changed to S**t Blows Up. Although it is a no-brainer and possesses not the least bit of logic, along with as many clich\u00e9s as it does ammunition, I had a field day with this and if you are a fan of violent action flicks that care more about high body counts than acting and story you will too.",

Having those two stars on board, a lot of money must've been wasted on this rather forgettable turkey. Hey, don't get me wrong, I love mindless action movies. But even a mindless action movie needs a lot more than just a catchy soundtrack and a bunch of dynamite to make it more entertaining than a 4-minute long Linkin Park video clip. Even a marginally decent action flick is capable of making the bad guys so nasty that in the end we don't have any choice but root for the good guys. However, Kaos is not even capable of rehashing that tried-and-true formula. His movie suffers from poor character development. I don't care if the good guys win, since the villains are so laughably two dimensional. They're just empty cardboard props ready to be used whenever necessary. Just like those villainy machine gun-toting anonymous robocops resplendent in their bombproof uniform, who miraculously keep getting back on their feet, even after being bombed at, shot at and booby-trapped.Toward the end, we are subjected to lengthy and rather pointless scene of empty freight trains being blown up to pieces. I didn't really see the purpose of this scene. However, now thinking about it, I think the reasons for that scene is just to wake up the audience for the final showdown between the good guy and the bad guy!In the end, when the arch villain asks Bandera's character Sever, 'That's it? That's what you're capable of, despite all that training?' We actually want to ask Kaos that very same question.",

Ballistic is what you will go once you see that someone went to all of the trouble to waste millions of dollars on this ritilin charged \"ACTION BLOW-OUT\". After walking out of this film, my faith in humanity in general was lowered.Here is the authentic \"Hollywood\" story: Lucy Liu is the \"enigmatic\" Sever, an agent the FBI is after that apparently also posses a glaring speech impediment. I mean this woman mumbles through all of the 32 lines she has. Ah, but let's take a look at the FBI in this film.The FBI can't catch someone that goes to a coffee shop and walks around in circles, so they bring \"Ecks\", latin flame Antonio Banderas into the game. Apparently the way to apprehend a mumbling idiot is to wait in your car, listening to the radio and reminiscing about how you screwed up your marriage. My, how proud I am sure the people living in this movie were to see their hard earned \"MAKE-BELIVE MOVIE PEOPLE TAX DOLLARS AT WORK\". And let's not forget the action. All this movie hasn't drawn from the '80's is the ROCKIN' guitar riffs, zig zag \"future\" ties, and rock hair. God, it's like the studio paid the CEO's 10 year old kid millions to write a movie. Think how rich you would be if you had a dollar for every cheap explosion, and ridiculously vapid villan that inhabited this \"movie\".As if the film's plot itself weren't a ludicrous tribute to the eighties, let's take a look at the director. This man/woman's name is \"KAOS\". Ok, I totally realize that the person's name is something longer that I can't spell, but for Christ's sake, your first clue to rip your money out of the ticket seller's hand would be that this idiot can't even spell the word \"chaos\" correctly. And how accurately does the word \"KAOS\" describe the \"cinematography\". It's like (to qoute one reviewer) the camera men took turns spinning around on the end of a baseball bat.

This way of acting suits them both excellently, and creates an attractive ambient atmosphere, energized by their martial encounters and growing mutual sympathy.The bad guys (Gregg Henry as Gant and Ray Park as his right hand Ross) do not contribute a whole lot to this movie. Gant is the sinister/smug/self-absorbed crook which Gregg also embodied as Val Resnick in Payback, and Ross' vocabulary is annoyingly redundant, particularly his constant use of the euphemism 'cancel' (one might be inclined to blame this on the script, but more subtle acting could have pulled it off by not emphasizing 'cancel' each time).Perhaps what I like most about this movie is that Lucy has a major role. In her other movies she is mostly spice to the plot, although Lucky Number Slevin does allow her personality to surface. To me, Ballistic is the best Lucy-movie. She makes a very lovely femme fatale, even agonizingly crisp in a catsuit.Do not watch this movie if you consider lack of dialog synonymous with shallow acting, or if you are just not a fan of low-key acting. If, on the other hand, you enjoy good atmosphere in a movie, Ballistic may be one of those you want to return to from time to time.I give it a low 7, and would have gone higher if the feel of the movie were not occasionally fractured by the Gant and Ross characters.",

            "content": "This film is of the variety that either gives you a headache thanks to its action scenes and thus, makes you really hate it or it's one of those that just passes by after watching it, not remembering anything remotely good about it because there wasn't anything good there in the first place. For me, it's the second option.As much as it seems people dislike this film, I didn't in fact hate it as much as I thought I would but it was still a silly, over the top action film that is trying to live off two of Hollywood's most recognisable stars (Banderas and Liu) and the action success that was The Matrix (1999) a few years earlier. Somewhere in there, deep down; there is a well shot, well lit neo-noir of a film desperately trying to get out but what we see with Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is a no-brainer action film that is so 'head-shakingly' bad, it's unreal.The first hint of what's to come is in the form of the very first action scene. This is an action film after all and was probably sold and marketed by level of its action and it fails to deliver. Agent Sever (Liu) is kitted out like either Neo or Trinity and basically defies all logic in her gun wielding abilities as she becomes a female, Asian version of John Rambo. The sequence is just insane as each gun she uses goes from (in order): small handgun to bigger assault rifle, to sniper rifle and then onto a massive double barrelled minigun of some sort \u0096 pulverising buildings and police men in silly slow motion. The director (Kaos by name chaos by filmic nature) is from Thailand and it's a common known fact that the Asian film industry does rely on its Hong Kong cop thrillers but it seems at times that he was really just trying to pull a fast one here and incorporate one of those into mainstream Hollywood.As the film continues, I could feel it dull my brain. Any essence of neo-noir or maybe a plot opening up was counteracted by insane action sequences. Agent Gant's (Henry) character is the key to the plot trying to get out as the whole kidnap, secrets, intrigue and several years of lies aimed at Ecks (Banderas) revolves around him. Gregg Henry's a good actor and he does his very best in the scenes he's involved in but the whole delivery between him and his 'wife' and the way the flashbacks of lies and murder is put across is just forced \u0096 so forced that it just blows over you as there's no real emotion.Additionally, when Ecks and Sever decide to partner up (rendering the title of the film false) I had a genuine fear that the wheels would just come off and I'm telling you: all the hubcaps but one popped out as although it didn't quite descend into the chaos I thought it would, it was still full of over the top action. Not only this but it started to do the basics wrong; the actors were suddenly void of emotion, Gant and Sever speak on the phone at about 300 yards from each other before the whole thing erupting into a fire fight, a well shot fistfight between two people climaxes with someone entering the room and throwing in a grenade at the victor \u0096 it's all random, brainless action.Although the clues are there (A film called Ballistic directed by Kaos), it's probably worth seeing just to acknowledge what a low point this is for Liu, Banderas and worst yet; this film probably ruined Gregg Henry's career. I don't think we'll be seeing Kaos make another film in America for a while.",

Sever is all of these things, and yet somehow I still got a kick out of it, albeit in the shallow end of the speedometer. I know what you're thinking.. \"wow, another turd that Nate is polishing up with multiple syllable words to make it seem like less of a piece of crap.\" Well, you're not wrong. I fully concede that this is one huge glorious, post Mexican food pile of poop, but there's something about it that pulls me in every time it shows up on SyFy or some such channel. Maybe it's the fact that it's one of those rare films that not only is shot in my hometown of Vancouver, but actually set here too. Mostly Vancity just doubles for Chicago, New York or any other Yankee metropolis, but director Kaos (yes that's his name) chose to tell the story right here in my little burg. Speaking of story, or lack thereof, it's one big shredded mess of a plot involving Ecks (Antonio Banderas) and Sever (Lucy Liu) two former federal agents out to get each other, eventually working together and then both becoming chumps in some ludicrous government conspiracy involving arch villain Gant (Gregg Henry, hammy as ever). It makes little to no sense, it's so convoluted it prompts the viewer to throw their hands up in exhausted defeat and give up hope on any cohesion, instead letting a wave of schitty early 2000's special effects and over elaborate, unwarranted stunt work to wash over them like a tidal wave of rejected video game cutscenes. And poor Vancouver, looking like a ghost town, just gets blown to smithereens by these trigger happy, matrix wardrobed, scowling lunatics. I'd probably stay off the streets too if Lucy Liu massacring hordes of VPD officers was in the forecast, or on second thought maybe not, that sounds kind of hot. I'm rambling, but any review of this film has the right to get sidetracked and ramble as much as this pile of wanton sound and fury does for the entirety of its scant runtime. It's disastrous to be sure, but does that make me pick up the remote and switch over to something else when it's on? Not really.

Upon the new release a so called sequel is released to coincide with the movie, even though people still believe the movie is based on a  gameboy advanced FPS.Sign #2: The aptly named Kaos proves that his name applies both to onscreen action and onscreen story. No one scene or plot revelation makes any sense, causing the viewer to scratch his head in befuddlement (thats a word look it up!) The story then drags the onscreen action down with due to a director who uses too many explosions, too many slow motion gunshots, and too much damn techno music. (Personal note, onscreen action should be hard and tough, not the musical that goes with it)Sign #3: Lucy Liu would seem far more interesting in a movie about her opening a jar of pickles. However hard this may seem she seems absolutely bored in this movie and it only add to the boredom of the movie. Even if she stripped naked and started cavorting in front of the cameras (Mental brain freeze occurs) it could not save what is at the core a severely dead movie that plods from plot hole to plot hole.",

The audience is only given bare bones, but to be fair, I remember being impressed with the way the action sequences were put together. They're adrenalin-inducing, and in such a giddy rush of a mood it becomes simple to overlook any logical gaps or lack of characterisation. It's easy to knock such macho enterprises.

Is it the shallow plot that tries to convince you this is a Ludlum thriller? Or is the action scenes - which include increasing amounts of TNT, bullets, bodycount, etc - yet never amount to anything other than an excuse to blow stuff up? What more is that these action scenes are stunningly bad - poorly shot, choppily edited - and that sets a new low in choreography for big budget action films. The 1996 low-budget direct to video no-nonsense action flick \"The Sweeper\" with C. Thomas Howell is infinitely better then this despite being made on a what could only be low budget. But it delivered what it promised.A strange thing is that this horrible movie reminded me of one of my personal favorites: Where Eagles Dare. That film also has lots of action, suspense and the screenplay obviously prefers that over logic, but that movie had a great plot to back it all up in addition to the overall tone of sheer escapism. It never took itself seriously and during action scenes, \"Eagles\" goes all out. None of that here and a motorbike chase scene, right before a \"plot twist\" must top off at what can be at most 30 miles per hour. Awful all across the board. 1/10Rated R for overblown violence",

BALLISTIC: ECKS VS. SEVER will most likely be forgotten by about half of its viewers by the time it comes out on video. I will buy this film when it gets cheap enough, only because I am one of the biggest film fans ever.\nThe film stars Antonio Banderas, Lucy Lui, Ray Park and some other unknown actors. The film lacks emotion in many areas. And it also has a lack for reality. (Possibly why this film is listed as sci-fi in the genre category?). Now, there are many good action sequences that are enough to make you have somewhat of a good time. But, many of the scenes where there is something not blowing up, someone getting shot, or cars crashing into one another, the film is very, very, very slow. Much of the action sequences are unbelievable anyhow. Lucy Lui's character seems to know every form of martial arts on the planet. And she also has the ability to kill about 25 cops in less than five minutes.Another thing that bothered me was how everyone seemed to have a different score to settle with someone else. By the end of the film, it turns out that Lucy Lui and Ray Park's characters (who haven't crossed paths until just now) appear to have known each other. But, what I do like about the film is how it was very up-to-date with modern technology and how it at least made a valiant effort at trying to create a memorable action thriller. While I was hoping for a film more based around Ecks and Sever trying to kill each other (the title is after all \"Ecks Vs. Sever\" but no, about half way through the film, Ecks and Sever team up to try and stop some bigger bad guy. See it for yourself and decide. I would recommened seeing it on video, because you can decide if you don't like it right away and stop watching it. BALLISTIC: ECKS VS. SEVER gets 2/5.",

Althought the title may have turned some people off, it's really just a simple, fun action movie, nothing more, nothing less. Critics look too much into it, taking the fun away from this showy action piece.The plot isn't important, all that you really need to know is that Agents Ecks (Antonio Banderas) and Sever (Lucy Liu) are sworn enemies. But when some kidnappings occur, the two realize that there's a greater enemy they must face.If you see this movie for an intricate plot filled with necessary twists, great character development, and superb acting, then you'll hate it. If you see it to see things blow up, then you'll enjoy it. And believe me, things blow up. Most of the movie is just various things blowing up and making neat explosions, but although it seems most is devoid of purpose, it's entertaining, and isn't that what movies are made for? To entertain? Exactly, and that's what Ballistic does. No real plot, no real characters, just fun.Thankfully, the necessary plot scenes weren't that long, and didn't really drag down the already short 90 minute runtime. I never thought I'd be saying this by a guy who goes by Kaos, but I thought it was directed well. It wasn't the MTV-style cuts every half-second, and he made the action scenes exciting, unlike other action movies, whose action scenes are just kind of...blah.

Maybe if they just called it \"Ballistics\" or something to that effect, I might like it better. Anyhow, I finally saw a second trailer for the film and actually thought \"Well, maybe I was wrong, this looks better than I thought.\"  So the other day I went to the theater to check it out for myself.  I can't say I was really disappointed, because I had low expectations to begin with, but it was BAD.  There were some cool things to look at occasionally, but the story was just god-awful, the story was unbelievably predictable, the acting wasn't anything worth talking about, the dialogue was less than exceptional, and the directing was far from great (what was with all the slow-motion?).  The only things that the film did have going for it was that Lucy Liu looked pretty good, Talisa Soto looked fantastic, Ray Park got ONE good fight in (although, the latter part of the fight was kind of lame), and there was a slew of big explosions.  This film is most definitely your typical mindless action film, and I really find it hard to believe that people out there are defending this film out there in IMDB's world.  There were a number of problems I had with the story line.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.  For instance, Why did Robert Gant attempt to kill Agent Ecks in the first place?  Was this explained?  Did I miss something?  Even if they didn't explain it, I can deal with that.  But why did Ecks think that Rayne Gant (or whatever her names was) was killed?  He obviously survived, why the hell didn't he notice that her body was no where to be found.  So, ok, he thought she was dead, why on earth would everyone else think she is dead?  They mentioned in the film that she even had a funeral. HELLO!!!  Why the heck would they have done that, when there was no evidence showing that she had died?  Ok, here's another minor problem, how the hell did Sever (Lucy Liu) know where Rayne Gant was going to be so that Jeremiah Ecks could find her?  How could she have known that she was going to be at that Sea World-type place?  There's no way she could have known she would be there.  Ok, well this is going to go on all day, so I'm going to stop with the plot holes.  All in all, I thought it was a terrible movie with very little redeeming value.  If you enjoy watching things get blown up or like watching cars and people get thrown all over the place, then by all means, check out this film.  But I urge you not to pay a full price theater ticket for this film. If you're going to see it, see it at matinee price, or see it as a rental.

While most preaching I find offensive, this was not-so-subtle yet easily accepted.I really like the idea of a tough FBI agent who's nearly indestructible, not because he's got superhuman powers or special technology, but simply because he's got the will to succeed.Lucy Liu did great. I really enjoyed how she portrayed a great deal of emotion without portraying any emotion ( you have to see it to understand what I'm talking about ).It was fun to see some other actors in rolls you're not used to.Ray Park is a hoot. His martial arts style is quite entertaining. I like Jet Li's style a bit better, but Park's pretty good for a white guy ( he's got a work on his voice, though, it's too weak ).Aidan Drummond did great as Vinn's son. His interaction with Lucy Liu was well done.As usual, Mr. Banderas looks great getting us butt kicked. He reminds of that clock that \"takes a licking and keeps on ticking\". There couldn't have been a bone left unbroken in his body.Maybe I'm too easily impressed, but lots of folks didn't rate this show very highly. Maybe they were expecting it to be darker than it was.

            "content": "Ballistic is infamous for still being the worst reviewed movie on Rotten Tomatoes with a listed 115 reviews and not a single one being positive. No other film on the site with more than a hundred reviews has a 0% rating.Personally, now that I know more about Franchise Pictures, I think this had to do with the studio's involvement with Battlefield Earth more than anything regarding the film's quality, cause it really isn't that bad. Not to say that Ballistic is a good film, cause it's not. For a Warner Brothers release, financing and distribution, not production, that's important, i can see why this would be a shock to the senses. The story is a walking corpse filled with contrivance and convenience and none of the cast really had any chance to pull it off in the first place. Which is not all that surprising because believe it or not, Ballistic started life off as a Dolph Lundgren vehicle from the 1980s that never got past the spec script. God knows why this is the case, but there you go.So, the story is garbage and not worth a damn, but the action is a much more complicated story, possibly. Director Kaos had the film taken away from him after his first rough cut and was re-edited under the supervision of the Goodfellas running Franchise. This would explain the obnoxious overlayed soundtrack and nonsensical video editing pretty neatly, which dirties up what is some truly impressive stunt work. Sound design when we can hear it over the techno is also solid and punchy. Ah, what else is good? The wardrobe is slick with some nice fashion on display. There is some good cinematography in here. Actually that's it really. Story's still CRAP and I think that was a problem from day one that was never rectified because I don't think a lot of people really cared.So, in conclusion, Ballistic is an average Hollywood action film butchered by wise guy producers and severely impaired by a terrible, outdated screenplay. At times, it does look good and sound good, but the overall product is a mess and what's worse, it's not even bad enough to be enjoyed that way. The film just doesn't make any sense and the espionage plot is lazily structured beyond all irony and agony. Ballistic, the producer's cut that is, is nothing good for but a background noise movie and a chintzy relic of an era of Hollywood action film-making that is now long behind us.",

Heck, in keeping with the Godzilla movies of old, maybe the winner will come back and fight some other action star in a sequel?  That would be a good idea; it would be a cash cow for whatever studio pulled it off.But, alas, another hack screenwriter gives us something any 10-year-old with an iMac could puke out, and the studio gives too much money to a first-time feature director, who drops the ball.I'm somewhat familiar with the music video work of \"Kaos,\" as he calls himself, but ya know, David Fincher couldn't make his first feature film into a classic, and neither did Kaos.  There are exactly two creative camera shots in \"Ballistic\" -- the slo-mo henchman's plummet off a building is quite stylish -- but that's not plot, character, or consistency.  At least John Woo sticks with one idea all the way through.A big raging fireball just isn't enough to hold anyone's interest.  In Act III, the movie stops for at least 15 minutes, just to blow up some train cars.  Yawn.  Where's the character?  (none) The sneakiness?  (Ecks and Sever work together?!  Cheat!) Fight choreography? (I've seen better in straight-to-video Micheal Dudikoff flicks).There is absolutely nothing here worth watching, renting or acknowledging.

Reading through other folks comments leads me to believe I'm not the only one who thought this was a stinker, but then I have a certain soft spot for really, really mindless action movies, so I had a grudging good time watching it.  I do think its unfairly tarred by the \"it has no plot\" criticism.  It does indeed have a plot, in fact, the plot basically falls apart under its own weight -- there are too many different moving parts, or balls in the air, or some other trite phrase, and it can't be sustained.  At one point in the movie we have DIA agents, Liu as a rogue ex-agent, FBI agents, and the Vancouver police all interacting in a fierce firefight, and it's hard to tell who is who. SPOILER -- another mystery to me is why Liu shoots the FBI agent Martin after she had already escaped, but purposely (apparently) misses his heart by \"a centimeter.\"  She later turns out to be a good guy (not much of a spoiler there I suppose), but if so, why the gratuitous shooting of the agent?  The plot never bothers with consistency and so all those balls in the air coming tumbling down near the end when most viewers, I suspect, just roll their eyes and figure they'll just watch the neat pyrotechnics -- and there are a lot of those, it's in the grand tradition and strange universe that one bullet can cause massive explosions and fireballs. There are standard action picture inanities -- like guns that never run out of bullets, or unreal events -- at one point Liu picks up from a fallen polic officer an M-16 that has a grenade launcher on it, I don't know about Canadian police, but here in the USA, police officers don't generally carry that kind of firepower, same thing about the heavy machine gun mounted on a tank (where do they think they are, Waco Texas -- but then that was the Feds).I get the feeling this was made more with a foreign audience in mind (or rather non-American) since it reminds of some Hong Kong or Latin American made movies I've seen, only with a vastly larger budget. Even with the ponderous plot, there's very little dialogue, maybe that's helpful with the subtitles or dubbing.  Another thing that made me uncomfortable, as an American, was all the DIA agents, presumably American soldiers, that kept getting killed.  Not really the way to win over an audience to have your heroes killing the best of America's soldiers.  With all the mayhem, and all the plot inconsistencies, and all the wooden acting (no wrinkles for Lucy with her style of expression here), it might have been better had it not taken itself so deadly seriously.  It sort of reminded me of \"Blade\" in its absolute silliness, but that movie knew it was silly and sort of winked at the audience to let them know that. None of that here with the grave tones when speaking of \"shadow governments\" and the \"orphan class\" of trained assassins, and the intrusive and overwrought soundtrack letting us know when we are supposed to be excited or the recipients of great drama.  If one likes explosions, silly conspiracy movies, or just bad action movies, this one has them all.",

However, the bits of the story that I did manage to catch, were beyond ridiculous.I can't lie though, some of the sillier story beats actually caught me off guard and made me laugh a few times, so that's something to acknowledge.Apart from that, pretty much the only other thing I enjoyed about the film was the music. It was great! Or rather, it was great during the banging techno tunes... but it was not great when they abruptly cut off said techno anthems to go back to the same bored, droning wail that repeated in just about every scene.I do find it quite amusing that Rotten Tomatoes, for example, lists this as their worst rated film of all time. I mean, it's not \"good\" by any stretch, but come on, if you're going to talk 'worst ever made', you've got to dive a bit deeper into the bad movie depths than one which for the most part, just feels like any other bland action/spy film.And ok, maybe its blandness could be why it is so despised, which is fair.

How justified the Director's last name is as he truly engineers a chaotic film in \u0091Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever', a deplorable debacle offering nothing but uncomfort and lunacy while one is confined to this poor excuse for cinema. The film's characters are lifted from an unheard video game and the plot is something no will ever hear of because there is none. The film is a poorly choreographed and poorly filmed exhibition of monotonous, action sequences. Now this critic loves a good action rush just as much as the next person, yet, when they are poorly staged and lack meaning, then it is a sin to watch all that money wasted on those explosions when it does not elicit the desired effect. The film stars Lucy Liu who apparently enjoys being typecast as an action vixen; the film also stars the abominable Antonio Banderas who each respectively portray Agent Sever and Agent Ecks. Both are rogue agents with a supposed hidden past but it is poorly brought to life and when it is, it does not mean anything to viewers because nobody cares. Why is this? Because in film school, they teach a course entitled \u0091character development'. This film lacks any development be it character, story or authenticity. The film's wafer-thin plot revolves around a young kidnapped child who within him contains a new assassinating mechanism that can from within the victim emit a fatal dose. As contrived and ridiculous as it sounds, one must have no worries, the faint idea of an iota of a plot is hinted within the first ten minutes and then is long forgotten.      Large guns and ridiculous one-liners substitute intelligence as our two characters first confront one another, and then as the film's trailer reveals, collaborate in finding and destroying the film's incomprehensible villain. Keep in mind, rampant gunplay and large explosions inhibit the city of Vancouver, Canada where the filming took place and where the film sets itself in. If I may, I have a theory concerning this decision on the film's location. Warner Bros. must have knew what a tepid film this would be and if they knew, what executive in their right mind would permit it? Yet, that is another story for another time. This film could have easily taken place in Los Angeles or New York, as the horrible plot has no real purpose for being in Canada. Yet, they decided to shoot and set the film in Vancouver. As the avid film lover knows, Vancouver is one of the cities dubbed, \u0091Hollywood North'. With this in mind, Warners must have decided it was less costly to shoot in Vancouver than in L.A. or some other Urban metropolis and decided to decimate the streets of Vancouver making Canada's beloved Mounties (the equivalent of the U.S.'s F.B.I.) look like pansies. All in the name of saving money on a film the executives knew would not make any.     In any event, realism lacks in \u0091Ballistic' as Vancouver's sheets are utterly destroyed and a cat and mouse game ensues as our two heroes battle it out all over the city resulting in a horrible climax set in some underground layer in Agent Sever resides in with an unlimited amount of resources and weaponry. The question remains: who is she, and where did she get all this money? The answer is never revealed. Ray Park (of Star Wars' Darth Maul fame) makes a supporting play in this film and his martial arts talents are wasted as he does not act and does not use his skills in front of the camera. After the buildup for this battle between Agent Sever and Park's character, the audience is treated to a knife fight lasting all but a couple of seconds \u0096 phenomenal filmmaking indeed. You have a black belt in Lucy Liu, and a proven Martial Arts Master in Ray Park, and this is what the film can come up with? The rest of the film plays like a hybrid of failed \u0091Matrix-like' nostalgia breeding with a Michael Bay wannabe ambition.  The only problem - the director does not have the vision of a Michael Bay, nor the skill of the Wachowski Brothers. From the film's very opening when the credits roll; we are catapulted into this film that sets itself up similar to those awful action films of the 1980's. \u0091The Matrix' composer Don Davis creates the film's score, but the film opens with some slow rock similar to that of those 80's movies and constantly jumps from rock to tepid techno never complimenting the film's action. The only effect it elicits is a lamentable attitude due to the film's score. Don Davis has certainly done better (look for his score in \u0091Bound') yet demotes himself and proves he needs a strong film, for a strong score. Moreover, Director Kaos works with Argentinean Cinematographer Julio Macat who has lensed comedies such as \u0091Home Alone 2' and \u0091Cats & Dogs', yet he has never photographed a full-fledged action film. And it shows. The framing of the film admonishes at being something it is not and results in a terribly awful film that displays to what extent new talent can be like. The recycling of film is one aspect; anyone can borrow ideas and turn them into their own for a film. Yet, when one lacks ingenuity and relies in borrowing ideas from other action films and fails at plagiarizing these ideas, then there must be a call to action \u0096 to never see another film by Thailand Director Kaos again. And while we are at airing our lemons, I have had enough of Antonio Banderas and his bad movies also.Giancarlo's Rating: *",

And that is what's missing in this movie. I saw this piece of garbage for free, but this was the worst movie I've seen all year.

Antonio Banderas seems far too old for this role, and is not an action hero in this movie whatsoever. The acting is mostly awful, very forced; therefore, emotional interest and character development is completely nonexistent. About the only thing good that I can say about this movie is that Lucy Liu kicks some ass in the action scenes. Unfortunately, she uses only one facial expression throughout the entire movie and has less than 30 lines of dialogue, if you can call it that. Do you remember the E*Trade commercial that ran last year where this guy sees a trailer on TV for a fake movie called \"Blow'd Up\" and then sells his stock in the production company because the movie looks so horrible?

So why bother to comment on something so amorphously pointless? Well, for one thing it's very well put together. For another, Liu and Banderas are as good as they're allowed to be by the fairly nonexistent script and this is a long way from the worst you'll see. Also Liu's character is rather unusual. She effortlessly deals with all comers, including Banderas, who's soon reduced to wandering about, telling whatever poor sap is next in the firing line: 'She's gonna kill you. Good luck.' Super-tough women are nothing new but, as in Kill Bill, The Long Kiss Goodnight, etc, they're always given some point of vulnerability. Not here. Liu's Sever comes close to being a female James Bond, an unstoppable winner. The sad truth is revealed by a brief exchange of threats with the main villain, a photo, and Banderas' closing line. They actually did mean her to be fallible and vulnerable, but it just got lost along with all the rest of the characterisation.If you like explosions, shooting, tough women and either of these stars, and have time on your hands, you could do worse than watch this.

The \"plot\" of this movie, and I do use the term very lightly, is little more than an excuse to have a series of pointless and poorly done shootouts, explosions, and chase scenes. All scenes come with a generous amount of slow motion included. A little free advice, filming a crappy scene in slow motion does not make it better, it just makes a crappy scene take longer to get off the screen and on to the next crappy scene.Normally I would attempt to explain the plot now, but I really don't feel like it, mostly because I have very little idea of what the hell was going on in the movie most of the time. What I can tell you is that a small boy is kidnapped, and his father, who isn't really his father, is trying to rescue him because he will die from an experimental nanotech weapon that has been injected into his bloodstream, by the guy who isn't really his father. Confused yet? Don't worry it gets worse. The non-father works for the DIA, never heard of it? Neither has anyone else, but apparently it is a branch of the U.S. government and they have evil, corrupt people working for them and they like to blow things up, especially in Canada, which is where most of the film takes place. Don't ask me why two U.S. government agencies are having a wild west gunfight in Canada and nobody seems to care, it just is.So the DIA gets involved in a small war with the FBI in Canada over the kidnapping of the boy by a former DIA agent whose own son was killed by the evil non-father, and....screw it this is giving me a headache now. Suffice it to say this movie really, really sucks. The acting sucks, the excuse for a plot sucks, the action and effects suck, the editing sucks (in one car chase scene the day is rainy and the streets wet one moment, and completely dry the next) there is nothing to like about this movie.

            "content": "This film could've been the Action blockbuster of the 2002 summer, but it's sloppy music video-style editing, stunts and very \"oddball\" script just ruined the idea of a successful film. Franchise Pictures should go out of business because they used the same money-making ploy on BATTLEFIELD EARTH ( don't get me talking about that film) where they had a convincing cast, a good-looking movie trailer, etc. and then the plot just has a couple of things go wrong and then the movie just gives up and goes downhill.You guys have probably already caught part of it on late-night cable, but didn't know what it was called and didn't care to after seeing such a weird movie. If this had been made in Hong Kong ( seeming how their action films always have huge plot holes, but yet no one complains about that ), then it would've had interesting characters and insane stunts, but that's just a dream. My problem was that the editing wasn't really good, there was an unnecessary sub-plot ( involving a \"believed-to-be-dead\" wife and son ) as well as too much odd humor/philosophy that you only see in these type of movies.Antonio Banderas ( who was in a similar, but way entertaining film known as \"Assassins\" ) and Lucy Liu ( \"Kill Bill\"; \"Charlie's Angels\" movies ) do good withwhat is given to them ( dialog, stunts, etc. ), but their characters will neverbe as memorable as other Asian characters like Inspector Tequila from \"Hard-Boiled.\" And Lucy Liu isn't as physically durable as other Asian stars like Michelle Yeoh and all the fight scenes could have been choreographed by Yeun-Woo Ping ( \"The Matrix\" trilogy, etc. )Plus, the director Kaos is no John Woo. He over-uses the \"slow-motion\" effect to where it gets pretty old, real quickly. Directors Ridley and Tony Scott, Michael Bay, Antoine Fuqua, Robert Rodriguez and, even George Lucas, could have done a better job making the film flow along without it feeling repetitive like a video game ( which, ironically, this film film is loosely based on a little-known GameBoy game ).Also, whenever you use techno music, try not to have it play just randomly or take awhile to finish because that is just being lazy and sloppy. Kaos has it be in the back- ground during the fight scenes ( which are the only real highlight, but yet lack any real tension ), but has it change rapidly or way too instantly to where it's just unneeded.I'm being fair and honest when I say that I wasn't expecting anything new, but entertaining for 90 minutes; I even looked at all the bad reviews and laughed to myself because the critics act like they have never seen a film like this before ( Plus, nothing is worse then \"Howard the Duck\" ) and watched it on T.V. anyway. I wasn't expecting an \"over-the-top\"Jerry Bruckheimer and/or ultra-violent film. I just expected something decent.So watch this only if you like movies that have the usual clich\u00e9s, have wooden characters/dialog and want a low-budget \"Popcorn\" film with pretty tight stunts.And why is this \"Rated R\"?? A thirteen-year old kid could handle this film 'no problem.'Also, the above 5/10 is just being generous because I think this might appeal to fans of music videos & this is far from the WORST movie out there.",

Director KAOS (oh dear) does give the action scenes some zip though (the shot bad-guy landing oh-so s-l-owly, on the car roof, is the 'money shot' for me) and there's aglimmer of some originality, with a thrown away subplot involving micro-bugs, injected into the bloodstream, to assassinate the organs!) but overall the movie looks as if, there's probably a 'interesting' 140 minute 'directors cut' somewhere.

Of course, I bought a copy (for $2.00) when the opportunity came up, hoping, in a perverse way, of getting some satisfaction and laughs out of it. I didn't. This is a continuously clich\u00e9d, CGI currency burner that will challenge your kindness and your perseverance. Its the kind of movie where the main character walks away, in slow-motion, while a car explodes in the background. Its the kind of movie where Lucy Lui uses a mounted machine gun to mow down multiple nameless S.W.A.T. teams and decimate a downtown CGI landscape in slow-motion. Expect a lot of 360 degree pans, \"the Matrix\" style bullet time shite, horrible fight choreography, and as many story clich\u00e9s as you can think of. In other words, you've seen this movie many, many times before. Trust me. It wasn't even halfway funny. I think we got 2 smallish laughs out of it, and as such, recommend that you skip. Sometimes, the \"so bad its good\" theory fails, and this is a perfect example of that. ---|--- Reviews by Flak Magnet",

Please, people, I refuse to waste my time to describe in lucid details how horribly bad this movie is.  The actors on screen did the best that they could with the garbage they were working with.  Blame the Director and the screenwriter for making a movie this bad AFTER movies like the MATRIX, FACEOFF, CHARLIE'S ANGEL'S, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, CROUCHING DRAGON, were released. Furthermore, the movie drops the ball in not utilizing the skill and talent of Ray Park.  Lucy kicks butt but Ray does nothing but sneer and talk a whole lotta mess before he (*****SPOILER*****SPOILER*****) gets his neck snapped by Lucy.  AAARGH!! Go rent Faceoff for really exciting explosions and watch Matrix or Crouching Dragon for entertaining martial arts.",

She should have been in the Matrix, this movie has some scenes on par with the Matrix. Lucy or her stunt double had some great fight scenes, and at one point Lucy dumps like 1 million rounds of ammo into the police like the Matrix elevator scene. Alas, the story was so so and Antonio Bandaras was dead weight. Who said he was a good actor? He needs to get in shape and his fight scenes were wack! Lucy Liu has a future in martial arts films.",

I found there wasn't as much slow-motion as most people said and I was really impressed by Lucy Liu (she's a great actress).  Now yes, the movie wasn't as great as it could have been but it wasn't as bad as a lot of people are saying.  Me?  I understood the plot (strangely) but I would have liked a BIT more of an understanding of the plot so I guess a bit more talking would have been better.(Spoilers ahread!)The fight with Liu and Park at the end was probably the best part of the whole movie.  But I REALLY don't think that Liu could actually beat Park but then again, it was in the script.  Anyone else notice a trend in all the movies Ray Park has been in?  His character always seems to die in the end.Sever and Ecks team up.  Okay, sure, that makes sense in it's own weird way but I'd really like to know WHY they teamed up.  They sure don't explain it totally but you know, few movies are perfect.It would have been better if the movie was just called Ecks Vs Sever instead of Ballistic: Ecks Vs Sever for Ecks Vs Sever sounds better.

            "content": "They are a ton of comments about this movie already, but so far I don't think anyone has been able to really describe what makes it so bad - or, in some cases, so good.What makes it good are superficial things which would interest you if you stop thinking and watch it in 5-minute intervals, or while doing something else, or with friends who are just out to have a good time. In fact, what I started doing during the action sequences was pretending I was watching someone play a rail shooter - the arcade-type games where you point a gun at the screen and shoot, and the action automatically moves alone as if you're on a train or other railed vehicle.Just like a good rail shooter, you have lots of explosions. This has been noticed in other comments but the fact that this is the director's debut seems to suggest to me that he has, perhaps a habit of playing rail shooters and wants to re-create the feel. He probably also watched a lot of action movies and decided to copy some of their trademark moments.Besides a lot of stuff being blown up, you get Lucy Liu and Antonio B., two of my favorite actors. They aren't bad in this movie, but this movie seems far below them. Their encounters are hampered by a contradictory plot which is so badly presented that it might have just been left out, and as characters you never really come to care about anyone because they are all just puppets hung onto the frame of this glorified rail shooter.Not that this is showing on cable, I want to watch it again with a toy gun in my hand and pretend that I'm playing it like the rail shooter it was supposed to be. That might make it fun.The sad thing about it is that it had potential. The basic plot features twists towards the end, strong main characters, compassion, and a child in danger... but the execution left me wondering what exactly the writers were thinking, and why on earth the director had based the film on explosions rather than sniping (as the title suggests) or that little thing we call a story. It just feels like less than a sum of its parts, no matter how you look at it.The two main stars have both appeared in much more enjoyable films, do yourself a favor and watch them instead.",

The trailer for this film looked good enough (cf. its fight sequences), but that is only because all of the \"good\" (or tolerable) parts of Ballistic are packed into it. (This only goes to show that you can't judge a film by its trailers.) The talents of both Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas are wasted on this would-be action film. It's full of too many explosions, too little of what might be called a storyline, and it's all edited together with scant attention to continuity.

The past of each character perfectly explains his/her attitudes and actions.  Those who comment that the actors seem disinterested in their roles, in my opinion, have missed the most crucial elements of the characters: Ecks is tired of life and goes through the motions until he discovers what happened to his wife, Sever is trained to suppress her emotion, Grant is vile and heartless power hungry worm.If you like realistic action you will like this film.  The characters get hurt when they get in crashes, they get tired when they run, their clothes catch fire when they are caught near an explosion...  The choreography is very nice and so is the timing.Can all of the negative comments come from people who expected to see something glossy and Hollywood?  Or perhaps it disappointed because it does not fit within the established formulas?

Not cool at all.First of all, this movie takes place in Canada.  Why it takes place in Canada is anyone's guess.  Probably because it's cheaper to film there. Anyway, the FBI (regardless of the fact that Canada's outside of their juristiction) is hunting down Sever (Liu) with the unwilling help of Ecks (5 o'clock shadow Antonio Banderas).  That's about all you'll remember of the story.  Sure, there's this whole love lost/found again subplot, but in a movie full of trenchcoat-clad protagonists and shotguns, love takes the backseat.  Actually, it gets stuffed in the trunk.What really bothered me the most about \"Ballistic\" was how bad everyone's aim was!  Think about it - Sever is one of the most dangerous killers on earth, but she misses almost EVERYONE she shoots at!  I mean, she doesn't get close to hitting generic swat team guys until it's hand to hand.  Even when she gets hold of a TURRET GUN, she only shoots brick wall.  Maybe the filmmakers did this in hopes of a PG-13 rating?  Who knows?  Ecks is more accurate with traps than he is with a firearm.  He was among the best of the best - if by \"best of the best\" you mean \"the accuracy of an inebriated redneck.\"Oh well.  What really bothers me about this movie was the fact that it got boring.  Yes, amidst all of the exploding cars and shots fired, I started to lose interest.  The problem here is that there's no STOP to it!  If there's no breaking up of the action, it loses its meaning.  You forget WHY these people are shooting at each other, and then you don't care.  At about half point in this movie you realize that Ecks isn't even against Sever anymore, and then it gets pointless.  It's really unfortunate.  \"Ballistic\" had so much potential - and it all got wasted.  The problem is I'm not quite sure what it was wasted ON...",

The direction of the action is quite good and some of the stunts are impressive. The last half of the film is were things fall apart with big gaps in logic and credibility. I know films like this aren't supposed to be watched for things like plot and acting but some of the twists and turns in this film are so hard to swallow a person would choke to death. Alan McElroy wrote the screenplay, lets call it that for the sake of argument, but you wouldn't know it. In the past McElroy has written such decent movies like \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Halloween 4\" but this movie plays like he made it up as he went along. The two leads, Banderas and Liu, were okay in their roles, neither one of them was required to do much other than run around avoiding explosions and bullets. Perhaps the real star of this film is the director, Kaos. Even though the movie was a flop in theatres I'm sure he got plenty of people's attention with his impressive visuals and good use of music.

This summer, we had a few misrepresentations, most prominently \"Attack of the Clones,\" in which no clones attack anyone. Ever. Similarly, with a title like \"Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever,\" we are lead to believe that these two people are on opposing sides of some kind of conflict. No, no, no. See, that would make sense, and we can't have that.What it is about certainly isn't quite as interesting. Sever has kidnapped a high ranking official's child, and former FBI agent Ecks is called back into service to find her. There's a lot of tough talk, sounding like \"We need him, he's the best,\" but it seems the only thing that gives him this title is the fact that he knows how to aim and fire a gun. All the other guys with guns in this movie sure couldn't.I got the impression that Ecks was originally named \"X\" for this movie, and halfway through someone figured out how stupid that was, and had the even dumber idea to spell the letter out. I don't know if I would have figured it out, except that a guy sees Ecks popping some pills and asks, \"Is that why they call you 'X?'\" If Ecks really had a name at the time that scene was filmed, he would have said \"People call me 'Ecks' because its my name,\" then slapped the bastard silly.Ray Park, who played Darth Maul in \"Star Wars I\" has a fairly substantial role in this movie. After his third or forth scene, I figured out why he had his voice dubbed over in Star Wars. I always wondered why stuntmen do stunts and never act, and now I know.What doesn't make sense to me is that Lucy Liu, who plays Sever, has fewer lines than Ray Park. All she does is the stunts and the fight scenes. Why is the actress doing the stunts and the stuntman doing the acting? Again, doing it the other way around would make sense, and therefore must not be done.In closing, this movie was directed by a guy who wants to be credited Kaos.

I can see why, this is defiantly a missed opportunity.The plot, what little we saw of it was actually quite a good idea (although the twist should have been set up a little better and had a slightly better reason). The plot is this, A new breed of weapon was created in the old Soviet Union that takes the form of a micro robot that can remain undetected in the body and kill on command. A shadow US agency (the DIA) steals the prototype and burns the lab erasing the research. A rogue agent (Sever) steals the prototype and the son of the DIA's headman. Then enter Ecks, a man running from responsibilities because of the death of his wife when his car was rigged to explode. He is re-activated by the FBI to hunt down the new weapon and find out what the hell is going on!That is about 90% of the entire plot development, which is a shame really.\nEcks Vs Server is a fun movie, stick the brain in neutral and let the FX and fight scenes wash over you. Well almost!!!There is defiantly some slickness in the depiction of the action scenes, the camera angles are good, the actual action is top notch but it does have a few flaws. Firstly, there is Antonio Banderas (Ecks). He does well with the hardware in the film but lacks a lot of dexterity in the hand-to-hand combat scenes, one of the biggest letdowns is the actual fight of Ecks Vs Sever. Lucy Liu is fantastic but Banderas is too rigid, a little slow and his timing sucks. It might have been deliberate as the character is a little out of shape but if this was true he shouldn't have survived most of his encounters.To my mind the film is more of a made for cable movie than a true cinema film. If the producers, directors and writes had paid a little more attention to the lines and plot (defiantly given Lucy Liu a lot more to do!). Tidied up a few fight sequences, we action junkies would have had a real treat. As it is, it falls short of its potential. One strange effect though is that it defiantly comes across as a conversion to film of a first person shooter computer game. Lots of bad guy's for the good guy's to pummel and ammo tends to appear from nowhere in a few scenes. There is no real sense of consequences of a persons actions. One proof of this is that all the good guys wear bulletproof vests and survive being shot, especially by Sever (who is supposed to be a deadly assassin). It's supposed to point to a twist to Server character later in the film but just comes off as unrealistic. Meanwhile all the other bad guy characters wear body armour and killed by body shots. Another weird effect is created by the costume design. All the attack teams in the film wear the same body armour and a ski mask, except for a few characters that talk. It was probably so they could re-use the extras without blowing continuity but it feels so much like a computer game, where only the main baddies are rendered in detail and the cannon fodder is split into classes, each individual a copy of the same model. It's almost like the famous Star Trek red shirt!If this film were a conversion from a first person shooter, computer game then it would give it a nine for a good attempt, unfortunately they would have done better putting a game together and using the film as in-game sequences.Sorry guy's F - must try harder!",

Interview with the Vampire was good and so was Philadelphia. Maybe he should stick to the supporting actor role and leave the lead to real actors who would read this script and fire their agent.Do not waste your money seeing this in theaters or renting this for home viewing.

So By the way, about Ballistic, I thought this film was well formed action film that I ever seen for a while since early 90's films. Thanks to Kaos for making his own philsophy and I agree with his philsophy for making this film. Well done explosions, action scenes, camera techinques, and the music was great. I prefer this film better than Lord of the Rings. Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever goes for an A+ grade and 100% out of 100 due to many many many negative reviews from people who kissed Lord of the Rings and Titanic asses.

I wouldn't be a bit surprised to learn that whatever Hollywood hack penned this script, had taken an old Death Wish storyline and just changed the names. I think Cobra with Sylvester Stallone would be easily interchangeable with this one as well. At any rate, if there is one thing this movie has to teach us, its that you can't win friends with salad. You need meat, potatoes, a few glasses of wine and a dessert consisting of either vanilla ice cream with strawberry glaze and bun cake, or at the very least a custard pie. Ecks Vs.

The heroine fighting a whole SWAT squad is unrealistic, Banderas cannot jump or move well in the fights, so there are lots of mistakes. And its full of commonplaces too. No matter how much money they spent on this film, it just sucks, because you can see, that Banderas isn't present in any of the dangerous scenes, so everything seems to be too sterile and mechanical due to all the cuts and editing.",

            "content": "This movie is definitely one of the worst I have ever seen. Take away the two leading actors and the flashy slow-motion-effects, and you have a regular direct-to-video-release.WARNING, spoilers ahead!The \"plot\" was laughably stupid: the bad guys are smuggling a super-secret nano-assassin inside a kid. Lucy Liu's character abducts that kid, trying to exact her revenge on the bad guys boss for killing her daughter. Banderas' character is send in to get the kid back, but realizes he's on the wrong side and joins forces with Liu - basically a plot we all have seen a hundred times before. The really terrible thing about this movie however are the details. The basic bad guys are so dumb, they'd put elementary school drop-outs to shame. They're supposed to be some kind of elite troopers, but they just charge in, not looking left or right - sure! The first time they want to apprehend Sever, they put snipers all over the place, but then they realize they can't shoot her, because she is the only one who knows where the kid is. How about shooting her in the leg, so she can't flee, or using non-lethal ammo or a stun-gun? And of course their aim is so poor, it would make stormtroopers look like olympic marksmen. Then there's the boss's right hand man. His nickname alone made me almost wet my pants laughing - Prince of Darkness (why not \"Master of Disaster\" or \"Super-tough Mega-Villain\"). He's supposed to catch Sever and find the kid, though he fails miserably on numerous occasions. In the end he gets to fight Sever hand-to-hand after they both dropped their weapons (rrrright!). The fight itself follows the basic formula for fights in bad movies: at first, the bad guys seems to have the upper hand, but after slightly hurting the good guy (in this case Sever gets a cut across the cheek, but she could just as easily have been hit in the face, so she could wipe away the blood running from her lips and look stupidly at it - a scene we all know to well), the hero starts wiping the floor with the villain. And last but not least there's the bad guys boss. He doesn't really do anything, except of course shooting innocents, stealing sweets from old ladies and putting gum on the seats in the bus, just to show he's a bad, bad guy. He even married Ecks' wife after convincing her and Ecks the other one was killed in an explosion. Naturally he gets killed in the end by the very same nano-assassin he was trying to smuggle (yawn!). There a numerous other things I hate about this movie, like Sever crashing her car but not getting hurt at all, Sever and Ecks meeting on a crane at the end of the movie (sure, let's meet in the sewers at the third bend, it's easy to reach and very inconspicuous), but I guess I made my point. However, not everything is terrible about this flick. Some of the action-sequences are shot quite nicely, but that's not enough to make this movie enjoyable.My advice is stay away from this, unlessa) you have a masochistic streakb) you are a big fan of Liu or Banderas and are happy as long as they are on the screen, no matter how bad the movie isc) you enjoy bad movies (however it is not one of those so-bad-it's-fun-to-watch-it movies)My rating: 2 out of 10 (the only saving grace of the movie was its eye-candy)",

I'm not an action snob (or any other type of movie snob for that matter), but this flick couldn't cut mustard.The premise is....Well to be honest it's a little sketchy what the premise is. They lay it out for you, but you don't really care.I don't know what pipe people have been hitting when they claim high-end action sequences are a part of this film. I can count maybe two nice, short, small sequences. Not worth $10, in my opinion.If Kaos wanted to go for some solid over-the-top action, he should have gone whole hog. Instead we're treated to underwhelming hand-to-hand combat (The high point, Liu vs. Park, should have been phenomenal..instead it was a snoozer), explosions you've seeen before (big, bright, and boring), and inexplicable logic (what was the deal with the motorcycle chase? Was that supposed to be exciting? Could Banderas not, after years and years, at least have gained a clue that his wife might not be dead?...I won't go on..).The performances are fine, not that anyone has much dialogue to work with. I heard Banderas did a lot of his own stunts for this. If so that's cool and all, though I wish it was for a more memorable movie.I didn't know this was loosely based off of a video game. That does explain the two-dimensionality present.Long story short (too late), this was an interesting idea spoiled with uneventful action and poor editing. If you do see the movie I think you'll agree that a lot of stuff hit the editing room floor that could have elucidated the plot in a more clear and interesting way.

The Fast and the Furious was probably one of the funniest movies I saw last year. But enough is enough. The plot was like someone found one of those Mad Libs books titled \"an 80's movie\", filled in an adjective here and a pronoun there, and voila. The most formulaic, cookie-cutter story I've ever seen. In the trailers they talk about this little pokemon that they inject into people that kills them when they press a big red button. They only mention the gosh darned thing in the first and the last ten minutes in the movie. Not to mention the whole GiJoe principle, where everyone is shooting and no one gets shot. And the whole slow motion action sequence this was only cool for fifteen minutes in the early nineties. This is the director's first try so I won't be too hard on him, I'll just cut off his pinky this time and hopefully he'll learn his lesson. And poor poor Ray Parks. It was comforting to see him because I took it as an assurance that someone was going to be taken to school. He didn't even resort to fisticuffs until the last scene. And as we all know Ray Park's charisma is inversely proportional to his fighting ability. Meaning that his acting ability is a great void that will ultimately destroy life, as we know it. You don't take a mini-gun slap a pink ribbon on it and call it a Care Bear, people. While sexy sexy Lucy Liu is believable as an action heroine, her presence and Tony Bandaras's what-a-manliness were not enough to carry this contrived piece of Hollywood hash.

Kaos seems to have a great deal of skill in crafting a story which is dictated by the action, and characters are developed by expression, and action rather than dialogue.  This style has a great deal of potential, unfortunately Kaos does not offer much in the was of a logic, or set of rules to define this world he has created.  Since he does not explain things explicitly through dialogue, he should be more careful to present a movie with consistancy.

This is about enough time for some good characterization, an action sequence or two, and a cool final 20 minutes with interesting twists and the good guys winning. HOWEVER, due to a crap screenwriter and an asshead director with no creativity whatsoever, these producers allowed one of the poopiest \"thrillrides\" possible, and completely wasted their mere 90 minutes on pointless crap. About 25 minutes total of this movie were good, but the other 65 were worthless. What the makers could have done, was add another 30-40 minutes to this flick, and be able to develop some real talented stuff. Lots of WELL-EXPLAINED twists, good characterization, a longer feud between Ecks and Sever, more about th e microdevice. Instead they just got bored half way and tried to quickly wrap things up. The special effects were beautiful and it is a shame that the rest sucked.The R rating restricted many eager 10-16-year-olds from seeing this movie. With slightly crap acting and a thin plotline, younger audiences would have been MUCH easier pleased, but instead MPAA decided to go out and get drunk before rating this movie, and gave it a rediculous R rating for \"Strong Violence\" Honestly, if a movie like Red Dragon is R for the same \"reason\" and the Ring is PG-13, why the hell does an innocent action film with practically 0 blood and no more action than 007, M:i, or XXX get ruined like this? Legally no teen with protective parents was allowed to see this movie, and the people that were, had a reason to hate it!Oh well I think Warner Brothers was able to recover the loss with HP2 (which sucked as well) because the SFX in Ballistic sure as hell beat the ones in Die Another Day, and so obviously they costed a pretty penny.

Lucy Liu it seemed had all of 10 lines in the entire movie and they were all very cheesy one-liners.  The VERY minor character from the tactical force team who was with Eckert in some 3 short scenes had more dialogue than Liu's did.  At first you are half interested in where each character fits into the plot, but they bluntly throw out the answers without any real \"clues\" to keep you interested prior.  In the end you don't even really care about the characters anyway because they have no depth to them.  They each have a different single motivation and all are cliche.  Put simply, the movie is just a chain of explosive and cheesy action scenes.\n-----------------SPOILERS(you won't care)--------------\nI always wanted to give this movie a chance and I had hoped that maybe there might be at least one good shootout that might be fun to watch.  I was wrong.  The first big action scene is ridiculous as Lucy Liu walks nonchalantly out into the middle of the street with 10 cops and several snipers trying to shoot her.  Somehow in the time she walks a few steps she takes out every single one of these armed men in bulletproof vests and blows up several cars while she's at it for good measure.  She escapes unscathed of course, not even one of these incompetent federal agents can hit her. And worse yet, they do this entire scene in slow motion to accentuate how stupid this scene looks.I would also like to gripe about the conclusion of the film.  The last fist fight scene between Liu and that other guy(who cares what his name is--you won't, I promise) was badly choreographed and looked too fake.  Her opponent was too much of a bodybuilder, he seemed to move like molasses leaving Liu far too many openings that she never takes.  Liu's own martial scenes were very lacking as well.  I kept thinking back to how great her ones in \"Charlie's Angels\" were and wished I had rented that movie again instead of going to see this one.The real finale fight between Sever and Gant was also as equally bad as the rest of the film.  There is no big fight scene, she just has him completely offguard and there is really nothing he can do.  So she shoots him--oh she could have killed him with the shot, but no she instead cleverly laces the bullet she used with the nano device Gant has been trying to retrieve from her.  I suppose the script writer wanted it to be ironic, but it makes for a horribly anticlimactic end.Unless you like seeing a long series of poorly done explosions and boring shootouts I wouldn't waste your time.",

The story telling is so bad that for the first half of the film it seems that there is no story at all. The film tries to be clever and unfolds the story late. But at that point it became so boring that it was hard to stay interested. The script is just bad.If someone likes a bunch of action scenes, great. But no action film works without a good story and a good rhythm to tell this story. However, even the action sequences are destroyed by awful music. Most of the time I thought: Why am I watching this? What is the purpose of this scene or this motorcycle chase? This is a film nobody has to see. A film full of action but without any thrill or excitement. There is no storytelling, no real filmmaking. It lacks the heart of a good film.PSSome people say that this is an action movie and therefore delivers what we can expect. But it is a poor action movie. As for the actors, there is no room to shine and to give the characters some depth. One could ask if it actually had a script and a plot or just a collection of action film stereotypes to run through.PPS\nAs this film becomes a regular on a German TV station (known for bringing the worst films of all time to your home) I have to write a little more about this film. More exactly: I have to ask. Who really thinks this is a good action film? The action is on the level of a German TV show called Alarm f\u00fcr Cobra 11. It is just a little better than the A-team (Action-weise, the story at the A-Team was often better). And the A-Team was from the 80s and not the 2000s.\nEven the action scenes make no sense. Every highschool film course with some action cams can make better pictures today. And there is no sense (story telling wise) in six cars stacked over each other, except they have been stackt to for an totally not logical stunt scene. This has nothing to do with action like tuple X or something. Watch the A-Team if you want so see flying cars, watch Matrix for martial arts. Don't watch this film for action.",

You say that Ballistic has \"no story, no decent action, no effects.\"  It makes me doubt that you actually watched the film.  The story was not just a backdrop for the action.  The story was engaging and it had just the right pacing. The fight choreography was well done.  Although Lucy Liu looks petite/is petite, she's convincing as an agent who knows how to fight and how to use various weaponry.  She might not be as big and intimidating as Chyna, the WWF wrestler, but the contrast of Liu's height/frame to her martial arts skills and to her handling of guns, etc. makes her character even more exciting.  Her character is a well-trained agent.  She is expected to know how to fight and to know how to use guns.  If you're watching her fight and thinking \"it's that chick from Ally McBeal,\" then you already had preconceived notions of what to expect  from the film.  Lucy Liu did some fight scenes in the Charlie's Angels film, but the action in Ballistic is on another level.  It's like The Matrix without the cyberspace motif.  (I've seen The Matrix several times, so I'm not just pulling that comparison out of a hat.)  The action scenes fit into the story, they weren't action scenes for the sake of action scenes.  There are people who would enjoy this film. Don't let negative reviews sway you from checking out a film you're interested in.  I'm pretty sure Ballistic is considered a Hollywood action film and people tend to equate Hollywood action films with overblown effects and senseless action and violence.  With that expectation, maybe Ballistic seems low-key.  I believe the film is well done, without being overdone.",

Liu had the capability of matrix agents to move faster than bullet. another great example. five men are running towards mr. Ecks while he reloads the pump-action shotgun. he then proceeds to calmly take down his opponents (professional commandos) one by one, while they keep running towards him. the conclusion im pointing towards is the following: this flick barely qualifies as an action movie, since action is slow, boring and incoherent. i think plot isn't worth critics.

I can understand Banderas getting stuck with this movie, but man, Liu should fire her agent right away, and sue them on top of it.The score was something a child could create on their $60 Casio keyboard, and the dialogue couldn't have been worse.  Two guys in a truck about to be blown up, and one guy says to other \"Take the flank\"?!?!?!  You've gotta be kidding me!!  LOL  I honestly don't know what was going on with the music...the composer was the same guy that did \"The Matrix\" as well as \"Behind Enemy Lines\".

I like to see a well-made and fast moving action piece as much as the next guy, but Ballistic was just a total bore-fest. I didn't believe it possible, but I found myself yawning massively when there were cars exploding on the screen. And hey, those martial arts scenes? Did the fighters (stunt men, mostly) have any training at all? It's one thing to imitate and plagiate HK action, but to do it this bad... it's deplorable. Kaos' direction had no style, no flare, no personal touch what-so-ever either. Ballistic is action-movie-by-the-book and a really lousy book at that. Avoid like the plague.",

First of all the acting was so fake and so forced by both of these actors (Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas) that it was funny. At one of the opening scenes, sever (Liu) kills about 30 FBI agents and at the end of the film Ecks (Banderas) tries his best to make it clear to the other characters and the audience that Sever is truly a very good person. Also, the villain in this movie acts so evil and gives the stupidest dirty looks that look so forced that it makes you wanna go to his home and beat him up. and another stupid thing that this movie had was the title. The full movie name was Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. First of all , what kind of name is Ballistic(i dont even know what the meaning of the word is) and second of all, the movie was named Ecks vs. Sever. The movie was absolutely not about Ecks vs. Sever but Ecks and Sever together trying to beat the stupid bad guy. anyway i could go on about this movie but i wont anyway dont go see this movie                        .5/4",

The search for the boy starts by his father, and also the FBI, who pull in a broke down agent called Ecks (Antonio). They cross paths and the rest is gunfire and TNT.CAST The characters were shallow, people of few words. I was listening very hard, but I did not understand a thing what Lucy said in  those few lines of hers. I like Lucy and Antonio, but please! This move made probably only to the theatres because they played in it.

And, how did the bad goodguys happen to know that she would satisfy her trinket lust at a certain shopping venue where they could have undercover agents in place to watch her every move and a gazillion snipers with high power rifles and the standing order not to shoot.  Huh!  The murdering starts when an undercover guy tries to collar the sweet lady. She apparently doesn't want to go quietly so we see multitudes of arms, legs, and heads busted as more nameless morons rush her.   Then the City SWAT team moves in and all hell breaks loose.  She kills about 50-70 city police and Federal agents with various fully auto weapons including a tank.  Then the hero of the story, Ecks, who just happens to be near by for no apparent reason, rushes in and chases her off by ineptly firing a shotgun in her direction.  She decides not to kill him and he decides not to kill her. For a moment I thought they might just get down and mate in the street. Anyway, there isn't a very strong plot.  There's just barely enough story to take you from one killing field to the next, with a few car chases thrown in.

This movie makes a feeble attempt to emulate the action flicks of the 80s by copying the same incoherent plots, big explosions, fast cars, oafishly evil villains, subservient right-hand man, and numerous masked henchmen. If I were an extra on this movie, I'd like to retain my anonymity as well. Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood, this movie does have a viewing value. If you like to laugh at the trite and contrived action, acting, and writing...this movie is for you. Some friends and I are going to get together one night with a big bag of junk food and watch this movie at home where we may obscenely snicker and point while making numerous off-hand comments, without fear of being banned from a theatre. It may be just me but I have always looked up to those two guys on the Muppets who sat up in the balcony. \"I've seen better film on teeth!

There was only ONE good shot in this movie, and if you really wanna see it, then watch the trailer so you don't have to be subjected to this abomination in its entirety:  it's one where some police swat dude or whatever gets somehow knocked off a building, and the camera follows him all the way down.  What makes it cool is that the camera is directly above him and he's falling back first, and lands on a car.  And it doesn't cut, you follow him all the way to the car.  That was interesting.

Lucy Liu speaks what seems to be less than 50 words of dialogue and gets upstaged by Ray Park (The Phantom Menace's Darth Maul who spoke next to nothing in that film but embarrasses himself by speaking like \"Steve Irwin - The Crocodile Hunter\" in this one).

The fight choreography was stale and uninteresting. And the characters were flat, and undeveloped.

Just about anything unique probably would have saved this picture.The problem, after watching the movie, really seems to stem from the utter unoriginality and inexperience of  \"Kaos\". If stupid problems like bad camera angles, badly rendered blue screen effects, and horrifying continuity error had been avoided, Ballistic would not have been nearly so bad. But these problems coupled with \"Kaos'\" (sorry, I refuse to accept \"Kaos\" as a legitimate name.You can use your edgy, rave-rat name after you have a couple of good, edgy films under your belt) utter inability to formulate original concepts, left me wishing I had stayed home and watched the linoleum curl in the kitchen.",

It was directed by an MTV video director that isn't ready to direct a feature in America yet. When you have the talent of Ray Park who is a world champion martial artist, you don't show his fight scene in close up with a ton of MTV cuts. Use wide shots to show off the actors ability and wow the audience. It probably would have been a good idea to cut out some of the needless explosions to make this fight scene a little longer and actually choreograph it with some excitement.Action movies have been done over and over. The mark of a good director is that he/she gives us something we haven't seen before. KAOS didn't do that. KAOS directs this movie as if doing color by numbers. It's one cliche after another. There was no effort put into the dialogue either. That was frustrating to have to sit through.For anybody who has been a fan of John Woo's work before he came to America, don't be surprised to see some of his sequences ripped off. HINT: Hiding the guns in the trains, like the hallway of a hotel. The origami was cheesy too. There was a reason for it in John Woos' movie, here there is really no point, especially at the end. It just made me mad that John Woo was ripped off again. All in all, save your money and wait for it on DVD if you feel you must see it.",
