            "review_title": "Wow!",
            "content": "I know that title isn't very descriptive, but all I could say for awhile after watching I Am Sam was, \"Wow!\" Although that's a positive endorsement of the film--it's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward (I usually suffer from logorrhea, which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it (verbal) flatulence instead if you like)--it turned out to be quite a problem, because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture. I believe I was served some kind of raw beef, and I have an exorbitant dry cleaning bill from the tomatoes and rotten eggs.But I won't bill director/co-writer Jessie Nelson, because it's not her fault that her film is so powerful and so stunningly constructed that it made me monosyllabic. I can only blame myself for putting off watching her work for so long.I Am Sam begins with Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) at his job. He lives in Santa Monica and works at Starbucks. We can see that he's mentally retarded. He appears slightly autistic. Because of this, he's given only menial tasks to do. Suddenly, his boss tells him that he has to go. We see Sam running through the streets, catching buses and so on to end up at a hospital. A woman is in labor and it turns out that he's the father, but she wants nothing to do with him afterward--apparently, it was something like a one night stand. She abandons him with the baby. Aided by a quartet of developmentally disabled friends and his agoraphobic neighbor, Annie Cassell (Dianne Wiest), we see Sam doing his best to raise the girl, Lucy Diamond Dawson (eventually played by Dakota Fanning)--so named because Sam is a big Beatles fan. At least until he is \"accidentally arrested\". Government officials question his ability to raise his daughter, and I Am Sam becomes the tale of Sam's legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by high profile lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer).I Am Sam will likely make you say, \"Wow!\" afterward because it is a masterpiece on every artistic and technical level.All of the major cast members give one of the best performances of their careers, and many of these actors have had a number of artistic triumphs on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Sean Penn is completely natural and believable as a developmentally disabled man. Two of the men playing his friends really were developmentally disabled, having been found at L.A. Goal, a non-profit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs, and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors. Nelson and her co-writer, Kristine Johnson, spent a lot of time at L.A. Goal doing research, as did Penn. Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. As for Fanning, I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior, much more experienced colleagues, and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7. Wiest, Richard Schiff, Laura Dern and others also turn in very complex performances that convey characters with deep, multifaceted histories, despite their relatively little screen time.Nelson approaches the film with a number of unusual artistic and technical angles that all work wonderfully. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work. Unlike similar attempts in films such as Lars Von Trier's Dogville (2003), the hand-held work never feels affected or intrusive here--it's completely \"organic\". The most common purpose of the unusual cinematography is to give the viewer almost a subjective sense of what it's like to be Sam, to experience the world in the way he does. Cinematographer Elliot Davis moves his camera in a way closely mirrored with Sean Penn's movements. There's an additional emotional symbolism. When Sam is feeling agitated, the camera-work is agitated. Likewise when Sam is confused, pensive, and so on. Davis shoots from a lot of unusual angles. All of them work.Nelson also has the editing, lighting and production design match the aesthetic of the cinematography. The editing is sometimes very choppy, but always feels \"natural\", just right for conveying Sam's experience. Sometimes there are odd incongruencies between sound and image, or between temporal sequences. The lighting, camera angles and production design often make some elements appropriately fantastical. The production design and costuming match not only Sam's world, but other characters' worlds, as well. Not one aspect of the film seems to have gone by without close examination and artistic justification.The music, which largely consists of Beatles tunes performed by other artists, fits the film perfectly. Sam and his friends are all a bit obsessed with the Beatles (and apparently, so were many L.A. Goal members when Nelson visited). The Beatles tunes exquisitely match the various moods of the film, and the lyrics often complement emotions and actions.But even above all of that, I Am Sam tells a heart-wrenching story that's something of an exciting, emotional roller-coaster. There are many humorous scenes, often centered on Sam and his buddies going about the world with a kind of Winnie the Pooh-like wisdom that seems more honest and admirable than most of the film's \"normal\" folks. Of course, there are also many scenes that will require tissues for tears. And there's just about every emotion in between the two.Finally, the film has a great message. Does parenting, or general personal worth, really hinge on intellectual ability and amassed knowledge? I don't think so. Parents who are very smart can have more than their share of flaws, as we see with Pfeiffer's character early on. Plenty of us had parents who were smart enough but couldn't help us with our geometry homework. Love may not be all you need, but it's definitely one of the major prerequisites.",

            "content": "I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since that time, nearly all his films have left me flat. In fact, I nearly didn't watch this film since he was in it. What a loss it would have been if I'd missed it! I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others. The story is sort of a clich\u00e9'd one and has been done before, though not as well. The story isn't this film's strength anyway - it's the acting. Rarely have I seen a film with this much powerful acting. Penn's performance as Sam is brilliant! He must have studied autistic/mentally challenged people to pull this performance off. I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this. Her character starts out as a hard-hearted witch and ends up being very human, thanks to her exposure to Sam. The change in her is gradual, subtle and fun to watch. Sams friends, very well played by Brad Silverman, Joseph Rosenberg, Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. Laura Dern gives a stellar performance as Randy. Dakota Fanning as Lucy very nearly steals the show. This little actress has quite a career ahead of her, I hope! This film is delicately balanced, and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue. The film has a sort of a sappy (and somewhat surprising) outcome, but by this time any other ending would have been pretty much unacceptable to most people. This movie blew me away and I gave it a 9.",

Because I have a splitting headache from being emotionally drained!IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has been the top of my list for all time favorite movies, now I AM SAM has moved in right next to it.  I'm not saying that you have to have kids to understand the true meaning behind this movie, but I must say it certainly helps.  I told my wife on the way back home from the movie that she was sooo stuck with me.  She knew what I was referring to; our 6 month old little girl and our 5 year old little girl.  I guess I'm just a good ole fashion softy.  I came home and gave my 5 year old the biggest hug of her life and the tears just started flowing.  I felt I had been impatient with her lately and just needed to let her know how much her daddy loves her.I know this isn't a true rating of a movie.  I'm not describing certain scenes that I thought were great or needed improving, I just wanted to express how it made me feel.  And though I have a pounding head right now, I feel like I'm the luckiest dad in the world!",

As always she delivers an outstanding performance and reminds us of just how excellent and beautiful an actress she is.Sean Penn is so believable that you forget that he doesn't actually have anything wrong with him...he captures every emotion perfectly and instills all of that emotion in the audience. Penn is highly under rated in the world that is movies, as he shows with this Oscar potential performance.The young actress who plays his daughter is amazingly mature in her acting, whilst always managing to capture the innocence of her youthfullness. On top of all that she is gorgeous. The combination of three excellent main actors combined with the supporting actors and the genuine theme and style of the film makes I am Sam an excellent and must see film. Truly Inspiring.",

            "content": "Sean Penn as a devoted father (Sam) who despite mental challenges, fights for the right to raise his child is convincing in a complete departure from his usual \"bad guy\" characters. Michelle Pfeiffer plays his reluctant \"pro bono\" elite lawyer, who eventually puts 110% into this case.The love between Sam and his 7 year old daughter is evident in many sweet scenes (got Kleenex?), best described by a reclusive neighbor (wonderfully played by Dianne Wiest), who overcomes her hermit-like condition long enough to testify in Sam's behalf. Even the social workers who insisted on doing everything to \"help the child\" appear to be fighting emotions over this unusual case. The \"support system\", which includes several equally challenged \"buddies\", a very supportive employer, and many other people in the community gives evidence of our changing society, fostering inclusion and tolerance. Eventually even the prospective adoptive parents of Sam's daughter can't go on fighting against this exemplary father.The girl playing Sam's daughter appears to be \"gifted\", at age 7 reading middle school material. Perhaps the \"difference\" between father & daughter's intelligence did not have to be in such an obvious extreme. The implication of a romantic involvement between Sam and his lawyer could have been avoided as well. The former is stretching it, but the latter is going too far. One can suspend her/his disbelief only so much! Since there are no \"perfect\" movies, I still consider this one pretty darn close! Highly recommended.",

He was quite convincing but somewhat funnier. With Hoffman, I never quite knew when he was supposed to be funny, but with Penn there were many funny moments that I felt okay about laughing at. And I just had to like the character.I've heard so many good things about Dakota Fanning, and now I see for myself. She's great.The actors playing Sam's friends also seemed very convincing, one in particular. I didn't catch his name, but he wore glasses and I think he must have really been mentally disabled. The others could have been but might just have been acting.MIchelle Pfeiffer was very good also, and gorgeous. And Richard Schiff was likable as the lawyer on the other side of Sam's case. In fact, I didn't see those who were against Sam as evil. They just had Lucy's best interests in mind. But I wanted Sam to win.While it is true this may have been done before, I think this movie offered unique twists and qualities other movies didn't have, and the performances were very good.",

I watched it with my 13 year old daughter and it alternately made us cry, got us angry and caused us to laugh uncontrollably.Sam is loved and respected by those who know him (Starbuck's patrons, IHOP Waitress, friends), taunted by those who have no regard for anyone different (Lucy's arrogant classmate and his equally arrogant father) and generally misunderstood by everyone else.I especially liked the irony of the lawyer, who is an emotional train wreck, yet because she's an adult intellecutally, no one questions her ability as a parent. Sam on the other hand loves his daughter and it shows.This movie is not for anyone looking for a \"fun weekend rent\".

This is a great film with a brilliant performance by Sean Penn (who broke the rules and went full retard). I wouldn't put it up there with Rain Man, but this is still a great film.

            "content": "I Am Sam is one of, if not the best, motion picture of all time.I Am Sam is about a retarded man named Sam (Sean Penn) who has a mental capacity of a 7-year old. He works as a server at Starbucks, is obsessed with The Beatles, and loves IHOP. After he accidentally has a daughter (Dakota Fanning) with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The woman leaves him, and Sam is left to care for Lucy by himself. However, when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father, child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody. He befriends a lawyer, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) with a bad marriage and a son who she thinks hates her. Together, Sam and Rita fight for Lucy's custody in a heartwrenching roller coaster of tears, laughs, and the overwhelming power of human spirit.This is all beside some of the most stunning performances I've ever seen in a film. Sean Penn is top of his game and gives an amazingly realistic performance as a disabled man without a single flaw. To this day it makes me furious he didn't win the Oscar. Dakota Fanning's premiere role is by far her greatest ever, and at only six years old opened the eyes of actresses who've been in the business for years and basically screamed into their faces \"This is how acting is done.\" And Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a phenomenal, incredibly realistic performance that will absolutely take your breath away.As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.And after watching, you won't want to ever give the DVD back to Blockbuster. If you don't at least give this movie a chance, you will truly be missing out on one of the shiniest gems of modern cinema ever.",

            "content": "I have to confess off the top that I am not and never have been a particular fan of Sean Penn. I have no specific criticism to make of him; as an actor he simply doesn't appeal to me. Because of that bias I approached this movie with low expectations. The story of a mentally handicapped man fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter sounded intriguing, but it starred Penn. But what a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be!Penn is actually very good in this role. He brings a realism to the character of Sam Dawson, and portrays him sensitively and with real emotion. In fact, I thought the only performance that was better than Penn's came not from Michelle Pfeiffer (who disappointed me a bit, actually) but rather from little Dakota Fanning as Sam's daughter Lucy. She seemed so natural in this role, and I would hope that we see more of her in the years to come. Pfeiffer, on the other hand, (as Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison) just didn't carry the role off that well, and even the courtroom scenes to me lacked the tension one would have expected from such an emotionally-laden issue.The movie weakens in the last little bit, going for the sappy (and highly unrealistic) ending - unrealistic particularly in the way Lucy's foster mother (Laura Dern) ends up handling the situation.Having said that, I still enjoyed this movie very much. It's raised my assessment of Sean Penn's acting abilities and I would recommend it to others and would watch it again.7/10",

            "content": "In an eye opening performance, Sean Penn plays mentally challenged Sam. It was the 2001 Academy Awards when I began to doubt the Oscars because Sean Penn was robbed of the Best Actor category. I really believed at the time, that Sean Penn was mentally challenged. He was way more deserving of the award than Denzel.This is one film that can tug your heart strings and have your eyes flooded with tears. It's powered by the performances of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning. Dakota has an innate ability to use her big beautiful eyes to induce crying. Michelle can steal a moment from Sean in any scene with her beautifully delivered words.The story of fighting for custody of his daughter is one for all ages and it's a tragic story to be told but can captivate any audience and especially all mothers and fathers out there. When you finish watching, you'll have red eyes from wiping away those tears. You'll also be in a mood to start watching more movies containing Sean Penn.If you've never seen a Sean Penn film before this, you'll believe that he is truly handicapped. Sean Penn's commitment to this role is accounted for six months of research on mentally challenged people. I'm not knocking Denzel Washington as an actor, as he's supremely talented. But Sean Penn has an uncanny ability to make you believe he is not playing a character of Sam, but is the character of Sam.The character of Sam, is not inspiring because he is handicapped. It's due to how loving he is and how much fighting he does to get his daughter back and make her happy that makes Sam inspiring. Kids can watch this movie, and parents will enjoy it most of all. It's not a movie that should be missed by anyone. There's no reason to dislike, I Am Sam.",

            "content": "Having taken in a homeless woman and sleeping with her, mentally-retarded Sam finds himself a father to a baby girl. He continues his menial job at Starbucks and, with the help of neighbour Annie manages to raise an intelligent little girl in Lucy. However leading up to her seventh birthday Sam gets in trouble with the police over a simple mistake and his situation is brought to the attention of the authorities who remove Lucy from his care. Sam manages to get pro-bono support from the efficient and rushed Rita Harrison and starts a challenging process to try and get Lucy back.It is good that Hollywood is able to put issues and ideas up on the screen like this but it is the way that it delivers these things that generally kills them. In this case it starts badly with us looking at Sam working away in a coffee shop and then coping with his new baby \u0096 it doesn't really look into this very much but just asks us to accept everything at face value. Then it gets to the court case and the unlikely twists that see Sam taken on by Rita and then sweetly stuttering and stumbling through the emotional turmoil as he tries to just reconnect to the thing he loves. It could have been an interesting look at the situation but instead it is too sickly simplistic and doesn't get to the heart of the characters \u0096 instead keeping things very superficial and slick. This is seen in everything from the writing right down to the choice of music (which is annoyingly sentimental itself). It works on this level though but it is disappointing to see such a high profile film seemingly aim for the quality of a daytime TV movie (which is where this will gradually move now that it has had its peak slot premiere).The cast are OK but the material isn't there for them. Penn deserves credit for taking it on and doing it so convincingly and he does it well but it is hard to get past the fact that he is \"doing\" mentally retarded rather than playing a character. In other films you would see his role as the simplistic one but here that is left to Pfeiffer to deliver and she fluffs it terribly. Her character is awful and there is little she can do with it other than be flustered, be emotional or be professional \u0096 whatever the scene requires. Fanning is as good as ever; a bit precocious of course but generally more able than many cute kids. Wiest has little to do, while Dern has a thankless task as the stupid plot device required to produce the ending. Support from Schiff is good (aside from the film giving his character very little sympathy) and there are a few other familiar faces in there too.Overall though this is nothing more than a starry daytime TV movie. The debate that it could've sparked never comes out and instead it is simplistic, sentimental and unconvincing. For some this level of \"ahh\" might suffice but it ignores the complexity of the situation and the fact that it is not as simple as the story here suggests is just rather patronising.",

            "content": "I Am Sam is one of those films that you will love for so many reasons and find infuriating at the same time. It is by far one of the best examples of acting talent across the board and evokes such levels of emotion that one is drawn deeply into the story. But, it makes a statement so one-sided and irresponsible that you cannot help but feel like you have just eaten a huge meal of empty calories by the time it is done.The basic premise behind the film is that love is all that one needs in order to raise a child. It does so by showing Sean Penn's character -- a mentally handicapped man -- trying to raise his daughter on his own and having various officials coming down on him to \"take his daughter away from him\". It is a sad reality that is faced by some mentally handicapped parents, and one can't help but feel sorry for the situation.Personally, I have a hard time accepting a film that ignores the reality of severely mentally handicapped caregivers. While they are indeed fully capable of giving as much love as anyone else, it is an unfortunate truth that some lack the mental facilities to properly raise children. I personally knew a mentally disabled person whose mental age was beyond that demonstrated by the character of Sam, and she had a difficult time raising a cat without injuring it regularly. Though she was repeatedly told by her veterinarian what she needed to do, she simply could not keep up to the ever changing demands of raising a living creature.To put it in perspective, imagine Sean Penn replaced by Haley Joel Osment (at his age in the Sixth Sense) and having him take care of Dakota Fanning's character. In fact, that is still an over-exaggeration because Haley's mental age would still have been more than that of the character of Sam. Because we see Sean Penn physically as an adult, we don't question his abilities and we are more likely to feel sorry for him. But one has to look at the mental facilities and give it a likely comparison. We would never leave a 6 year old girl in the care of an 8 year old boy. In the same way, we can't automatically give the care of a 6 year old girl to a physically mature man with the mental facilities of a 8 year old.While there cannot be a perfect parallel between all situations, certainly there must be some semblance of logic applied instead of just presenting heart-tugging sentiment such as what this film prefers to present. I find it irresponsible of the filmmakers to simply ignore the reality of the situation in order for it to hit home emotionally alone.The film could have been equally effective had they simply acknowledged the fact that Sam really did not have the ability to take care of his daughter on his own and explored the emotional consequences of the situation he finds himself. It is tragic, but it is a fact that must be dealt with. And for the creators of this film to suggest the only gauge to deal with this situation is to ask how sorry you feel for the main character is condescending at best.Beneath the emotional surface and the performances, this film is intellectually empty. A movie for the heart, not for the mind.",

I will not elucidate too much on the plot points, but the realism in this film is about as good as it gets. I understand that there are a sporadic few mentally challenged people who are able to conceive, let alone have to go through the complicated initiative to raising a child single-handedly. But then again, there are many non-handicapped people who are not adept to raising offspring. But in this day and age of unpredictability, the situation depicted where the dominating factor gets the call to determine what's best for the welfare of the child who is unfortunately caught in the middle.Sean Penn who has played a cornucopia of performances over the the last 30 plus years plays the role of the titular character Sam Dawson, a loving caring, father and Beatles aficionado, is raising his seven year old daughter Lucy Diamond (Dakota Fanning). Penn played his role splendidly, almost up there with other mentally challenged characters like Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman), Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) and Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson). Many performers though have attempted to play mentally disabled individuals, but often times failed. Pen succeeds in keeping our interest through and he shows that even the most underfed minds are still humans and that nurturing a child is not rocket science all you need is loving heart and the will to step up deserves some kind of credibility (think of all those deadbeat dads who abandon their kids and tell me who's incapable of rearing kids).Lovely Rita Harrison Williams (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a big-shot Civil Dispute Lawyer is not up to par with the roles she's played in the past, but still succeeds to make this movie all the more special. She's very important in providing the message that not all the money in the world, all the riches of our universe and all the fame that comes with it can never usurp the love of a child. The message is pretty obvious and it is something we can all take into deep thought.If there is one thing that really irks me about this movie was the very grim portrayal of the Social Service Department as an unmerciful group of corporate shrills who care nothing more then to take advantage to the easily vulnerable and to deprive him of the one person in this world he truly cares about and maybe the only person who cares about him. I get frustrated every time I see their smug faces, but I guess every story needs an antagonist/s. I guess we've all had those snooping neighbours who calling Social Services for reasons justified or unjustified. And yes Social Services will always be scorned for getting involved in affairs that is not of their concern. And have built a solid reputation of breaking up families either for better or for worst, either way it is 90% of the time negative.This is truly a very excellent and deserves special attention one must reconsider. The theme of \"I Am Sam\" will have you in laughter and tears, but will tug at your heartstrings the whole way through. With legions of fan support of Sam's other mentally blocked friends and an agoraphobic neighbour played by Dianne West, it illustrates that it's better to be loved by simple-mind rather than not being loved at all.",

First of all, Sean Penn's performance is awesome! He really look a mentally challenged person in all his acts and ways to move and talk! Michelle Pfeiffer also has a great performance and is very beautiful in this movie as Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison.Sam Dawson is a mentally retarded man, who has the same capacity of a 7 year-old child..He works at a Starbucks, loves the Beatles( his favorite band) and one day has a normal daughter with a homeless woman, who abandons him and her daughter when she has the chance. Sam takes care of his daughter, who he gives the name Lucy Diamond, with the help of his friends, specially Annie.( a piano teacher who is his neighbour) But time is passing, and when Lucy reaches 7 years old she understands her father is not *normal* and intentionally tries not to be smarter than him,what makes her have problems in school. The Social service takes her away to another family, and Sam needs the help of a lawyer to win the case. That's where Rita Harrison enters, and she will not only help Sam, but learn great values with him.aka \"Uma Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Amor\" - Brazil",

Penn's performance is occasionally agonizing, but he is also extremely sensitive, intentionally funny and sad; Dakota Fanning is likably wise-beyond-her-years as his little girl. All the performances are commendable, but the script is a tangled mass of ideas that either don't work or don't build momentum (the hooker episode is just a pretense to get us into court, and it's execrably staged). The arty presentation (with herky-jerky cinematography and colors that are either cartoon bright or steely blue) is another liability, but the finale is moving and Penn's energy nearly makes it all worthwhile. **1/2 from ****",

            "content": "And that's why we loved \"The Beatles\" because their songs were invitation to a better world, one different from our reality. But Jessie Nelson's \"I Am Sam\" approach the Beatles like a real Gospel of life.This well-meaning drama is about the group's number-one fan: Sam, a Starbucks Coffee employee with the mind of a 7-year old child fighting for the custody of his daughter of the same age, needless to say that we're supposed to root for him. His lawyer played by a Michelle Pfeiffer, starts like your typical shallow, self-centered, publicity-seeking executive women who, learns in the process one thing or two about love. Love, that's the film's motto, the whole purpose of the film is to prove that one's ability to love is enough to raise a child.I'm sorry but as a parent of a four-year old little girl, it's not true. The film mixes up two elements in a way that insults intelligence: loving and raising. One is a matter of the heart, it's something of universal value that transcends the barriers, but rising is a practical thing, requiring a decent amount of both mental and physical ability. It is such a painstaking occupation you can't deal with it alone, whether you're Sam, a blind woman or even two parents. But this movie wants to make us believe that love is the one and only requirement. The premise is fallacious from the start.Critics pointed out that the film makes an effort to show a father capable of taking of her child despite his handicap. Actually, the film can't even afford to be manipulative, as it contradicts the very points it tries to make, some situations were so embarrassing that I started to question very early whether this film was serious or a joke? Starting with the birth, Lucy's mother doesn't even have a glimpse on her child and she leaves the hospital as if she had just thrown a used Kleenex on a trashcan. And Sam leaves the hospital with the baby in his arms!!!People leave a hospital with a baby in a Moses' basket or in the mother's arms if they're going to a car or a cab. That sight of Sam with little Lucy in his arms, in the middle of a subway, exposing her to all the germs of the world and with no one being ever worried about it, it could look like a kidnapping after all, killed all the film's credibility. If the point was to show a capable father, well it's a fail. Later, he can't understand why his daughter is crying and needs the help of Annie, the benevolent next-door neighbor, to tell him that she needs to eat every two hours.Didn't he know? Didn't he prepare her birth? Didn't he train from diaper-changing? Does this guy have any family? How much time did pass before Annie came? Before you ask too many questions, the film makes a convenient ellipse with the Beatles' music in the background (the musical leitmotif) Lucy grew up and turns out to be a bright little girl, played very well by Dakota Fanning. From this chronological leap, we've got to assume that nothing went wrong until she started to outsmart Sam, and refuses to learn anything to stay on his level.You can tell the writers needed to make this as pivotal as possible; he's also arrested in a weird scene involving a prostitute, which raises a social worker's attention. Loretta Devine plays the 'bad guy' part while we're supposed to feel in comfort when Sam goes buy shoes to his little girl, with his friends also suffering from mental handicap, some played by actors. Not every girl has a mother but I know shopping and buying clothes is a girl or a woman thing. I refuse to believe that Sam doesn't know any woman who could go have a woman-to-woman moment with Lucy. Seeing little girl surrounded by a bunch of grown-up adults talking weird isn't heart-warming, it is downright creepy.Or at least, that's what the directing applies, what's with all the weird camera short and hand-held filming (with some weird zooms), you can tell some parts want to make you 'aaw' well it's either embarrassing to watch or unintentionally funny. The performance of Sean Penn has been deemed as 'full retard' by \"Tropic Thunder\" and you can tell it's the kind of one-note approach that doesn't work in movies, especially since he's not always in the same level of smartness, he's capable of detecting hidden messages beneath the Beatles songs, but sometimes, he can't even handle a client in his Starbucks shop. His level of mental retard fluctuates according to the requirements of the plot.The whole experience of \"I Am Sam\" feels like someone tried to make a film in the same vein than \"Philadelphia\" with the subplot involving the lawyer. But even Michelle Pfeiffer can't save this and I thought she was too miscast, she's just too 'beautiful\" for that face; they made an effort to make her so appealing to the camera it was distracting. As for the message, well, we're supposed to believe that Sam is capable, because of the Power of Love.I'm sorry but I agreed with the prosecutor and in the one scene where he asked Annie a valid question about Sam's capability to raise Lucy when she'll reach puberty. Annie eludes the answer and asks him if he would (as if the issue was gender) and instead of asking the question again, the prosecutor turns into a sort of villain who asks a sensitive question about Annie's personal background. She cries, she becomes the victim, and the question is left unanswered.That's the film in a nutshell, too many good sentiments preventing the good questions to find answers while they're too obvious not to be seen.",

            "review_title": "More and Less Folding",
            "content": "Spoilers herein.This is a very well engineered project, a real lesson in the conceptual end of filmmaking. There are three legs to the strategy: the engineered approach to the acting; the camera stance; and the abstraction of the Beatles.First the acting. Sean Penn does the richest character work of anyone on film. Usually when a mentally diminished character is portrayed, the actor starts with themselves, then takes away, then dramatizes. The rather crude work of Dustin Hoffman in `Rainman' is of that type. (The same approach as `Tootsie.') Juliette Lewis' `The Other Sister,' is much more interesting because she tries to reduce to the real. But she still starts from herself. The bones of Scientology and theater glitz show through.Penn is far more intelligent, nearly always working on several stances at once. Instead of starting with himself, he creates the character that Sam would be if he weren't mentally limited. Then he takes away from that. That means playing a character behind the character. But what he does is add the dimension needed to dramatize the elements. The trick is to do this is a way that doesn't show. So he manages all three in three different ways.What's novel is the pairing with Michelle. She is remarkably one-dimensional. So there is a reversal of the characters: next to Penn, Pfeiffer seems retarded. The rest of the cast is between the two in talent, and that placement of the casting must have been deliberate.\nThe management of the camera enhances the effect. It is almost exclusively handheld. Instead of back and forth cuts, we have pans. Engages us more intimately, between two of Penn's layers.But the most clever element is the use of the Beatles in the story. The main thread of the story is ordinary, but the backthread is not. The Beatles defined a reality, which constitutes the world of Weist's character. Adopting this world brings a whole prefabricated fantasy to the story. Sam uses this as a template to explain the world to himself and us. As with the contrast between Penn and Pfeiffer, so too the contrast between the Beatle's originals and the versions we get here which are simplified, watered down, soulless.Its abstractions are all so well folded and integrated that it has multidimensional body. The whole project can only have started with Penn. Note the deft touch that has him making elaborate origami throughout.Just on the side: Mary Steenbergen has the most appealing controlled face in the business, and one of the few older women film whose sex appeal has increasedThe only thing that is a miss here is the title, and the reference to reading. The shift from `normal' to `impaired' intelligence is implicitly equated to the relationship of the real world to Dr. Suess's world. That's not fair, even offensive.",

            "content": "I did cry during this film. There, I got it out there in the open so that it wouldn't hold me back as I talked about how great of a cinematic journey I Am Sam was. I remember when this film was released and how disgusted I was to hear that Sean Penn was taking the role of a mentally challenged individual because I am under the utter beliefs that if you want realism in your film, just hire someone who faces it daily. I didn't see the point of getting Sean Penn to over dramatize it. I am here to say that I was wrong. For once, I think Sean Penn was the perfect choice for this film. Yet, it wasn't just Penn that made this film worth more than one viewing. I believe that director Jessie Nelson realized that she had a clich\u00e9 Hollywood story on her hands, in fact just another retelling of Kramer vs. Kramer (which is referenced throughout the film), and needed to do something to set it apart from the rest. Her answer, Beatles songs, imaginative cinematography, and gathering the best of the best to tackle her main characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer seemed to be an odd fit, the rest fell into place beautifully. Let me say this now, Dakota Fanning will win Oscars (more than one) during her film career. Needless to say, this was a much better film that initially represented. I Am Sam is one of those movies that we assume will be just like every other Hollywood outing, but until you open the box, put the DVD into your player, and experience the music, the visuals, as well as the phenomenal acting; you will never quite understand why I Am Sam carried above the Hollywood standard.On the apparent level, I Am Sam works because of Sean Penn. As I watch more and more of this actor's body of work, I cannot help but be continually impressed. Penn brings more to the screen than any other actor could imagine. His presence, in my eyes, dwarfs Hanks and Cruise phenomenon. Penn is constantly surprising us with challenging roles that fluctuate between light and dark. He is not focused on one genre, but always impressing with his ability to move between films. One will never quite know what he has in his back pocket until we see him on screen. He is that impressive. I believe that it was also the aid of Dakota Fanning which gave Penn the strength to be the character that he was. For her first feature film, Fanning came out with the prose and professionalism that has nearly gone missing in Hollywood. She stood up, worked with Penn like they had been companions for a lifetime, and succeeded in giving us the emotion this film desperately deserved. She was an element of I Am Sam that was needed to bring a human element to Sam, and she did it with the greatest of ease. I can say the same about everyone else in the film to those that played Sam's friends, to Diane Wiest, to even Laura Dern. They all created an ensemble cast that brought emotion, humility, and sincerity to this film. Alas, I just can't say the same for Michelle Pfeiffer. I thought her role in this film was too dramatic; she seemed to be the only one that fit within the clich\u00e9 walls, and just seemed to be a bit miscast. There was a level of annoyance with her as well. The lawyer that leans more about herself through her client was just too much for me. I think if she just played herself being a lawyer, than it would have worked better. She tried to hard to counter Penn's brilliance, and it didn't work. Fanning did it exceptionally well, but Pfeiffer seemed too familiar. I know we could have expected more from her, the sad thing is, we didn't get it in this film.There are two other elements of I Am Sam that nearly knocked me off the couch because I wasn't expecting them. The first was the cinematography which added a very artistic element to this film. The cut scenes added a new level of humanity to everyone involved, while the choice of colors for different moments really added to the raw emotion of the film. This wasn't your typical film where it was the stagnate colors and straight-forward camera work, this was a movie that took unfamiliar leaps with the camera, choosing to use darkened colors for the courtroom scenes, and lightened colors for the moments between Penn and Fanning. This is much different than your typical courtroom film. I thought this idea worked brilliantly to bring a defined tone to the film. Coupled with the fabulous and detailed Beatles' music that was used with superb accuracy, I Am Sam transformed into more than what I was ready for. I read that Penn was influential in getting the Beatles' music for the film, and the choice to use one band to compliment the film was yet another tool not used often in cinema. Again, I Am Sam took risks, and it is those risks (like the music and cinematography) that took this a-typical film into a whole new galaxy.Overall, I thought this was a surprising film. I was not expecting the level of superiority that I witnessed when I watched this movie. I was expecting your typical courtroom drama with Sean Penn befouling a character that he had no right to play. I am nearly certain his portrayal here should have won him the Oscar over Denzel. The only negative I have is Pfeiffer, but she can be easily overshadowed by Fanning and Penn if you get too deeply into this film. I highly suggest this film to anyone as a more than once viewing. I think you will be just as surprised/shocked as I was!! Grade: ***** out of *****",

            "content": "\"I Am Sam\" has its flaws.  This is not a perfect film.  This is not a masterpiece.  Then why am I ranking it so highly?  Because of the way it made me feel.  It took me on an emotional rollercoaster and allowed me to ponder a lot of questions I've taken for granted in the past.  This movie proves the saying, \"People will always forget what you say, but they'll never forget the way you make them feel.\"  This movie has its flaws and I'll get to them later, but I can only name them because the movie is still fresh in my mind.  I'll probably forget them later.  But what I will never forget is the way this movie made me feel.  I'm not a law expert, so I wouldn't know if a mentally challenged man like Sam Dawson would legally be able to take custody of his daughter.  But the law is not the issue.  The issue is, Does Sam DESERVE to take custody of Lucy?  And I watched those touching scenes between Sam and Lucy, I couldn't help but feel, \"Yes!\"  In the courtroom scene where Sam cries out the line, \"Why isn't Lucy coming home with me?\" I couldn't provoke myself from bursting into tears. \nSean Penn is an incredible actor, with great standards.  I look forward to any movie where he's the star.  Penn's the kind of actor who actually waits for a good script to come along, and will turn down a bad script even if the director offered him 20 million dollars.  The thing that intrigues me about Sean Penn is that he's not an opportunist actor.  When he's in a scene with another actor, he doesn't wait until his line comes up to deliver true emotion.  He's a character actor in the truest sense, and he immerses into this character, not missing a single beat.  If Russell Crowe didn't amaze me with his performance, I would've said that Penn deserved the Oscar.  All I have to say is both of those actors deserved the Oscar over Denzel Washington.  One great approach that Jessie Nelson (the director) took was hiring actors who actually have mental illness.  It seemed to have improved the dynamic between Sam and his friends.  And the actors, despite being handicapped, are naturals.  They're reminiscent of Chris Burke in \"Life Goes On.\"  Now, onto the flaws.  First of all, that scene where Sam almost goes to jail because he accidentally made conversation with a hooker (who turned out to be a cop posing as a hooker) was pretty far-fetched.  Come on, the guy's obviously mentally ill, so why would the cop want to try and bust him?  And even if he weren't mentally ill, how can you bust someone just for talking to a hooker, who doesn't even give him a clue that she's a hooker.  This was just a cheap plot device to have him get into some trouble with the law, which will eventually result in the inevitable court battle.  Another cheap plot device was Michelle Pfieffer taking Sam's case just because her fellow attorney's at a party were a little tipsy and stated that she would never take a pro-bono case (being that everyone thinks she's greedy and egotistical, and she pretty much is).  Lucy's dialogue seems a little too witty for a child of her age.  There are some people my age who don't even talk like her character.  But I do have to give Dakota Fanning tons of credit for natural delivery of her lines and making her character quite convincing.  As I said before, usually when child actors deliver smart, witty lines it looks incredibly forced, like they're reading off cue cards. But Dakota's a natural and I predict she'll grow up to become a fine actress.  The movie goes on pretty long at 2 hours and 10 minutes, but not overlong. I don't believe any director should delete scenes that build character just to make the film snappy and perhaps make the audience feel better.  There are lot of great character-building scenes that involve the relationships between Sam and his daughter, Sam and his new lawyer friend and Sam and his three loyal best friends.  And because we get to know these characters so intimately that we develop a deep sympathy for them.  Go ahead and complain about \"I Am Sam\" being a sentimental tearjerker.  It's a sentimental tearjerker with a great heart.  And even the most macho of guys will probably have tears rolling down their cheeks while watching this movie.  I've seen quite a few well-made films with great performances that have nothing else to show for themselves other than...they're well-made!  I can't find any flaws in their structures, but I got nothing out of these films.  One example is \"Wonder Boys\"--very well-made film; had virtually no impact on me.  \"I Am Sam\" has  imperfections in its structure, but it had a huge impact on me and it's a film I will never forget!  So like the character of Sam Dawson proves in the film--being perfect isn't everything. \nMy score:  9 (out of 10)",

            "content": "--This review contains no significant spoilers. For the safety of not getting blacklisted, the 'contains spoiler' option is highlighted.--It really is true, Penn, the never aging Michelle Pfeiffer and even child-women Dakota Fanning and all of the support cast perform adequately in a cinematography-wise well polished yet story-wise highly emotionally manipulative skunk of a movie.And you know it's going to be manipulative from the get go when you understand the premise. Penn plays Sam, a retarded man with the mental capacity of a 7 year old, who somehow manages to impregnate a homeless women who in turn gives birth to Lucy, played by Fanning. He raises her for 7 years until she mentally outgrows him at which point social services steps in.This, if one didn't get it yet, is a completely fictional scenario which could not have been happening in the real world. Unfortunately, the movie is not a fairy tale, it deals with the premise so seriously as to cover a complete legal trial taking place over several weeks if not months, trying to establish something which shouldn't have to be established in the first place. Sam cannot take proper care for his daughter by himself and it doesn't even take the mental capacity of a 7 year old to understand this.When you watch the first 5 minutes of this film, you know exactly where it is going given this premise and there will be little surprises on the path ahead, it is done completely and utterly by the numbers. It's almost like it wasn't even written by a human being but by story writing software copying the successful gimmicks of the past.This really is a shame given the movie's strengths in a large number of areas including a decent screenplay (considering the story arc) written by Kristine Johnson and Jessie Nelson.But ultimately, most movies will be judged on their weakest link(s) if those weaknesses don't warrant some kind of leniency due to things like budget constraints. The weakest link is in the story itself and the manipulative way it is shamelessly presented.This movie scores a 7.4 on this website which means I'm in minority opinion. But if you are a person who hates being emotionally manipulated watching a film, and let me assure you that you will be every 5 minutes or so, I can't imagine you'll disagree with this review all that much.4/10",

            "content": "This movie has flaws, but this movie touched me.  Maybe its because I'm a father of a six year-old girl, but I was moved by the love between father and daughter, Sam and Lucy.  Sean Penn plays Sam, a mentally challenged man that instantly becomes a single parent, when the mother immediately abandons them when they leave the hospital.  He some how raises her with help from a neighbor, played by Diane Wiest.  On her eighth birthday, child protective services take her away from Sam.  It has become apparent that Lucy surpassed her father in intelligence, and she is struggling to cope with classmates and friends making fun of Sam.  Can Sam adequately care for Lucy?  The whole time I was watching, the answer was, no.  This is where the movie fails. It did not convince me that this mentally challenged man that could not even eat at a Kip's Big Boy without freaking out because they did not have French pancakes, could raise this child by himself.I am sure that Sean Penn's will get some accolades for his performance. However, I felt that I had seen it before, and I had seen it done better. He was adequate in the role, but Leonardo DiCaprio did it better in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape', and I even think that Mickey Rooney did it better in `Bill'.  Penn's downfall could have been the character's lack of dept. Maybe if we had seen his childhood, his relationship with his mother, or the relationship with Lucy's mother, it would have created a more believable role.  He does do well to show his love for Lucy.  The chemistry between Lucy and Sam is touching.  You had better take some tissue.The newcomer, Dakota Fanning, as Lucy, was wonderful.  Lucy is cute and loveable.  She is the only thing right in Sam's life.  She is hope.  She is beautiful.  She is everything to Sam.  When she is taken away, your heart will break.Michelle Pfeiffer, as Rita the lawyer, was a pleasant surprise.  Rita is so vain that she takes Sam's case just to save face in front of her colleagues. She is too busy, even for her own family.  All she cares about is winning. She is heartless.  However, she blossoms during the movie.  Sam opens her eyes.  She is like the butterfly that Lucy does a report on in school. She is the true hero of the movie.The music in the movie was great.  If you are a fan of the Beatles, which most everyone is (even if you may not realize it), you will appreciate this movie.  The Beatles' songs convey a feeling of safety and comfort.  The songs are familiar and soothing.  In Sam's chaotic world, the Beatles come through with a calming effect.  One of my all time favorite songs, Across the Universe, is used as well.Overall, I think this movie comes through with heartfelt messages. However, you will have to suspend belief and let yourself go with it.  Laura Dern also pops up with an excellent performance.  The final scenes were fresh and unexpected.  Thank God this movie did not stay in the courtroom!\n7/10",

He's stupid (to the extent that these things can be measured, his mental age is that of a seven-year-old), he's intrusive, he's loud, he never shuts up, he BROADCASTS his every trivial thought in a monotonous braying voice, he throws tantrums the instant he fails to get what he wants. True, he's not this way by choice. He's mentally retarded and cannot help it, but that doesn't make him any more endearing, or capable of raising a child. Yet we're asked to believe that nobody could have been or could be a better guardian of his daughter than he, and we're also asked to endure his constant, grating presence for two hours. And when I say \"constant\", I mean it. There's not a single scene that Sam is absent from until two hours in, and even then, it's only a brief respite. Before that I doubt he's absent from the SCREEN for more than five consecutive seconds. I can't be sure; the movie was so unbearable that I had to walk out three times to gather the strength to sit through the rest - I HAD to, I had no choice. How many bad movies are quite THAT bad? It's true, I walked out entirely on \"Showgirls\" and \"Thumbelina\", but that was years ago; my stamina has improved since then, and I would not walk out on such movies today.The product placement is about as blatant as it gets (if it seems otherwise, this is only because the constant manipulation, the contrived plotting, and the cardboard-cutout nature of Michelle Pfieffer's character are, somehow, even more blatant). What did the studio get, in return for placing Starbucks in every other frame? My guess: unlimited coffee for the cameraman and the editor. They mangle the footage as though they're ashamed of it, which they have every right to be, and when there's an ESPECIALLY weak scene, the camera goes positively berserk.",

It's more like a journey. It talks about a father, Ssm Dawson, who was mentally disabled and whether he is capable of taking care of his 7-year daughter, Lucy Daawson. So the child service takes his daughter away from him and tries to get a foster parents to care for the child. Along the way we see a lot of emotional clashes, like a father who wants to reunite with his daughter, a daughter who wants nothing more than her father's love which only Sam Dawson could give, Sam's attorney Rita who has a husband who is cheating on her and son who feels their parents are not paying close attention towards him, and then the foster family who wants to take custody of Lucy Dawson, seeing her as their own daughter but didn't know how to end the love and affection Lucy and Sam have for each other.It's just difficult to mix systems and rules and conscience, sometimes. I mean, we make a system and follow the rules, do we have to follow the rules all the time ? Or do we have follow our consciences ? Where to follow the System and when do we look into our conscience ? Is it possible to look at them together always ? How does it affect us ? From this movie, do we have to look into the child's affairs in what ways ? Through the rules or through the heart ? Is it right to separate a kid from his/her parents just because they are not intelligent than their kids ? I mean, what parents wouldn't want their kids to be smarter than them ?Sean Penn as Sam gives an Oscar worthy performance. Dakota Fanning as Lucy shines in her role and proves that she's beyond exceptional. Michele Pfeiffer as Rita does justice to her role as well. A very well written movie. At some places I felt the emotion building up in my heart. I wanted to cry in the middle and smile at the end. I have never seen such a powerful movie in my life. It had that much of an impact on me. I am 24 now, I never had a girlfriend and am single, but after seeing this movie, I just want to be a Dad, like right now. It had that much of an impact on me. Awesome performance. Amazing cast. Excellent directing. Nice Script. Nice story. Very well written. Very good editing. Beautiful cinematography. Wonderful musical score. And honestly, I can't see why people are not choosing heavy subjects like this. Nowadays they just want to movies with special effects and stuffs.Just, watch this movie. You'll know what I mean. It's one of a kind and unique in many ways. A masterpiece. It's definitely going into my DVD collection.",

See how good this simpleton is to his daughter. How pure his love, how corrupt & selfish the \"normal\" people are. Blah blah blah. Pass me that empty popcorn bag, I'm gonna hurl.It isn't that the story hasn't got a point, but that it is horrificaly overplayed, the message being delivered in industrial amounts. It's like expecting a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee & getting 2lbs of sacharrine dumped in it instead.The clumsy manipulation isn't limited to the script, with wooden, cliched characterization & oh so obvious directorial & cinemagraphic tricks. Notice how the scenes are technicolor when Sam is with his daughter, but have a cold, blue, almost monochrome color during the court scenes. Sublety seemsnot to be this film's strong point & wherever there is a chance to drive a point home with a sledgehammer the opportunity is taken to do so with obvious enthusiasm.Michele Pfiefer is normally watchable, but this has to be her first role where I couldn't bear to look. She does her best with the part, but ultimately the clunking story & dialogue leave her trying to shine while carrying a dead albatross round her neck. God only knows why she agreed to add this turkey to her resume. Maybe it seemed a good idea at the time. Maybe it simply paid well & the rent on her mansion was due.Sean Penn is simply diabolically bad, unconvincing & puke inducing as Sam. Laura Dearn ambles through looking like she's smelt something bad. The rest of the cast simply wallow around, subsumed by the crushing sentimentality.This whole film stinks. The one area where there is some very limited relief is the soundtrack, where Beatles tunes are played. Even here this is spoiled, for a start they're all pretty sub standard covers by other bands & even then we only get snatches.When you consider how many great film ideas never get anywhere you have to wonder just how this pile of poop ever got onto the screen.

            "content": "Well, that was not the greatest movie to spend six-fifty on. In the beginning, I bit my lip with frustration. Toward the middle, I was groaning inwardly. By the end, I sat in my seat filled with shock, ranting to my friends and anyone else who would listen.Obviously, not enough research went into this film. Sam (Sean Penn) was an unrealistic character. The characters explained that he had autistic tendencies and was retarded. No. I have dealt intimately with autism (living with someone who has it, working at a daycare for children with it, going to preschool in a class with well over half people with disabilities) for over sixteen years, and I can tell you that Sam is well off his marker. He is far too high functioning for some of his low functioning traits. In other words, he becomes incredibly capable when the plotline requires it, then appears to be quite low functioning at other times.He knows the Beatles like the back of his hand. Okay. I can go for that. But how does he apply the songs and life stories to and draw complex connections from the Beatles to his own life? How can he come up with these life lessons for his daughter and profound statements for just the right time (\"Always set your dreams high, Lucy.\" \"You need to leave your husband.\" \"You don't know what it's like when you try and you try and you try, and you never get there!\")? So he is high functioning enough to do all that, but he can't make a drink at Starbucks after many years there? He can't understand concepts simpler than the profound exclamations he makes?Some of the other disabled people in the movie were well done. However, the man who the filmmakers apparently wanted to appear to have autism (the one who kept rattling off movies and their release dates) was a cheap Rain Man rip off but plausible. The largest problem with him however, the thing that made me not believe in him, was that he seemed capable of analyzing the characters in the movies of which he spoke. While this only happened once or twice, it was enough to cause me frustration.Also, there was very little to no background given. How did Sam have a baby? How did he hook up with a woman, hooker or not? How did he raise a child alone (except for the help of a woman who never leaves home) for seven years? How did he know what diapers to buy? How, how, how? How did all of these plot holes sneak by? This only served to confuse viewers and give an unstable view of Sam's abilities. More \"hows\" were generated than answers.The best thing to come out of this movie was Dakota Fanning (Lucy, Sam's daughter). She was the most believable character, and seemed to innately know how to act and react. Laura Dern (Randy, foster mother) was also fantastic. She obviously just wanted the best for little Lucy. Sean Penn did the best he knew how for Sam, but it just wasn't up to par. With a script that had adequate research, a well-defined character with a well-defined disability, and some more research on his part, he would have fared much better.Many think this is \"just a movie\" and doesn't deserve harsh criticism, but face it, this is what the general public sees of disabilities. This is what the average person thinks about people with autism. They'll get their education about disabilities from movies like this one. And what they're seeing is a false image. I'm so sick of seeing autism misrepresented in cinema.If you want to see a good drama that deals with disabilities, Rain Man is the best. Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of autistic savant Raymond is dead on-I believed that he was autistic. The next best is What's Eating Gilbert Grape?. Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job with his autistic character Arnie, a completely unrecognizable change from the DiCaprio in Titanic or Romeo and Juliet. If you do want to watch I Am Sam, knock yourself out. Just don't waste any of your time believing it.",

            "content": "I Am Sam is a very inspiring tale and an emotional movie that can be hard to watch at times due to the subject matter. Along with such films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape, this film tackles a very tough subject in mental illness and it creates a theme about how anyone can love, even if the person has a mental capacity of a seven-year-old. Sean Penn is at his best here as he delivers another fine performance, even if his performance is questionably full-fledged. This film is about a man named Sam who has the mental capacity of a seven-ear-old, works at Starbucks, and is obsessed with the Beatles. One day, a homeless woman gives birth to a girl with Sam as the father. The state fears that he is incompetent as a father and take his daughter away from him. Now Sam enlists the help of a hotshot lawyer named Rita to help him win the case. As said before, Sean Penn delivers a magnificent performance. People have questioned his performance, but the purpose of acting is to become a different character and that is exactly what Sean Penn did. Michelle Pfieffer delivers a strong performance as the lawyer, Rita who learns the lessons of love along the way. Dakota Fanning musters a strong, natural performance as Sam's daughter. Finally, Laura Dern does a good job as the foster mother. Overall, I Am Sam is the kind of film that teaches people to love all over again. If you have any children, remember to say how much you love them. This is a drama that could take place in reality, thus giving the movie even more of an emotional bite. A very good, powerful movie thanks to Sean Penn's effective performance. My Grade: A",

            "content": "I try to be as non cynical as possible when writing my movie reviews. I hate people who review movies with such a negative and trashy attitude towards them, honing in solely on the negative. I avoid this as much as possible, always looking for the positive in a movie, but some movies just have no positive side to them, despite their acclaimed status. Every once in a while you just have no choice but to write a really cynical and really negative review. That said, I Am Sam is about Sam Dawson, a mentally retarded man who is fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter, Lucy, who has been taken away from him by what the movie shows us is the evil, cold-hearted, and oppressive Child Protective Services. Sam gets help from a lawyer named Rita, who learns the true meaning of family value from Sam in the most Hollywood formula way possible. This movie attempts to emotionally move you in the most obvious and intrusive ways possible. It is a truly horrible cramming of ideals down our throats.I Am Sam is a film that can go one of two ways. It can be a very human story brimming with emotional prowess, that moves its audience to the brink of tears with its sincerity and heart. Or it can end up being a pathetically formula film with motives so blatantly obvious it's not even funny. I Am Sam is a poster child for the latter and it had me frustrated and put off within thirty minutes. This movie makes it ridiculously easy to be on Sam's side of the court case for his child and it removes all realism the story could have had and replaces it with unrealistic archetypal heroes and villains. There's nothing human about this film and the majority of the characters don't feel like actual characters and are present to just serve one story development purpose. For example, the people who are against Sam are made out to be heartless evil people who have no contempt for love or positive emotion. They also seem to constantly forget the fact that Sam is mentally disabled, showing no empathy or compassion towards the situation he is in. Sam's relationship with everyone in this film feels either heavily exaggerated to force a point, or formulaic and predictable.That brings me to another point surrounding the character of Sam. Robert Downey Jr. put it perfectly in Tropic Thunder. You never go full retard. Sean Penn went full retard and came home empty handed, losing out to a much more deserving Denzel Washington for Training Day. I know the \"full retard\" thing is a joke, but it actually has a lot of truth to it. Penn plays the character of Sam to such an extent that he is completely detached from reality. He is unable to understand 95 percent of what is happening around him making him really seem like someone who can't properly function in society. I found myself actually questioning whether it was a good idea for Sam to keep his daughter with a higher mental capacity than him at the age of seven. I almost wanted to side with CPS, but the movie's over exaggerated idealistic ways made that impossible to do so without feeling as evil and anti-retard as the CPS are made out to be.Who knew that a potentially heart warming and moving film could produce results that not only don't meet expectations, but are the makings of a truly awful film. This movie had me emotionally invested for maybe twenty to thirty minutes. After I realized what a force fed bout of lies this film was, my interest deteriorated quickly. This is a prime example of Hollywood's lack of creative ability. Do not let these two hours go down the drain watching this movie.",

He named her daughter Lucy Diamonds (Dakota Fanning) (after Lucy and the Sky with Diamonds Beatles song). He makes his best effort to raise her and they develop a relation based on pure love. When Lucy gets to 7 years old, she start to became smarter than his father (who according to studies has a 7 year old boy I.Q.), Because of that, the authorities take her away from him in order to search for adoption by a standard family. Sam starts a quest to recover back his daughter; and he finds help on Rita Harrison (Michele Pfeiffer), a high price lawyer who takes his case as Pro Bono.

Due to his difficulties to raise her, the law came to take her away for better education and living in another family. Sam loves her and moved to another house close to the one of the family where her daughter lives, and this may possible to her to visit so often her father and to even sleep from time with time with him. In conclusions, both love each other. I would not argue about the law, i.e. whether it was right or not when the Sam's daughter was taken away from him, I'd rather talk about the extraordinary acting of Sean Penn supported by Michelle Pfeiffer, he was simply the best.

            "content": "I finally got to see I Am Sam all the way through recently on the late night movie. I'm sorry I missed this when it was fresh in the theaters because it destroyed my bias that it would be one of the obvious tear jerkers and predictable.Thanks to the writing and directing it was far from predictable nor was it obvious.Sean Penn is one of America's classic actors in that he can play just about any role and kill it. Having had a sister who was mentally challenged, he got that part so dead on I was thinking all his character needed to do was hate doctors and it would be my sister up on the screen.The film takes on two powerful topics - mainstreaming mentally challenged adults and child well-being.In the not too distant history people like Sam would have lived their entire lives in an institution. They would live with insane and other people with different mental disorders. \"Normal\" people use to not want them around and would warehouse them out of sight out of mind. Adults that live in the community now are functional but don't comprehend or understand complex ideas that we all take for granted. They don't hide or moderate their feelings.Today the government takes a more active role in protecting children. Some say they get too aggressive but in my view I would rather they make a mistake in a effort to help a child than the other way. Dealing with a mentally challenged parent has to be one of the most difficult things to handle when it comes to child protection.This film does a good job of meshing the two topics without giving either short shrift.Through a series of unfortunate events Sam loses custody of his daughter Lucy. He gets a high power lawyer Rita (played by the excellent Michelle Pfeiffer) to take his case pro-bono, mainly because her co-workers think she would never do pro-bono work. While preparing the case Rita learns first to care about Sam and his case and put her heart into it while also learning about why she was having issues with her own life and her relationship with her son Willy.I said the film was unpredictable and the best example was a scene during a court hearing when Sam is being questioned on the stand. Mr. Turner (played by Richard Schiff) asks Sam what does it take to make a good parent. Sam thinks really hard and starts to give a long speech that seems so lucid and intelligent compared to his previous answers. The people in the room are stunned because the answer is so perfect then we find out he quoted a scene from the movie \"Kramer vs Kramer\". Then the look on the faces in the court room said \"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\" The ending of the film, while plosive, is left open to interpretation which I also liked.The only quibble I had with the film was that Sam, being mentally challenged and obviously not understanding what was happening to him, was never given any help or an advocate. One example was when he had to see a state appointed psychologist and she explains to him at the start that since she was appointed by the court that he was waving his patient doctor privilege rights. She asks him more than once if he understood and he said he did but there is no way he knew what he was doing. There should have been an advocate there since Rita wasn't there to look out for his rights. Of course that could've been the point - that Sam was being held to the same standards as a intellectually adult person even if it didn't seem fair to Sam.Still this is a great movie and I'm glad I watched it.",

So the whole story is about the love between the father and the daughter, and their attempts to stay together as the state tries to make a case that foster parents would be best for the girl. Sam stumbles upon the help of a driven lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to try and win his case.A film of this subject should make a viewer uneasy at times, and this one does. It brings home the difficulty certain people, not in the mainstream, have fitting into our fast-paced society. And the difficulty with social services and the legal system. Sean Penn does a remarkable job in this role, it is hard now to visualize any other actor doing it.I suppose this film affected me so strongly because I was a single father when my smallest children were under 10. As good a movie as it is, I don't think someone who hasn't been the father of young children could get the same from it. The DVD picture is superb, both in its sharpness and great use of colors. The soundtrack uses Beatles songs sung by modern musicians. DTS and Dolby are both available, but there isn't much \"surround\" to talk about. However, the DVD extra which chronicles the genesis of the story, the research, the casting, the filming is among the most interesting I have seen. It makes the film that much more wondrous.

Child services feel that Penn, a single parent, cannot continue to care for a child who will soon be more intelligent than him. Enter lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer who gets suckered into taking the case as Penn's economic status is near invisible to start with. The film is just too uneven to really work. The audience feels sympathy for Penn's character, but it also becomes quite clear that he cannot continue to care for his daughter all alone. There are some really dramatic moments and some funny moments that feel forced. The film twists into the courtroom late and this once again was probably needed, but did not work as well as it should have. Also the movie runs much too long as Laura Dern is wasted in what is pretty much a cameo role and Dianne Wiest's character is a bit distracting as well as she has a side-story of her own. Penn's friends, played by real-life mentally challenged men, add good turns and make the film more convincing. The main attraction when all is said and done though is Penn.

            "review_title": "Why let reality intrude?",
            "content": "I AM SAM is one of the most unfairly manipulative movies I've seen, which is all the more frustrating because a moment or two of real greatness would become clear between the times I was questioning how wrongheaded, false and/or blind it is to reality.Let's start with the most obvious complaint - a plothole the movie chooses to completely ignore. If Sam is unfit to raise his child because his IQ is that of a seven year old's, how, I wonder, did he raise her in her early years? The story starts around Lucy's seventh birthday, but little is shown how good a father Sam was up until then; all we see is him shopping for diapers and playing with her on the swings. How were his parenting skills during these formative years? Wasn't Social Services concerned for her well-being even once before?The lack of backstory isn't the biggest reason for my dislike of the film. What frustrated me the most is that it raises valid questions about what makes a good parent only to negate them by forcing a compromised resolution before an upbeat ending. Every point the opposing attorney raised is true (in the real world, anyway). A man of Sam's intelligence is not capable of providing for his child, but the movie bends over backwards trying to disprove this fact. The movie's tagline summarizes this lie: \"Love is all you need.\" Sorry, but love is NOT all it takes to raise a child, and anyone who thinks otherwise is naive and unfit for parenthood.Now that I've got my major gripes out of the way, let's move on to the minor ones. First, Sam makes only $8.00 an hour after working at least seven years at the same place? Since he was unable to cover the cost of his daughter's new shoes, I wonder where he got the money for that inflated air trampoline for her birthday party. And I wonder how he fit it into his apartment. And while I'm thinking about Sam's sources of income, I'm still confused about his other job - dog walking. Walking dogs for extra money I get; what I don't understand why he takes these dogs home with him. Whose dogs are these? Did Sam just forget to return them to their owners, or is he sitting while they're out of town?And Sam's places of business weren't just a coffee shop and pizza place. They were Starbucks and Pizza Hut. Sam and Lucy went shoe shopping not at a mom-and-pop place, but at Payless. They don't eat at diners, but at IHOP and Bob's Big Boy. I Am Sam has the most intrusive, blatant and unnecessary product placement I've seen recently outside a pro sports stadium, and they fit uneasily with the all the covered Beatles songs. Why were the Beatles so upset when Michael Jackson licensed their \"Revolution\" to Nike while this movie sometimes looks like one long commercial? Speaking of the sneaker conglomerate, there was even a huge Nike shoe on the side of a bus in the movie for absolutely no reason. I'm surprised there was no mention of Blockbuster with all the talk of movies here. (Maybe because the average Blockbuster doesn't stock KRAMER VS. KRAMER and GONE WITH THE WIND?) I AM SAM has the homogenized feel of a cold corporate environment, and the lighting and camera work exacerbate this lack of warmth.Why were so many scenes lit with a blue filter? Disparate locales - a supermarket, elementary school, lawyer's home and Department of Social Services all had the same sickly azure tint. Was this for artistic reasons? To show how unfriendly these places were? If so, how and why are they unfriendly? Looking at cinematographer Elliot Davis' credits reveals he's a competent veteran (and he lit the also-bad-but-in-a-different-way FORCES OF NATURE similarly), so I guess I'm just missing the point.I'm willing to give director Jessie Nelson a pass for all the unsteady handheld camerawork here. This technique has a purpose and is effective when used correctly, but I AM SAM is only Nelson's second feature, so maybe one day she'll learn why it's a distraction in a quiet domestic drama.I AM SAM is not completely terrible. All the actors do their best with what they're given. I especially liked Doug Hutchison as one of Sam's circle of differently-abled friends, and little Dakota Fanning is a naturally gifted child actor. Dianne Wiest, as the homebody neighbor, is her usual excellent self despite her aforementioned sketchy role. And, as the leads, Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer need no confirmation of their talents.How convenient, by the way, that Sam's neighbor is a recluse who can hear a baby crying in the next building over. What was her story, anyway? The whole movie I kept waiting for this character to be fleshed out, but her testimony at the hearing added little to her character. A 2+ hour drama should make the effort to develop its supporting characters more.What about those moments of greatness, you ask. One scene springs to mind. Actually, make that half a scene, in which the Pfeiffer character peers through the paper wall Sam erected following the custody loss. Wonderfully shot, written and acted, it was the only moment I can now recall that had real dramatic and artistic strength. Unfortunately, this scene devolved into soap opera emoting and uncomfortably close to an ensuing love scene that thankfully never happened. Whew. I was dreading any sort of romantic connection between these two characters, which would have been wrong in so many ways.So, as a whole, I AM SAM is maddingly unsatisfying up to and including the end. About 90 minutes in I thought to myself there's no way it can have a happy ending without either ignoring everything that came before or totally copping out with some kind of half-assed compromise. Sure enough, the final scenes left me dumbfounded. There's not much to say without spoiling it, so allow me just to detest it. Like LOSING ISAIAH (another child custody drama), it ends with of those exasperating solutions that really wouldn't solve the problem in the real world, but lets both sides of a movie court battle come off as winners. And after this insufficient denouement, the movie ends with Sam refereeing Lucy's soccer match. When did Sam become qualified to do this? And wouldn't the ref being a player's father make him unfairly biased? I don't think an officiator should be cheering for a player to score, nor do I think the kids on the other team would be too happy, either. But why let logic get in the way of a happy ending?3/10",

First, Sam (Sean Penn) is surrounded by his inner circle of friends who are also mentally handicapped and who come across much more believable, probably because they are in real life. So Sean Penn's character 'Sam' stands out against his group of friends like a fish out of water, trying to get in every speech and facial nuance that says 'hello I'm retarded'. (Much like Nic Cage's depiction of O.C.D.'s in Matchstick Men) Sam's daughter Lucy is a cute little girl, it's hard not to like her. But she's just a little too 'Hollywood cute'. Michelle Pheiffer over-acts, first as her 'I am a beautiful female lawyer who has what it takes to win a case' to the understanding sensitive pro-bono attorney who makes Sam's case (to regain custody of Lucy) her exclusive campaign, all the while having to constantly push her hair out of her face in order to impart the facts of family court to Sam.By the end of the film, Sam seems to have gotten smarter, his verbal skills are quicker and it seems his thinking is faster. And his lawyer has predictably learned a lot of life lessons from helping Sam.\nDid anyone else think he 'borrowed' the exact same clothing from Dustin Hoffman's character Raymond in Rainman? Is is an unspoken rule that all mentally handicap men must dress in khaki jackets and pants that are 2 inches to short with white socks?",

            "content": "I can't say I've ever been a fan of Sean Penn an actor some critics have labeled \" The greatest actor of his generation \" . I've followed his career for twenty years ever since he married you know who . I found him okay in WE'RE NO ANGELS while his performance in CASUALTIES OF WAR was so OTT he was in danger of going into orbit . In other words he's rather hit and miss but I was totally taken aback with Penn's acting in I AM SAM . All too often an actor playing a mentally or physically handicapped character lays it on with a trowel but at no point in this film did I ever believe I was watching an actor ( Far less an actor called Sean Penn ) playing a character called Sam Dawson - I was watching Sam Dawson a man with the mental age of a seven year old , a man working in a coffee shop , a man trying to bring up a baby daughter a real life person . I've never seen MYSTIC RIVER but I can't wait to see Penn's Oscar winning role if this is the type of character acting that he's capable of It's a pity that the only that's successful thing about I AM SAM is Penn's dynamite performance . Ironic too because if Penn's nuances are subtle everything about the movie is hammered home far too obviously . Jessie Nelson has a background in television or more specifically in television movies , but even the most naive TVM producer would baulk at this heavy handed story . As soon as Sam's partner has given birth she runs off holding the baby - I mean that in a literal sense so Sam has to bring up a baby that turns in to a young sweet child called Lucy Diamond . She is so sweet I'm surprised that everyone around her hasn't died from diabetes and I'm sure a few people who have seen this movie have needed insulin injections such is its sugary sentimental storytelling . I certainly feel like I'm getting emotionally blackmailed by Nelson into feeling for the characters which eventually feels like manipulation . Certainly I would have respected the film a lot more if there'd been a lightness of touch , a lightness of touch which is totally absent here . As it stands it's still worth watching because Penn's amazing performance",

A guy who can't handle a blender in Starbucks manages to lease an apartment, keep it clean and presumably cook and do laundry for his daughter.I found all of the characters to be drawn in that black and white mode so beloved of Hollywood. Michelle, a frantic lying workaholic parent, becomes a better mother, an agoraphobic leaves her apartment for the first time in decades, life, as in Forrest Gump, is not here \" a box of chocolates\", but \" An all you need is love\" and the Beatles.I was anxious to see what should have been a key scene, where Sam is awarded custody of his daughter, but this is mysteriously omitted. I am not surprised. No judge in his right mind would award a child to this man without a responsible adult being an integral part of his life.5 out of 10 for the performance of the actress who portrays Lucy (Dakota Fanning) so beautifully.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a tear-jerking, emotion-provoking melodrama, this is your first on the list. I am Sam is a sensational dramatic piece that will leave you with tears to wipe. In the film, Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is a mentally challenged single father who's left by, as what it seems, a one night stand homeless woman to raise his daughter Lucy(Dakota Fanning). Despite of being a mentally retarded person, Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He's a sweet, good-natured, and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.Unfortunately, a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise, at Lucy's 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam, having the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, can't raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father, along with the help of his mentally challenged friends, tries to find a high-profile attorney that can help him get his child back.After multiple attempts, Sam manages to appoint an attorney (Michelle Pfeiffer) who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her, through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eye-opening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son's life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy, aided by his mentally challenged friends, his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell (Diana Wiest), and his high profile determined lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer).The film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably, Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal, a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn's performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor, it's a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I wouldn't expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It's a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted ill-tempered work driven nature. Least but not last, the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set, and by far one of her best performances as a child.The movie is Beatles-themed as we first understand Sam's character as an impressive Beatles-knowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Diamond Sky\". As a matter of fact, Michelle Pfeiffer's character is named after the song \"Lovely Rita\" by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member, George Harrison and if you noticed in the film, Rita Harrison(Michelle Pfeiffer) points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition, the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. The film is sweeping in its beauty, director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of \"I Am Sam\" into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly hand-held work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam's movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions. It's a closer look to the mentally handicapped people's world, that every act of their doing has an essence and that they are truly remarkable in their own \"special\" way.Lastly, should a intellectual deficiency restrain one from raising his own child? We've all had a grandma or grandma that despite of their intelligence in life aspects, had difficulty in helping their kids with their Geometry homework but does that alone hinder the child from having a well educated natural life? The movie has a great message, that when it comes to parenting, love is the most important thing and if that is present then it most certainly paves the way to a healthy parent-child relationship.",

I hated it and I didn't know why.  This took over that position, but I know why.The story is about a retarded man....daughter...custody...yeah yeah blah. you can read one of the other reviews for a synopsis.Sean Penn is of course my favorite male actor along with Benicio Del Toro, and his performance is naturally brilliant.  not everything has to be flawed for me to hate this movie as much as I do.  The story makes itself out to be touching but ends up being so sickeningly sweet I wanted to throw up every couple of seconds.  Take his daughter for example, the doppelganger for the Welches grape juice girl.  Of course you can justify a man wanting custody of his daughter when she has the psychological identity of a thirty-year-old.  she delivers each line so precociously that I have this adverse visceral reaction and I feel the urge to strangle puppies.Sam has a fan club of other dunces, some played be real exploited disabled men and some played by Percy from \"The Green Mile.\"  The fake one's didn't convince me at all.  They sounded like they were making fun of the real ones.Every scene in this movie (I assume since I had to leave the room because I felt prone to fits of rage.) was shot from across the room zoomed in, hand-held, with a blue filter on the camera.  which is a good effect in \"Traffic.\"  In \"i am sam\" the style just makes me want to punch my own grandmother.The worst part about this movie is the sound of dozens of 17 year-old girls going \"awwwWWWWWWW!\" every eight seconds, while all the while my hands are digging into the arm rests of my chair like talons.There is a scene in \"Fight Club\" where the narrator feels so resentful toward the world that he beats the most attractive man he knows until his face is destroyed all the while thinking \"I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.

On second thought, hold the ham because this film is full of it. If no Dr. can be found, then the audience will be terminally blinded by the worst case of sugar overdose since `The Majestic.'When Penn first read the script, he may have turned off his signature intensity; how else could you account for his not recognizing the insipid script about a retarded man with the intelligence of a 7-year old fighting to retain custody of his 7-year old daughter.  Penn's mugging and nasal wonderment are technique gone in pursuit of sentiment. Even the usually in- control Penn must resort to cliched mannerisms to overcome the screenplay.\nWhen pro-bono lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer says to Penn, `I've gotten more out of this relationship than you have,' we have gone beyond `Kramer vs. Kramer' and `Rain Man' into the sugar land of `Mary Poppins.' Pfeiffer's redemption would play much better on a Christian Coalition channel, as would the whole politically\u0096correct movie.The corruption of a film manipulating the audience to side with Penn is that it is seriously questionable whether he should, given his sometimes-deficient coping skills, be in charge of the child. Even his ability to remember Beatles lyrics and dates and the film's overlay of songs like \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" and `All you need is Love' can't convince me that this is an honest portrayal of a complicated human situation. Not when he can barely understand a written court order or order food without a riot.Go to the Lifetime Channel for more honesty than this, and tell director Jessie Nelson that the emotional hot buttons should be pushed now and then gently, not with a permanent repeat button.",

As the film opens we see him working very diligently and effectively at Starbuck's, organizing the sweeteners, busing the tables, and delivering the coffees. He complements everyone on having made \"an excellent choice.\" Then he is reminded that today is the big day and that he needs to go to the hospital, where his daughter is born. When the mother runs away, he is left with the baby, who he names Lucy. While he is overwhelmed with the task of raising a daughter (which we see by the camera swirling around him to show his confusion), he gets some help from a neighbor (played very well by Dianne Wiest in a small role) and manages to raise her. The film goes through these early years quite quickly to get to the heart of the story, which is when Lucy begins to surpass her father's intelligence. The authorities decide that perhaps Sam is not such a good father after all, and he is forced to fight to keep her. He doesn't really understand what's going on, but manages through luck and determination to get a lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. This part of the film, which needed to be edited a little more aggressively, becomes a bit too manipulative and \"movie of the week\" for what would normally be my taste, but it is done so well that it worked for me, and I didn't mind.Penn's acting is amazing, with only one brief moment when I saw his intelligence flash out from behind his character. You really can't appreciate what he does here from watching the clips or the movie trailer. Dakota Fanning, who plays Lucy, is also quite good most of the time, especially considering her age (7 in 2001). Pfeiffer is acceptable most of the time, but is obviously acting (or attempting to) in her biggest scene. I'll also mention that Brent Spiner has a very short part in one early scene (so small I expected him to be uncredited, but he is listed), and Laura Dern does good work when she appears later in the film.And lastly, I should say that the soundtrack is made up of remakes of Beatles songs, which also fits into the story because Sam falls back on the lyrics of Beatles songs when he doesn't know what else to to (like when he names his daughter after the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"). Surprisingly, I do not believe that \"All You Need is Love\" is used, because that would perhaps summarize the message of the movie.",

Like Tom Cruise in \"Rain Man\", she goes through all the changes while the main character (Sean Penn here in another awesome display) has to remain relatively static throughout the proceedings. And like Tom Cruise, the Oscar voters, in their wisdom, decided to overlook an outstanding performance. Which. if history is any lesson, they will make up for in the future by handing her the award for an inferior movie. (see Paul Newman-\"The Color Of Money\", Al Pacino-\"Scent of A Woman\", et al.) Anyway..bottom line is they OWE her one now. Sean Penn nails it, as does the rest of the supporting cast in \"I Am Sam\", particularly Dakota Fanning as Penn's precocious daughter in a performance that's sure to put her on the Jodie Foster track in a big hurry. \"Sam\" is a 5-hankie tear-jerker, but for all the right reasons. And the use of the Beatles' music as a sound track is on target. A compelling film with a clear message about love and family and a happy ending to boot. What more can you ask for?",

The acting was very good, especially Sean Penn's performance as a mentally challenged man fighting to keep custody of his daughter. First of all, for the past five years I have worked closely with mentally disabled individuals, and although some of them are very kind, and have a loving nature, I've yet to come across one that would be capable of taking on the responsibility of raising a child. I can also assure you that in real life, the attempt to take the child out of the home by social services would have occurred long before the child ever reached her fifth birthday. So while I think the outcome of the movie was what I consider to be not realistic, I still liked the ending, the way I have enjoyed many endings to films that I consider to be fiction. I also thought the film had some problems from a technical standpoint. Why this filming style was adopted for this type of movie is beyond me. Normal camera angles, with a nice dramatic symphony score would have been much more pleasing to the eyes and ears. The music that was ultimately chosen for this movie was so out of place at times (and I usually love The Beatles) that it became very annoying. Even with all of these problems, I still managed to somewhat enjoy the movie because of a pretty decent script, and some very good acting. But as always, that's just my opinion.",

Although it has its mawkish sentimental moments, I Am Sam is watchable and charming.

The experiences of Sam and his friends are true to life -- struggling to cope in a world that expects you to think quickly, but not necessarily thoroughly. Sam has \"heart smarts.\" I particularly enjoyed watching the smartass lawyer come to see Sam as a person, and as a peer.There were a few plot holes (such as the way Sam got arrested for soliciting when no money, or even promise of money, was exchanged), but the film's biggest flaw was its unrealistically happy ending. In real life, the best Sam could have ever gotten without a \"normal\" wife would be visitation.",

The woman disappears and it is for Sam to try to raise the child on his own. Thankfully he gets a wealth of help from one of his neighbours and without that I don't think he would have succeeded.On his daughter Lucy's seventh birthday the social services take her away from Sam with a view to putting her into care and eventually adoption.Sam eventually enlists the help of Rita on a Pro Bono basis. Rita is coerced into taking the case free of charge by her colleagues.She initially considers that Sam has no chance of winning his case but as she gets to know him and Lucy she realises that they are perfect together and the love each has for the other has no bounds.Rita has been having problems with her own son but with the help of Sam she learns to appreciate her son and learns how to be a good mother.SPOILER ENDS Sean Penn played Sam Dawson the Autistic father of Lucy Diamond. A young Dakota Fanning acted this role.Michelle Pfeiffer played Rita Harrison Williams, Sam and Lucy's lawyer.Penn was nominated for an Oscar for his acting in 'I am Sam' but it was won by Russel Crowe for Gladiaor.As good as Crowe's acting was in Gladiator I feel that Sean Penn was robbed of the Oscar as I feel he was much more deserving. If he had won he would have had a hat trick of Best Actor Oscars.Dakota Fanning was her usual immaculate self as a child star and played her part to perfection.So to did Michelle Pfeiffer who showed how great an actor she is.All in all this movie is well deserving of a 10 rating and in my opinion deserved the Oscar for Best Movie also.",

Let me tell you something: Not like this it hasn't.This is a film about parenting in a world challenging parents to balance priorities.  It's about much more than an autistic's desire to parent.  It is centered around juggling love and life - setting priorities ... \"All you need is love,\" right John, Paul, George and Ringo?  An oversimplification for sure...  which is why it's a fairy tale with a moral.  Love your kids. Balance your life.  Do it now.The Beatles composed a \"pretty good\" score I think.  :-)  The lyrics string together a screenplay that will win your heart.  Dakota Fanning (Sam's Daughter) has the charisma of Shirley Temple and the more acting talent than many of the top earning stars today.  Whatever part of your heart she doesn't win, Sam will.  Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laura Dern . . . Brilliant all of them.Jessie Nelson's direction pays homage to the genius of Beatle lyrics with ground breaking effects and camera angles.  Jessie brings Sam's world (and his friend's) to your perspective by allowing you to glimpse through their mind's lens (an agoraphobic's, a paranoid's, an autistic's for starters).

Basically in Los Angeles, Sam Dawson (Oscar nominated Sean Penn) is a man with autism, a developmental disability, following the abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman who \"just needed a place to sleep\", he becomes single father to his daughter, Lucy (Dakota Fanning). Despite his limitations, Sam is well-adjusted, with a job working at Starbucks, a supportive group of friends with developmental disabilities, and kind, agoraphobic neighbour Annie (Dianne Wiest) who takes care of Lucy when he cannot. Though Sam provides precocious Lucy with a loving and caring environment, she surpasses his mental ability, he has a mental age of 7, other children tease Lucy having a \"retard\" as a father, and she is too embarrassed to accept that she is more intellectually advanced than Sam. After Sam's parenting skills come into question and the authorities threaten to take Lucy away from him, Sam is advised by his friends to approach high-powered lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer). Rita has a reputation as being cold and unfeeling, due to a brusque manner, fast-paced schedule and difficult personal life, to prove to others that she is not heartless, Rita surprisingly agrees to take on Sam's case pro bono. As they work together to secure Sam's parental rights, Sam unwittingly helps Rita with her family problems, including encouraging her to leave her cheating husband and repairing her fractured relationship with her son. Sam and Rita share an emotional moment, both feeling that they have never felt good enough to solve their situations, they sob and hug each other. At the trial, Rita does everything she can to prove that Sam could be a good father to Lucy, but Sam breaks down following the counsel opposition that he is not capable of all responsibilities of being a father. After the trial, Lucy is put in foster care, residing in a home with Randy Carpenter (Laura Dern), who does everything she can to prove herself as her new \"parent\", while Sam is promoted and finds a new apartment in the neighbourhood. Lucy continually escapes from her room in the middle of the night to go to Sam's apartment, she tries to convince him that they should run away, but he returns her to the foster home each time. Randy realises she cannot give Lucy the same love that she has for Sam, the foster family decide ultimately not to go ahead with adopting Lucy, she will return her to Sam, Randy will tell the judge that Sam is a suitable and better parent for Lucy, they also make an arrangement that Randy will help raise her. The final scene takes place at a soccer game, Sam is refereeing and Lucy is playing, Randy and the foster family, Sam's friends and newly single Rita and her son are watching. Also starring Loretta Devine as Margaret Calgrove, Richard Schiff as Mr. Turner, Brad Allan Silverman as Brad, Mary Steenburgen as Dr. Blake, Joseph Rosenberg as Joe, Stanley DeSantis as Robert, The Green Mile's Doug Hutchison as Ifty and Ken Jenkins as Judge Philip McNeily. Penn is just about passable about the disabled man with a passion for Beatles music, but it is obvious this performance is for vanity, Pfeiffer is a little stereotypical as the lawyer who learns life lessons through helping her innocent client, and Fanning making her big screen debut is alright. You could argue this portrait of mental illness is offensive, inaccurate and even unhelpful, the script is overly sentimental, it is only mildly funny in moments, maybe for the wrong reasons, and it is perhaps a little too long, you could just shun it is Kramer vs. Kramer meets Forrest Gump, or Rain Man, but I went with it, a sort of uncomfortable but not completely awful comedy drama.

So this movie is not as much fiction its a comment on Society as well. Its very well done and only an oddball would criticise it.It was over too soon really and seems wide open for a sequel to take the story further after the implications at the end,that the chosen foster mother whose husband left her could very well develop a relationship after Sam told her every child needs a mother. The circumstances of his daughter's birth told the viewer earlier that she wasn't planned that she was an accident but the woman who gave birth to her didn't want her hence she was taken by Sam. Soon the SS comes snooping and she's taken away-yet she's not at risk. Sam is seen as not being fit to raise a child so get legal aid to fight it and this is the main of the story. Sam is supposed to be retarded yet his knowledge of the Beatles is good enough for him to have been employed as a Beatles Tour Guide if such a thing had been available in his town. Right from the beginning you are on his side and definitely not the prosecutors in the court room who are just throwing the book around all the time-a job they do because they're paid to do it. One of them reminds Sam his daughter will be 6 years in front of him IQ wise by the time she's 13 but that's a dumb thing to say-today kids are teaching their parents things like using computersIn fact Sam talks a lot of sense while the prosecutor is only thinking of her monthly salary The use of Beatles songs was a great idea as so many of the songs act as comments on the situation. So imagine a scenario for a sequel-it begins in the Court Room where Sam has to say whether his circumstances have changed and Sam is able to say he and the foster mother have decided to get married.The story could then turn into Sam becoming a successful tour guide for the town's new Beatles museum",

Penn has received a lot of criticism for his 'oscar fishing'-performance. It is remarkable how well roles portraying mentally challenged people seem to fair with the academy (think of Rain Man, Forrest Gump, Shine and more recently, A Beautiful Mind). Penn emphasises Sam's disability in each and every scene, creating a charicature, a cartoon character that never feels real. When Sam is having trouble adjusting to his new job at Starbucks, he doesn't just mix up orders, he uses the blender without the lid, he starts screaming and yelling and he drinks coffee meant for customers. He reminded me more of Tom Greene than of anything else. Penn has proven in the past he is an excellent actor but frankly i find it ridiculous the academy even considered his performance for the oscar (let alone nominated him). The tendency of director Jessie Nelson to rely on cliches and charicatures is even more obvious in her casting of child actress Dakota Fanning, portraying Sam's daughter. Dakota has 'cute' written all over her, innocently staring into the camera with eyes the size of saucers, in scenes that were written to extract tears from the audience. Furthermore, unlike her father, little Lucy seems possess the mental capabilities of an adult as she miraculously comprehends exactly what is going on around her, all the while shooting off one-liners and kodak moments. And then there is Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of the caffeine-drinking, cartier-wearing hard-as-nails-litigator deciding to take Sam's case pro bono in order to prove to her colleagues she isn't the ice queen after all. Of course during the procedings she rediscovers her own humanity as Sam's unconditional love makes her see her own failure as a mother. Because yes, with all his shortcomings Sam makes for a better parent then she does, having all sorts of troubles with her own son. This part of the plot is particularly poorly developed, showing her hysterically screaming at her son for no apparent reason, also she explains she sometimes tells her son to 'get into the f***ing car' without really knowing why.Nelson is the first to realize that large parts of her film remind us of Kramer vs. Kramer, the quintessential movie dealing with divorce and child custody. Therefore she refers to it constantly, probably wanting to avoid criticism of going down familiar roads (passing it off as an hommage no doubt). Pherhaps the subject matter is similar, but I Am Sam never bears any resemblance to the brilliance of the aforementioned film. Forget I Am Sam and rent Kramer vs. Kramer instead.",

The neighbor is even a Juilliard graduate who gives free piano lessons.The lack of realism here is stunning: does a job sweeping floors at Starbucks really pay for a decent apartment in any major city? Of course it doesn't. People with the mental age of grade school children don't make competent housekeepers either: they end up with dwellings full of vermin, they stack newspapers next to oily rags because they don't know any better, they mix the wrong household chemicals with toxic results. In the real world a child whose parent has a mental disability is more likely to get singled out by pedophiles or schoolyard buddies than by a kindly agoraphobic pianist. Reality can be ugly; this is why child protection agencies exist.The plot of this fiction then challenges whether such a person should keep custody of his child. With the dice weighted like this, how much of a mystery could the outcome be?In one scene in particular Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Sam's lawyer in his defense against Child Protective Services, loses her temper for a moment at her own children and then wonders whether she is so different from Sam? Yes of course she is different because a normal parent is capable of learning from his or her mistakes but a mentally impaired parent lacks that learning curve.There is no doubting the skill of the cast in their profession and Dakota Fanning is a darling. The writing goes as far as it can toward making this premise plausible, which in a different sort of film could be harmless. We all know, for example, that zombies can't really exist. Yet it can be thrilling for two hours to pretend that they do. This film is far more toxic because it attempts to depict a real world problem, and then it encourages all the rationalizations that leave helpless children in unsafe situations. The film's emotional arc shifts to how much Sam wants to be a parent--rather than whether he is competent at it. That is exactly where the focus in child safety cases should never be.",

Sean Penn's performance is very accurate and shows a fine understanding of this group of people. I have worked for a number of years running a drop-in center and I have had many interactions with people just like Sam.  I have two criticisms of the movie - firstly, the premise is somewhat flawed. It is extremely unlikely that someone with Sam's mental capacity would have been able to raise a child to the age of 6 without a strong support team that was nowhere evident in the movie. Without giving away the movies ending I have to say I was disappointed that the movie lacked the courage to face the most likely real-world outcome. Still, fine performances by Penn and Pfeiffer make this a very worthwhile experience. I think the movie raises important questions in a thoughtful way.",

Dustin's character Ray obviously had alot more trouble talking and can't even hold a simple conversation. And whats more, he is a genius on numbers. Even the acting (the way the character is presented) is different, definitely, definitely different. And from my humble opinion, Sean can compare his performance-wise to the great Dustin.\n So there are three possible reasons why there is such a mix up of films. 1), the reviewers actually didn't see the movie. 2), there is a cascade of monkey see and monkey do effect 3) maybe it is a different Rain Man we are talking about..

A few good ideas were also included for good measures. I love the scene when the guys were trying to record a message in the answering machine, that cracked me up laughing.  But this is a typical hollywood type film, so you won't expect a sad ending or anything bad will happen to the main characters. When I saw Sean in U-Turn, I misjudged him as a one dimensional pretty face actor who can only do one role. Apprently, I am wrong about that. Sean did a very good job in this film, I must say his acting was as good as Danzel in Training Day and Russell in Beautiful Mind. Whoever won in the Oscar night as best actor probably won by a very small fraction since they all did a very good job in their respective roles.8/10",

I recall how the critics and IMDb commenters didn't much care for this movie when it came out (check out 2 of the first 5 comments). Astounding, frankly.I think I enjoy the Beatles covers in this movie more than my \"1\" CD. My first awareness of Sarah McLaughlin was her cover of \"Blackbird\" in this movie and my wife today is a big SMc fan.The story, always the most important part of a movie, is immediately familiar and relatively common. So once again we have to appreciate what a superb job of direction, production, acting, editing and general creativity went into this gem to cause it to rise so high above the average.On the downside, of Hollywood not this movie, what frosted my socks the most was that Sean didn't win best actor for this, then won a token Oscar the following year for Mystic River -- a horrendous movie that never appears on TV and is fit only for torturing an Arpaio prison population. OK, I'll let that go, I promise.Test this movie on yourself.

            "content": "As I sit down to write this review on October 8th, 2019, it occurs to me that I watched a movie about a mentally challenged man the night before, 2 years to the day after my challenged sister passed away. That wasn't why I watched this movie at all, it was just by chance.However, that may be part of the reason why I Am Sam moved me in a way most movies can't. Having a disabled sister, and being on the autism spectrum myself, I could relate to Sam in a way most people would not be able to.Sam is played by Sean Penn, who as mentioned before, is mentally challenged. He has the IQ equal to a 7 year old, and a daughter named Lucy(Dakota Fanning) who just turned 7. She is the product of a one night stand with a hooker, who ran away from Sam when Lucy was born.Since Lucy's age is equivalent to her father's brain, Social Services fear that a man can't raise his child if the kid is more intelligent than the father. So they take her away to a foster home and Sam has to hire a lawyer(Michelle Pfeiffer) to get her back.I also read the reviews of Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli before seeing this movie. They both gave it 2/4 stars for the same reason. This can be best explained by quoting Ebert himself:\"The lesson \"I Am Sam\" wants to teach us is, \"All you need is love.\" This is not quite strictly true. Sam loves his daughter more than anyone else, and she loves him, but it will take more than love for him to see her through grade school and adolescence and out into the world. Since the movie does not believe this, it has a serious disagreement with most of the audience.\"This seems to ignore the fact that Sam has had Starbucks employees and a woman named Annie help raise Lucy as well! Sam is not alone in caring for his daughter, so it DOES make sense that Sam would be able to care for Lucy.To steer from that subject, the performances is this movie are fantastic. Sean Penn gives a very believable portrayal of a mentally handicapped man. Had he never worked in another movie, you could buy that he was disabled. His acting never comes off as offensive or trying too hard, it's just the right balance to believe Sean Penn is actually Sam.Dakota Fanning playing Lucy is just amazing as well. At just 7 years old, she shows how amazing she is as an actress in this film and in others to come. In fact, she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for this role, and that made her the youngest person to do so!Michelle Pfeiffer also does a fine job as the lawyer, with only The Age Of Innocence and The Prince of Egypt being superior works of hers by my knowledge.I Am Sam also should get acknowledged as one of the few movies to make me cry quite a few times, because it takes a lot for a movie to make me cry. At times the movie can seem a bit saccharine due to this, but that didn't bother me much. If you need a good cry, I Am Sam is a great movie to put on!I could say more about I Am Sam, but it should be clear that this is well worth seeing. It's moving and inspirational, no matter who you are. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen, and you owe it to yourself to be moved by it as well!Note: I apologize for not writing in over a month, I got busy and struggled with knowing what review to write next. I intend to write more reviews soon!",

Come on Michelle, we know that you are a talented actress (Scarface), you can do a better job than that.The story wasn't realistic, and you can see that in many of the scenes in this movie. here's an example: Why does Sean Penn character referee a soccer match, he has a mind set of a seven year old, now tell me what seven year old, or mentally retarded referees a soccer match?Why does the camera move all over the place? What kind of effect does that give? All I know that, in the end of the movie I got sick.The music was ok, but at times it felt like the same songs are playing over and over again.What's up with all of the advertisement? It was seriously obvious, and it made the movie like one big corny commercial for starbucks, pizza hut, 7-11, Nike, and etc.If you only want to see great acting with bad co stars, story, and cinematography, I should watch this movie.

To my astonishment, it was a little girl who turned out to be the star of the series, delivering a performance that any adult would consider the role of a lifetime. So here, in I am Sam, we see Dakota a year earlier, showing she could nail a challenging role. My only objection to the movie is that she wasn't listed more prominently in the credits.Sean Penn delivers a strong performance, but what makes it so interesting is seeing him and Dakota on the screen at the same time interacting, not just cuts back and forth between them. Great performances!Being a big fan of Quantum Leap, I was also delighted to see Brad Silverman again, who played Jimmy LaMotta so wonderfully in four key episodes. I hope he returns to the screen!This is a message film, and the message viewers take away may differ. It's difficult being a parent, and its difficult being a child if you don't have loving parents. I think a loving parent, regardless of IQ, trumps a cold or cruel parent, even if a rich genius. But there's more to the movie than that.For some IMDb reviewers, the movie didn't work; some said it wasn't realistic. Have people forgotten how to watch movies? When you sit down to watch a movie there is a contract between the viewer and the director. You agree to suspend belief, at least for the first 10 minutes or so, and in return the director promises to envelop and entertain you in an alternative universe. If you are not willing to enter this realm of imagination, why are you watching movies?I am Sam succeeds in enveloping you in its universe, and making you care about all of its key characters, including Sam's friends. There's no purely good or bad guys. We can't help but disliking the child welfare cadre, or at least their tactics, but we also realize they have a point. And in the center of the storm, anchoring all the performances, is little Dakota Fanning. But the best thing about I am Sam is its originality. Not all movies that try something different succeed.

If I were to use the spectrum of mentally handicapped movie characters: Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man,\" Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump,\" Billy Bob Thornton in \"Sling Blade,\" Leonardo Di Caprio in \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\" Kevin Bacon in \"Digging to China, or Randy Quaid in \"Of Mice and Men;\" Sean Penn's Sam Dawson would be a Rain Man/Ricky Schroth (Kevin Bacon). He spoke more like Rain Man but had the dexterity with children like Ricky Schroth. Sam was able to, with the aid of his neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest), take care of his daughter for seven years. He made one costly mistake and the ubiquitous department of child welfare services stepped in to take his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning) away from him.To his credit, Sam didn't go down without a fight. He got attorney Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) to represent him pro bono. It wasn't an easy fight and it didn't go exactly the way Sam or Rita planned, but fight they did.\"I Am Sam\" is a touching movie without even trying. How can your heart not be affected by seeing the brilliant and darling Lucy, who is wise beyond her years, enjoying the time with her very simple father? The subject matter alone is enough to extract tears, and it's only amplified by the two stars. Imagine how you felt seeing E.T. being torn away from Elliott.Each side is seemingly fighting for what's best for Lucy and it's no slam dunk. Sam is so honest, pure, and good you want him to win custody of his daughter. Besides, who can bear to see them split apart? But just because something is sad or painful doesn't mean it's any less right. Being a parent is hard for the most astute, most nurturing, most academically accomplished person, so what more for a single father with the aptitude of a seven-year-old? I'd hate to have to make the decision. This movie will tear you up before piecing you back together again, and I'm not mad.",

Let's face it, people who play mentally challenged people win awards.  And the only explanation for some one intelligent, like Penn, accepting a role in a movie that has such a mind numbing script, is that he wants to win an oscar.I wasn't going to bother writing anything on this movie until I read how a lot of people were actually falling for all this.  Although I don't understand it, I accept the fact that Julia Roberts and Adam Sandler movies make lots of money.  But I can't let something like this go unchecked.  Was the acting good?  Absolutely.  Even the kid was amazing.  But I'm expecting to see a picture of Sean Penn as Sam on a macaroni and cheese box because this movie is the cheesiest.We've got the evil social services people trying to take away Sam's daughter.  Booooooo.  Why is it, that certain professions are always portrayed as the bad guys, unless they happen to be a main character? Lawyers, cops, social workers, accountants and many more jobs are always evil people unless the movie is about them.We've got a high priced/stressed out/fast talking/workaholic lawyer who just might have her life turned around by helping out Sam.

Yes it was made quite well.  I liked the use of the steady-cam.  But the script was transparent and self-important.  It's a movie that's filled with scenes that try and make you cry.  That's the real problem, it's a collection of scenes designed to push you over the edge.

People might defend it by saying that they portray the handicapped in a favorable manner, which is partly true in comparison to some of the other characters, but there is no getting around the fact that the movie makes jokes about mentally retarded people. The movie makers want the viewers to laugh when they see a retarded person slap himself in the chest or say something stupid or do something stupid, and that is wrong on so man different levels. I am not a \"worried mother\". I am a 16 year old boy, who this movie is targeted to and even I can see how mean spirited it is. The makers think they can make jokes about retarded people, claim it was in good fun and think they can get away with it. Wrong. But, even once you look beyond this despicable aspect, the movie still isn't funny. There are a few small good jokes they make, but that is the extent to which this movie has any enjoyable aspects. Avoid at all costs.",

Sean Penns character, Sam, is about 10 times more animated then Raymond Babbit from Rain Man. These are two totally different characters.  It's a lame thing that because there is one very very memorable character that any other acting roles in the same fashion will always be compared to that role.  I just cant believe the references from the past few comments because these two characters are so different, only similar in having a mental disability.  If you are going to comment then know what you are saying.  Its a pitty that people have obviously gone into this movie thinking that they were going to get a Rain Man performance, and that is where the problem lies.  People making this reference are saying that Sam could not raise this child.  Well, Sam could, Raymond Babbit cannot even raise himself.  So there, take Sam, and S E P O R A T E him from Rain Man.  No more Rain Man references to this movie.  Two Totally different movies.  Next we will see Tron and Matrix grouped together or Animal Farm and Babe.",

Sean Penn was Oscar-nominated for his role as Sam, a mentally retarded father who hires a savvy lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to represent him in a custody trial involving his daughter (Dakota Fanning).The courts think Sam isn't fit to be a father due to his mental limitations, but Sam feels otherwise. As Pfeiffer begins representing Sam she realizes he is a good father and feels an emotional attachment to the case that she hasn't experienced when dealing with criminals and the sort.This film came out and received generally negative reviews in 2001, which I was surprised at considering it's an enjoyable movie. The performances are admittedly much stronger than the actual film (which has kind of been done in the past) - Penn deserved his Oscar nom and Pfeiffer is strong and perfect for the role of a lawyer.If you're a fan of the actors you should watch this, but if you don't like Penn or Pfeiffer you should be more reluctant since it's basically a performance film.",

The fact that he was nominated for this performance is a sign that there is still little justice with Oscar.There was a point in the movie where had it ended, I might have been able to stomach the film as a whole, but instead, we have another 30 minutes to make things \"right\" again. I'm sorry, but the situation depicted is not going to have a resolution that makes everybody happy. I am willing to suspend disbelief at times, but not over a bottomless pit of absurdity.The one thing that I thought would be cool was The Beatles angle, especially from a soundtrack aspect, but I was wrong there, too. Some of the cover versions of the Fab Four's songs were OK, but some of them sounded about as good as that annoying version of \"Taxman\" played on those H&R Block commercials.

And Sean Penn, as Sam, makes a completely lovable and convincing dad. It's so heartwrenching and heartwarming, it's a joy. And it adds one extra element, a central one--Sam is mentally retarded. And Penn plays Sam, to my sense of it, brilliantly. Dakota Fanning is the archetypal sweet kid, too, so there we go.I wish that was the whole story. The movie is troubled by how it's made. It pushes comic moments too hard and sentimental ones with too much calculation. And any number of elements can be ticked off that are more than just distractions. For one, there is a steady stream of improbable events--just slightly improbable, but it's hard to keep looking the other way at how, say, the foster care system really would work, and so on. Michelle Pfeiffer, for her part, is offkey as a snotty rich lawyer forced to come to Sam's aid. There's the fact Sam is far too alone with his troubles, without family, without any social support at all (not counting his tight group of friends, more on that later). There is also an odd tone throughout, partly glib and partly probing, and partly very weepy sentimental. It's an odd mix. The tale also too long by half an hour at least.But when it works, if you can get past the manipulations, it works great. I found myself crying, I'm not sure why, maybe with empathy, or just sadness at the state of an individual's world. I even came to see the obvious charms of Sam's disabled friends were also metaphors for the range of problems we all face. The neighbor Dianne Wiest has a brief but affecting role. Likewise, Mary Steenburgen as brief witness. And then there is the metaphor (again) of the Beatles, all in cover versions, known in detail by Sam. The group, the real Beatles, really do become a lens on this father/daughter dilemma, and the meaning of life. I love this movie for what it does right. It's beyond merely flawed, but it has something very beautiful bubbling between all the flaws.",

            "content": "*some spoilers*Jessie Nelson directed a movie of extraordinary warmth and beauty. She has a good eye for elegant shots and editing. But what stirred me the most were the stunning performances by Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning.Most detractors of that movie considered it too manipulative and simplistic. Many people think the manipulation starts with Sean Penn playing a disabled person because he's intent on winning an Oscar. Give him a  break! So many other actors have played villains or \"serious roles\" before. You could reproach them for the same. And should disabled characters be banned from movies? That's preposterous! Some say playing a disabled person is a snap. Maybe it is but playing one as convincingly as Sean is amazing! So is it really simplistic, one-sided and manipulative? It's definitely not: It doesn't simply state \"all you need is love\" is Lucy IS taken away from him, isn't she? So in a one-sided movie she would have never been taken away from him as nobody would be questioning Sam's mental fitness. We do agree on some misgivings of the social workers. Thus, the movie does not fall into the trap of being too one-sided. It does raise serious issues regarding Sam's mental capabilities. Can he raise a child? Is he intelligent enough to see his daughter through adolescence? But then again: How many \"intelligent\" people fail being good parents? How many kids wound up doing drugs despite having intelligent parents? This is the first trap \"I am Sam\" doesn't fall into. The other trap is describing the social workers and the foster parents as callous who want to see Sam suffer. But they are not. Hence the movie really focusses on the issue of Sam's ability to look after his daughter. Even the ending gets it right(DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!): We do not really get to know how the trial has ended. They probably agreed on a compromise, i.e. Lucy can stay with Sam under the stipulation that Randy, Lucy's foster mom, will be overseeing Sam and Lucy since we do get to see them all together happily reunited in the end. And what a wonderful final shot we get to see! Well done, Jessie! All in all \"I am Sam\" is an elegantly shot and engrossing drama with some hilarious bits. It never gets too one-sided nor does it manipulate the viewer more than any other good movie. If you're not a cynic, you're gonna adore Sam and Lucy and the entire movie! Quite stirring. 9/10",

Im glad you all were touched and LOVED the movie, but I felt it was Hollywood manipulative clap-trap at it's worst. I found it VERY condescending to the mentally disabled. Oh, Rita the high-paid lawyer with her cel phone and Porsche needs to be taught what's important by the mentally handicapped guy. Wow! The symbolism of the \"paper\" wall being torn down so she can TELL HIM (and the audience) everything that has just happened for the past two hours. It's like the filmmakers didn't trust the I.Q. of the audience either so they always nudged you and pointedthings out to you, just in case you were \"slow\" and weren't getting the message. Not sure what to feel here, well, we have some bad Beatles covers all cued up with a lyric here that will TELL you how to feel right now. Sheesh!!! Oh, the cynical, hard-working career woman needs a mentally retarded guy to TEACH her to be a better parent! There wasnt a subtle bone in this film's body - and then they have the NERVE to mention Kramer v.s. Kramer a few times and then they have a cop-out ending just like that film. (At least in Kramer - they let Hoffman lose in court and THEN Streep's character totally sells  herself out and hands the kid back over just so they could have a weepy, tacked-on happy ending.) But in this, they dont even have the judge make a decision - god forbid real life and real law interfere with this fairy tale, let's just have the Laura Dern character hand the kid back to Sean Penn - here ya go, take her, that way we dont have to have any more conflict or show the reality of the court system dealing with such a case. Time for the movie to end, time for a happy ending, cue up the Beatles music and cry. And I am huge fan of Penn's work in the past (Bad Boys, Fast Times, Taps,Racing With the Moon and of course, Dead Man Walking)but he was so inconsistent here - there were times when he had such intelligence in his eyes and then other scenes where he had \"found\" the look - the look that Leonardo was so brilliantly able to create during ALL of Gilbert Grape. Look, it's a hard thing to play for an actor. Mentally retarded, blindness - more actors fail than succeed. Plus, the voice Penn decided to use was so Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\". Now - the little girl, Dakota Fanning was stunning. Not a false move. She steals the movie. And yes, of course, there are touching scenes - you CANT do a film about a parent losing a child in a custody battle without hitting on some real emotional moments - but the film is more interested in fake tears and easy endings than reality. The actual REALITY of a retarded man trying to raise a child. Does he love her? Of course he does. That's not the point. The point was, as the court said, what is best for the kid. But the film seemed more interested in dealing with black and white, Penn- good, Courtroom people - bad!!! Please.",

I only found flaw with one scene where I wasn't really convinced by Michelle Pfeiffer's crying.  Most incredible, was that I never once saw the 'bad-boy' Sean Penn image peak through in his portrayal of the mentally diminished Sam.  I was afraid that I was going to see another Dustin Hoffman 'Rain Man', but Penn's protrayal was completely different, and actually more intriguing.  I Am Sam is a wonderful alternative to the gritty, depressing, ultra-reality style of many films of recent release.

There are some scenes where Pfeiffer and Penn just absolutely steal the show with their performance and you are completely memorized by them, that's what makes this film so good. And Dakota Fanning is very impressive for her age here, she handles dramatic heavy scenes very well and that's probably why she has gone on to continue a successful Hollywood career. The writing is good overall, I will say that the script isn't the strongest thing in the world but it is good. I think the screenplay and the execution of the plot takes a little bit of a backseat to the magnificent performances given. But that doesn't mean that the screenplay is weak, because it's not.

I have great empathy for films about challenged people coming to terms with their situations but, when a writer and director play fully on the viewers emotionalism it reduces the work to mere manipulation. If you want to see what it looks like when done better try finding \"Charly\" '68 ~ where Cliff Robertson deservedly won the academy award for his fine interpretation - along with a script offering more depth. While Sean Penn can be OK, he can often be painful - here, he is OK but the material is simply unbelievable.It's also hard to believe that Cinematographer Elliot Davis allowed his name to be left on the credits. There are sections where the sloppy, single hand held camera shots rival some of the worst to be seen in a 'mainstream' movie - the jerky movements and annoyingly bad use of the zoom lens made me feel so nauseous that watching to the end became a complete struggle. Judging from the blatant product placement throughout - it looks like the producers may have ended up with a comparatively small financial outlay. What could and should have been a warm, intelligent character study has been given a somewhat sentimentalized, if not patronizing, how-not-to- do-it Hollywood treatment - while also perhaps lacking a degree of genuine integrity. The end result looks like a let's try playing it to the hilt and see if any awards might just get handed out. And predictably some were - but not quite what was hoped for.Michelle Pfeiffer at times looks a little embarrassed with her lines as well as certain situations in her role as a successful high priced lawyer and, can we truly believe this woman doesn't have anyone knocking on her door? - perhaps this situation might have played more convincingly if the always reliable Laura Dern role was reversed. While young Dakota Fanning is marvelous her lines are far too mature for her cute six year old. Considering what it might have been with better handling this generally comes over as a bit of a contrivance. Those looking for a feel good show who don't necessarily want to think too much about their movies will enjoy it - others could possibly be more than a little disappointed.

Maybe they are, maybe they are not disabled in real life but my point here is that Penn is trying so hard, yes, overacting, it's almost as if he's gonna split his pants or something. If the friends are actors too, their acting disabled flows smoothly and natural unlike Penn's.As far as playing a mentally disabled person, Penn don't hold a candle compared to Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man (1988) or Leonardo diCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993).This is also a movie about a custody battle. Kramer vs Kramer (father fighting for custody) is still the ultimate custody battle movie followed by Hollow Reed (gay father fighting for custody). Oddly enough, when the movie ended I still wasn't convinced that Sam having custody of his daughter was the best solution...",

OK, enough camp.I loved this movie, the second half being twice as powerful as the first. That being said, I have grown to respect an actor I used to despise (Penn). He studied and portrayed the most dynamic disabled person I have ever seen on screen. Having grown up with twin brothers who were mentally disabled, I felt in a superior position to make judgment over the treatment of the characters, the development of the story and the eventual direction of the plot. All were superb.If I had one pick or pan, I didn't think Michelle Pfeiffer was the best choice. She did get the rhythm of the character but left me a little empty.Brilliant writing and direction, camera work top notch. I gave this a 9.",

Feeling like a failure, an undeserving guardian, and a maniac who constantly yells is so common. This movie sheds the light on the subject of how we interact with disabled people, and the way to do it is not by having pity or isolating the character with special focus; Sam lives in us, among us, and with us. 'It takes a while village to raise a child', and the film is special because Sam is the hub for interaction with people, getting help for Lucy and helping others as well.I also love the camera work. The camera does not hold steady ad still like typical movies. It subtly moves, spins, or closes up suddenly, representing confused and turbulent mindset of Sam. When a character presents genuine feelings deep inside the heart, it closes up the face so the audience can enjoy the actors' ability to bring emotions on the screen. The color subtly changes to express atmosphere. When Sam is desperate and hopeless plus the court scene, the color is blue, cold color. However, when Sam is with Lucy, Rita, or friends, it is yellowish or orange-ish or gold-ish, very warm like their realtionship.",

Sean Penn is so earnest, forthright, and full of wisdom in this film, that we were in hysterics because he really does look and sound like a low IQ, totally handicapped person. But he is deep, perceptive and spews the lines equaling about 110 or 120 IQ. To be cynical about it, though the ACLU has fought for the criminally and legally insane to roam the streets many times and won over and over, the truth is that nothing but disaster has resulted in being this PC.",

Even the Beatles' songs (all remakes) are cued up at the exact right time with a lyric appropriately fitting the sappy situation at hand.  And the product placements.  This thing doesn't even try to be subtle with the way the products are placed.  Half the conversations center around Starbucks or Pizza Hut or Payless Shoes, or take place in one of those, or many other assorted corporate facilities.  Now that I've slammed this film sufficiently enough, I'll admit that the acting is okay (although I couldn't decide if Sean Penn was playing a retarded man or playing Dustin Hoffman playing an Autistic Savant), and there are a few funny parts.  It's not worth seeing at the theater, or even worth renting, but if it's on TV some night, well, it still really isn't that worth it.

            "content": "I can understand why people would love \"I Am Sam\", and I can just as easily understand why people would hate it. It's easy to call the film manipulative and cheesy and predictable...it most certainly is. However, I loved this film, and I can assure you that I did NOT expect to. I'm not sure what exactly I did expect, but I went into this movie fearing the worst; after the wildly mixed reviews, and having nearly overdosed on Cinema Cheese in the terribly disappointing 'The Majestic', I was a bit leery of this film. Much to my surprise, I came out of the theater feeling supremely satisfied.\nThe film poses its audience a rather difficult question: should a mentally retarded man be allowed to raise a young child, even if he is the biological father? It's bound to leave its audience sharply divided, and this is part of the reason that it could likely spark a love-hate reaction in viewers. I won't bother discussing my views on this subject, I'll leave that up to you. But I will say that the movie made me think, and it made me reassess the values I cherish in life and love. IT goes without saying that any discussion of this film begins and ends with Sean Penn's knockout performance. While I do agree with some fellow IMDB users and a certain film critic that playing mentally retarded individuals is usually just a ploy for Oscar consideration, there's no getting around the fact that \"I Am Sam\" underlines the rationale that Sean Penn is, indeed, the greatest acting talent of his generation. His character may be seemingly \"simple minded\", but his trademark raw emotion is conveyed so beautifully that he adds a whole other dimension to the character that could not possibly have been on paper. And as for Michelle Pfeiffer...she's simply wonderful, as always. She's always boasted the sort of fascinating screen presence that recalls the ladies of Hollywood's Golden Age, but in recent years she's become more comfortable than ever onscreen. She exudes so much charisma and finesse that she makes acting look like the easiest job in the world, all the while bringing about her own personal touch to the character. Many critics have called this one of her best roles, and I would have to agree. However, this is also the biggest fault in the film. Her screen time is surprisingly a LOT less than one would expect going in, and her character is never as fully developed as she should be. I also wish the movie would have focused more on her relationship to Sam. At one point in the film there seems to be a very clear hint of romance in this interaction, but it never amounts to anything. Perhaps it was intended to be conveyed ever so subtly, or perhaps the studio was too afraid of how audiences would react to a possible romance between a hot shot lawyer and a retarded man. Either way, I think that this sort of edginess would have heightended the emotional impact of the film.\n\"I Am Sam\" is not a perfect film by any stretch, but it's so incredibly good hearted and truly riveting that I don't see the need to pick apart its shortcomings. It's a worthy film to view, and regardless of whether your reaction to the film is negative or positive, it will surely be a potent response. And in this age of instantly forgettable films, that is a worthy accomplishment in itself. My Grade: B+NOTE: It's interesting to point out that this film, released in 2001, is often rather similar to a certain film released in 2000....The Next Best Thing, which starred Penn's ex-wife, Madonna. Both films consciously reference the classic Kramer vs. Kramer in depicting a father's struggle to defy societal prejudice in an attempt to gain custody of his child. It's not a particularly relevant detail, but in a year that began with films directed by Penn and Guy Ritchie (Madonna's husband) being released in America the very same weekend, I'd say it's worth pointing out.",

            "content": "I Am Sam is brilliant. I thought this was going to be a comedy but it ended up being one of the best tear jerker's I have ever seen. It has a beautiful concept of a struggling father. Sam (Sean Penn) has a daughter called Lucy Diamond Dawson (Dakota Fanning) and they like to read and go to the park together and they both love IHOP. Sounds nice right? The problem with this is that Sam has learning difficulties (I think it's autism) and when his daughter reaches the age of 7 she will have a higher mental age than her dad. The government believe it's best to take Lucy away from Sam (I know!) and Sam doesn't know what's happening. He hires a lawyer called Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is very cold-hearted. Sam shows her what kindness is (I'm not going to spoil how) and she helps him.Even with his disabilities he still fights for her which is very respectful. The way the camera pan around in this film makes it look like a documentary and adds to the tension. All of the characters are really believable. Sean Penn is brilliant because he portrays a disabled well but doesn't take the Micky. Dakota Fanning is amazing even though it is only her second film and she was only 6 yet she steals the show. Michelle Pfeiffer was very good but wasn't too believable in the courtroom. Lucy's foster mother wasn't believable (I know because i'm fostered) but I enjoyed it.Overall the film is unmissable and I'd recommend anyone who doesn't like to point and laugh at other people's misfortunes. If you are going to watch this movie for cheap laughs at disabled people watch it and it will change your mind about them in a heartbeat.",

            "content": "Just from reading the plot, I think it's fair to say that that there is a high chance that this movie could be a simple sob story that goes for the cliche in order to get you to cry. That NEVER happens in this film. Every emotion, although sometimes gut wrenching, is elicited genuinely from the actors and the story. I should also mention that I grew up next door to a mentally challenged neighbor, so I have had experience with the subject. Although Sam is clearly at the upper end of the spectrum in terms of mental deficiency, Penn nails the role and I think it's one of the best performances of his life. Playing the role of a retarded person is not easy. It's not just a matter of talking funny, or acting stupid - Penn clearly illustrates that fact. Not to mention that he's able to hold the screen acting opposite a child and 5 dogs!In conjunction with Penn's performance, the writing is truly incredible. It's realistic and doesn't portray any of the characters as caricatures of themselves. Richard Schiff, for example, could have been portrayed as simply \"the bad guy\" in his role as Turner, State's Attorney. It would have been an easy choice for the writer's to make and unfortunately, it's a choice that many movies tend to make. Instead, Turner is portrayed as someone doing his job and looking out for the best interests of the child. Although it's one of the more minor roles of the film, the fact that none of characters were \"throw away\" just goes to how how well the script was written.One other element that is often overlooked is the cinematography. Elliot Davis really gives this movie a unique style and feel in his photography and actually plays a role in telling the story. As the color pallets change for the perspective it makes it easier to tell where the perspective has changed as well. One of my favorite scenes involves the Sam in the courtroom and Davis' use of 4 cameras to capture the scene coupled with Richard Chew's editing makes that scene so compelling.Lastly, I have to mention the performances given by the lead women in the cast. Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison, gives one of her best performances in her career. The arc that she is able to take her character is not easy. She goes from being someone who has very little in the way of redeeming qualities to someone you can deeply care for. She really stretched herself in this role and took some chances that pay off in spades. And last, but not least, Dakota Fanning plays Sam's daughter Lucy. I haven't seen Dakota in any other films yet, but now I want to. Although playing a child, when you're a child isn't much of a stretch, having to play a child that understands the mentally challenged is. The script gives her everything she needs for the scene, but Dakota has to deliver it and she does. Her talent is well beyond her years and the emotion she is able to convey through her eyes and in her reactions to other characters is truly impressive. Her role could have been the weak link that brought the movie to a much lower level, but she proved to be one of it's anchors.Make no mistake about it, this is a tear jerker, but in the best sense of the word. It's an honest look at a unique situation that shows us many facets and pulls no punches.",

What is a little surprising is that Michelle Pfeiffer was overlooked. This is by far the best performance, save for her turn as Catwoman, that I have seen her in.Otherwise, I can't really say that I saw something out of the ordinary and I was a little disappointed by the slightly punctured narrative. Not that it's confusing, but I just thought that I would see both sides to the argument more clearly. The other side, is hardly represented. It's all from the point of view of Pfeiffer and Penn. The other side is generally understanding and even helpful and there isn't that underlying threat of unpredictability (where will it all end?) that this kind of film needs.One little side-note. Remember Robert Downey Jr.'s comment on Sean Penn's performance in Tropic Thunder: \"Go full retard and lose the Oscar\". Sam is a much too clever character here to be fully retarded.",

Sometimes it seems that there isn't an actor at all, it's just a person being filmed, not a person acting. This is the case with Sean Penn in I Am Sam.I Am Sam follows a mentally handicapped man named Sam Dawson (Penn) who tries to keep custody of his child Lucy Diamond(Dakota Fanning), named after one of Sam's favorite Beatles' songs. Sam has been a good single father to Lucy since she was born. They do everything together like reading one of Sam's favorite books Green Eggs and Ham. With the help of those around him like Annie Cassell (Diane Wiest), Sam raises Lucy in a very loving environment. When Lucy turns seven and starts to realize what is wrong with her daddy, she becomes a little concerned that she will get too smart for him. Sam doesn't know what is going on due to his handicap until it is too late. At her birthday party, she is taken away from social services and the two are split apart.Sam needs the help of a good lawyer and finds one in the yellow pages thanks to one of his buddies. He goes to see Rita Harrison (Michelle Phiffer), a lawyer who never loses who ends up taking the case pro bono so the office doesn't think she does this all for money. The two of them seem to be on two separate pages when it comes to life. Sam feels like everyone is against him, including Rita. All Rita wants is to win the case and win her family back. They both learn a lot about each other and about life in general as the case goes on.Penn is outstanding in this role, which got him an Oscar nomination. This movie really hits home giving the viewer a lot to enjoy. Penn is a character that you like and feel bad for all at the same time (much like Forrest Gump). Penn, an Oscar-winning actor, gives another one of his great performances showing how a dedicated actor can really make or break a movie. Young Dakota Fanning is also one to be reckoned with. This little actress has been appearing in movies left and right as of late and she means business. Only seven years old in I Am Sam and she gives a performance that is better than some actresses can give in a life time. Phiffer also does a fantastic job as the never give up lawyer. Her transformation in this movie really shows a lot of character.I Am Sam is a real tearjerker. Penn makes you believe that there is still some good left in this world. For those looking for a feel good movie, this is the one for you. I Am Sam will find its way into your heart because just like the Beatles' song says, \"All you need is love...\", and that's just what Sam shows us.",

For me this was a very annoying movie to watch.Even though Sean Penn is good in his role his character is far from a believable one. The way his characters acts and time and says some things makes his character totally unbelievable and perhaps a bit over-the-top at times. Really a horrible portrayal and perhaps at times even offensive portrayal of a mentally disabled person. There also is some totally misplaced humor in the movie with Sean Penn's character mentally disabled friends, which I found to be totally unnecessary. Thankfully there also still are some good character portrayals in the movie by Michelle Pfeiffer, Dakota Fanning, Dianne Wiest and Laura Dern.The movie doesn't only over-dramatize it also wants to be overly artistic at times. The camera-positions and style of editing are at times completely pointless. The camera-work in general is also too intense for a movie like this one. The intense camera-work by Elliot Davis worked for a kind of movie like \"Thirteen\" but is completely out of place in a drama movie like this one. I still like his style of lighting for this movie though.Another thing that annoyed me was the musical score by John Powell. The score was incredibly simple and had no beauty or what so ever in it. In fact it truly annoyed me at times and distracted from what was happening on the screen (not that much interesting or new was happening on it though).The movie is way too bittersweet. The movie has some totally unbelievable and over-the-top sweet and moralistic moments in it. The movie its intentions were good but it simply tries too hard to be emotional and dramatic in almost every aspect. The ending was also totally lame and left an incredibly bad aftertaste and was completely unsatisfying. Why so many people fall for this annoying over-dramatized movie really puzzles me.With currently a 7.2 rating, this movie is terribly overrated here on IMDb.com.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

How many times have we seen actors cooing over portrayals of \"disadvantaged\" people? Lets face it, for many actors, playing a retarded person does not require much effort.The biggest and immediately obvious gaping hole in this story is that Sam is fighting for custody of his 7-year old daughter. Why now? Why was he left to bring her up alone for 7 years? She seems pretty much the perfect child so he can't have been a bad parent for 7 years. But how does a single man with severe learning difficulties get to bring up a baby and apparently not register on any welfare radar for 7 years? It is truly absurd.Then of course there's the question of Penn's performance. Personally I think it demonstrates very little understanding of the issues, and occasionally borders on mocking. It is not a realistic portrayal, but one moulded to suit the script, which also severely lacks credibility.Fanning and Pfeiffer however are on a different level. Fanning was a natural child performer who never looked like she was acting (until she was about 12 anyway) and there are few more gifted. Pfeiffer gets to grips with her role and just about errs on the side of non-hamming, but she certainly steals almost every scene she's in.The film ends too suddenly at a point where even this cynical viewer was getting drawn in, thus leaving another gaping hole. So we have a hole, a middle and a hole. And the middle is mushy.",

I Am Sam was the first movie that focused on what a person with a severe disability could do rather than couldn't.  I thought the acting, especially by Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning was superb. The writing was amazing, and really captured the essense of people dealing with Autistic tendencies.  I was especially moved by the scene toward the end between Laura Dern and Sean Penn.  I left the theater feeling emotionally exhausted, but pleased.  If there was one thing lacking in the film, it was the lack of explanation of Diane Wiest's character's situation. I wish they had gone into a bit more detail of her issues.  Overall a fabulous film, incredible acting, fantastic writing, and a credit to people with disabilities everywhere.

'I am Sam' has been frequently criticised for being emotionally manipulative.  I wouldn't disagree, but consider this can only be the result of the viewer becoming so powerfully drawn to all the characters that they really care what happens to them.Sean Penn is excellent and totally convincing in the role of Sam which is so different to his norm and demonstrates again his great skill. Michelle Pfeiffer played the change in Rita's character throughout the film very well too and she continues to look fantastic.But the star of this film has to be the amazingly talented and beautiful Dakota Fanning as Lucy.  Her acting is so natural, with body language and facial expressions true for every emotion and situation.  She was there to be loved and carried it off superbly.  Not once did she look lost amongst this celebrated company, incredible considering they were all producing near career best performances themselves.*** Possible spoilers ***Sure, there were unbelievable elements to the story, the most serious of which was the reason for Sam's arrest.  And, after Lucy had her first night time 'escape' to visit her father, endangering herself by crossing roads and climbing ladders, are we really to believe she was allowed to repeat the exercise many more times!  However, many of the events causing criticism I consider to have been misunderstood by the critics.  The film is often ambiguous about certain situations or simply lacking in information.  How was Sam able to cope with Lucy during her first seven years?  The film makes no statement that he did it on his own so why should the viewer believe this to be the case.  Many critics appear to believe that the final uplifting scene of the film is also unrealistic.  There would be no way in reality that Sam would regain full custody of Lucy, however much we would wish it to happen.  But where in that scene does it suggest that he has?  Around the football field we see all the major players of a wonderful support network for Sam and Lucy.  Any one of them might have day to day care of Lucy, perhaps allowing Sam unlimited access.  We don't know, and I think it is to the film's credit that it allows the viewer to imagine their own ending.*** End of spoilers ***The superb music is very appropriate with individual songs chosen carefully to complement the screen action. There are two soundtrack albums available, one with all the Beatles cover songs and the other with John Powell's incidental music.  Both are very worthwhile and recommended.In conclusion, a remarkable film, worth watching even if only to see and admire the true art of acting.  It contains no sex or violence and the two hour plus running time passes very quickly.This would be my current choice for a Desert Island DVD, which incidentally is also excellent with many high quality extras adding to the appreciation of 'I am Sam'.  10+/10.",

I got sucked right in by his performance and had to keep reminding myself that Penn is not only perfectly normal but probably highly intelligent as well. Dakota Fanning is charming, precocious and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer is always a treat and does not disappoint here. Her transformation from cold, calculating and cynical lawyer with a 'perfect' life to someone warmer, vulnerable and with a less than perfect life, is almost as important a sub-plot as the main story of Sam's struggle to keep his beloved daughter.The premise of the movie is nothing new, but I don't think I've ever seen such delicate and inspired handling of a situation that could so easily have descended into a maudlin melodrama, given its potential for pain and heartache. Plenty of humour and the energetic pacing keep things from being weighed down.The ending is not unexpected, but I really couldn't have seen it going any other way. Definitely recommended for the all around strong performances. Dianne Wiest deserves special mention for her delightful and memorable supporting role.I have a small confession; I gave the movie an extra star because I am a HUGE Beatles fan ;) Enjoy!!",

It is so incredibly funny, then so incredibly sad. It leaves you feeling good, but upset at the same time. You get so connected to Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning's characters in the end that it is very difficult to abstain from emotion. VERY difficult.Scenes that really got me: The scene where Sam and Lucy go to a different restaurant and Sam can't handle the change in routine...The answering machine scene!!The scene where Lucy sneaks out to go be with her dad.Those are just a few that brought tears of sadness and joy to my eyes.

Before going into that, I'll go out on a limb here and say that the mental defects were incidental to the plot, the real issue was how much love Sam (Penn's characte) has for his daughter, Lucy (played by Dakota Fanning). These performances are masterful, Penn really departs from his trouble maker persona in so many of his earlier movies and shows depth that I really didn't expect from him.  This is a breakthrough movie for him, and shows a range far exceeding my expectations Dakota Fanning gives a remarkable performance (I want to see her in other roles).  I'm not very  familiar with the behaviors of mildly autistic/retarded people, but I did find the Sam character believable.  I think part of the issue is the same phenomena as Forrest Gump, that is the genius of the actor comes through, so you have a \"brilliant idiot\"  As the father of a young daughter, I could relate.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character was O.K. but not really central to the plot (her acting was O.K. I guess, but not great).  My wife found the intrusive nature of the way the social workers were portrayed compelling. Other review have compared this movie to Rain Man and Kramer vs. Kramer.  I thought this movie was more powerful than Rain Man (which was also good) but I have not seek Kramer vs. Kramer so I cannot make that comparison.I gave the story a 9/10, but if your not a parent or don't like emotional movies you might give it a lower rating.",

What makes this a great film is the story and Sean Penn's and Michelle Pffiefers performances. You believe Sean Penn really is autistic and has a disability. You care for him because he shows the audience his frustration and confusion of living in a world so complex and having the intelligence of a 7 year old.  He struggles to raise his daughter and to succeed at his job at starbucks. Michelle Pffiefers character is also incredible. She is a lawyer with a seemingly perfect life and wonderful career,but beneath the surface there is the pain and frustration to keep her marriage afloat and win the affection of her son. She too learns to cope, while helping Sean's character along the way.\nI am sorry if I gave too much away but I need to express myself in detail.

It's classified as a drama, so you should come to expect a little sappiness. Otherwise, maybe you should check out a different genre.The chemistry between Sean Penn and Lucy is good. Both their characters are likable, esp Lucy's.

            "content": "I Am Sam is one of those overly-sappy, over-the-top dramas. It is one of those very sad movies that are out there for the sole purpose of making you cry. Not only did I not cry (I didn't laugh by any means), but I was confused as there are many instances that just simply come out of the blue and are not fully explained. The acting is fantastic, but the plot is low and weak.In one of the best roles in his illustrious career, Sean Penn plays mentally challenged Sam Dawson. He makes his living working at Starbucks and has an entourage of four other men at his intellect. There is one scene where Sam is buying shoes for his daughter, Lucy (Fanning) and is a little bit short on bread, so his friends each pitch in some money to help Sam pay. I love that scene, as it is cute and funny, yet cheesy in a good way. I wish that more scenes were like that.Sam lives in a nice apartment with his daughter whom he loves more than anything. It never fully states how Sam had Lucy because he is a single father with a very low IQ. It briefly mentions that he knocked up a homeless girl and he does have run-ins with the law about solicitation, so I figured that he knocked up a hooker. It just never made sense to me that that would happen. Sam is too innocent to just be fooling around with just anybody. I guess it is possible, I just highly doubt it.We do see Sam and Lucy having good times together as well as Sam and his buddies having fun. Only, those bits are very brief. Most of the early scenes show Sam embarrassing himself and Lucy, and having run-ins with the law. I know that Sam is mentally challenged, but he embarrasses Lucy and himself is some bits that are unpleasant. Like there's one scene where he has a tantrum at a restaurant because they don't have his favourite breakfast. I really felt embarrassed for Lucy. Then there is the scene where the movie takes off and the plot fully begins. Sam is arrested a Lucy's birthday party and is sent to live in foster care as Sam loses custody. I always hated that scene because the cops show up just out of the blue to arrest Sam on past things that have been dropped like solicitation. Would they really just arrest a mentally challenged man like that even if they had a warrant? That scene never clicked for me. Sam decides to fight for custody as he hires an expert family lawyer (Pfieffer) who actually is laughable. She is the stereotypical and over-the-top, paranoid, workaholic mother. She does do a fine job of acting, but her character is often funny. The ending is confusing to some, but its all how you interpret it.I have always been on the fence about the general premise. Sam has the mental capacity of a 7- year-old and Lucy is holding back as she herself is 7. I know that Sam is loving and caring and patient, but he can't take care of himself. He can't teach Lucy the facts of life or guide her. Lucy would be the one taking care of Sam when she's like 10. No child should be a parent at such a young age. Her foster family has regular parents and a mother figure the Lucy needs. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the whole movie itself has always made me question things.I have experience with mentally challenged people, I found this movie to be a little bit of a mockery. The regular people are painted as even worse off than Sam in terms of intellect. Sean Penn does a dynamite portrayal and the acting in general is good, but the movie is too sad, unrealistic, unclear, and sometimes insulting.1.5/4",

About ten minutes in, the first tear popped out of my eye, and by the end I was a wreck. Sometimes I will cry a little at the end of the movie, but never the whole way through like I did with this film. At the same time, it's not a schmaltzy film - it walks a very fine line in that regard, and there were perhaps one or two moments in the whole movie where I felt it was too OTT - given the subject matter, that's a great achievement, as it could have been really sappy - instead it has a beautiful calm touch to it, which is rarely heavyhanded. There are very funny moments in the film as well, which make it extra-great. Sean Penn is the star of the show - he is just fantastic in the role, and deserves the Oscar hands down. There are moments when you think he is going to get angry, and he doesn't, he's just gentle instead the whole way through- and in that way he's so different in this movie from all the others he's been in. What a great achievement he made here! The music is terrific- both the score, and the stunning revamps of old Beatles tunes. The little girl delivers just a fantastic performance - I think I'd have to say it's her and Sean Penn's chemistry along with the music which really makes this movie as good as it is. Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a satisfactory performance, but it somehow doesn't hit the same high notes as everything else in this show - I knew what her character arc was going to be straight away, and never connected emotionally to her in a big way - although she still looks so stunning. The cinematography in this movie is also quite interesting - it's quite free form, with a lot of moving around, and hand held, and zooming in and out. On one level that's being so done, and it thought it would obstruct the film - but somehow it gels in the most perfect and organic way. It is a great screenplay, and the ending is very satisfying and quite unpredictable in many ways - it says so much about the integrity and heart of this writer/director. I would highly recommend this show to anybody.",

The good guys didn't win here - they lost!  There is _no way_ Sam should have been allowed to raise a child.  Visit yes, raise no - it would have been endangerment from the beginning.Just to make things worse, the movie has 60 minutes of plot spread out over 2 and a half hours.

The story takes him as a father who is able to take care of his daughter (Dakota Fanning who at times seems like the smartest person of the movie) until she turns eight, and then she is taken away from her.  This prompts him to get a probono lawyer (Michelle Pfieffer) who is a workaholic who through the course of the movie will learn the importance of family from her client and all that mumbo jumbo.  For fans of tear-jerkers, it's worth it I guess, but fans of Penn be warned, this is a bit too much to take (which is a sign for non-fans and non-tearjerker moviegoers).

I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend, who happens to be a professional, working with children of this type (autistic, mentally challenged, etc.).  She left the theater in tears, and absolutely loved the movie.  Her opinion of Sean Penn's character was that he was very true to form.  The love you see between him and his daughter, is incredible.What follows might contain some spoiler info, so don't read on if you don't want to know anything about it before going to see this film, which in my own humble opinion, I highly recommend that you do.Every film you see requires that you be willing to partake in something called \"suspension of disbelief,\" which many other posters flaming this film do not appear to understand much about.  They present us with a story, not always the entire life story of the character, but about a specific instance in their lives.  They never said anything about how Sean Penn was raised, not until very deeply into the film, and not much about it.  The agoraphobic neighbor never really says anything about why she can't come over to Sam's apartment to help with the baby, not until much later in the film do you find this out.  I like a little mystery, I like trying to figure things out before they spill the beans, they really don't need to go in to a dispose' of all the why's and wherefore's, just put it into the context of the story and play it well, which I think they have done a superb job of doing. Take it for a simple fact, Sam has a baby with a hooker.  (How?  You must've missed that line in the film, she was \"sleeping\" over at his place, perhaps she felt guilty about taking advantage of the poor guy when he took her in off of the street.)  I don't know how much you know about young children, but most of the ones I've seen have extremely short attention spans - which would explain Sam's loss of reality/lucidity at times.  I've also seen a lot of very intelligent children, children who are much smarter than their age group would indicate, so Sam's daughter's intelligence isn't so surprising after all.  The lawyer came around, though it took some major time for her to do so - the hectic pace of her life and how she had been living it would explain that quite well.  Even the evil witch foster mother comes around at the end, though I would have loved to see that other lawyer get what he deserved for all the pain he put Sam through.So, in my own humble opinion, ignore these flamers and go enjoy this film. It has wonderful characters, great music, and truly manages to touch the heart.  My rating?  A 9, extremely close to 10.",

And I found out the cinematographer also did Out of Sight which was also a great film.

The whole movie consists of a Sam loudly moaning and feeling sorry for himself, and his wide eyed daughter giggling beside him. This reminds me of a homeless man I see in New York who puts a miniature poodle literally on a pedestal as he shakes his beggar bowl, hoping the rich civilians will give him change out of sheer pity and manipulated sympathy. The producers of this film have used the same approach on a much larger scale. If that weren't enough, the film trys to make you feel sorry for everybody else, and the film almost becomes a kindergarten class, where the young pupils whine and cry, whine and cry, until they get what they want. Sean Penn gives by far the worst performance of his career. Not  only is he not a convincing retarded man, his performance is like a bad archetype for an over the top \"retard\" impression that I would expect out of an actor from MAD TV.

Then again, given that they automatically give Oscars to actors who play retarded people, autistic people, AIDs patients, etc, then I guess it's simply the fact that Penn is playing a retarded person that makes his performance so worthy, right? [No, I'm sure not everyone is that dumb] Pfeiffer, IMO, pulls off a better acting performance, given her character is not written to be very likeable.The trouble with movies like this is that they appear to have a good heart, but Hollywood and Company are so clearly afraid that their audience is stupid that any genuine, original, memorable potential in a movie is sucked out. Particularly when it involves those who are considered 'not normal' (quote from movie). They give you the movie title in little letters 'i am sam', they show how orderly and likeable Sam is with the customers, then there's the heart-wrenching scenes of how Sam is left with the baby, and how, like any father in such a situation, he has no idea what to do. This is just in the first five minutes.  Sam's just like you and me, isn't he?But there's something missing, which makes the premise of the entire movie hollow. The first meaty scenes we're given of how Sam reacts in the real world not only give rise to severe doubts that Sam has a case for raising his child, but make one wonder how Sam could possibly have raised this child without coming to the attention of any authorities for seven whole years. That's a large credibility gap.There was also a credibility gap with Rita's transformation - Hollywood conventions mean we know right from the start she will have one, but we are only told of it, rather than shown any evidence. Rita, in actions, does not change one bit that I saw. In particular we needed to see far more of her interactions with Willie.It was a nice touch that the foster mom was played as human rather than as a bitch, which brings to mind another thing I was concerned with. Was it really necessary that every single female character in this shed such copious quantities of tears? I think the social worker was the only one saved from involuntary dehydration.I was also disappointed that, despite Sam's clear obsession with the original Beatles, most, if not all, of the soundtrack was only cover-versions of Beatles songs.Overall, a lot of good effort put in by the actors, gone to waste by a forgettable story.",

Actually, I'm not an emotional person at all, at least I didn't thought that I was, but this movie made me so sad, because I realised a couple of things from it. One of them and also a first one is that, it doesn't really matter how smart are you, or what you have in life, how reach you are....the only thing that really matters is how much love can you give to someone... That's the only think that matters. Thank you Sam for showing me that! Watch this movie, he will change you...change your views...and at the end, make you a better person. I know that it changed me and I'm thankful for that.",

This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over again and not feel bored.

I'd dumped my first Kleenex before the credits were over, and after that, I don't think I spent 5 minutes with my face dry.And yet - this is not a predictable film. Question - you have Michelle Pfeiffer in your movie, and you want it to be a success. Do you wait 45 minutes before showing her (45 minutes filled with geeks that wouldn't even make in into the X-files), and then make her a solid-platinum, probably bulimic, bitch? Because that's kind of like having Julia Roberts in your movie, and then not letting her smile.Or getting Audrey Hepburn (these days it would have to be Cameron Diaz) to play Lyra's Mum in 'His Dark Materials'...Answer - only if the art matters more to you than the box office, or the actor's future career.Watch this, and then spend about 4 hours hugging your nearest and dearest - or nearest and estranged, because that works too.Incidentally, by the end of the film, it's become Pavlovian. Show me 8 orange balloons, or any number of yellow jelly beans, or say the words 'it was pink and yellow, and the pink and yellow melted together and made orange', and I'll start to snivel quite spectacularly... you have been warned!",

Another reason, why would anyone want to take a child away from a parent who loves them more than the entire world itself, just because of a mental handicap. I think it is truly sad anyone would want to do that to another human being. The movie was well worth watching and it also had a few of its funny moments as well. the one quote out of the movie that made me break down more than anything was when \"Sam\" said \"You don't know how it feels when you try and you try and you never get anywhere\" or at least that how i think the quote went. i am really very good at holding my emotions during a sad movie, in fact there were only three movie that i ever really broke down on and they were \"I AM SAM\", \"RADIO\", and \"THE PASSION OF THE Christ\".",

Sean Penn was absolutely amazing and I would be absolutely surprised if he didn't win an award for his remarkable performance. Dakota Fanning is an 8 year old sweetheart. She really played her role well and is also up for an award (wouldn't it be great to see a youngster get an award?). Michelle Pfeiffer also played her particular role as the lawyer really well. The co-cast including the likes of Laura Dern and Dianne Wiest also played magnificent roles. Whilst the movie's story may seem quite sad and depressing, let me assure you its not. The story is about a retarted father whose daughter absolutely adores him.The social service feel that Sam in incapable of taking care of Lucy now that she is older and becoming smarter than Sam himself. Yes I do agree that this seems quite depressing but give him a hot shot lawyer like Pfeiffer and great friends such as Dianne Wiest and his retarted friends (who might I add were also amazing) and trust me, you will have a movie that will stick with you for the rest of your life.Overall an amazing film.

This movie showed the main character, Sean Penn, being overwhelmed.  The best scene for me involved the shopping for diapers. Penn is trying to decide what to buy and their are too many choices. The camera is showing the shelves and Penn swirling round and round.  What made this show work for me was the show had this mentally handicapped man being stuck with his daughter and the interference from people who had no clue as to what mentally handicapped people might be capable.  So many people have no clue that the mentally handicapped people have or want sexual relations and some do bear children.  And believe it or not, parents and siblings actually love their mentally handicapped child or sibling.  What I would say about my brother is that he is 100% forgiving for the horrible things that have happened in his life and has a unique perspective.  He also gets upset over what may seem stupid such as \"I want potatoes for supper tonight.\" Sam gets highly upset at the new restaurant wanting the familiarity of the old menu.  He wants to do the same things over and over again.  This was a believable story with a great ending.  I wasn't setting there thinking, \"Who was the stupid director/writer who wrote another story about the mentally handicapped with too many inaccuracies.\"  This was a really good movie and I'm glad I finally watched it.",

The grass being greener on the other side concept. Then there comes a point when we stop questioning and we start to accept the love for what it is. We settle for 'enough', not willing to believe that perhaps we deserve more than what we have now.This film provokes intense appreciation for all we have been blessed with: we may have faults, deficiencies, we may be victims of disorders, but we are what we make of ourselves: we are more than what we are born with, more than the families we've been born into. No family's perfect: too often we think those who have been born into a rich lifestyle are so happy...But money doesn't solve all of our problems. Money can't buy you love: at least not the real kind of love.This film portrays the powerful love a father has for his child, how he wants the best for her- even if it means separation from him. A man willing to fight and determined to achieve custody of his little girl. I'm unafraid to admit that this film made me cry, sob uncontrollably and made me forget whatever suffering I've ever gone through. Yep-the type of film that shifts your life's problems into perspective. There's nothing greater and more powerful than the love between a child and their caregivers. And there's nothing that serves as a greater blessing than having a love akin to that.I recommend this film because it encompasses a beautiful and true message and because there's real feeling in the characters. I have nothing more to say, just that there aren't enough films out there that have you feeling so broken, only to lift your spirits over.",

I am surprised I have never heard much of this actor and think his performance is one to  be remembered. Fanning is beautiful and so talented especially at such a young age, and yet her youth still manages to come through her mature acting. Pfeiffer plays her character well also, managing to show the pain that lawyer is in and how much she learns from a mentally retarded man.This film not only is emotionally striking, but it makes you really think about it afterwards.

If you do not get touched by this film, then you have a hard heart, and do not believe in the miracle of love. Sean Penn's performance was amazing, better than I expected, and Michelle Pfeiffer must have learned some good skills from her used to be husband David E. Kelly.

The subject is difficult with few easy answers.  I thought that there was no way that a movie would explore more than one side of the issue.I stand corrected!  Sean Penn's performance was the most true performace I have ever seen of a mentally challenged person(Including those given by the mentally challenged).  There were so many layers to his performance, nuances that just pulled you right in.The subject was explored in a way I didn't think possible in a movie that also entertained.

Thank God Nelson had more sense to drop a large hunk of semi-soft cheese into the middle of an outstanding masterpiece. Such a cliched and trite twist would have aboslutely ruined the film for me. Obviously, Nelson did not want to pedestrianise her masterpiece and so consciously steered away from such a soap-opera style conclusion.Penn's performance is highly commendable - more Rainman than Forest Gump. Indeed, it represents what must surely be a turning point in his career direction. Full credit also to young Dakota Fanning (Lucy) who carried off a superb portrayal of her character and simply stole the movie!I'll keep this short but suffice to say if you haven't seen this film you're missing something big.

            "content": "This movie was OK, but it was clearly a ploy by Sean Penn to win awards. His portrayle of a retarded man is way over-the-top. I'm glad he didn't get any of those awards.  The film is also filled with sappy moments, obviously an attempt to pull in the viewer's sympathy.  And to top it off, the director had to give it a happy ending.  Sure, it is nice to see a child with her father, but realistically, he couldn't have raised her.  I mean, she was 7 and tricking him in to doing the wrong things.  As she got older, he would be putty in her hands. Not to mention, when she got closer to being a teenager, she would want to get more things and would be embarrassed by him.  The movie should have ended with the child having a permanent foster family, and the retarded dad could visit when he liked and could take her out on outings.\nI think Michelle Pfeiffer did a better acting job than Penn.  Her character was more realistic as a hard working mom, putting work before her own child. The changes that happened in her life by taking Penn's case were far more compelling and interesting than the retarded dad's story.  Her story should have been the main focus.\nThings I really didn't like were the blatant commercials of Starbucks and Pizza Hut. I hate it when movies do that. It just lowers my thoughts of a film.  And I didn't like how Penn's retarded friends were basically comic relief. It was like they were used to break the tension and make the audience laugh.FINAL VERDICT:  This was nothing but an attempt to make the viewer feel sorry for a retarded man, even though he did things that were inappropriate as a parent and was not the best person to raise a child by himself.  If you like sappy movies, then you will probably want to see this; otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this.",

This is one of those very few movies(I can count them on the fingers of my hand) that actually brought a tear to my eye. And that was not even because of Sean Penn. But because of Michelle Pfeiffer.Sam is an autistic and retarded person, who has a child out of a stand with a female he gave shelter to one night. The female leaves him to care for the girl on his own. Father and daughter love each other deeply, but soon, the courts come to take her away as they feel Sam isn't capable of taking care of her. The rest of the movie shows how Sam, with the help of a lawyer(Michelle Pfeiffer) tries to get her back.The acting is superb. I cannot understand those critics who dismissed Sean Penn's performance, saying that it was just a desperate attempt to win an Oscar. So what? The man has acted beautifully. Ditto Michelle Pfeiffer. The scene where she breaks down in front of Sam was beautifully enacted. These are two wonderful artists. And Dakota Fanning. Now she is famous, but when i saw her at the time, i was absolutely blown away by her. She had to be the best child artist i had seen in a long time. The supporting cast is all great.If you want to watch a movie which shows how deep human bonds can go, and which will help reassure you that, yes, love does break across all barriers, watch this.

            "content": "The overarching tendency that I noticed in I Am Sam is that it is so good at making the audience root for Sam and his daughter Lucy to be able to stay together, but the better it is at that, the further it gets from reality. Very little is revealed about Lucy's conception beyond the fact that she was born from a homeless woman who \"only wanted a place to sleep.\" Granted, we don't need graphic details, but it's pretty hard to imagine Sam being involved in sexual or even romantic situation, much less being in a position to offer someone a place to sleep. The guy literally can't make a cup of coffee. Nevertheless, Lucy comes into the world and, despite having the \"mental capacity of a 7- year-old,\" his love for Lucy is real and he desperately doesn't want to lose her. Where the movie really gains sympathy and is heartwarming is in Sam's struggle to understand why she's being taken away. He just wants to spend time with her and play with her and read to her and simply can't grasp what's so bad about that.I Am Sam is an actor's film. It's all about Dakota Fanning's performance as Lucy and Sean Penn's performance as Sam, both of which are astonishing. What is the deal with Dakota Fanning, by the way? I can't understand that girl at all. She is one of the only actors I've ever seen who so consistently turns in nearly flawless performances, even in the otherwise disappointing Man On Fire, in which the managed to steal the show even from the great Denzel Washington. The girl was born in the mid-90s, for crying out loud! The main problem with the film is that, while it's tremendously effective as a heartwarming tear-jerker, the bad guys are right. The lawyers fighting to have Lucy taken away and put into a foster home are portrayed almost as movie-villains, when in fact what they are fighting for is, in fact, in Lucy's best interest. It's not a genuine flaw, as I'll explain later, but I can understand the criticisms.It's not the best thing in the eyes of an 8-year-old girl or in the eyes of a movie audience, but in the real world, it's true that a man who struggle to read anything more complex than Dr. Seuss will have significant difficulties raising a daughter more than literally a matter of months after the age we see her in the movie. When Lucy wants to learn to drive or has boyfriend trouble, she will likely be much less interested in, as Ebert pointed out, helping her father with her own homework.But what the movie definitely does right is that, even though it's based on a massive fallacious myth (\"Love is all you need\" is not at all true in any kind of relationship, parental, romantic, or otherwise), it does show the importance of people coming together to help each other. It's a thin line, but the movie is not about love, it's about caring. It's about everyone doing what is best for everyone else, not everyone doing what is best for Lucy, because that can be the worst thing for other people and, in turn, a terrible thing for Lucy. Laura Dern's character, Randy Carpenter, is introduced as a foster mother for which Lucy has not the slightest hint of affection (\"My dad's coming. Why don't you just go do something...\"), and presents a stern front when Sam arrives. She sees him as a bit of a threat to her, in that he doesn't understand her emotions and needs, but as she begins to understand the relationship between Lucy and her father her tone changes by the end. Sam can't raise Lucy alone, and many people have criticized the movie for this, but it should be noted that the movie also understands this. It ends in the only way that it should (and the only way that it could, as it were), and even though, like As Good As It Gets, it ends with the feeling that more difficulties are just around the corner, we get what we want. It's flawed but it's a huge achievement as well. And it's a great date movie!",

A seven-year old herself, she is just beginning to pass Sam's point of development when Child and Family Services intervenes. Realistically, though, it's preposterous for Lucy to have already reached the age of seven without the authorities taking an interest, without some sort of major mishap, and with only a few wise words from reclusive neighbor Annie (Dianne Wiest) to guide Sam.The acting by Sean Penn is amazing. Penn plays a kind, naive, earnest and sincere, busboy in a Los Angeles Starbucks, carefully arranging sweetener packets just so. He also adores ritualized dates with friends. Sean Penn amazingly lost the \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\" award to Denzel Washington (Training Day) on that year.The authority and emotion of the climax is absolutely incredible. It's difficult to watch, but is so very worth it, if for nothing else than to watch Penn, a master of his craft at work. Sean Penn is truly at the top of his form here, creating a role that will stick in your heart for quite some time after the cinema lights come up. You find yourself rooting for Sam, in a role of the same standards as classic performances such as Dustin Hoffman in \"Rainman\" or Daniel Day-Lewis in \"My Left Foot\".A very moving and wise movie. 8/10",

            "content": "Sam (Sean Penn) is a mentally challenged man who is in the midst of a trial to regain custody of his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning). The trigger that caused them to be separated was the fact that the girl, at seven years old, was showing signs of surpassing her father intellectually. Faced with this, the social worker who takes care of the case decides to take Lucy to an orphanage. Lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer), touched by the case and instigated to fight for it as if it were a challenge for her career, decides to defend Sam, assuming that he is sufficiently capable of assuming the role of father. From there, Sam teaches everyone the true role of the family.Despite his mental condition, Sam has a normal life, his routine is like anyone else's; he works during the day, takes care of Lucy, hangs out with friends, goes shopping, and abides by the rules. His life history is not known, nor the treatment conditions (structure, techniques and supervision) he received. From the context of the film, we can associate that the environment in which Sam was raised allowed him to develop his autonomy, being able to lead a normal life. He is a man in love with the Beatles, he knows all the songs and information about the band, even Lucy's name was in honor of a song by the band. Scenes like this, in which he shows his passion for the band, or when he's with his friends, that allow the film to have a lightness and deflect some of the drama and tension that Lucy and Sam are going through.Sam is solely responsible for Lucy, this is because the child's mother abandoned them shortly after the girl's birth, he, however, does not stop raising Lucy, and receives the help of some friends (most also with mental problems, being they are responsible for the comic and light part of the film). Here we associate another characteristic of individuals with moderate mental retardation: despite being clumsy in interpersonal contact, they like to interact and establish dialogues all the time.The father-daughter drama begins when a social worker judges that Sam is incapable of raising Lucy, given his mental retardation and that the child is holding back his development to match his father. Justice then takes custody of Lucy and puts her up for adoption. From there begins the difficult task of convincing the judge that Sam is capable of raising Lucy without affecting her development. And not only does Sam's life change, Rita also learns a lot from her client, especially when it comes to the importance of parental attention in the development of their children. She, being such a famous lawyer, ends up leaving her son alone, which results in a conflict between mother and son. When she starts working on Lucy's case, Rita gets involved in the case in a way that benefits everyone.We cannot analyze a story, a case or a film from a single angle, because there is not only \"one side of the coin\". I am Sam brings, in addition to the central theme, other themes that deserve attention, that are worth discussing and that allow many reflections. There is a whole criticism behind the care that parents should have with their children and the importance of parents' participation in their children's development: attention, affection, love, protection, teachings (rules, duties, rights). We can also perceive a criticism in relation to the way we limit people with mental disorders. Do we really give them enough autonomy? Why can't a mentally disabled parent help with raising their children?Sam, throughout his fight for his daughter's custody, tries in every way to prove that within his limitations he is capable of taking care of his daughter, and that's what he likes to do the most. He is able to forget about anything else but what helps the child sleep when he is having trouble falling asleep. These are small details, but when added together, they show Sam's awesomeness and incredible ability to raise his daughter. What everyone judged in Sam was if he had the ability to raise Lucy alone, but no one realized that he didn't want that exclusivity, the only thing Sam wanted was to take care of Lucy. Sam's love for his daughter and his willingness to raise her makes us reflect on the extent to which human beings are judged because of their stereotypes.The question posed by the film is simple. Can a person with Sam's limitations be responsible for a child who will soon be more mentally capable than he is? Hollywood, however, could not resist the temptation to exaggerate when portraying her. Thus, people considered capable, not to use the word normal, are shown to be the least suited to raising their children. Just look at the \"imperfect\" life of Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer), a lawyer with a broken marriage who barely looks her son in the face. It is also the case of the mother who abandoned Lucy and her father after leaving maternity. At odds with these lives are Sam and his friends, who always help each other and are positive in the way they approach everyday life.The work was constituted very well when it created the parallel story of the lawyer with no time for her family, betrayed by her husband and indifferent to her son. This does not detract from the central story, but rather responds to the yearnings of a woman who no longer knows where she belongs in her own home. Sam unintentionally brainwashes the tough Rita. It is also essential to speak briefly of the relationship between Sam and Lucy. Despite Sam having his limitations, he never let his daughter lack anything. He gave so much love that the girl melts for her father in every scene in the film. Lucy, played wonderfully by the then little girl Dakota Fanning, is a divine example of a mentally grown child who still sees all the gifts of being a child in her father's company.In the second half of the film, the script focuses on the courtroom scenes, where Sam is being tried by the federation as unable to care for a child. It's all very well done. All the plans made by the lawyer together with Sam's friends and the lady with agoraphobia (Dianne Wiest), little Lucy's testimony scene and, above all, Sam's emotional testimony, where everything goes wrong.The cast is superb. Sean Penn is inspired (as always), Penn gives the viewer a cold shower, his innocence mixed with his unconditional love is the pillar of the entire film, which was structured around this emotional performance and recognized with an Oscar nomination. Dakota Fanning (in one of her first works) moves and demonstrates an absurd naturalness in front of the cameras, giving us a genuine emotion and hypnotizing us with her big blue eyes and her sweet face. Michelle Pfeiffer is not as good an actress as she is beautiful, but she does not disappoint, she has her moments (the scene where she opens up to Sam in the final stretch is undoubtedly the highlight). We still have a precious bit of the fantastic Laura Dern as Lucy's adoptive mother and Dianne Wiest as Sam's faithful friend.Another positive point to be highlighted is the soundtrack, all made up of Beatles covers. In fact, the English band is mentioned in several moments of the film. Director Jessie Nelson opted for re-recordings of the band's songs, as follows: Ben Harper singing \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", Sarah McLachlan with \"Blackbird\", Eddie Vedder, Rufus Wainwright, among others. A great success, which absurdly enriched the work.But not everything is perfect. Director Jessie Nelson's choices also prove to be wrong, not to mention cowardly. The camera movements, continuous close-ups and unstable framing, as well as the quick cuts over dialogue and angles, try to create an even more emotional atmosphere, but end up causing problems. Not to mention the excessively bluish photography or saturated colors in most of the projection. Thanks to these \"maneuvers\", the whole sequence in the courts, for example, becomes unbearable. The audience could also live better without the ending, which tries to reconcile everyone's interests.Unpretentious, the film touches on several pulsing wounds that could take everything down the drain. After all, we have a history of mental retardation, of a lawyer weakened by the shallow relationship she supplies within the family, the inconsequential abandonment of a child, the relationship between father and daughter and the autonomy of institutions that judge themselves capable of defining what is better for the others. The path to be followed is extremely dangerous. There are countless films that tend to build this kind of path, but \"I Am Sam\" stands out for its sheer quality. Does it make you cry? Does. In five minutes of film we can already see the first tears coming out of our eyes. But, at the same time, a slanted laugh appears and shows the specificity of this work. Such a dense theme, but which managed to transpose a deep lightness in the film.",

            "content": "Sam Dawson(Sean Penn,attacking the role like a hungry dog to meat)is a basically gentle soul who loves the Beatles and works in a Starbucks in a large city(San Francisco?Seattle?New York?the filmmakers weren't very clear). He raises and adores his beautiful and very smart daughter Lucy(Dakota Fanning,wise WELL beyond her eight years here)and lives with his best buddies,a foursome of similar guys who help him out of situations large and small. This would sound pretty ordinary,save one less-than-minor fact:Sam is retarded(they say he's Autistic,but I've been around Autism before. In fact,my brother is Autistic,Sam is HARDLY Autistic),albeit high-functioning. He had his daughter with a homeless loser of a woman(in details made quite fuzzy,besides the obvious),and even though he is a responsible and can-do sort,his retardation begins to come to a head with the fact that his daughter,who's barely in grade school,is reaching an intelligence that exceeds his. Naturally,authorities are notified and the state steps in and aims to take away Lucy and place her in foster care. Not willing to let the child he's bonded with(and has bonded with him)get away,he pursues,wears down and wins over the help and advocacy of a high-priced attorney(Michelle Pfeiffer),who sets out win his case as sort of the pro Bono case that she's not known for handling.Director and co-writer Jessie Nelson puts into motion this sweet and basically moving movie,but the direction and writing of this film is so heavy-handed in making you root for Sam,Lucy and his friends and conversely boo and hiss the Social services(Social workers are about as often portrayed as heavies or villains in films as much as lawyers or bankers,it seems)and the attorney working with the state that it makes someone like me feel as if I am being forcibly drawn into this film. As a younger lad,I might've not minded those tactics so much,but as an older lad who's seen his fair share of movies,this doesn't sit too well with me at all. Rain Man was FAR better at portraying the mentally-disabled-trying to-adjust-in-the-outside -world-film than this one does.I've said it before on other films,and I'll say it here:the acting is really what makes it interesting and thus watchable. Penn,who,whether you love or hate the guy,his politics,etc.,is maybe over-the-top here,but he still is able to make this role his for the entirety,and he does his best when he's with Fanning,who is a prodigy here. His friends,played by character actors Doug Hutchinson,Stanley DeSantis,Joseph Rosenberg and Brad Silverman,nearly steal their scenes as the also mentally handicapped support base that lends support to Sam in any way they can. Pfeiffer,however good she generally is(and I believe she is),however,seems like she's acting in another movie here,and her transformation from cold,calculating lawyer to soft-hearted crusader to the underdog seems to be ill-transitioned.Natch for Laura Dern's at once jealous and hard-headed,then repentant,foster parent. To me,this show is most at fault by the direction and writing,where it doesn't seem to trust that you,the audience,will get the point about who to root for and who to root against,making sure the Social worker(Loretta Divine)and the state attorney(Richard Schiff)in particular are such cold,arbitrary and heart-less professionals that one would have to be pretty cruel and insensitive to not be taken aback by their methods of trying to discredit the hero.A sweet-natured film with interesting imagery,this film IS worth a look,but you should be ready to have this film try to squeeze the emotions out of you with extreme prejudice.",

            "content": "Another year, another actor making a desperate Oscar bid by playing the fool. You can always be sure to get noticed that way; even though this mess received hearty derision all round Sean 'I used to have integrity' Penn walked away with a nomination, and of course several milllion dollars. I think that the Academy believes, with some kind of warped logic, that failure to nominate an actor playing a handicapped character would be a direct insult to the genuinely disabled. Either that or they feel that to play such a character requires a huge amount of courage, dedication, sensitivity, responsibility, respect and above all talent. Let me be the first to burst that shiny bubble of witless reasoning. Playing a handicapped character requires a totally mannered performance; you observe real life cases and imitate, and try to make it as genuine as possible. Thats about the height of it, and it's something that's pretty easy as far as acting goes. But then of course, a subject like this is important, but instead of being treated sensibly and with intelligence it simply degenerates into a completely anodyne and sugar coated lollypop of a message movie, devoid of any sincerity.That's a major problem I have with this movie. Since someone figured that a comedy drama ought to have some jokes in it we are forced to tread a fine line between harmless fun and Farelly brothers style humour. Nothing so obvious as Warren in 'There's Something About Mary', but still a lot of the laughs are built around the behaviour of the mentally handicapped. Now in reality I'm sure a lot of people do occasionally see someone with mental problems doing or saying something that's unintentionally amusing and the reaction is to laugh at it. That's fine, that's instinctive, it's by no means malicious, and it happens. But it's one thing for it to happen randomly in the real world and another to deliberatly make a series of jokes about such people for public enjoyment, expecially in a film that's supposed to be supportive and understanding. I mean programmes like 'South Park' have jibes at the disabled but then that show has always worn it's non PC attitude on it's sleeve, the gags are more absurd than outright offensive and the characters are only kids anyway. In something like this the effect is far more pernicious and uncomfortable.Let's look at the film's logic. Sam is a guy with an emotional age of about 7. The authorities want to take his daughter away from him and put her into foster care, so he's fighting for the right to keep her. Does that really, really sound like such a good idea? I mean, it is a distressing and complicated situation, and one that in reality would have to be handled with tact and moral respect for the family, but I am not in favour of having someone with an acute mental disorder being allowed to raise a small child. But the film piles greasy sentiment and some self righteous posturing on top of that minor issue. The crux of the argument seems to be that since regular people can be bad parents, who are we to judge abnormal people's abilities in that area? Ok,maybe so. It's an irresponsible proposal, but on a human level you can see the point being made. But then, at least most regular parents understand certain important things, like the necessity of insurance, education, having and holding down a job, being able to drive a car and all the other necessary minutae of adult life. Plus, if mentally adjusted people can't properly bring up their kids, who in the hell is going to believe this guy can? A child needs adult supervision for any number of reasons, not least for it's own safety.Incidentally the child character in this movie is utterly unconvincing and trivialises the issue still further, giving not one ouce of realistic drama to an already flimsy narrative. She's like some sort of Buddhist monk, a picture of serenity and compassion, mouthing Hallmark sentiments and weighed down with unconditional love and adoration for her father. No one bit of conflict or confusion, never torn between her loyalty to him and perhaps a desire to live a more normal life. Nothing like that. No, what we get is 'All you Need is Love'. All I need is a bucket to be noisely sick into.This is a burnt offering of a movie; offered up to the public as appeasement in the name of a 'Worthy Cause'. BURNT offering you notice. As in overcooked, chewy and, yes, tasteless. I pefer mine rare and succulent (sorry for all these weird meat references but I can't sing, so I couldn't end on a song).",

Because of his mental disability, his qualification of being a father is questioned. With help from the hard-working lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, he fights for his custody. I believe this is among the best films I have ever seen. The humour in the film is warm and funny but not hysterically. The acting is stunning; I don't think I have seen a better child performance before (or at least in long while) than the one Dakota Fanning did in this movie, and Sean Penn's performance was unforgettable and beautiful.

Sean Penn is completely natural and believable as a developmentally disabled man. Two of the men playing his friends really were developmentally disabled, having been found at L.A. Goal, a non-profit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs, and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors. Nelson and her co-writer, Kristine Johnson, spent a lot of time at L.A. Goal doing research, as did Penn. Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. As for Fanning, I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior, much more experienced colleagues, and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7.

Its a touching experience watching Sam attempt to raise her. A natural, beautiful film which grew out of research with people like Sam (which you can hear about on the DVD), accompanied by a soundtrack of covers of great Beatles songs. One of my favourite movie soundtracks.I Am Sam is one of my favourite movies, but i recognise it is probably only an 8/10 in objective quality - mainly due to Michelle Pfeiffer. I always feel she lets it down. She's just not that good an actress. Plus, its plot is a little too familiar custody battle - we've seen this on screen before, most fully and effectively in Kramer vs Kramer, which this film fondly references.I believe Sean Penn's performances is one of the finest ever, and i don't say that lightly. He really embodies the mentally-challenged Sam, in the best onscreen representation of this deficiency we've seen.Its also a very touching film - the relation between Sam and Lucy (in a remarkable child-star performance from Dakota Fanning, who knew how to relate to Sam from having a relation like him in real life) is one of those special things in moviedom, for me at least.Highlights: When Lucy says \"All you need is love.\"8/10. But i still think its an essential film to see. Despite Pfeiffer, its still one of my favourite films, a beautiful film i love to put on every now and then and spend a little time with Sam and Lucy.",

Sam's life consists of his daughter, his job as a waiter in Starbucks, his friends, who are mentally disabled like him, and the Beatles. His love for his daughter, named Lucy Diamond after a Beatles' song, is honest, true and unconditional. He might be retarded, be he knows and understands love much better than many other people, including his lawyer, Rita, a rich but unhappy woman who constantly lies to other people and cannot even find the time to spend with her only son. Perhaps Sam's love for his daughter is expressed through a line in the Beatles' song \"Michelle\", which Sam repeats in court: \"I love you, I love you, I love you\". Rita is to help Sam keep the custody of his daughter, but it is through Sam that she learns to find happiness in her cold and hectic life.Although the film sometimes goes towards clich\u00e9s, the brilliant performances of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning make it a memorable film. It is similar to the French film, the Eighth Day, as in both films the cold workaholic characters learn the value of love, friendship and family from their mentally retarded companions.",

            "review_title": "A poorly choreographed, terribly directed and unnecessarily drawn-out mess of a film",
            "content": "Firstly, I am surprised at the polarized differences in ratings between the users and the critics with this film. After reading through the user reviews, I can safely say the critics are speaking the same language as I. How the users seem to be more impressed and taken aback by the lead performances to completely oversee the glaring faults staring them right in the face is beyond me.Those who have praised this film do so by crediting Sean Penn's performance as the autistic father, Sam, of a young child, Lucy. (Just for note, I won't bother outlining the synopsis, it's on the title page.) Yes, it goes without saying that his acting is brilliant throughout the film and yes he conveys a vast myriad of emotions in a way many of us with or without disabilities can connect to. But it does not outweigh, in any way, shape or form, the awkward direction and choreography that's so shamefully profound I am astounded it's never fully come to light in other user's reviews, or, more disturbingly, is actually loved by them.Half the time, I found myself watching a documentary trying to emulate the warmheartedness of everyday people and their selfless actions, which then hap-hazardly shifts towards the actual drama between Sam and his daughter Lucy relevant to the actual storyline, and this laughable disequilibrium unfortunately carries on throughout the film; running in parallel to what is otherwise a class act by Sean Penn. The camera angles are inconsistent and unorthodox in many scenes, the filters used made me feel like I was on an acid trip and the cinematography does not enforce the scenes, nor do they aid in forming a coherent dramatic piece. So essentially, what is left as the final product is, well, just a shamefully abhorrent mess.Backing performances are weak, and though Michelle Pfeiffer's character begins pretty solid (as they do in these types of films), her development throughout the film poorly progresses to the end goal of self-realization (aided by Penn's Sam Dawson.) Some scenes were pointlessly dumped in throughout the running time (which I won't mention here, I'm sure you can figure it out once you watch the film, if you haven't already done so,) and I'm intrigued as to what scenes the editors decided to scrap altogether.And it doesn't stop there. The full length of the film, clocking in at 2 hours, feels more like 4 hours of painful drear; having in fact the very juxtaposition of the feel-good and uplifting factor this film was aiming to achieve. Too many unnecessary scenes weighed the drama down to the point where it became a mere effort to continue watching, and any spark within quickly snubbed out by meager (if any) efforts by the editing crew to keep this drama short and sweet, which is what it should have been. Every time a scene ended, another one follows which otherwise should have been replaced with rolling end credits.Drama's like these are a clich\u00e9 amongst many, and have been recycled and reused many times before in cinema history. Obviously, and for the most part, audiences prefer watching such films to connect with others going through struggles of their own and seeing them endure hardships to the ultimate positive eventuality. But there's no lasting optimism to be found at all in this film, when you take all I have outlined above into consideration. Unless of course you're one of the many other users who credited this \"uplifting, poignant and brilliant\" and all the rest of it. Those who also credited the director for his \"artistic attempts\" ought to also invest their time in watching much better directed films of the same category that would make Nelson's 'artistry' look like an amateurish high school project.One out of 10 may appear too harsh and cold to many of you reading this, but there are seldom any good points I can make about this mentally exhausting and emotionally torturous movie that has the exact opposite effect on me as that of which it was intending to create, and Sean Penn's leading role is not enough to uphold and take lift to a diabolical drama anchored down by a mass array of film making faults.",

Personally it has been since \"A time to kill\" that I have actually cried in a movie but with I am Sam I just could not help it, seeing a helpless person losing everything he loves as the \"system\" considers him incapable of doing so, but he manages to convince everyone that this is maybe the only thing that he can do.

Sean Penn did a very good job, as did Michelle Pfeiffer. Dakota, as expected, did her job well too.(I was initially a bit irritated by her overly smart character in the movie, but then I saw her interview in some TV channel the next day, which made me realize that this girl was equally smart in real life too! I also saw Denzel Washington being overwhelming in his praise of Dakota and her acting). The grace with which Annie Cassell (Dianne Wiest) carried herself was excellent: a blind woman whom none would realize to be blind (not even when she tells Sam, \"You know that I cannot do that.\" in reply to Sam's question if she would come down to help him with Lucy), until the moment she appears in the court; her correcting the lawyer abut the \"summa cum laude\" was very graceful, equally convincing, and yet devoid of any arrogance. The affection of Sam's friends' for baby Lucy was another highlight of the movie; it showed that one need not be smart to be loving and caring. But the thing I liked most is that this movie didn't oversimplify the equations: Rita, for example, in spite of her growing attraction to Sam, did not try to be a \"mother\" to Lucy.Nor did Sam try to snatch away all emotional rights of Randy; rather he confessed his realization that most probably she was the person most suitable to fill the void left behind by a \"mother\" Lucy never had the chance to meet, play with, or be pampered by.The watershed, however, was the final legal fight and the accompanying high-drama that -- someone like me, used to Indian/Bollywood melodrama, was bound to expect -- that never happened. The negative points: well, for one, the Beatles stuff was a bit of an overdose. Also, life is never a bed of roses, and thus real-life events don't often lead to such happy ending. But then, it's our dreams that we live for, and Sam's fulfillment of his only dream, to have his daughter back, could perhaps make some of us feel optimistic about our unfulfilled dreams as well.",

Most essential to the film is hot shot lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) who develops a relationship with Sam that manages to reach an emotional resonance akin to \"Rain Man\" despite the constraints of the film.As for those constraints, there's the icky manner by which Sam became a parent in the first place. Fortunately, the film doesn't delve too much into how he became a parent in the first place as someone who likely had little idea how babies are made.The film also doesn't give too much detail about how he manages to raise the daughter all the way to her seventh birthday outside of the help of his reclusive neighbor (Dianne Wiest). According to the logic of the movie, though, he somehow manages to get the job done as a single planet with the salary of a Starbucks employee and severe mental deficiencies.According to a basic knowledge of parenting, it would be a huge impediment to raise a child in this environment, and it doesn't help that the foster family (with Laura Dern as the mother) is miles above the stock portrayal of neglectfully abusive opportunists doing it for the paycheck.Although there's some wiggle room in how much empathy the film wants us to have for the dastardly social services employees, the film appears to want the audience to be on Team Sam when Team Social Services seems a lot more tempting.Still, the film's moral leaning towards one side doesn't negate that the thought-provoking nature of this kinetic courtroom drama.",

Even more preposterous, you say? Well, this is the entire premise of the movie, I am Sam.It's just too ridiculous that the kind of mentally retarded man portrayed in this movie should have sole, unassisted custody of a child. This is compounded by inconsistencies in that portrayal; the way Penn plays a retarded man is fantastic, but his degree of dysfunction varies depending on what the movie wants you to believe at any given time. At some moments, he is so inept that getting him to do simple things like pay attention is nearly impossible, yet, Sam also seems to \"know what to do next\" in complicated plot points in order to move the story along.

Instead, I was drawn immediately to the character Sam played by Sean Penn.  Penn uses his incredible chameleon acting skill to bring Sam to life in a totally believable way.  He is so convincing that I think this movie is a \"must see\" for Oscar voters.  Sam could fit in beautifully in the work center where I have been shooting a documentary about a real life couple that is planning to get married and have a child.  Unlike Dustin Hoffman's Rainman, Sam is a wonderfully social person.Although retarded, Sam displays incredible internal strength of will which is the driving force of the movie and makes him instantly rootable. He has close loyal friends and although the director doesn't directly point it out, Sam has a healthier lifestyle than the so-called \"normal\" people in the film.  The girl who plays Sam's daughter, Dakota Fanning, is adorable and her precocity is typical of other children whom I have met whose parents are mentally retarded or disabled in another way.A weakness of the film is the director's unwillingness to take a position about developmentally disabled parents and stick with it and to point out how controversial the issue is.  Los Angeles is one of the few places in the U.S. with resources for developmentally disabled parents and a U.C.L.A. professor who fights for the rights of these parents in court.  In most of the country, babies are automatically snatched away from their \"retarded\" mothers in the hospital.  Another weakness is that the \"normal\" characters are for the most part one-dimensional.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays an obsessive-compulsive Century City lawyer with $1,000 suits and a $100,000 Porsche and a $1,000,000 house who is less able to deal with the most basic elements of her life than her \"retarded\" client.  The movie deals with how Sam teaches her how to find what is important in life.  Diane Wiest and Laura Dern, two accomplished actors capable of remarkable work, are not given enough to do with their characters, and we end up not completely satisfied as to their roles in the movie other than for plot points.Even with its weaknesses, I recommend the film because it is an incredibly moving comment on the power of love and touches on a topic not usually covered in film.

He's shown as the idiot who's unimpeded by social restrictions, has no cynicism about unconditional love of his daughter & eventually he wins her back through his unending love for her....... blah blah blah. OK, if you like this stuff, but this is hardly original.It's also pretty much by-the-numbers, with the expected relationship between Sean Pen's \"Sam\" & his hard bitten lawyer, Pfieffer's \"Harrison\", popping up (oh what a surprise, eh?). She even gives him a suit for his court appearance, but can't you just tell he's going to get it all dirty at the last minute? (oh what a surprise.... again....etc etc etc, YAWN!). This goes on & on throughout the whole 2 hours, something I do not expect to have to pay good money to see.To be fair there are some impressive performances. Sean Pen as Sam is a wonderful performance, seldom does he lose the character's multitude of ticks, quirks & other autism habits. Pfieffer is a real pro' & can seemingly take on any role with ease & keep your eye on her when on screen without looking as though she's actually working hard (which she most likely is, but that's the skill, isn't it?). The supporting cast are also competent, with Laura Dearn as the foster mother, Lucy Diamond Dawson as \"Sam\"'s daughter & even Brent Spiner as a shoe salesman (the cameo has REALLY had a come back it seems). As for Sam's film obsessed friends, you couldn't really tell if they were also autistic or not. Were they actors or were they autistic actors? Either way they were the foil for some slight comedy & character insights.The camera work & direction is also polished, Jessie Nelson plays with colours quite a lot (notice the bright, almost primary colours of Sam's world & the drab colours of the real world.... also the child protection agent appears in almost monochrome at times, except her earings which are bright gold.... etc etc). This reminded me of the wonderful \"Three Kings\" where colour & hue played an important part of the atmosphere when following the various plot threads.Some of the \"Sam plays with daughter\" flash backs were so twee they almost seemed like washing powder ads, but it was always well done.The underlying weakness of the film is the plot. It's so limp wristed & wishy washy that you wonder how it's going to hold together without completely falling into old cliches. In fact the end creeps up on you in such a hopelessly weak manner I had to wonder if I'd missed something.\n2/10, boring.",

The movie does have some flaws: 1) If Sam can take care of the girl when she was a child, then it will be easier to take care of her in her older life becuase she is more independant. 2) Sam is accused of hiring a prostitute (he is unaware she is a prostitute).  But no money is exchanged and no clothes are disrobed, therefore making it a plot hole.Still a wonderful, touching film.",

I did NOT like Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as a scatter brain lawyer with just a bit too much modern living in her life and not being able to handle her day to day duties fully in both her personal and professional life.  She reminded me of her character in 1995's 'One Fine Day' where she looks very similar.  Sean Penn is superb as a mentally handicapped man fighting the state for custody of his little girl.  Penn mixes sentiment and a hidden strength contained in his character very well. 'I Am Sam' has a family atmosphere about it but I doubt kids will enjoy it. It'll play well in the future as a watchable movie for a rainy weekend afternoon.  So?  Do I recommend it?  Yes, with reservations.",

The supporting cast was great, especially the young actress who played his daughter. Love can conquer all obstacles is the message I got from this movie.The interaction between Sam and his lawyer is another story line that shows that even the smartest of professionals can learn something from the dumbest of humans.The film also shows normal people the everyday problems that the mentally handicap has to deal with it their everyday lives, and how they learn to cope and adjust to the world that surrounds themI give this movie a 10, cuz it made tears well up in my eyes quite a few times, and thats hard for a movie to do to me",

Not very many people could carry off the sweet and mentally retarded demeanor as he did.I haven't seen Training Day, so I can't say that Penn was any better than Denzel Washington, but in my opinion having seen this movie twice now, I really believe Penn should have won that Oscar he was rightfully nominated for.Michelle Pfeifer was also fantastic in it, and she really shows her true acting ability off towards the end of the film, once she starts getting more and more emotional as the movie carries on.And the real gem in the movie was Dakota Fanning.  She was so convincing playing the little girl and so good, that I definitely see her in the future making movies when she's older too.  She's a natural and true talent, and I especially liked her in this movie.Basic Plot: Sam [Penn] gets a homeless woman pregnant (whom we only see at the very beginning of the movie giving birth), and after she has his baby she deserts him and the child.  Sam is left alone to raise the child, while still trying to maintain his job at the local Starbucks.  He has the mental stability of that of a 7 year old, and so raising this child is much more difficult for him than the average single father.  After six years, a mishap at the mall, some police and a social service worker, Lucy [Fanning], Sam's daughter, is taken away into Foster care.  A hearing has placed him with only two visits a week for two hours each time which will be monitored.  A court date is set, and so because of this he needs to find a lawyer. Enter Michelle Pfeifer.   Through her help to get his child back, and his help to get her to see the world through a new set of eyes, they take a journey together that will change both of their lives forever.A remarkable piece and definitely cheated from more than a few worthy Oscars/nominations.I give the movie a 9 out of 10.  I cried throughout the entire movie from beginning to end and I don't mind saying it!  It was so good!",

It didn't have that effect on me, but then I'm not a fan of middle of the day TV soaps either.I Am Sam is about a mentally slow father called Sam played by Sean Penn. His daughter at 7 years of age is starting to help him with his reading. Family services set their sights on the problem and decide that Sam can't be expected to raise his daughter on his own. Sam loves his daughter Lucy. Lucy (Dakota Fanning) loves him. Sam persuades Rita, a high octane lawyer to plead his case. Rita is played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Rita is selfish, greedy and a poor mother to her own son. Rita only takes on the job because she's shamed into it by her co-workers.So you can see the set up. Will Rita become softened by her experience with Sam and his case? Will she even have a close relationship with her client. And what of the opposition?\nWill Family Services, represented most forcefully by the opposing lawyer Turner played by Richard Schiff, be out and out baddies?And what of the little girl Lucy. Will she find love elsewhere, perhaps with foster parents? Or will they be the rapacious, money grubbing, nasty child beaters usually coughed up in films like these.I Am Sam does have the virtue of not playing the characters straight down the line, except unfortunately for Sam. Sean Penn is a masterful actor and director. The Crossing Guard, The Indian Runner, Dead Man Walking, She's So Lovely and U Turn have revealed an actor of distinction.So why should he play a necessarily one dimensional character like Sam? Didn't Edward Norton turn that one on recently in The Score?There was however a scene in I Am Sam that for me was very effective. Sam is trying to add up money and it's very difficult for him. His struggle was obvious, especially because he knew that other adults did that task much better. He knew that others were much smarter. That was revealing.However I Am Sam overall was too glossy, perhaps not bleak enough, especially when the glamourous Michelle Pfeiffer character blasted onto the screen.I Am Sam could have been mistaken for The Old And The Desperate or some such.2  Glum Flys Out Of Five",

But considering the entire movie, I really don't care. I'm left with a great feeling, the kind that you only have after having spent a certain amount of time being sad or angry. This movie made me feel both those feelings, sadness and anger.I Am Sam is a movie I won't soon forget.

I have never been a big Sean Penn fan, I find him to be often sleazy and uninteresting but he is by far the highlight of this movie. He gives a believably, heart breaking performance from start to finish and he is so accurate you almost believe that he actually does have a problem. He plays a loveing father with the IQ of a seven year old and has his daughter taken away from him because it is believed that he can not provide the girl with the life that she needs. The film contains many powerful scenes one of the most note worthy is a scene where they lawyers are questioning the little girl about what her father can give her and the little girls replys all I need is love. Michelle Pfiffer also gives a great performance as a heartless laywer whoes life is falling apart around her. The one thing that is wrong with this movie is the choppy editing which makes the courtroom scenes seem rather bland and uninteresting. Also the use of dark lighting makes this movie probably to intense for younger viewers. All in all this is a very powerful movie and Penn has never been better so if you are a fan of Penn of just want something that will instantly melt your heart I Am Sam is for you.",

The film really does make you consider if love is all you need or not. Parts that were extremely emotional for me was when he was reading to Lucy and telling her off for not reading herself. The topic of disability is dealt with sensitively. However, I didn't enjoy all of Dakota's performance. She is an amazing actress and the crying/emotional scenes were amazing, but she acted like an adult at times rather than an average child. I am not sure if she is supposed to be a extremely clever child or not, but the scene where she shouts 'are you writing this down' seems too mature.The ending was quite open vague and up for interpretation.

The story is amazing and the cast delivers a wonderful preformance with such gifted actors as Sean Penn and Michelle Pfieffer.Sam Dawson has the mental capacity of a 3 year old and is portrayed by actor Sean Penn who yes indeed won an Oscar for this movie. He won for best actor in a leading role and I'll tell you why he did. No other actor I have ever seen has had the ability to portray such a mentally retarded man in such a beautiful way. He truly has a gift. Rita Harrison is Sam's pro-bono lawyer because he loses his daughter that he had with a homeless woman and since he can't take care of her they take her away. And he needs a lawyer to get her back but can't afford it.There are some very humorous parts in this film supported by Sam's best friends who have Autism, Down Syndrome, and even a Paranoid one. I work in a school with Special Ed kids and this film touched my heart in so many ways. I came out of the theater and I was amazed that a director could pull of a movie so beautiful and the script is wonderful. Everybody who has not seen this movie. Rent it. You will absolutely love it. LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED!! Thank you for hearing my comments and I encourage you to open your heart up to movies like this. I also reccomend the Academy Award winner for best picture. Rain Man. Another heartfelt movie portrayed by incredible Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbit and his adventure even though he has autism he can make \"magic\". Anyway see I AM SAM!! 11/10",

I have been around many handicapped people and can honestly say that deciding whether they can be guardians or parents is quite dubious. However, the acting is very good and the storyline is quite believable enough to hold your attention. But I was very uncomfortable watching this. Is Penn at fault for his portrayal. Certainly not, he's a great actor and looks and behaves the role quite naturally.My problem is that this movie was far too long and just seemed never-ending. Do you think the director or writer were huge Beatles fanatics. I thought the references to the Beatles was far too abundant. There must have been at least ten songs that were re-badged by current artists and maybe a dozen references to the Beatles in the script. A couple of times would have been enough.",

The blend of music and story is so perfect ... Beatles music has become even more poignant as years go by. The acting is brilliant- one of the best ensemble pieces ever- it really has a lot to say about community and coming together for the best possible outcome for all concerned. Yes there are challenges in the real world for a disabled parent to raise a child and in the real world as a community it can become a win-win situation I love how Randy (played by Laura Dern) came to realize that it wasn't all or nothing win or loose - but how they could all work together for the benefit of the child. The movie didn't go into a lot of detail around that as far as the final court hearing (I actually would've loved to have seen that included in the film even if it did run longer than an average two hour movie ) To recap the outcome for the final scene they decided to cut to Lucy playing a soccer game with Dad/Sam participating as referee; cheered on by onlookers his attorney and child, foster mom and dad that picture is worth 1000 words that everyone was on board with creating a community. It really does take a village.... For all of us not just those who have special needs. I think there should be a special award for movies that stand the test of time- now more than ever this one rates as a forever classic with heart that will never be outdated.",

They delivered their lines perfectly & were really great! I also especially love Laura Dern in this film.Probably the very best thing about this movie is the quite obvious, or should be, message;Sometimes - it's allegedly 'normal' people who act hateful, inconsiderate, and are so immersed in themselves, their own issues, and trying too hard to be thought of 'perfect', - and sometimes, it's the so-called 'handicapped' people who are kind, loving, and look towards helping others before self, and they're not a bit worried about whether you think they're not 'perfect' .And this was all portrayed so perfectly in this movie.Hopefully, it has and will continue to motivate us all to be kinder, less self-absorbed, and real.",

The \"support system\", which includes several equally challenged \"buddies\", a very supportive employer, and many other people in the community gives evidence of our changing society, fostering inclusion and tolerance.

It was extremely interesting to see Sean Pean acting like that. There couldn't have been a better for Sam than the Amazing Sean Penn; he conveys his performance perfectly. It's so believable that I was really impressed by it. I can honestly say he was astonishing. His Academy award nomination was well deserved.As for Michel Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning, I consider them well chosen to portray the supporting categories; however in the scene when Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) cried, answering Sam that her life wasn't as perfect as Sam thought it was, wasn't that believable, it seemed somewhat shallow, so I think this part of the movie was not that convincing. It was great to have seen the two times academy award winner Diane Wiest. I saw her in `Hanna and her sisters' a while ago, and I thought she was great, but she looks much older in this movie. It's a sorrow that she didn't appear much throughout the whole movie. \"I am Sam\" was a pleasurable and moving experience, but it seemed that the whole movie fell apart at the end. Even though the ending was so predictable it misses the most important issues like showing that Rita and Sam won the case. It just shows that they're happily playing soccer at the end; however we don't know if they either won the case or lost it. Overall, it is a somewhat touching movie, but I didn't like the musical score and it misses the point at the end. The supporting cast, especially Sam's friends were outstanding. Since it's an original movie and shows great performances I rate it a 6/10.",

Sam shows the extraordinary bravery and honesty required for all like him to insist on living a full life as part of society. He has respect from his co-workers and unquestioning acceptance from his personal support network, but he is forced by circumstance to test the limit of his life skills.I agree that it's not a perfect plot. What responsible foster parent would let a child walk out of their house night after night?

It isn't easy for a grizzled leathers and chains biker and rock 'n' roll guitarist to melt into a puddle of superlatives over a movie. This movie is in the same league (imho) as my previously set in stone top ten:1. The Man who shot Liberty Valance 2. Out of Africa 3. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly 4. Pirates of the Caribbean 5. The Empire strikes back 6. It's a Wonderful Life 7. Terminator 8. Raiders of Lost Ark 9. Pathfinder 10. The Boat (Das Boot) 11. The Bridge over the River Kwai 12. AlienThere are twelve, so you can see that my personal top-ten is a bit crowded. Now, one of them has to go to make room.In #10, the grit and the oil keep it permanently in place as a top-ten movie of all time. Tuco rules, so #2 is permanent. No one will ever top Geoffrey Rush's Cap'n Barbossa, so that's permanent. Han re-defined the role of \"leading\" man, and his tongue-in-cheek perfection spilled over into #8. Ridley Scott is one of the finest director/producers ever, so that's out. Alec Guinness is one of the Big Five and fascinating as well, so that's out (both times). Pathfinder: watch it and you will agree. And what \"top ten\" does not include J-J-J-Jimmy Stewart's roust with Clarence?So I'm left with Clint, John, and Ms. Streep. All will stay forever.I'm clearly pathetic and hopelessly self-absorbed, so my \"top ten\" now becomes 13, with a new addition: I Am Sam.I Am Sam is a movie that challenges you. My step-daughter has two autistic children, both of them beautiful in their own way. Sean Penn has made this so real and strikingly so.

I have had friends who are mentally challenged before, and Penn did seem to act like them.

I'm very familiar with the habits of autistic people, I'm the mother of an 8 yrold boy with autism. So I think Sean did a very good job. If you've never seen him in anything else, you wouldn't know that he's not like that at all. He was awesome. If he doesn't win an Oscar for that performance, somethings terribly wrong with the people at the Actors Guild, or whomever votes for movies and actors.  Michelle Pfieffer, and Laura Dern also did a wonderfull job with their characters. The little girl who played Lucy was also wonderful. This movie definately gets 2 thumbs up, I think it's one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It might take the place of Steel Magnolias, which is my favorite movie.

In other words, if the idea of a union between the \"Rain Man\" and \"Girl Interrupted\" doesn't seem hopelessly implausible, then what results is a wonderful fantasy.  What does it mean to be a parent, this otherwise incredible setup challenges us to consider?  Is it really just a matter of \"All you need is love\"?  What if the parent is mentally retarded while the child is of normal intelligence?  These are disturbing questions, and our buttons are pressed for an emotional response at every turn in this fable.  Unfortunately, the alternate viewpoint is presented as a straw man.  The story is more about feelings than reason, and we are therefore supposed to want the father and daughter to stay together as though there were no other issues.  In \"real\" life they would most likely be helped to do so from the start, but of course this is a \"worst possible scenario\" presentation.  The character of \"Sam\" and the uniqueness of the daughter are both masterfully portrayed.  It is a film that will bring tears to your eyes as well as smiles.  A good story does not necessarily need to be grounded in the probable, and hence perhaps, in an alternate reality, something like this \"could\" happen.",

It was truly remarkably. Michelle Pfeiffer played her part as a hard-nosed, money-oriented lawyer also very well, and Dakota Fanning, playing Sam's daughter, shows remarkable ability for an actress of her age. A wonderful performance. She may well be winning Oscars for herself in the future, judged on this.It was a fairly unfashionable film in Hollywood and it didn't have quite the glamour or the budget of other films, and certainly didn't have as much publicity as many others. As a result of this, it didn't get the recognition it deserved as a film. However, Sean Penn was nominated for an Oscar for it, but he was beaten by Denzel Washington for his part in Training Day which I find, frankly, incredible.This is why I was so pleased to see Sean Penn win the Oscar in 2004 for his role in Mystic River, even though I believe his role as Sam in this film was much more challenging and therefore so much more of a triumph.

He fought with his lawyer Rita Harrison , played Michelle Pfeiffer, at first they are not much , but gradually their teamwork better.This movie is unspeakable for me, only one thing that I want to say is \"Family is important and love is very strong \".",

            "content": "This film is more of an experience than a spectacle.  The direction was magnificent.  The slightly eclectic camera work was evocative and played its own, important role in the storytelling.  The handheld camera technique that so irritated us when we first saw it on television in such tele-dramas as the old Hill Street Blues or the more recent NYPD Blue was essential in this film.  A great deal of thought obviously went into the music selection and performances (this is a soundtrack I wish to own).  The only real script weakness, in my opinion, was the lack of early character and motivational development of the attorney, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer).  But perhaps by the time we reach her moving monologue in Sam's (Sean Penn) apartment we felt all caught-up.  The performance of the child actress who played Lucy (Dakota Fanning) was stunning.  And I was happy to see how well the camera caught the familiar kindness in Laura Dern's (who played Randy Carpenter) eyes. But most surprising of all was the performance of Sean Penn.  In my life I never would have imagined that he was capable of such a performance, and were I casting the film he might not have even been on my list.  I was astonished, moved, and happy to have demonstrated to me what a lousy casting director I would have made.  If this were the only film that its creators ever made, I would think it would be enough.",

Sean Penn was terrific and I believe this is by far his best role in a movie (thus far). It's very shallow with the odd humor here and there and a terrific performance by a very young Dakota Fanning. Through-out the movie we see mixed emotions, decision making and heart-brake as Sam tries to get his daughter back. Those who have had a similar situation that Sam is having in the movie will touch you deeper and emotionally tear you apart. A very simple, original drama with great performances, the self-acclaimed modern villain and a terrific opinionated ending. I Am Sam is nothing particularly special, there's no massive stand-out as some elements found within were quite weak. But, a good movie that will touch different people in different ways.",

The soundtrack for this movie is the best i've ever heard,  but then again your reading this from a Beatles buff.  Every song in the film is a Beatles song performed by other artists, but i don't think any other song could replace them.All in all, if you can't decide which film to see when going to the movies, you can't fail with this one.

            "content": "I'm a girl, so I'm allowed to admit I cried during this one. Machismo or not, I bet I would have seen some misty male eyes in the theatre had I bothered to look. I Am Sam is a rare movie that's touching, funny, and heartwarming.Sean Penn is Sam Dawson, a mentally challenged single father. The reason I say \"is\" and not \"plays\" is that Penn does such a brilliant job in this role, it is as though he actually becomes Sam, in much the same way that Tom Hanks became Forrest Gump. I don't like Sean Penn personally. I find his politics obnoxious, and his soapbox ways of preaching them nearly intolerable. But there's no doubt the man can act. For the entire length of the movie, he never slipped from his character for a second. He was so convincing and believable, I half expected him to sound like Sam when he interviewed on Oprah Winfrey.Despite its ingenuity, Penn's performance is not the only standout one in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer is inspired in her role as a driven, frazzled, neurotic ultra-successful lawyer with a suffering home life. Several of the supporting roles are played by actors with mental disabilities, which only adds to the richness of the cast. And Dakota Fanning is captivating as Lucy, the seven-year-old who knows her daddy is \"different\" but loves him anyway and wants to fight not to be separated from him.The main problem with this movie is that it requires a significant amount of suspension of disbelief. Are we really to believe that a man with Sam's mental capacity was able to raise and take care of his daughter singlehandedly for seven years, without major catastrophe? His job would hardly be able to cover his rent, let alone child care expenses, and he lacked many basic skills necessary to raise any child, let alone such a well-adjusted one as the girl in the movie.And it does raise some questions about who to root for. Sam is the \"good guy\" and presumably, the audience is on his side. But is it really in the best interest of the child for him to win custody? I mean, in real life, she might have been placed in an indifferent or even abusive foster care situation, but this movie comes up with Laura Dern as a picture-perfect mom-substitute. Wouldn't Lucy be better off with her? Even Sam concedes this at the end, so why don't we? However, if you can turn this off for a couple of hours, there aren't too many viewing experiences that are more enjoyable.",

Other women in the audience were sobbing during the movie.  I didn't get it. I'm not saying the movie wasn't well done.  It was.  I'm not saying the actors didn't do a great job.  They did but (and here is where I get in trouble at times) Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer are both very well respected in their field and we tend to expect good performances from them.

At first, she was proof of how much someone has to go through just to see their child, then she was a way to show how autistic people perceive the American court system. And then she's a parallel to Sam as a fellow parent who would do anything for their child.I could go on and on about /his movie, from the soundtrack to the daughter to the acting, but I'll say this.

This story is loaded with Beatles music and many references to their personal lives which is interesting and effective. This film pulls at the heartstrings constantly and is emotionally draining in a positive way. A lovely and tender rendition of what \"Love\" is all about. Dakota Fanning as the little 7 year old is endearing and Sean Penn as the retarded father who has only the mental capacity of a 7 year old is brilliant in his portrayal. My hat goes off to Sean Penn not only for his fine performance but also for his willingness to do such a role. This is a film for big hearts and for Daddys who love their daughters. The injection of all those dogs in the latter part of the film is a fine bit of emotional manoeuvering that is cleverly timed. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a good performance as Sean Penn's lawyer. Her emotional breakdown puts us all on a level with \"Sam\" Dawson so that we can, as a collective whole, identify with and understand his plight in life. There are several references to \"Kramer vs Kramer\" which are appropriate. The state interferes in their lives by \"stealing\" away Sam's daughter for her \"best interests\" because he cannot take care of her the way the state sees fit. The harshness of the state (government) interfering in and controlling our lives is bluntly put on screen. We are all worn down by life but \"Love\" is the sustaining power that saves us all from depression and ultimate extinction. This is a story about the triumph of \"love against all odds\" that will linger on in your memory long after this film is over. As the little girl says (echoing a Beatles song) in response to the harassing lawyer's questions - \"Love is all you need.\" See it. Own it. This is truly a fine film.",

            "content": "It is with a great feeling of disappointment that I write this negative commentary on the movie, I am Sam.The movie starts off reminiscent of Rain Man. The obsessive-compulsive traits of autism are apparent as Sean Penn's character; Sam guides his fingers through the packets of Equal and Sugar Twin separating them into their own groups.We then learn that Sam works at Starbucks and before we have a chance to get to know him we're off to a hospital where a woman who we are never introduced to is giving birth to the other lead character, Sam's daughter, Lucy. We are never given any more information about this woman.Somehow Sam manages to raise this child some help from his neighbour who I assume is agoraphobic, but we never really know for sure. Anyway, after a series of circumstantial events, Lucy is taken from Sam by the social workers and Sam is forced to look for a lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) who will argue his case to keep Lucy in his care.Sean Penn's portrayal a mentally disabled person is very good, but what sort of mental illness does he have? Is he autistic? How severe is it? One minute, Sam is answering questions by relating their answers to obscure Beatles lyrics and the next, he is losing his patience and causing a scene in a restaurant that doesn't have his pancakes on the menu. I am no expert on mental illness, but would someone that has Sam's condition be able to make connections his life and the Beatles song, \"Michelle\"?I also had a problem with the fact that just because Sam is sweet and good and able to live independently that we should by default assume that he is the best person to raise Lucy. The social workers and layers are portrayed as terrible people with no other goal than to tear a happy family apart.\nI believe this movie was intended to display mentally disabled people in a different light, and to show that there are many things that mentally disabled people can do, but it failed. Because the antagonists and so many elements of the movie were so unrealistic, it doesn't convince the audience that, in the real world, a person like Sam could actually raise a child.",

In my opinion it represents entirely what a film such as this should represent.Yes it is a David versus Goliath story that has people gasping in awe from the side-stand, but to me this film opened up to become a fantastical display of directing, acting and script that drew me in and had me rooting for Sam (played to perfection by Penn) from the very start until it came to the, albeit rather expected, dramatic ending.Some people may think that from the sound of the description the film will be just like rain man and well you are, my dear friends, epically wrong. Although Penn somehow managed to have a certain Hoffman-esquire quality about him in this film, it's only similarity is the fact that the protagonist has a learning disability. That is all.The remarkable acting by all the cast in this spectacular film just shows how it should be done, it isn't wooden, it is robust, Penn, Fanning and Pfieffer showed great on screen chemistry that gave me the feeling of actual life, Pfieffer's character showing empathy, Fanning as the loving daughter and Penn as the adoring father that attempts the impossible to make his daughter, and himself, happy.The camera work was (and again my opinion) totally key to the feel of this film, the constant shifting and changing as though you were yourself in the mind of Sam; confused and at some points distracted. Flitting from side view to front view, from Sam to whomsoever Sam was talking to. Just showing the thought process that Sam would have been going through; his frustration at trying to find the words, or the confusion of people bombarding him with words he cannot understand, is conveyed quite miraculously through this alone.I highly recommend this film to anybody and everybody that has, at some point in their lives, been confused or frustrated. Just to give them a little perspective as to how hard it can be. Or if you haven't or aren't either of the above . . .I recommend it anyway.",

Too often enough it is the parent trying to deal with the child's issues; this movie flipped that around.Despite it's flaws, and at times believability, this was an excellent movie.

Yes it's cliched and yes it has Sean Penn in it - but somehow I am Sam rises above all that and becomes one of the most charming and thoughtful films I have seen in a long time.The performances are good but most of the credit goes to the writer and director who managed to create fully rounded characters in what could, on the surface, have been little more than a movie of the week.My only criticism is the ending was a little too \"happy\" and although at the time I appreciated this (i did in fact have a few tears to shed) after consideration afterwards I thought the film would have been more powerful had the true situation resulted in only partial custody.This is nit picking, the happy fairytale ending works too and it's nice to see the good guy win sometimes.Several people I have spoken about have mentioned the \"americaness\" of this film. Strangely I didn't notice that at all - despite the obvious advertising placements for Starbucks and Pizza Hut. Overall it had a universal quailty and a heart that sadly many american films lack.",

Sam, as a very sensitive, good-hearted guy tries his best to be a great parent, despite of his mental handicap. Obviously, his limited intellect makes it very difficult for him to face the obstacles his situation serves. Well-acted struggling of Sam to understand the world around him and to deal with his destiny his new role and life's everyday problems really made me *feel* the story. Well written characters and great, believable performance of Sean Penn as Sam and Dakota Feening as his daughter Lucy quickly got my strong sympathies. Though this film didn't offer that much of surprising plot twists, deep subtle messages or extraordinary attractive scenes, I'd say this film was very good - for its emotional content - the mighty and powerful love between the parent and his child.",

The acting of Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeifer was very well fitting but the child's role and her acting was what disturbed me most. She is said to be 7 years old and Sam's mental age is also said to be 7 but how come the little girl can act like a 30 year-old grown up? She is so much grown up that it feels she can even look after his father but it was so unrealistic to portray a 7 year-old as an extremely mature girl.Also the film was far too long. It could have made its statement in 2 hours as well. There was too much subthemes like the problematic lawyer (yes i know it was important for the well-being of the plot but from time to time it made me lose the main theme), the never-going-out neighbour. But these are also not very much elaborated either. It was as if all of those plots were loosely fitted to the main plot to underline the statement of `all you need is love to raise a child`. 5/10 and that's for the good performances of Sean,Michelle and Dianne Wiest.",

            "content": "Somewhere in `I Am Sam' there is a very compelling story. There is a story of a man with the intellectual capacity of a 7-year-old, and the struggles he faces while raising his daughter. There is a story of a girl who will be smarter than her father by the time she gets to 1st grade, and the difficulties she will face in school and at home knowing that `Daddy is different.' These two stories are played out in the film's first 35 minutes, at which point the filmmakers chose to abandon them in favor of a courtroom drama. It was an unfortunate decision, because it turned a very insightful and touching film into a frustrating yawner.Sean Penn plays Sam Dawson, a man with a lower than normal IQ who is forced to take care of a daughter all by himself when the mother runs away just after birth. It is later explained that she was a homeless woman who just wanted a place to sleep. Sam raises Lucy (named after the Beatles' song) as best he can, and tries to operate under the advice of the Beatles: All you need is love. However, while he has more than enough love, he does not always have the intelligence required to raise a child. Good intentions and a loving heart are not substitutes for enough food and a good place to sleep. But instead of showing all of these problems and how he and his daughter deal with them, the movie takes the easy way out by having lawyers and witnesses discuss how they feel he will deal with them.Sean Penn does an outstanding job in this role, but unlike Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, Penn is not surrounded by great writers, directors, or actors. That makes it difficult for his talent to really be appreciated, and it was frustrating to see a great performance go to waste. It was also frustrating to sit through a film that chose to fill its soundtrack with poorly done remakes of great Beatles songs.",

I think this movie does a good job showing how child service lawyers (scum of the earth) have the ability to prove that love is not a factor in determining whats best in raising a child in our society. If you have ever been through this you know that these legal proceedings can damage a child long term far more that the problems that are going on in the home. I think the foster mother at the end really showed how bad this idea of removing children from one home to give them to someone else (usually do to inability to have their own) is a quiet epidemic running through the courts right now. The lawyers and child services lady were just sickening! Something tells me they would have had this beautiful and intelligent child aborted given the chance. Almost seemed to be masking as Eugenics believers. I usually don't like when other artists cover the Beatles but this soundtrack was awesome! I guess what really surprised me about this movie was the cast. Uber-liberals fighting against government institutions that they support in the real world, go figure.

There was a lot I liked about this film and I think Michielle Phieffer did deserve an Oscar nomination as best supporting actress (or just best actress). The acting was strong and so were the actors and actresses. I thought the script was well written and everything else was played out in a realistic sequence.

Sean Penn is brilliant as Sam Dawson, an adult father with the mental capacity of a seven year old. No one doubts he loves his daughter Lucy (played wonderfully by Dakota Fanning). But with Sam's limitations, family services intervene to take Lucy away from Sam while everyone questions whether love is enough. Everyone except Sam and Lucy. Michelle Pfeiffer is fantastic in her portrayal of Sam's driven, obsessive, manic (and lying!) lawyer, Rita Harrison, \"who never loses\". She's all that's tragic and wonderful about the corporate legal world. The juxtaposition of her high-powered, successful lawyer against Penn's childlike simplicity brings into sharp relief that life isn't about talent or intellectual, financial or corporate success. Sam and Lucy show, and Rita (et al) learn, that it's about love, honesty, consistency and slowing down enough and opening up to let people in, to care for one another, and to enjoy the things of life together. The movie keeps you guessing right to the end. The camera work is 'out of the box' and the Beatles covers are poignant and relevant. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because the ending didn't quite work for me. Other than that, sheer enjoyable brilliance.",

It is about Sam(Sean Penn) who has the mental ability of a 7 year old, who is trying to raise his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning). Sam is a loving and caring parent, he wants nothing better then to see Lucy, who is holding back in school so she won't appear smarter then her father, to do her best and become the smartest in her class. Sam has a misunderstanding with the law that alerts Child Protective Services to his situation. A social worker pays a visit to Sam and Lucy's house while he is waiting for her to come home to her surprise birthday party. Their is a misunderstanding that reveals that Lucy told her friend she was adopted, so she runs away upset. the social worker removes Lucy from Sam's custody. Sam retains the services of a high priced layer (Michelle Pfeiffer), who takes the case pro bono because everyone thinks she is to money hungry to ever take a pro bono case. Thus Sam fights the system to try and get his daughter back.The main problem with the story is that the \"bad guys\" in the movie are right, Sam should not have custody of his daughter, she is quickly becoming to much for him, and she is quickly becoming the head of the household. Although as much a Sam and Lucy love each other, Sam should be in her life as much as possible.What saves this movie is Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer is good to, but it is Sean Penn's movie, although he let Dakota Fanning take the movie away from him. Penn is great as the retarded Sam, and plays it very convincingly. He is a man child, with the light and pure love that only a child has. The real star of the movie though is Fanning, who plays Lucy to pure emotional perfection, she is irritated at having a father who acts more like her friends do, then a father. She is embarrassed by him, although what kid has never been embarrassed by a parent, when he act to much like a kid in front of her friends, she is a caring guardian when she masterminds her \"kidnapping\" for child services. She is purely upset when she thinks he has forgotten about her, and is purely in love with her father when she is trying to convince child services to let her go back to her dad.This movie is worth seeing for Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning, and if you cry easily bring a box of tissues, Dakota will make you cry.",

Jessie Nelson helps bring to life the importance of love and family through a character named Sam Dawson (Sean Penn).  In this film Sam is an adult who is mentally retarded with the learning capacity of a seven year old child.  The fact that Sam is mentally retarded does not stop him from living what appears to be a normal life. Sam is employed at Starbucks Coffee and has developed a first name basis relationship with most of the customers.   Sam and his friends, who also have disabilities, have a weekly routine of playing cards and going out to their favorite eatery.  As the movie progresses there are some situations that are about to bring fourth some changes in Sam's life.  Including his job performance and weekly routine of hanging out with friends. Although the film does not go into detail about meeting and having a sexual relationship with a homeless woman, Sam is shown later in the delivery room witnessing the birth of a child.  At that time I came to the conclusion that Sam is in fact the father of the baby girl whom he names Lucy Diamond.  The name seems to come without hesitation or debate, since Sam is a huge Beatles fan.  The name came from a Beatles song, `Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'.  Soon after the birth of Lucy, Lucy's mother runs away from her responsibility of helping to care for their child.  She is later quoted by Sam as saying, ` I never wanted a child with you, I just needed a place to stay'.  Sam accepts the responsibility of taking care of their daughter.  Although the experience would hold to be a real challenge, Sam is determined to raise Lucy. Years later, Lucy is of age to attend school.   Once Lucy reaches the age of seven she realizes that she is progressing and her father is not. She decides that she does not want to advance if he can't.  Lucy begins to close herself off from her teachers at school.  A concerned teacher steps in and a parent teacher conference is called.  Soon after, Children and Family Services steps in and removes Lucy from the home.  Sam's desperate plea to get his daughter back leads him to meet an attorney named Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), who after numerous attempts to avoid Sam becomes his attorney.  Rita first comes across as being a very overworked and stressed individual.  It's not until the very end that I start to notice a change in Rita. Sam did not have the mental capacity of a normal adult but he came across as having more than enough love.  The fact that the director portrayed Sam to be mentally retarded made this movie even more enjoyable to watch.  Sam lost custody because of a disability he was born with and not because of drugs, alcohol or abuse. In the end Sam regained custody of Lucy and gained a new friendship all in the name of love.",

            "content": "Sam, a mentally challenged father, proves that \"all you need is love\" to raise a child. As he is brought to court over the custody of his daughter, Lucy, he proves that genuine love, compassion, and kindness is worth more than any prestigious education or elaborate house can ever provide.This truth is evident in both the lives of Sam and Rita, his lawyer. Sam is handicapped, poor, and marginalized in his community. He can't provide for his daughter in the same way that other parents can. Rita, on the other hand, is a successful, rich lawyer that \"never loses.\" She has the big house, the fancy car, and the designer clothing. With that being said, Sam is happy and content. He finds time for his daughter; he loves his daughter, and his daughter dearly loves him. Rita, however, is miserable at her job. Her husband is none-existent, and her son abhors her.After watching this film, (and shedding a few tears in the process) the idea is obvious: love is greater than anything this world can provide! Contentment does not come from wealth or even a high IQ, it comes from a genuine heart and a authentic desire to put others before yourself... much like Sam's heart.What a beautiful movie depicting the resilient power of love. The love of a father to overcome all of the adversity around him to get back to his daughter. Sean Penn is brilliant in his role as Sam, as well as Michelle Phiffer as a no-nonsense, arrogant lawyer. You can see the characters perception of Sam and his situation change throughout the film in a beautiful way. \"I am Sam\" is truly touching, inspiring, and captivating.Remember, \"all you need is love.\"",

Finally, my wife checked it out of the public library on DVD.What can I say? Most movies I see, I forget them totally, as far as any impact on me, as soon as I leave the theater. This one, days later, (and I keep watching it over and over), haunts me. Everyone raves about Sean Penn, and rightfully so. His performance is seamless. You forget that an actor is portraying Sam, and start to believe differently. The world disappears (your world), and you immerse yourself in Sam's.Michelle Pfeifer blows me away as Rita. I have never had the urge to write an actor/actress and applaud their work, but I do now. She draws you in. You care about her, her marriage, her relationship (lack of) with her son. She lays on his bed and kisses his head while he is asleep, and you believe it is because Sam has encouraged her to try again. She is a winner in the courtroom, but a loser with people. Her secretary, her husband, her son. She would have lost with Sam, but he is a man on a mission.Sam knows how to be a friend, in his simple way, and he unconsciously \"teaches\" Rita the things she didn't learn in Law School.Sam is still a child, but he has a grasp of what it means to love unconditionally. He impacts everyone he meets because of it. \"That's a fine choice\" he tells patrons he meets on his job. He hugs a witness during the court session. He affirms Rita. \"You're my attorney that never loses.\" Her line that sums it up? \"I worry that I've gotten more from this relationship than you.\" To be honest, they become friends, and help each other as best they know how. And it's a win/win.",

Sean imbues Sam with so much heart, and so much love for his daughter, that's its VERY easy to beleive she really is his child, and that's a hard trick to  pull off in a movie! I'll make a bold prediction, if Ms. Fanning stays away from dreck like the Cat in the Hat, and sticks to work this good, she'll have an Oscar by 12 years old or so!!! And Sean deserved one for this, sorry Denzel, but this is one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen!! The ever lovely Michelle Pfeiffer gives a fab performance as well, and her slow awakening to just how good she has it is something to see. She's got it all, but never took the time to appreciate it, Sam had nothing at  all, but knew the value of the love he and his daughter had for each other. I HAVE to mention Sam's pals, and the fact that several of them ARE mentally challenged, but it makes the film so very real, and nowhere in Penn's interactions do you see who the real actors are, and who the really handicapped ones were, which is just one more point in Penn's favor for the Oscar. Me? I'm 38, your typical guy, but I bawled like a baby at several points here, it's THAT good of a film, trust me, usually a flick like this tries too hard to pull the heartstrings, and fails as a consequence (ever see Radio?) but this works, sure, the somewhat documentary look to the filming helps, but they got the heart just right, so very right. Sometimes love IS all you need. Maybe the whole world could learn from this one........then again, if every had listened to John Lennon, maybe we wouldn't be in such a mess....",

Anything below 7/10 does not do this movie justice.You can read the summary for yourselves, I'm going to briefly tell you about the ACTUAL acting. Sean Penn is utterly, unmistakably brilliant. His portrayal is touching and brought me near tears on numerous occasions. How he did not win the Oscar for this baffles me.Michelle Pfeiffer also throws in a very good performance and her character development throughout the movie is impressive; she does very well to depict a person who needs a reality check(in this case Sam) to really examine her life.At 6 or 7 years old, Dakota Fanning does extremely well to fit into her role with great maturity yet still maintain innocence and deep love for her father.I cannot stress enough how well Penn is and I am amongst the many who believe he is underrated; especially in this movie. A must see for anybody; forget about the technicalities of what is realistic and what isn't. This is not based on a true story, it is fictitious accounts. Enjoy the movie for what it is; a heart-warming tale of a father's undeniable love.",

            "content": "I just went and saw \"I am Sam\" and the movie and must say the movie is not a bad film, but plague by some flaws. The acting was generally good, with good acting from Sean Penn portraying the mentally challenged father \"Sam\" who have struggled to get the custody of her daughter Luci. Dakota Fanning's acting was generally good but at times it felt she was a bit too \"mature\" for her age, eg. when she was talking and comforting her father of been different in the restaurant and offering a hand, and also when she was yelling at the 1 way mirror glass. I think it might have been accurate, as children of mentally disabled parents tends to grow up faster. Michelle Phiffer's character portray of the work mother / lawyer also seems a bit forced at times, (when she broked down and cried in Sam's shoulder, it feels poorly act at that particular moment) but gets better in much later part of the film. The ending itself seems a bit rushed, and I have to agree with other reviewer that having a mentally challenged person who certainly have difficulty taking care of himself to win the child custody battle is absurd, but as the tagline of the movie said \"All you need is Love\" and I guess it will be alright ;) we all have to believe in it. Generally, it's a heart warming film, well worth have a look.",

            "content": "When I left this movie, I was puzzled.  Is a movie good because it moves you?  Because a movie makes me cry and laugh does that mean that it deserves praises?  Then I was reminded of a movie that I loath.  Blow.  I cried with fists clutched.  How dare a movie try to make me feel bad for this man.  I think that me leaving the theater with this thought made me realize that I didn't like this movie as much as I felt that I did.  But it most certainly does not deserve the ridicule that it has been getting.  It seems that everyone is going on as though this character Sam is all of a sudden unable to raise a 7 year old girl when he has done a very good job raising her since birth.  Personally, I think that there are many difficulties with raising a baby, a child, an adolescent, and a teenager, and Sam has gotten down 2 of those stages.  I think that if the woman from HRS would have found this situation when Lucy was age 3 then she and the \"system\" would have thought, thank goodness we got this taken care of when we did, just imagine how messed up this child might have been at the age of 6 or 7.  Don't get me wrong, I understand that the issue is that Sam has the intellect of a 7 year old and they are afraid that she will surpass him and that this may do harm, but I just don't think so.  Rita's witness is a doctor whose mother was retarded, but they only referenced this by saying her IQ was not much more then 70.  From this, I personally began to think that MAYbe Sam's intelligence level is at a 7 year old's but that may not mean much more then his smarts.  Sam has been on his own, Sam has held a job, Sam pays his bills and Sam has raised a a daughter for 7 years.  Could a 7 year old do this?For everything that someone says is wrong with this movie, it seems as though I can recall a scene that contradicts it.  Here is a for-instance. Lucy is holding back her learning because she does not want to go past her father.  Well, just like any other child in school having trouble, the teacher sets up a Parent/Teacher conference, the parent goes, and then tries to help at home.  There is a scene following where Lucy and Sam are reading and Sam sees what the teacher is talking about, he sees Lucy holding back and he corrects it just like any parent would try to do.  And it works. This shows that he is contradictingly a good father.  He cannot earn more then $8 and hour. Well, unfortunately, there are good, normal parents out there earning the same amount without much drive to change either.  Its almost as if Sams troubles are the same as a normal persons troubles, but the system gets concerned because they dub Sam as incapable of working through them, but for some reason they forget that there are normal people out there that have the capabilities but don't. Another thing that people don't understand is that we are not supposed to hate the woman from HRS, or the attorney trying to give Lucy a good home, but we are supposed to think of them as uneducated in the matter.  As not being in Annies shoes to see the love, commitment and determination that Sam has.  The best way that this movie shows us this is in Randy, the foster mother.  She is the one that WANTS Lucy, she is the one that is harsh to Sam, and in the long run, she is the one who sees what Annie sees.  So, if you were to take Mr. Lawyer and put him in everyday life with Sam and Lucy maybe instead of thinking, this man is a retard and everyone knows that retards cannot raise children, he would think, wow, I guess he can do this, just like Randy does.  Well, if you have made it through to the end, then thank you for your time.  I liked this movie a lot, although it is not one of my favorites, but goodness, the reviews that I have read on it are as if it is a nightmare, and I think that is a bit of an extreme.",

I guess I've just seen him in too many other movies where he is powerful, vengeful, tough, militant, everything that he is NOT in this movie, so in that respect his character simply wasn't believable to me. Also, why is it that movie directors feel they need to put the mentally challenged person in pants that are always too short? It's ridiculous.Michelle Pfeiffer's character is unrealistic.

So eventually, a lawyer named Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfieffer) takes his case.I was told Sean Penn used to beat up photographers, but I'm not hesitant to say he did a good job in \"I Am Sam.\" Maybe it's because this is the first movie starring him that I've seen, but I believed he was the mentally retarded but lovable Sam. And Michelle Pfieffer did a great job. Her character, Rita, is basically heartless. But Sam changes her and gets her to spend more time with her family.But the real standout performance was Dakota Fanning, who played Lucy. She was excellent for a child actor, and same here, I believed her.Like others say, this WAS filmed at weird camera angles, but I think it fits the theme. It's in the eyes of Sam, who sees everything in a different way. How something is filmed shouldn't affect whether or not you want to see it (except maybe \"The Blair Witch Project\"), because then you would miss a really great movie, because that's what \"I Am Sam\" is.---------9/10",

Other great actors are in this movie as well, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning (whose roles I usually do not like. However, no one could have played Lucy better). This movie is designed for all audiences (as long as you can deal with a lot of f-bombs), and it will definitely take you on an emotional roller-coaster.Great story, great acting.In fact, I like the movie as much as Rain Man. However, I do think that Sean Penn's acting is more believable than Dustin Hoffman's (sorry guys).",

            "content": "\"I am Sam\" is about a mentally disabled father, Sam (Sean Penn) who fights for the custody of his 7-year-old daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning), with the help of lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) and neighbour Annie (Diane Wiest).It has a good humanitarian side to it; it is a reminder that mentally challenged people deserve to be treated kindly, and that sometimes they are more capable of giving love than people with better I.Q.s.\nSam adores his daughter, who loves him just as much but she is smart enough to notice that her mental capacities are superior to his. They share such a wonderful complicity that I find it hard to believe that a father-daughter relationship can be that solid. The premise is incredible. No one ever raises any questions about Sam's ability to raise his daughter until she is seven! Sam is the father every child wishes to have: he is caring, patient, loving, giving and selfless. He cares too much for her and not enough for himself; I'm no psychiatrist but it is commonly believed that autistic people are much more self-centered than that! Another unrealistic part: with all due respect to mentally challenged persons, I doubt that a restaurant as popular as Pizza Hutt and a coffee shop as famous as Starbucks would actually hire someone like Sam, regardless of his position. Moreover, everyone in this movie seems to be afflicted with some sort of a mental or emotional problem. Lucy suffers from anxiety, Sam and his close friends are all mentally handicapped, Rita has problem communicating with her son and her marriage is falling apart, Annie has not left her room in years, and even one particular doctor who testifies against Sam in court has developed a guilt pattern because her son died of an overdose.All of these elements combined make the viewers feel they are being manipulated in a somewhat obvious manner. Finally, let's be objective here: the whole movie focuses on reuniting Sam and Lucy, regardless of Sam's handicap and how the latter would lessen the girl's mental and educational growth. Undoubtedly, Lucy would never find a more loving father, but she also needs 'regular' people's guidance and besides, he needs assistance himself! The filmmakers were obviously not sure how to end the movie in a believable manner, therefore the ending was ambiguous. Lucy most probably ends up being \"shared\" by Sam and her foster family, Rita seems to have regained her son's trust, and Sam's mentally challenged friends will have the same habits for the rest of their lives, like video night every Friday.So I guess that is a (sappy) happy ending. Again, not very believable and too many questions are left unanswered. Overall, the movie is good; it is very moving and at times, it does put a smile on your cynical face. :) Everyone gives an excellent performance, even Fanning, though I find her character a bit too smart and perceptive for her age. The soudtrack rules! But then again, I'm a Beatles addict, so it's hard for me to be objective. I enjoyed the scenes of Sam and Lucy together and how certain Beatles cover songs fitted the mood and situation. Sam is a Beatles freak himself; he named his daughter Lucy Diamond after \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and throughout the movie, he uses analogies related to the band's life and songs to express his feelings and point of view; those portions of the script are clever and make his character interesting and rather 'creative' compared to, say, Rainman. Fortunately, the movie did not stay in the courtroom and ended on a football playground. \"I am Sam\" has garnered Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar nomination, and he truly deserves to win that award.",

It is an emotional film, but in contrast to other reviewers, I don't think the emotion is wasted and over-the-top, but is instead used to great purpose. The movie addresses the fact that Sam is in reality not equipped to be the sole provider for his daughter. The problems Lucy faces as a result of her father's disability are not glossed over or ignored. Instead, the movie artfully demonstrates that Sam and Lucy need and deeply love each other, but that they also need a good support system (as do we all). The juxtaposition of Sam's loving and supportive relationship with his daughter and his \"normal\" lawyer's troubled relationship with her son is brilliant and very telling. As the daughter of a father who is blind, I understand Sam's struggle to help people see beyond the disability to the man. My favorite scene in the movie says it all. Rita is struggling to define Sam's disability without sounding insensitive. She finally says, \"I don't know what to call you.\" He replies, \"Call me Sam.\"",

I knew what I was getting myself into when I rented this. I mean, a retarded man getting his daughter taken away, this has cry-fest written all over it. There were some moments where I got a little misty eyed, but the emotional scenes started to get too frequent and a little over-gratuitous. I liked the story, that is, WHEN I WASN'T DISTRACTED BY THE CAMERA MOVEMENTS!!! OMG, what was the cinematographer thinking? It had the amature feel of a couple of junior high A/V geeks trying to shoot a homemade Megadeath video; a lot of handheld in the movie, boyo. Quick pans and quick inappropriate zooms. The editing was equally distracting, chop, chop, cha-chop, ch-ch-chop chop, I thought I was going to have a fu*king seizure. That being said, I thought the story was touching enough albeit unrealistic. Who in their right mind would agree to have this guy be the legal guardian of himself, let alone a child? There I go again, hey, this is a movie that you just have to roll with it a little and you'll enjoy it perhaps. Sean Penn carries this movie like Atlas, man, that dude can act. Oh, BTW, I'm sick of some of these reviewers saying his performance didn't seem realistic, like they are some kind of an authority on the mentally retarded. Give me a break. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent. Everyone else does a decent job too. Oh, and that Dakota Fanning kid, what a little sweetheart and fine actress. They could have really sunk this movie quickly if they had cast some untalented hack kid actor (does anyone remember the kid who played Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace?), but she pulls it off. Too bad the only thing holding this movie back is the story, over-indulgent sap and mind-blowing inappropriate camera/editing work. [6/10]",

Also how a man named Sam is born with autism, and has a child named Lucy and tries to raise her.The movie I am Sam is about a man named Sam who is on a seventh grade level. He was born with autism. Sam works at a coffee shop, but is only allowed to deliver the coffee. He meets a lady who is homeless and lets her live with him. She gets pregnant and they have a little girl named Lucy. The mother runs away when she is born and leaves Sam to raise her. Sam lives next door to a lady named Annie who becomes Lucy's God mother. Annie helps Sam out with Lucy and answers any questions Sam has. San and Lucy are fine until she turns seven. A conflict happens at her seventh birthday party, while a lady from DHS is there watching Sam take care of Lucy. They start to worry about Sam taking care of Lucy, so they go to court.The characters in this movie are Sam (Sean Denn), Lucy (Dakota Fanning), Rita the lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Annie (Dianne West). Sam is a strong character. He fights for Lucy with the help of Rita, his lawyer. Rita doesn't know how to control her anger. Sam helps and teaches her how to love and care a person. Lucy is also strong; she's just like her dad minus the autism. Annie tries and helps Sam out in court by testifying. The protagonist is Rita and Sam. Antagonist is the people in the court who are against Sam getting Lucy back and being able to raise her.In conclusion, this is a very sad movie to watch and see Sam try to fight for Lucy. It's hard for him to explain how he is a good father and won't worry about her future. It's exciting to find out if Sam gets her back or not. The movie keeps you hooked through out it.",

In fact, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer), Lucy (Dakota Fanning) and Randy (Laura Dern) are blinding blondes. Meanwhile, the baddies in Social Services and the courts, the cold-hearted grinches who want to yank Lucy out of Sam's arms, tend to be self-righteous African-Americans and ethnic types. Yes, I know. The latter gravitate toward public service jobs. But still. What's going on here in this paen to difference & and embracing minorities?

Truth be told, I could barely get thru the trailer. I have to differ with Roger Ebert on this one (I was truly stumped by only one other review by him - of Raising Arizona).  Penn's acting is a breakthru for him.  It's not a matter of not taxing his acting skills (Roger,) but in fact of working inside what seems to be a very small box, and portraying an incredible range of emotions within the boundaries.  It harkens back to James Stewart's tortured bar-room scene in Wonderful Life. I have had the experience of working with mentally retarded children and adults, and have seen them - in one instance - turn into impressive equestrians - something no one would likely imagine they can accomplish. Unrealistic as some have charged?  How can Sam raise a child? With great difficulty, but that's the point.  The situation is a matter of degree- we all know kids who have dozens of IQ points on their parents and they do fine.  Why would a homeless woman take advantage of Sam?  To get a roof over her head.  Think it's bizzarre?  Watch any daytime talk shows lately?  This is tame stuff It wasn't perfect - some things are left hanging - Annie's background for instance is dropped and left to maybe too much speculation, though it does serve as contrast to show that a seemingly together person can have just as many critical flaws as those who seem outwardly flawed.  And Sam does seem to come up with a few quantum leaps in dialogue and tone, but it holds togather in the end. As for the grown-ups - the ambiguity of the foster family isn't as set as I thought going in - you realize in one extended sequence, that not only is Lucy smarter than her dad, she can put one over on the 'normal' adults too. To see Sam/Penn's earnestness and corresponding anguish is perhaps the best test of his characterization.  Yes people like Sam are embarrasing to the unenlightened, and in an extension of that situation, you get a sense, like in A Beautiful Mind, that we as a species still have a sickening tendency to prey on the weaker among us. I doubt this movie will do for many what could be done by a real- life familiarity with such adults - but it's a great foot in the door. Like Leonardo diCaprio's Arnie in Gilbert Grape, you get to watch the details of interaction between \"challenged persons\" and us \"normal folk\" - to find that there's not as much different as there is alike.",

Sean Penn got the chance to do something different here: rise to the challenge of playing a father with mental retardation. To do this well, one must temporarily \"put away\" him/her self and \"put on\" his/her character. Like Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\" and Dustin Hoffmann in \"Rain Man\", this film has a similar effect.Sean Penn plays Sam Dawson, a single father with the IQ of a 7-year-old. The mother, believed to be a homeless woman, abandoned him and his daughter when the daughter was born. He names his daughter Lucy, after the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" He raises her on Starbucks coffee wages for some time. She is obviously very bright, and exceeds most expectations in school. But when she turns 7 herself, it's obvious she is avoiding doing well so that she won't appear to be more advanced than her father. This arouses the concern of school personnel and social services, who take Lucy away and place her in foster care. With the help of Sam's friends/roommates, co-workers, and high-priced, tough-nosed, lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), he works to get Lucy back. But it won't be easy. The courts do everything they can to prove Sam has nothing close to the intelligence and skills required to raise Lucy successfully. He and Lucy believe \"Love is all you need\", however. To add to this, Rita has her own problems at home. Sam sets out to help her see things differently, and in the process learn more about herself. Dakota Fanning shines as Lucy. Also, Dianne Wiest has a small supporting role as a neighbor who defends Sam's love for Lucy.I recommend \"I Am Sam\" for everyone. In our increasingly diverse and inclusive society, those with mental challenges are people too. They deserve as much of a chance as possible in the \"real world\", even with assistance. Everyone is \"gifted\" in one way or another, and must show it. Kudos to the incredible acting and film-making.",

            "content": "Sean Penn deserves an Oscar nomination for best actor in a very touching and compelling story. No one should remains cold facing such a powerful human drama. After all, are we in a way or the other, all mentally handicaped? Jessie Nelson (director)handles the story in a very brave and honest way. Her casting is almost perfect although Michelle Pfeiffer sometimes plays over the top. But Dakota Fanning gives one of the best performance by a kid in many years. Remember that name DAKOTA FANNING. she'll be a huge star in the future. It's the short but so effective part of the foster mother, played by Laura Dern, which synthetizes best the emotional response from the audience. I have hear in other reviews that I Am Sam  was a\"chick' movie. Let me tell you, that in a full house  on a Saturday night, a lots of \"roasters\" were sobbing too.I Am Sam deserves 8 out 10. A must see movie.Sputtosi",

Maybe the movie seems worse to me than it really was because I walked in with very high expectations. But they could have done better, with or without my expectations. The acting was wonderful. Sam and his daughter did a wonderful job playing the part of their character. That wasn't what made it bad. All of the actors did wonderful jobs, and were really well casted, but they were the only part of the movie that made it good. The script was horrible. There were times when it just got too long, and then there were times when it seems rushed. Especially in the end, it seemed like the producers ran out of time, and that they cut out many important scenes. In the end of the movie you kind of don't know what's going on, because either the scenes were cut out, or the script writers left out a lot of information that they needed to keep in. Other than that, Sean Penn was an incredible actor in this movie.",

I don't think one person had the exact same reasons for disliking or loving the movie. I have my own opinions, however.I went and saw the movie twice. Not because it was a favorite or some fabulous film, but because I wanted my friends to see it. When I first saw the movie, I cried four times, and I do not cry at movies. It's not my thing. But this movie brought out so many emotions relating to my own life that I could not hold them in. Admiration, courage, sadness, happiness, and pure ANGER gripped me. My younger brother is autistic, much more severe case than Sam in the movie. But I totally related to the feelings of frustrations of dealing with people who treat you like s*** because you are different. My own good friends sit there right in front of me making fun of retarded kids knowing full well about my brother. This society acts as though it is so compassionate towards others, but reading some of these comments just proved that this isnt the case. i knew it before, though. oh well, theres only so much that can change a close minded person.The movie had its flaws, I'll admit. I walked out of the theater unsure if I even liked the film. It is pretty unbelievable that Sam could live in a nice area like he did with Lucy and raise her even to the age of 8, yet it has happened before i suppose.But from my own personal perspective, there was much more good to the movie than bad. The movie was filmed beautifully. I read comments people had about it looking like a camcorder and being too chaotic, but did you ever stop to think why? Sam is retarded, and his whole world is dizzy and confusing. The camera movements simply displayed how Sam was feeling and set the mood, a perfect way for it to be done. The movie was well acted, all i can say is SEAN PENN. I thought he was amazing. yes i will always think Leonardo did it best in gilbert grape but this is the closest i have seen. It was completely believable in that sense, and like another commenter stated, the chemistry between lucy and sam was incredible. what a great casting job and what a great job done by the cast!The message is there, whether you liked the movie or not. It was that love is not an emotion created for \"normal people\", but one that anyone can feel. it was also about stereotypes and the fact that people judge before they know a damn thing. I suggest this movie for anyone, open your minds please! 8/10",

(timing is everything!) (pfeiffer plays sam's attorney in a custody battle for his daughter, who at age 7 herself is almost as intelligent as sam, and has learned her beatles history as well ) it is a lovely, heartwarming film, the ultimate lesson of which is that the beatles were right all along: all you need is love. run, do not walk to the theatre to see it. you will not be disappointed. the cast, including penn, pfeiffer, dianne wiest, laura dern and richard schiff all shine, and the young actress playing sam's daughter is perfect...",

Not a terribly original concept and yes it has been done before, but wouldn't it be nice if life were like that. If a simple thing such as a love between a father and a daughter, beat all adversities that stood in their way and with that love touched the lives of others.In reality of course there wouldn't have been much chance of Sam having had Lucy for as long as he did and a high priced lawyer like Rita wouldn't have taken the case for free because she was mocked by her friends.\nHowever, due to the good performances by the cast and a kick ass sound track of some of my favourite beatles songs, I was able to step out of the crappy cynical world that we live in, where love isn't all we need,in fact it isn't that important, and I stepped into a world where people actually genuinely care about each other.

Love for our children has become an editorial for the masses in this movie.

Show your love no matter what challenges you undertake, and then take it a step further to challenge anyone who may intervene upon your convictions.

I agree with an earlier posting that Sean Penn's performance --- while strong, and well-done --- was somewhat one-note (though I would rest more of 'blame' of that on the writing and story construction, than on the actor).  Still, this is one of those movies that has so many consistent strengths, that it captivates you from the opening scene, and doesn't let go of you even after the credits start running.And in all fairness to Penn, his performance was one of those 'consistent' notes that keeps the momentum going.  Dianne Weist was superb as Sam's equally 'disabled' neighbor; and Sam's group of friends (which included several real-life 'challenged' persons) were captivating and enchanting.  To me, the deep, troubling performance of Michelle Pfeifer was one of the best of her career.The story line is basically straightforward; a mentally challenged man is left to raise a daughter who soon becomes as much of a parent to him as he is to her; obviously she resents being in this situation (although she loves her dad deeply) and when she rebels against it, she ends up being taken away by Social Services.A couple of interesting notes: its never really answered whether Sam (Penn's character) actually is the biological father; the ending also doesn't completely explain how things were worked out.  But these things end up being strengths.  In real life, answers aren't always clear and resolutions aren't usually tidy.Here is a movie with a clear voice, and a solid vision.

            "content": "If you do the math, Sean Penn should win Best Actor this year even though I don't think his time has arrived yet.  His character Sam is a culmination of the two characters Dustin Hoffman won his Academy Awards for, Ted Kramer and Raymond Babbit.  Ted Kramer was a father in danger of losing his child and Raymond Babbit was not retarded, but had a mental handicap and similar tendencies as the main character in this movie.  Sam is a loveable character, but many characters have won our hearts with their imperfections. What's unique is this story and the premise of the movie, whether a man with such a problem can be responsible for raising a child despite his love for his child.  I'm not sure if this comes into debate in society much, but I am overly sentimental in terms of movies so I can't make judgement to whether a man should gain custody in such a case.  The character has some interesting facets to his personality, for example his love for the Beatles. He uses their lyrics and stories about them as lessons in life, and it really fits well in this movie.  Its obvious that because of her upbringing, his daughter is intellectually advanced beyond a normal 7 year old.  The girl who plays Lucy is the most beautiful little girl I've ever seen and she really steals many scenes of the movie with her acting.  One of the funniest performances is the one by a man who really has downs syndrome and is played out to be the intellectual and definately the most normal of Sam's group of friends.  I feel the relationship with his neighbor (Diane Wiest)was undeveloped, but there aren't many complaints from me.  Overall, if you're a sentimental go see it or if you're looking for an acting performance which might blow you away.",

            "content": "The movie I am Sam directed by Jessie Nelson follows the journey of a mentally disabled man named Sam Dawson in a fight for custody of his daughter. He was abandoned with his newborn daughter Lucy after impregnating a homeless woman who ditched them as soon as the couple left the hospital. This drama piece made in 2001 stars actors such as Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffler, and Dakota Fanning. Sam raises Lucy all alone with the help from his kind old neighbor and his friends, all of which happen to have their own disability as well, showing unique traits and characteristics. As Lucy continues to grow, she begins to pass Sam's intellectual level and other adults in her life begin to question Sam as a father. Sam then must prove his ability to be a father with the assistance of a workaholic lawyer who helps in pleading his case for custody of Lucy. In my opinion, the movie does a good job of empowering the main character Sam because he doesn't have to eliminate his disability in order to help him win his daughter back. Instead, his unique perspective on life helps others grow by teaching the lesson that love conquers all. In the end of the movie, Sam doesn't overcome his disability, he learns to accept himself as he is and use his love for Lucy to help him be the best father he can be. It isn't Sam's disability that holds him back, it is instead the negative ideas that much of society has of disabled people.",

            "content": "I Am Sam follows and explores the life of Sam (Sean Penn), an individual with an intellectual disability, as he fights for custody of his daughter Lucy. Lucy proves to be a bright, young girl who has above average reading skills, but when faculty members at her school begin to notice that she is falling behind in school, they suspect that she is doing so to spare her father's feelings. With this discovery, child protective services intervenes and takes Lucy away from her father, prompting the start of Sam's fight to gain custody of his daughter. In Sam's attempt to find the best lawyer possible, he not only gains a lawyer, but a friend, who he eventually teaches a thing or two about what it really means to love. Despite the adversity he faces, Sam holds down a job and refuses to give up, all with the help of his devoted support team. Sean Penn, Dakota Fanning and Michelle Pfeiffer deliver an authentic and emotional account of the love a father and daughter share and the trouble that a father will go through to prove that love.This film accurately portrays the idea that an individual's intellectual capacity has no correlation or bearing on their ability to be a parent and to love their child. Regardless of the fact that Sam has the intellectual capacity of a seven-year old, his love for his daughter is unmatched. The bond and love Sam and Lucy share is evident throughout the film and eventually proves to those who doubt his ability to provide her with what she needs, that he is more than capable of loving his daughter. This film also conveys the general message that individuals with disabilities are still humans and deserve to be treated as so. These individuals are wrongfully marginalized in society; they deserve to be treated with respect, kindness and love just as anyone else would like to be treated. Sam proves that he is a capable individual by overcoming adversity and working to prove his dedication to Lucy. Kids often do not realize the impact of their words or actions, hence the saying \"kids will be kids,\" which was clearly demonstrated in this film. When Connor, Lucy's friend joins Sam and Lucy for dinner, Connor asks why Sam is acting like that and uses the \"r-word\" to describe him. He then proceeds to ask Lucy if she is the same as Sam because she is his daughter. Sticking with the negative reactions of children, at the Halloween party when Sam is dancing around in costume, the kids all stop what they are doing to just watch and laugh at him. Sadly, children are not the only ones who negatively perceive Sam. Rita often questions Sam's ability to do certain tasks, like order food or pay a check because he does so a little slower than others. These perceptions all demonstrate the idea of putting an individual's disability for the individual. Luckily, Sam has a support system that invariably sticks by his side as well as a lawyer with an eventual change of heart and a neighbor who loves both Lucy and Sam. Rita explains to those in the courtroom that one's intellectual capacity has nothing to do with one's ability to love and Rita tells those in court that she never questions Sam's ability as a father, and the only thing she does worry about is that if they take Lucy away from Sam, that she will be missing a piece of her she will spend the rest of her life trying to fill. The support that Sam receives from his boss at Starbucks also demonstrates positive advocacy in that they have a close relationship and he trusts him to work there.To anyone who is looking for an emotional roller-coaster ride that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, want to go and hug all of your family members, and everything in between, this is the perfect movie for you. I Am Sam is one of the most accurately portrayed films I have seen in terms of illustrating an image of individuals with disabilities. This film draws you in, makes you feel a connection to each character involved and does so all while conveying an important message that is worth understanding. You will not regret watching this film.",

But as the film wore on, the audience was burdened with trite, spill-your-guts cliched scenes in which little Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is spirited away from her heartbroken father by the big mean scary social workers, and conspired against by the perversities of the modern justice system. We are asked to believe the idealistic, but entirely unfounded notion that sincere intentions and the heart of a saint will suffice for the upbringing of a precocious child, never mind the father's narrow scope of mental capabilites. Notwithstanding, the soundtrack shines with copious alternative pop renditions of Beatles favorites, but the cinematography, with its merciless and unyielding cuts and jerks, is enough in itself to significantly cripple the coherent inner ear, not to mention the movie's rating.In short, \"I Am Sam\" may jerk tears more than once in 130 minutes, but it ultimately tries too hard to secure an emotional reaction. 3/10",

Most people know how hard that would be without being shown exaggerated tears, even though Dakaota Fanning plays the mature daughter of Sam. The lack of editorial timing and using the audiences sensitivity towards the subject wasn't enough to be a masterpiece. That did not prevent me from wanting to see the characters relationship as father and daughter. Their efforts make this movie relevant and very watchable.",

            "content": "So I guess I'll start with saying I did like this movie, and I was surprised to see such harsh reviews however some of the plot points that drive the story don't make sense, so I'm making this review to get the confusion after watching out of my head.first let's start with the driving force that caused cps to heavily pursue terminating Sam's guardianship of his daughter. (Besides the concern from Lucy's school)It seemed to me, that the charges for soliciting prostitution were dropped, as authorities were able to determine that Sam was not intellectually capable of knowing the woman was a prostitute, yet this seems to come up again a few times as one of the driving points of him being unfit to raise a child.-Secondly even at a glance the man is heavily disabled, yet no one notices or takes issue with him raising a child basically one his own until she reaches 1st grade? That doesn't really add up for me. I don't think he would have even been allowed to leave the hospital with a newborn except for the fact that the it was assumed the mother wasn't going to abandon them both the second she gave birth.Also, when I think about it, I would wonder if CPS wouldn't have been checking on aftercare arrangements for the baby prior to the mother being discharged.Lots and lots of stretches to the imagination to make this scenario work.Anyway, if you ignore these sort of glaring plot holes it was a good enough movie, the court scenes were brutal as it was obvious that he was an extremely loving, albeit heavily disabled father.I liked the camera work chosen for these scenes especially when Sam is being questioned by the prosecution. It really gave the viewer a glimpse into how disorienting and overwhelming it is to live in this society with a severely impairing intellectual disability.Really heartbreaking to think that this is a reality for many people.In the end, I wanted him to have custody of his daughter because of the deep love & bond they shared, but even I had to agree that sadly he wasn't capable of doing this, as the movie points out, even parents without these particular challenges struggle as successfully raising a child is one of the hardest things one can do in life.It's heavily implied that he will have more help with Lucy going forward, and honestly her character seems smart enough to essentially raise herself.I also found that to be a bit unrealistic, unless Lucy was actually intellectually gifted herself. Maybe that was the case, and something implied that went over my head.I do think it's drawn out a bit longer than it needs to be to get the message across, but for all those saying it's just overly sappy and sensitive I can't say I really felt that. Except with Michelle's character. You don't get to be an ultra rich high powered lawyer like that by having a heart.I buy everything else about her story, especially the break down at the end where she admits that her son & husband hate her, but I just don't believe her changing so radically as to actually grow to care enough to be a part of Sam and Lucy's lives.Anyways, I gave it a 6 for a lot of heart and not skirting around such touchy subjects. I thought everyone did very well in the parts they were casted in, just didn't buy some of Michelle's performance here and there, but when she delivered she did it well.",

            "content": "***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** `I Am Sam' is about growth and acceptance, and how people aren't always what they seem to be at first glance. But it loses track trying to please everyone and what it sets out to do becomes compromised in the delivery of a happy ending.Penn plays the title character, Sam, who suffers from autism. Sam survives, as is shown in the opening credits, by living through routine and order. He has an order to everything and is able to function in `normal' society only by keeping all elements of his day constant. That's why, when Sam impregnates a homeless woman and is left with the kid; his life is affected drastically.Initially, Sam has absolutely no clue how to be a father. He relies on his reclusive neighbor Annie to look over Lucy, his daughter, while he works. His job is at a local Starbucks delivering drinks to tables. He aspires to be behind the counter someday. When he comes home from work Sam faces a new and strange responsibility of taking care of a child. He does so the way he does so many other things: by setting up constants to rely on. Sam eventually develops a routine that includes Lucy, and slowly becomes able to function as he was before the birth.Lucy grows rapidly and her intelligence quickly surpasses that of Sam's. She helps Sam out with reading stories, and grows tired of playing games well before he does. In school she has to deal with taunts about her father and wonders why her dad isn't like the others. Sam, of course, can't explain. Regardless of their awkward relationship, they develop a strong bond. This bond, however, is broken when the Children's and Families' Center takes Lucy away because they think Sam isn't capable of taking care of a child.\nSam's routine is again dramatically changed. He turns to a high profile lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), to help him out with his custody case. She is a vain and self-centered workaholic who cares more about her self-image than anything else. And when she's presented with Sam's case, she immediately turns it down because of his lack of funds. She changes her mind, however, and signs him on as a pro bono case when her colleagues call her greedy and selfish.`I Am Sam' sets out to make people aware of an issue that normally would go unnoticed. And it doesn't quite make its point. This movie, through a series of courtroom scenes, has to come up with a definite decision as to who gets custody of Lucy: Sam or a foster family. Yet, in an effort to make everything come together in a Hollywood sort-of-way, a definite decision is never made. I guess audiences wouldn't like it if Sam never got Lucy back, and any point of making people aware of autism would be lost. But this film doesn't work the way it is.After the first trial the movie seems set to end. But then, in an effort to give Sam a second chance at custody, the movie heads for another trial. What's wrong with that is the film's need to make everything turn out right in the mind of the audience. This film would be fair if the first trial resulted in Sam gaining custody of Lucy, but it chooses to stretch itself out and make a contrived ending difficult to arrive at.\nDeciding, Who will get Lucy? isn't what this film is about. It's about how people like Sam are easily looked over in the world and how people suffering from mental illnesses still can be contributing members to society. And once this film strays from that point to a conventional and, ultimately, unsatisfying plotline, any message of awareness is lost.",

If so, wouldn't that have been a significant basis for finding that she had adequate care?How did he afford his apartments on the money he earns at his job at Starbucks?Sometimes such incongruities in a story simply interfere with the \"willing suspension of disbelief\" and make it impossible to buy into the movie.It would have made much more sense to have this story set earlier in Lucy's life -- some time around the middle of her first year.",

I don't think of Sean Penn when I think of box office blockbusters, but from this point forward, I will.Additionally, Dakota Fanning is a treasure in this film. She was very young at the time but displays such warmth and understanding of her character that it is hard to believe that she is only 7 years old. She acts from the heart and it is hard not to follow her lead and respond from the heart in kind.Michelle Pfieffer is her usual glamorous self, and while she gives a good performance, it seems a more normal acting performance rather than a stand-out one.

To tell you my taste, I will say that my all time favorite (based on emotional response) is The Color Purple. Number two is ET. This evening I discovered a close runner up for number three: I Am Sam.And now I need to go lie down and recover from the emotional experience...If you haven't seen this movie, rent it and keep a box of Kleenex at the ready.",

How can any thinking person find a shred of credibility to this film from the moment the homeless woman refuses to take the child in her arms and the hospital staff hands the child to her retarded father? Then discharge the infant to the same couple? Who pays the hospital expenses? Who pays for formula and baby stuff? Then there is the conspicuous  lack of routine doctor visits, where the circumstance would be noted long before the first grade! We witness Sam and his daughter in a restaurant where Sam gets unreasonably emotional and agitated over not being able to have exactly what he wants to eat, but we are expected to believe that he has been able to cope with the constant challenges of a young child's changing needs and disposition?Nothing holds up including the vocabulary and insights of his mentally challenged friends, the child's saintly compassion and selflessness, the unexplained reason Sam was discharged from an institution with no supervision, ect. (ever hear of social workers?) And who has been caring for Lucy all these years while Sam is working at Starbucks? Was it Ann? If so why was there not more emphasis put on the little girl's attachment to her and why was she not continuing her role in the child's life?I could go on and on with questions that have no answers.

The movie however was very long and very slow at some points. I got up thinking it was over at two different occasions to be yelled at by the people in the back of me to tell me to get out of their way. The movie of course was very touching in many parts and I was getting some water in the eyes, but it didn't dwell on the tear-jerking parts like some movies do. I found the camera work extremely unique in this movie and fascinating. I loved the way they did it. Overall, this is a movie to wait until it comes out to rent it. It was good. 6/10 rating.

Michelle Phieffer plays her role to a tee and is a reminder of what can happen to a family life when a career gets in the way. That said, and without giving anything away let me just say, if you have not ever seen this movie make it a point to see it as soon as possible. Also be prepared to cry and walk away thinking, and thinking, and thinking. Most movies are fiction and made from someones ideas, imagination, etc. I am Sam will leave you feeling like you just experienced a real life event. Remember, all you need is love.",

Penn plays Sam who has a mental capacity of a seven year old. He is raising a daughter with the help of a neighbor and three friends. The friends are also mentally challenged. The problem Sam has is his daughter, played by Dakota Fanning, is growing older and is getting smarter then her father. Social Services sees this as a problem and takes her away. Penn talks to an attorney, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, to help him get his daughter back. She eventually agrees to give her services for free. In a nutshell, the plot of the movie is a fathers love for his daughter and he will do anything to stay with her. For a young actor, Fanning gives a strong performance and almost steals the show. There is some strong language, mostly by Pfeiffer, but that doesn't distract from the movie. This is a heartwarming movie and if you like a good drama, I highly recommend it. I give it a 10 on a scale of 1-10 and you will see why once you have seen the movie.",

To say he blew me away would be an understatement. So I searched high and low for other films that he was critically acclaimed for, and came across I am Sam. I loved it.Not once did Sean Penn slip out of character, not even for a second, and I found myself completely immersed in the idea that he was Sam, letting go of Sean Penn as an actor completely.Not only was Penn outstanding, Michelle Pfeiffer played the development of her character in a wonderfully compelling way, and I think the pair shared a great chemistry between them......however, no chemistry could beat the one that was felt between Penn and Dakota Fanning who played his daughter. Born in 1994 she was seven years old, acting with the enthusiasm and capacity of a woman twice or three times her age.For me, the connection between Penn and Fanning made the movie.The wonderfully sweet and full-of-love storyline is wonderful, and it all makes for a very entertaining watch.Okay, admittedly, life is never this simple, and things don't always end happily, but separate yourself from reality for a few hours, and you'll be right there with Sam and Lucy.",

As for the discomfort, in the 20th minute, I completely sympathized with Sam. The main feelings that the film evoked they are regret, sadness and joy. The reason for how sadness and joy fit together is that it was an immeasurable sadness to even think about the situation, but besides that, the two of them had a joyful and happy relationship and that was very good I felt sorry because the whole situation they were in was, to say the least, unsalvageable. I wanted from the bottom of my heart that he could keep his daughter, but beyond that I knew that it was better than if he couldn't see her at all because an evil person decides. That he would get it back when he took it back to the guardians in the evening. I thought that they would convince the judge with this case. It was a great pleasure to see the end of the film when they play very happily ly\u00e1n. In the real-life equivalents of the story, I would definitely support such games, afternoons and joint programs. However, I had to realize that, no matter how heartbreaking, this was the best possible decision. By being placed in foster care, you can get your needs and a stable, permanent environment. I learned from this film that you can learn something new from anyone. Just like the lawyer. He learned to slow down and calm down a bit. Which in today's world sometimes doesn't hurt. And there is the feeling of sympathy. Here it is not only about the lawyer learning to sympathize, but that that the situation itself taught me to empathize. The film also taught me that love does not depend on intelligence or learning. Anyone can love who wants to. The foster mother also said that no one can love Lucy like her father. Obviously, it is difficult for Lucy she had work to do, but she still felt good and loved her father. Meanwhile, there is also a counterexample. His protective child who does bad things and doesn't listen to anyone because they didn't take care of him that much and he didn't get a good example from the family. You can also see from this example that anyone can raise and take care of anyone who wants to. Overall, the film evoked mixed emotions in me. I was happy until the end because of the relationship between the two of them, but also sad because of the situation. I learned a lot from the characters in the film. The touching story was an excellent example that anyone can learn from anyone if the situation is suitable. Also, there was the visual world, which greatly influenced my emotions. At the beginning of the film, everything it was colorful and bright, then almost until the end it was a dark, gloomy, bluish color scheme, then when it started to become happy, the story returned to a more colorful, brighter picture.",

The meaningful relationships which are carried through this cinematic experience are revolutionary, from Sam's love for Lucy, to the tremendous amount of love and care he receives from his friends, to lastly touching the life of Rita. The role of Annie I felt fell flat at times however, extremely crucial to the storyline. This film was quite difficult to watch at times as I could not imagine myself in these circumstances. It was devastating to watch as Lucy gets taken from Sam as it affects so many of the people in his life. Thankfully his friend suggests a lawyer from the phone book and he manages to get an appointment with her (Rita). In the beginning when first meeting Rita you quickly find that she is not everyone's cup of tea, however as the story unfolds you warm up to her. Throughout the storyline you find Rita begins to have a soft spot towards Sam as she has a 7 year old as well and could not imagine losing him. Slowly as you find Rita begins to warm up to Sam she opens up to him about her issues with her personal life and husband in which he responds that she should leave him. Near the end of the trial Rita comes over to Sam's house to prepare and gives him a suit casually slipping in that her husband left it when he moved out. This lead to my favourite line when Rita says, \"I worry that I've gotten more out of this relationship than you.\" I bet she never thought her life would change so much by one person. Remarkable. The ending scene is Sam refereeing Lucy's soccer game and the two of them are having a blast. This was a wondrous way to end the film as you are hopeful that Sam still gets to be an important part of Lucy's life. I found this film to be captivating from beginning to end. There was just the right amount of comedic aspects to bring your spirits up as the tragedies were unfolding. A true classic for this girl. Solid 8 out of 10.",

What a magnificent find she is for the movie-going public.  (And it's never hard to watch Michelle in a film.  She did a great job, though if the language were edited here and there, it would have made a much better film -- but I digress).We asked ourselves afterwards whether we were laughing at or with the handicapped people -- and we agreed that we were laughing with them.\nThis is such an entertaining film, though I didn't like the moving camera (hand held?) that seemed to make the film look a little like my home videos, but I guess there's some artistic point/approach being made/taken.I know there were a number of holes in the story, but if films are meant to entertain, this really accomplished this.

Michelle Pfeiffer, well she was just OK.  The first 20 minutes or so she was on screen she was terrible but she got better as the story went along and of course as usual she looked great.  I think this is partly because of the character she was portraying a very shallow high strung high profile female attorney.  I don't think this part was really meant for her.?????Spoilers?????But there are a couple of things about this movie that I really disliked.First, this movie was way too long.  It kind of dragged in 2 or 3 places. 10 minutes of the trial court scenes could easily have been cut out without losing much if any of the whole story and would have made this basically a 2 hour movie.Second, and this really annoyed the total heck out me.  The almost constant angle changes in some parts of the movie drove me absolutely nuts.  Why did they use this technique in this type of movie?  I totally don't understand it.  This filming technique just should not be used in a regular run of the mill drama.  None of the other reviews I've read on IMDB have brought up this issue which kind of surprises me but if you see this movie pay attention to this filming technique and see if it just doesn't annoy you a little bit too.I am Sam is a pretty good movie and it's highly recommended but just like most any other movie it has it's faults that in the end can be overlooked in order to say that \"I enjoyed watching this movie\".",

Contrary to popular belief, there are many disabled people who are able to care for their own children, most with some outside help - just as Sam had.The movie of course leaned toward Sam and Lucy reuniting, but with due cause. A man who was capable in raising an infant can be no less dangerous than the fully-grown adult with a child.It is possible for such things to happen, but in their case; Sam succeeded because of the people he knew and the friends he had.  I hardly doubt that a man like Sam would be neglected and forgotten by his co-workers and his friends.This movie was a good sentimental film in which one can't help but cry. Why shouldn't a father be able to keep his daughter?  Eventually - she would be able to take care of him, as he did her.",

It is rare to find other artists who can do justice to a Beatle song but these selections were perfect for the film. The little girl was also very good (Dakota Fanning). I think we will see lots of her over the coming years. Unfortunately, I was most disappointed with Sean Penn's performance. There were too many inconsistencies in his behaviors and capabilities to function in day to day activities. One minute he is an insightful, wise man and the next he's acting like Rainman. Overall, the movie is worth watching but I question the reviews that say this is the best Sean Penn has ever done.",

Michelle Pfeiffer is good (she's done far better) and the supporting cast turned in a pretty decent performance (some of Sam's group of friends are quite charming).Why don't I sound too positive about this movie? Based on a friend's recommendation, I had very high hopes for the film. Unfortunately, I probably started watching it with the wrong idea. 'I am Sam' is a sad, touching melodrama that could very well make you cry (or at least want to).\nAs a few people have mentioned in reviews here, the lack of realism was a bit frustrating. I don't think every movie necessarily needs to strictly follow the laws of reality. But 'I am Sam' deals with subject matter that would be more effective without some of the candy-coating. This movie could have been *SO* much better!I was disappointed with Dakota Fanning's performance as Lucy. I understand it must be tough for child actors not to overact. But she really could have used some guidance in HOLDING BACK. A great example of a child actor NOT over-acting?? See David Dorfman as Sammy in Panic (2000).Michelle Pfeiffer was good, but somewhat disappointing. She seemed a little lazy in the role (especially at the beginning) - not really giving it her all (and I think Pfeiffer is terrific). I was also disappointed in some of the courtroom scenes, and especially the one-sided, stereotypical treatment of child protective services. Isn't it getting old by now? Making the agencies that look out for children's welfare out to be \"the bad guys\" is too easy.Overall, I'd say 'I am Sam' is worth watching, but only if taken as the slightly smarmy melodrama that it is. I would have enjoyed it much more had my expectations not been so high.",

The performances from the actors are phenomenal, Dakota fanning and Penn do a wonderful job depicting a father daughter relationship. I think the most beautiful aspect of this film is that every parent can probably relate to not knowing what to do all the time and there is nothing wrong with that. The main character is a disabled man admitting that shamelessly and answering a complex question so simply everyone just writes it off as Hollywood creating a happy ending. What it means to be a parent? Love and the desire to be there and present for your children. Being a good dad doesn't mean you have to be perfect and its ok to ask for help; being there is the most important part. I guess I'm a sappy guy but I really enjoyed this movie. And if we're talking about whether the actual premise works; I don't know I wasn't raised by a disabled parent and its important to recognize that when saying one side is right or wrong. In this particular situation created by the film where the father is constantly aided by loved ones I would like to think it could work. I don't know how often this happens, but what I do know is that people with disabilities have a lot to give to the world and we should recognize their importance in bringing the best out of humanity.",

Sometimes you have to make things work for the story. There is more to this story than just a single autistic/mentally challenged parent fighting to keep and raise a daughter that has surpassed his intelligence level. There are times when it makes you think and wonder if you (if you are a parent... or at a different level, pet owner)do all that you can do, spend all the time you can, sacrifice things for your child as much as this father has. Yes, his IQ is low, his responsibility at work may not be as demanding and stressful as some of us, but for a challenged individual, I think he's done one hell of a job. Heck, some of us who are able and capable aren't as dedicated as such people!!! I'd recommend this movie (yes, I'd say it's not for all) keeping in mind that there can be hidden messages to you (on a personal level).

I feel all the actors and actresses played their parts to the tee.  The young girl I think was wonderful and cute.  This movie reminds us that a parent and child love is stronger then any government agency.  The acting in this movie was so good that it felt like I was right there feeling everything that each of the characters felt at each moment.  The end of this movie was touching and made you fell like you wanted to hug the little girl too and congratulate Sam on winning her back.  It was just too bad the lawyer and Sam didn't get together but oh well the important thing was that father and daughter were together again.

But when Sam, his friends (all in some way beautifully different from so-called \"normal\" people)join Lucy in purchasing her a new pair of shoes they all leave the shop each holding a red balloon (on the request of one of the friends) and walk across a street like the Beatles did on the cover of their \"Abbey road\" album. In the film not only the problems of a single parent trying to raise his child to the best of his understanding are addressed but child abuse becomes an issue as well. In the figure of the seclusive neighbor it becomes a shocking knowledge to the viewer that memories of a child who suffered past child abuse might be very hard to talk about in public (if at all). Culminating in a court scene where the attorney questions the witness (Sam\u00b4s neighbor) about her relationship to her father her silence reveals the painful past.If the state laws won\u00b4t approve of the biological father to have custody of his child on account of his retardation, they cannot argue a child might have a better home with foster parents, especially when the child was never asked. Plus, the danger of child molestation in a foster home was never an issue in the courtroom. Not only are the details of the story itself beautifully entwined but I can also recommend the movie because of its film techniques used. The slow motion scenes and the freezing technique enables the viewer to slip into Sam\u00b4s role and experience life from his perspective. The routines he needs to keep his daily life afloat are shown in details like \"Every Wednesday he and Lucy go to a certain restaurant\". The solidarity among the friends and even among Sam and his employer at the coffee shop are something to consider. Love and friendship keep things going! An admirable piece of art recommended highly even to those who have not heard of the Beatles yet.",

[part of me wonders if the kid was really his? was the chick already pregnant when she met Sam? was she disabled too?] And if they did have sex, wouldn't that encounter have a major impact on Sam? I'm assuming he probably did not have a ton of experience with women, especially sexually. Did the chick live with him for nine months?and yeah, Laura Dern's character just all of a sudden gave up the fight...but then Sam admits that he can't raise Lucy alone...duh? isn't that the question they are all trying to answer? what about the \"guardianship\" situation that Rita mentions? And if Sam expects the foster parents to stay involved, well what happens when they get their next foster kid and want to adopt that one? how would they have time to raise the new kid AND coddle Sam through raising Lucy?The DVD production notes talk a lot about LA Goal, a social service in LA that helps disabled adults. The film-makers spoke to real disabled fathers to make the film realistic. Then hey, why not showcase LA Goal in the movie and have Sam turn to them for help? I sort of thought that's where his friends came from, but they never mentioned it.Also, if that recluse Annie lady never left her room, how did she eat? or afford her place? I'm surprised Lucy turned out so outgoing with such a strange upbringing. Sam surely had a larger support system than that.Any way, I avoided this film for a long time. When I saw a teaser piece about it on Bravo, I seriously thought Penn and Pfeifer were just goofing off and making fun of disabled people. Ouch! or doing some little improv thing. But no, it was a feature. Now that I've seen the film, I appreciated it's heart but am extremely frustrated by the reality behind the story. Zwick is often guilty of this. \"La la, here's a lovely story based on fantasy which will look like reality\". Hello 30something! Maybe it would have been better as a short film, not giving the viewer any time to question these things. OR maybe a documentary about LA Goal would have been even more uplifting!And were Penn and the movie-trivia guy TOTALLY channeling our old pal Raymond? is there any fresh characterization going on in Hollywood?  \"Hi, I'm Sean Penn. For this movie, I'm going to put on my Dustin Hoffman Autistic mask. Look at me!\"Otherwise, it was pretty cool to see Brent Spiner selling shoes.",

            "content": "Director, Jessie Nelson, uses the father/daughter all alone in the world scenario in I Am Sam that she used in Corrina, Corrina (1994). Although the story lines are completely different both movies depict unrealistic plots. I Am Sam, however unrealistic was an emotional feel good movie that kept me cheering for the under dog. I Am Sam, starring Sean Penn as Sam Dawson is about a mentally challenged father who is trying to raise a child on his own. The theme that is carried throughout the movie is that the love between a parent and child cannot be measured by intelligence.This movie added a new dimension to Sean Penn's repertoire of characters. Penn's portrayal of a mentally challenged adult was very convincing. Penn's character was very meticulous when performing his duties at Starbucks. In addition to his meticulous mannerisms his dialect also added to the believability of the character. It was hard to imagine while watching the movie that this was same actor that portrayed Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) or the sergeant in Casualties of War (1989).There is no doubt from the moment Penn becomes a single parent that he has love and commitment for his daughter. His first nights are trying but Penn does not loose his temper, which would have been more in character for him. With the help of Dianne Wiest, Penn's neighbor Annie, he learns about feeding times and is able to settle into a comfortable routine.Yet another example of Penn's love for his daughter occurs when Lucy, his daughter played by Dakota Fanning, is ready to advance with her reading. At this point both father and daughter are at about the same level of intelligence. Fanning is reluctant to progress and pass by her father. Once Penn is aware of the situation he encourages and insists she reads more difficult books. There is no doubt that parenting, especially single parenting, can be complicated even for the most prepared and intelligent person. When Social Services becomes involved in Penn's life and removed Fanning from the home this presented the perfect opportunity for him to return to his normal routine life. However, Penn's resolution, determination and love for his daughter leads him to incorporate the help of high-powered attorney Rita Harrison played by Michelle Pheiffer. Reluctantly Pheiffer takes the case. In the beginning it is apparent Pheiffer feels as the rest of the `normal' establishment that the current situation is probably in the best interest of Fanning. After realizing the lengths Penn will go for his daughter and the love that becomes evident to her Pheiffer puts enormous effort behind the case. The movie makes you reevaluate the bureaucracy and social over involvement of our society. Is it really an outsiders place to determine what is best for a child that is obviously loved and well cared for? I Am Sam makes one think as well as feel-good as the credits roll.",
