            "content": "About halfway through the movie, I was actually considering giving this a 4, but the complete and utter lack of reasoning in this movie that made me give it a 1 I will now try to sum up.The ghost made a website that people can log (and start hallucinating from) onto only 48 hours later they will be dead unless they find her body so she can exact revenge on someone who killed her on another website that people subscribe to, even though she kills other people in car crashes and train accidents who had no involvement with her death.Things I learned from FearDotCom:-Ghosts are capable of creating websites.-The internet is inherently evil.-People who use the internet are freaks.-People who use the internet are incapable of closing their eyes.-A bunch of weird images on a computer can drive someone crazy and make them hallucinate.-A bunch of weird images on a movie can drive someone so crazy that they hallucinate so they think what they are watching makes one ounce of logical sense.Obviously the producers of this movie wanted the audience to be driven insane by the film and have shut off our brains by the time the \"ending\" has arrived. Sadly, I was still conscious at the end which didn't explain anything and only dropped my score from a 4 to a 1.And it's a very boring movie too. Did I mention this movie sucks?",

Well the answer, it's worse then I remember, time has of course been unkind, so it now looks dated, but worse, it's an incoherent mess, that makes absolutely no sense. I will give some credit to Natasha McElhone, who does at least try and give a sincere performance, but she was up against it in this dire film.At the time the production values were pretty good, so I won't slate it for ageing, but I will slam it for being a terrible film, that makes no sense at all, it never decides whether it wants to be a thriller or a supernatural horror.Avoid. 2/10",

            "content": "After some mysterious deaths showing the same symptoms in the victims, Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone), from the Department of Health, investigates the possibility of a virus in the city with Homicide Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff). However, they realize that all the victims have visited an Internet site called 'www.fear.com' forty-eight hours before dying. A further investigation shows that there is a ghost on the web killing its users. Meanwhile, Detective Mike Reilly is also investigating a murderer called Alistair Pratt, 'The Doctor' (Stephen Rea). This movie has good and bad points. The story is plagiarized from the excellent and original Japanese 'Ringu', but the American 'The Ring' was a copy and became a success. There are some flaws along the confused plot. But there are also interesting points. For example, the dark and rainy atmosphere recalls 'Seven'. There is a sort of contrast between the modern (computer, Internet, cars) and life in the 30's or 40's (old buildings, classic costumes and furniture), recalling a film-noir, with a beautiful photography and style. There are also some reasonable special effects. The cast is slightly above average, with Natascha McElhone, Stephen Rea and Stephen Dorff. Therefore I dare to say that it is a watchable movie and I do not agree with the User Rating. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'MedoPontoCombr' ('FearDotCom')",

            "content": "Feardotcom might not be a masterpiece by any means with its weird supernatural plot, at times cheap special effects and wooden actors and actresses but it certainly doesn't deserve the loath and ridicule it has received upon release. The story revolves around a dynamic police officer and a clever researcher who investigate a series of strange deaths that have occured after the victims visited a website depicting voyeuristic torture murder. It turns out that the website is haunted by one of its victims who is seeking for vengeance. The police officer and the researcher attempt to find out more about the victim's case to stop the haunting and arrest the serial killer behind the website to put an end to the violence.The movie's main flaw is that its generous budget of forty million dollars hasn't been used very efficiently. The special effects are average at best, the actors and actresses are at times misplaced and the director failed to make a dynamic, fluid and emotional movie out of the script. It isn't hard to understand why this film became a box office bomb.However, the movie isn't without its merits. The atmosphere is gloomy from start to finish. The dirty locations blend in perfectly. The lighting techniques and sound effects are employed with care. The idea to show the dark side of the internet back in the early years of the millennium wasn't completely new as it had been portrayed in Pulse, Ringu and Videodrome before but said intention was nevertheless already ahead of its time.In the end, you will enjoy Feardotcom if you are looking for a very atmospheric supernatural thriller with some grisly violence. The movie is stylish, gruesome and entertaining. If you are however looking for high-quality special effects, a clever plot and gifted acting performances, then this movie and genre simply aren't your cup of tea.",

            "content": "If the survival of horror films depends on titles such as this \"FearDotCom\", we are indeed facing the downfall of the genre. This is lame, uninspired and repetitive garbage that irritates you from start to finish. Director William Malone's idea of suspense exists out of underexposed and fuzzy images of murders edited together in boisterous flashes that actually show you NOTHING. Add a poorly written script about a murderous website and completely unconvincing characters to this and you've got yourself one of the biggest cinema-turkeys since the new millennium. If the premise of this film rings a bell, it means that you recognize it from the Japanese cult hit \"Ringu\"\u0085. Or the slightly inferior American remake \"the Ring\". Only, the videotape has been replaced by an internet website and the poor victims have only 2 days left to live after being exposed instead of 7. Typical for an unscrupulous rip-off\u0085Faster, louder and modernized! The elaboration is a mess: weak dialogue, plot holes all over the place, no style or atmosphere and very bad acting. I can't believe class actors like Udo Kier and Stephen Rea were talked into accepting roles like this? Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times. Stephen Dorff and the leading lady deliver lousy performances in roles that really don't fit them. Dorff as a tough, experienced copper? Doubtful\u0085 Perhaps what annoyed me most about the cast (shallow, I admit) is seeing how one of my all-time favorite B-actors, Jeffrey Combs, is given such a small and insignificant role! That's Doctor Herbert West from Re-Animator we're talking about, dammit! Show a little more respect, Malone! If you love horror, you should avoid \"FearDotCom\" at all costs!

The acting is bad, the dialogue is worse, and the editing is terrible. The film lacks coherence, cohesiveness, and, in some parts, comprehensiveness. The film manages to maintain its unwatchability for over an hour, but by that point the viewer will probably have already logged onto www.feardotcom.com in hopes of ending the misery. If I had been able to give this movie less than a star, I would have done so in a heartbeat.

            "content": "I do not really remember how I came upon this movie, but I do know that somewhere along the way it has made it's way into my DVD collection. I do not know if I blindly bought it, was given it as a \"gift\", or if someone lent it to me and I just forgot to return it, but whatever way, it is in there now. I watched it quite some time ago, expecting it to be decent enough, entertaining at least, because I really liked the tagline and the premise seemed fun, though I have learned to stay away from a lot of \"technology killing\" horrors over the past few years now, and I remembered before I watched it again recently that I hated it the first time I watched it, a lot, and it was very negatively reviewed as well. Watching it again confirmed my feelings.The film itself is just entirely ridiculous and absurd from beginning to end with a horrible storyline and lame performances and \"thrills\". There is zero to none interesting scenes that make the viewer feel creeped out or enticed in any way, and the whole film is a joke within itself. I especially hated the ludicrous characters and twists, and also the way the story was executed in a poor manner, not being able to stay with one main idea for too long that it is infuriatingly annoying to watch the plot, what plot there is at least, unfold. The movie resembles a little diddy of a film titled \"Ringu/The Ring\" an awful lot, though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales entirely in comparison, and even though there are some nice settings in this movie, that is really and truly the only plus side to it.There are many noticeable errors and plot holes, the dialogue is, for our inconvenience, not as laughable as one would hope, but corny enough to get a few giggles now and then, especially some of the deliverances from the female lead, and the climax/ending is not anywhere near heartracing or interest sparking, just bland and hardly tolerable. There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer, which was not accomplished in my situation, and a lot of material is just thrown in there randomly, which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed and extremely mediocre. My summary pretty much warns anyone and everyone away from this movie, unless you are a masochist and want to be put through this pain.",

            "content": "Following a series of strange deaths, a detective and a health officer investigating the deaths find the link to be caused through their logging onto a website haunted by the ghostly victim of a serial killer and race to stop him in order to end the rampage.Overall this one wasn't all that bad but did have a few glaring problems. Among the many problems here is the story itself is pretty weak, with the main point serving between the evil spirit and the website, as the film really has two separate plots that are put together in one of the most confusing ways possible. While the first half is a nicely drawn-up detective story about a possible killer virus, the later search for the website and its resident ghostly haunting is completely nonsensical and doesn't offer up much of anything really coherent about the connection. If the entire purpose is to find revenge on the perpetrator of her crime, which this one is certainly striving toward, then the need to haunt the website rather than go straight for the source utilizing the power of the internet seems like a waste by killing those who log on who have no connection to anything. It makes no sense at all, and only results in more split hairs trying to connect the dots of what was at stake by being so disjointed and completely out of sync. There are some rather nice moments here and there, though, that tend to make this enjoyable. The biggest plus here is that there's a couple of really decent suspense scenes along the way, from the opening in the subway station where one victim sees a young girl playing with her ball on the tracks as a train approaches, jumps down to the tracks to try to save her but disappears at the last second and he then tries to avoid the train by plastering himself against a wall. A later scene where a man goes out to his car only to find the young girl playing outside the car and it to then turn into a self-controlled vehicle that delivers a devastating crash nearby is rather enjoyable, and t he most inventive one is when a character becomes paranoid while walking up a stairwell and suddenly sees a small ball that then melts down into a ball of cockroaches that begin chasing her around the apartment in a truly creepy, frenzied scene. That all of these rather frenzied and chaotic scenes work is due to the nature of the ghosts throughout here which has a rather creepy vibe placed here that manages to overcome the somewhat obvious CGI nature of the effects and becomes quite enjoyable throughout getting that on display. Coupled with the intriguing premise and nice gore throughout here, these are enough to hold out but not to overcome the flaws.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Nudity.",

Behind the website is a snuff film maker that shows footage of him killing people 'erotically.' The director of this movie must has some screws loose in his head.

A medium that kills because you watch it (in 'The Ring' a videotape, here an internet-site), a little girl that is probably the key to solve the problem, a woman and a guy searching for the answer, both saw the site and therefor they both have to hurry, and why they have to hurry has something to do with earlier events. Here they have 48 hours to solve this mystery that involves The Doctor, a killer who broadcasts live killings over the internet. Well, not just killings. He tortures a woman for a long time and in the end there must be a point where the woman asks him to be killed. And so it is done.To tell more about the messy plot would be stupid. I am not even sure if I understand everything. After you have seen the internet-site you die of your worst fear in 48 hours, that I did understand, but why do 'infected' people see the little girl over and over again while she herself was killed as an adult? I probably missed it but like I said it doesn't really matter. The scary visuals have something admirable. The images are really haunting but again I liked the videotape from 'The Ring' a lot more.

But, of course, give benefits to the voice of the people, because this is one hot mess, flawed on every level.A New York City detective investigates mysterious deaths occurring 48 hours after users log onto a site named feardotcom. 'Nough said. Story-wise, \"Feardotcom\" reminded me of J-horror, finer examples like \"Ringu\", \"Ju-On\", \"Pulse\", etc., all starts with mysterious deaths, all seems dark and grimy, mystery needs to be find out, and there is almost always a scary (little) girl involved. \"Feardotcom\" has all of that, but to no success. A familiar plot is continuously sabotaged by a gloom-doom-overkill cinematography and darkly messy visual depiction of New York City, silly, often highly expositional, point-out-the-obvious dialogues, sub-par acting, eyebrow-raising and overcooked action sequences with odd editing solutions, and so and so forth. Worst of all, the film takes itself dead seriously, and possesses little to no wit, so the product turned rather preposterous. Stephen Dorff grunts his way through, Natascha McElhone delivers a funky performance & Stephen Rea is maybe a little creepily amusing as the over-the-top torturer.

            "content": "'Feardotcom' was filmed in Luxembourg (apparently standing in for New York, I think.) and hasn't been officially released yet. I saw it as one of the featured films during the Luxembourg International Film festival. (Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title might change. However, since every second of the film was even more tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen, I believe no amount of focus groups or editing could save this film. I'd say 'straight to video', but that would be a major waste of plastic and cardboard. I suppose if they market it as a parody, they might salvage the cost of, um, the catering during the film.Stephen Dorff plays a hard-boiled detective who's haunted by that one case that was never solved. You know he's haunted because he walks around with a 3 day growth of beard. Which stays at the same length the whole film, even though the film covers quite a few days (it was hard tell, nothing was very coherent) And guess what! His old nemesis from the unsolved case is killing again! Oh boy! And since we now have new cases to solve, AND they're dying from what looks to be a virus, we need to bring in the woman scientist and nominal love interest (Natascha McElhone - who displayed quite amply in 'The Truman Show' that she can't act. She must work cheap, or maybe they needed someone to make Dorff look good.) We know she's a scientist because she wears glasses. And just for grins we get Jeffrey Coombs as Dorff's partner, whose main role appears to be running around spouting non-sequiturs. Speaking of which, there was a writer listed for the film but I'd bet a Ben Franklin that they were making up the dialog as they went along, and probably for a different film. It's too bad 'Deep Space 9' went off the air - it might have prevented Coombs from getting caught up in this travesty. And there's Stephen Rea as the mad scientist, looking vaguely like Geoffrey Rush mad scientist character in 'Mystery Men.' Now, I could have sworn Rea could act, so maybe they are two of them? Amazingly a director is also listed, but from what I can tell they pretty much turned on the camera, came back later, took the film to the editing room, forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing. That would explain a lot.And what of the plot? Ha! There isn't one! Well, OK, maybe a little one. I think the deal was that the girl killed in the unsolved case somehow inhabited the internet and is killing people if they log on to the mad scientist's site, where HE tortures women until they beg him to kill them - and all for $9.95! (but just for grins they (the unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds, and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up connection. Um, anyway, she's going to keep on killing people unless the mad scientist is caught. And her body is found too. I mean they threw that bit in there about finding the body, but then when it was found, it didn't count for anything! Now, doesn't that just bite. Damn fickle internet ghosts.**SPOILER**Actually this whole film was a spoiler, at least it smelled spoiled to me. Anyway - the final scene where Dorff and the McElhone rush into the mad scientist's lair (located in an abandoned steel mill or nuclear plant - the film couldn't make up it's mind what it was - it identified it as both during different scenes in the film) and stop him only seconds before he's going to kill his latest victim had me rolling in the aisle with laughter. It was just like watching an old horror film from the 30's or 40's. Maniacal laughter, bug-eyed expressions of madness, flashing lights, tilted camera angles. So they manage to save the girl, but then the mad scientist shoots Dorff, and then stabs McElhone then Dorff grabs a keyboard and logs into feardot.com which drives the mad scientist so mad - he dies from fear! Then Dorff dies, and McElhone, who was in love with Dorff (oh, did I leave that part out? - apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene earlier in the film - some real in-depth character development going on here.) sort of cries over his body, but um, somehow she's no longer stabbed! Maybe it was her Multi-vitamin.**END OF SPOILER**So -um, in conclusion - I can't imagine any changes to this film possibly making it watchable. I'll be surprised if gets released at all (though the executive producer said Warner Bros had picked it up for US distribution, and Columbia-Tri-Star for the rest of the world. Let's hope they come to their senses.) You have been warned. Go watch 'Donnie Darko' instead!",

Those strands that do exist are very loose and don't really hang convincingly well together.  The end result is that there is no real tension to speak of \u0096 certainly no fear.

What I didn't expect was for it to be so bad.1. What was up with the lighting?  Did they spend the entire budget on the website graphics and not have enough left over for electricity?2.  How many times can one movie reuse special effects from House On Haunted Hill?  The \"ghosts\" walking around and having a seizure?  The \"ghost\" at the end looked so much like the \"shadow\" from HOHH that I was waiting for Famke Janssen to pop out of it looking for Geoffrey Rush.  The even ripped off the gory statues that could be found in the foyer to the basement in HOHH.3.  How did the main characters fall in love after meeting for two seconds? They had very little chemistry together.  Which is probably due to the fact that Natascha McElhone CAN'T ACT!4.  The website issue and Denise the ghost woman were never really tied together that well either.  AND, while we're on the subject of little Miss Ghost Denise, what mother would let her hemopheliac 8 year old walk 2 miles down the street to play in an old abandoned steel mill?With a running time of 98 minutes that felt like 3 hours, by the end of feardotcom I had laughed so much that I really didn't care how it ended.  I only wish that McElhone hadn't survived either, because the last part of the movie, the epilogue of her answering the phone and it being just static made no sense either.Thank God they showed a preview for Ghost Ship!",

I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie off after the first 20 minutes or so. In the first 1-2 minutes, I was hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo Kier in it! My god, how wrong I was...When the movie reached the 20 minutes mark, I was so desperate, that I've never been in my life. By then, it was pretty obvious, that this is a bad movie. It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the start but goes downhill later; no. It was bad from the beginning to the end.There is no story. There is no acting. There is no direction. Character-development? Did you see any characters in this movie? Or can I even write down the word \"movie\" regarding this cinematic torture? I think, not. I won't. Moreover, I won't write anything more about this awful piece of film-making (Hmm... where did I see film-making in this? I really need to stop writing this comment, before I write some more ridiculous stuff. \"Filmmaking\", holy jeez...).IMDb's lowest rating is \"awful\". This word hardly represents the suffering you go through watching FearDotCom. This is the only movie I rated 1 on this site, and when the credits started rolling, I immediately put this movie into the AAAC-category. What does AAAC mean? AVOID AT ALL COST!!! 1/10",

Then you get to see a wacko torture people live on the website. Which begs the first question: Is a ghost running his website? How does he pay her?Basically the problem with this movie is it tries to develop a mystery about things we don't care about. So the cops are on the case after people show up dying around the city. Turns out they all visited this website and died soon after. So, of course, the brain surgeon cops log on as well. Now they're in trouble. Weird things happen to them and a little ghost girl with a bouncing ball show up. Follow the bouncing ball stupid!So it all ends up with this girl and the wacko on the website being connected somehow. The ghost in the machine is guiding people to the doctor. If you can't unravel the mystery, she'll kill you for not trying.It kind of choked on its own plot. It was too much. I would have been happy with just the ghost.

            "content": "Every so often a film will come along that requires a fair deal of sacrifice. You have to sacrifice your personal code of what you come to call of perfection and you must view the world through your eyes and not your mind. Feardotcom is one of those films. In a grey world, with a blue atmosphere and a black existence, lies a man, bleeding from the eyes from some sort of hemerage, dead, because of his plagued visions of a little blonde girl with a white ball. The case is brought forward to a detective who fears germs and disease and one who works with them at the Department of Health. As they search for the answers of why so many people are being found dead, bleeding from the eyes they stumble upon a website entitled feardotcom.com. As more research is made available they are able to link the death of the victim to occurring exactly forty-eight hours after logging on to the site. Then comes the obligatory promise to not visit that site at any cost but instantly break it as soon as the others back is turned. There are three functioning parties within the parameters of this film. There are the good guys. The bad guy, a medical reject that is known only as The Doctor. This is a man who believes that death is an art and therefore should be as graphic as possible. He tortures his victims until they beg to die and then he kills them, making him an artist instead of a murderer. The last formation in this morbid puzzle is a blonde dominatrix, a pale little girl with a white ball and a rotting corpse at the bottom of a flooded reservoir. She is a neutron force that keeps the cell process moving in a forward fashion. She is neither good nor evil. She kills but does so in hopes of redemption. A person searching for something but hasn't found the right key to unlock her treasure chest of ghastly bliss. The problem here is that neither the Doctor nor does the ghost have any connecting factors. First the cops search for the Doctor, then they becomes side tracked by the site that is killing people and search for the ghost and forget about the Doctor, until they finally set the ghost aside and go back to searching for the doctor. This film is an incoherent mess that possesses no bonding materials to make its story move at one pace and stick to one thing at a time. It is like a huge black whole where things come out of and get sucked back in as they feel. Scenes end short with no others to vouch for them. People are found dead and forgotten about and detectives find things without having to search for them, only to have nothing in which to apply them to in the future. But we must take into consideration that this is one of the best boring films I have ever seen. It's a film that makes promises to its viewer and then breaks them because it can. It is more of an experience than a film itself. It is a group of scenes that would make David Lynch bow his head in honours but would never be dumb enough to form a movie around. It is a cyber kinetic game that plays with its viewer's emotions. Why do you look at car crashes even though you know you don't want to see what could have happened to the victim? It is because people want to see something that they shouldn't. It's a voyeuristic tendency that people have that could push oneself to the edge of decency and still leave the person hungry for more. This is a film that wants to feed our fetishes with the obscene by being as sick and twisted as possible. We are shown skinned human carcasses, blood spewing reptile like women and live surgery, all broadcast on the Internet. The human body is a network of gears and leavers that read codes that enable life, so why can't computers do the same thing? The Internet is a body of work that previews the future by utilizing the past. Yet this is not a smart film, it ditches the idea of having something to say within the first half an hour. It has no moral code and follows no ingenious rules, it goes wherever it wants, whenever it wants and has no problem in knowing that it is absolutely terrible. You could probably get the same effect of this film from lining up four televisions in a row and playing Seven, Dee Snider's Strangeland, the Cell and House on Haunted Hill all at once. It is one huge mash of colours and feeling that the eyes will love but the brain will loathe. The film was directed by William Malone who knows how to make terrible horror films (House on Haunted Hill) that are like nice, big, juicy, red apples. They look delicious until you bite into it and get a mouthful of a nice plump worm. This is one of the most visually stunning films of the year and one of the most inconsistent all at the same time. This is a film that has so much going for it that that its priorities get lost in the cause and become little of the effect. But although this is a truly brilliant film, it is nothing more than a W.Y.S.I.W.Y.G. (what your see is what you get). It suffers in trying to compare but results in little contrast. The visuals have really nothing to do with anything that happens in this film. It's not some deep, emotional burden that uses symbolic structures and astounding breakdowns to amplify the viewer's attention span and make them think. This is a run-of-the-mill detective thriller with a ghost story twist. It has no symbolic substance meaning that if you really wish to see how miraculous this film is you have to watch this film in such a fashion that you will be able to absorb the films good qualities, on mute. William Malone, a man whose fascination with fear allows him to produce the product but rarely radiate it, directed the film. I think it would suit Malone wonderfully to consider becoming a conceptual artist of take up the art of silence film. The film also sees Malone in one of the years most ironic pairing in actor Stephen Dorff (neither seems to read scripts before signing on to films). Dorff is the films greatest asset in that he is the most talented man on screen and he does the best he can to make this film seem like a real detective film. As for Stephen Rea as the Doctor, he falls flat on his face. Rea is one of the most boring and unthreatening villains I have ever seen, clearly this guy called in a favour to get this role. Since this film was released I have seen nothing but negative comments for it, which, in all entirety, it deserves. But in all honesty there is more good about this film than people are willing to realize because they are bogged down by the incepted story and not willing to care about anything else. But for the most part, in the genre of bad films, this one is just about the best.",

A film so awful that I got a headache - not because the plot was so complex and intelligent, but because the plot was so ridiculous and unrealistic. It's simple: when you go in search of a killer, call for backup. Don't go alone into an empty building. Have some common sense! Unfortunatelt, all the characters in FeardotCom, seem to have been born without the common sense gene. I could suffer through dozens of cheesy horror flicks where the victim getting chased by a killer conveniently trips and falls down while the killer get increasingly closer. . . I could even suffer through poor acting in a horror flick if the plot is entertaining and at least scary.

After that it is all downhill as we meet the main characters Mike And Terry, as they investigate what happened to the guy getting hit by a subway train.  From then on the plot becomes extremely convoluted, but basically it amounts to what happens when you log onto a web site and are told you have three days....to live as it turns out.  Of course, we know right away that Mike is going to log on, and Terry, not having a good bit of sense either will soon do the same.  There is a mad doctor, kidnapping young ladies and performing autopsies while they're still alive (for all you gore seekers hoping for a thrill forget it.....this is all done in some sort of razzmatazz cryptic electornically distorted view).

So though the ghost is avenged at the end of the movie, we really don't care because the ghost itself was so evil killing innocent people to achieve it's goal.

Well, FEARDOTCOM is certainly mindless; indeed, I muttered out loud when the credits were running, \"Oh my God! They actually had a writer!\" Could have fooled me -- I was literally expecting one of those \"Script by Committee\" acknowledgments; whoever Josephine Coyle is I sure hope she doesn't quit her day job (her only other credit listed at IMDb is as a \"production coordinator\" for PRESENCE OF MIND in 1999).And, largely because of that miserable excuse for a script, it winds up being not a good ANY kind of film: When the bloody hell are film makers going to realize the rather elementary truth (as in Kindergarten level) that if you don't have a good script, you don't have a film? Period! Never mind good production values (and I hate to admit it but they ain't bad), good direction (this definitely has none of that - Lord! The number of bloopers is just astonishing SPOILER**Just as a for instance: When McElhone rushes into the psychiatric ward of the hospital to talk to Dorff (with no explanation WHY he's in a psychiatric unit), is directed to his room \"first door on the left,\" she is instantly there, finds him having a full-on seizure (with no medical people in attendance, mind you), and suddenly -- when she, oh, so frightfully conveniently gets a phone call -- NOW she's got to go out the door onto a stair landing and through yet another doorway before she's back in the same corridor! Really good continuity there, folks!) END SPOILER.I have admired Stephen Dorff in many films **but this was just, well, a grunting quasi-Neanderthal that pretty much embodied every tired clich\u00e9 there is for a world weary cop since sometime in the 1930s**! (**Oh yeah! And somebody really should point out to this generally admirable young actor that if you have a story in which the primary character doesn't \"solve\" the main problem, but instead winds up a clueless bystander, you just don't have a viable story.**) I adored Natasha McElhone in MRS DALLOWAY (and -- even GIVEN the weaknesses of the character in the script -- in THE TRUMAN SHOW), and have been an admirer of Stephen Rea ever since THE CRYING GAME, too -- but I can't figure out why they agreed to do this one; did they all need some quick-and-dirty money or something. . . .Usually one can at least learn something from a genuinely bad movie (which this is) but with this one, for the very first time, I wanted to go back to my film rental store and demand my $3.50 back on general principles.I'm glad I didn't follow my first impulse to shut the show down at the end of the \"first reel\" 20 minute period, because I can quite honestly report about this disaster of a movie: Dreadful!

The cinematography for Fear Dot Com contains one of the darkest looks that has been seen for quite awhile. Even daytime sequences have a moody overtone that give off the feeling of a different world. Everything is very dark, and very blue. This adds to the surreal, sinister, melancholy atmosphere of the film.Sort of a cross between Seven and The Ring, along with a dash of the soon to be popular 'torture porn' sub-genre, Fear Dot Com has a reputation as a really bad movie, which may be one reason why it's taken me until now to watch it, but within just a couple of minutes the movie didn't seem that bad at all and I was onboard. The storytelling is incredibly chaotic, and yet I quite enjoyed Fear Dot Com. Maybe some of that was due to me expecting the worst, but its surreal and dark atmosphere gripped me. The flick dealt some heavy freak out moments done with some fine dramatic no-holds-bared acting. A stand out moment from actress Amelia Curtis (Denise) as she descended into total and utter madness as she looses mind in epic fashion. This scene is worth the price of admission. Some very good macabre stuff in this film. Fear Dot Com makes you think, after the first time you've seen it, that you've seen a considerably more brutal film than you actually have, and director Malone, deserves credit for going down this trippy path.With great sound, lighting and camera work that opens a door way to the surreal . Some very sick and disturbing images . Strong dramatic acting from Dorff and the lovely Natascha McElhoneand (Solaris 2002). Add for the horror buff Jeffrey Combs puts in one of his always fun appearances. Fear Dot Com poor reputation isn't to me really deserved. It was a trippy, dark and intense film. I found it to be freakishly entertaining. 8/10",

You put those good bits together with those from other films and you have masterpieces. For me, much of the impact of film is in memory rather than that brief dark period of exhibition. The real influence on my life and imagination comes from these memories and it is a small task to assemble my own film from experiences.\nFor instance: `Attic Expeditious' had a terrific story, `13 Ghosts' a pretty cool notion of environment as mechanical demigod, `Dark City' was visually self-referential, and this turkey has some haunting cinematography. Yes, it is poorly written, yes, the acting is off kilter, yes it doesn't engage. So what? This is just a very, very bad film in a vast heap of bad films.`The Ring' (US version) worked for me largely because of the self-reference, like `Cut.' Here was a film about films that kill. Transferring the notion to a website, which isn't passive and narrative is where the primary flaw is, I think. Until we have the `Tulse Luper' websites, and if they live up to the promise, we just won't have websites of narrative, visual power.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

Too many of the \"scares\" were laughable, too many of the scenes pointless.The only saving grace for my $5.50 was the trailer for \"Ghost Ship\" before the movie.The lead actress, Natascha McElhone,looks like a cross between Crystal Gayle and Meryl Streep, with the acting ablitiy of Tawny Kitaen.

            "content": "Ok, so my boyfriend and I were going to go see this while it was in the theaters but we never quite made it (Perhaps it was a divine stroke of luck). So we rented the DVD from a video store. We were delayed from seeing it yet again (you'd think we would've taken the hint) and left the DVD disc at my house. After getting down to watching the movie, I was excited and ready to be scared. We'd watched The Ring a few nights ago and it easily gave me nightmares. But despite our hopes that this movie would do the same job, we were sorely let down. The movie had a strong start even if it was confusing. A man is hit by a subway train when he sees a little girl on the tracks. Why did he jump back out in front of the train? Then you meet the male lead and his associate in the police department. Why do they both sound like the stupidest cops you'll ever see? The female lead knew more about policing than the both of them. Most of the other actors sounded like they were reading off cue cards and the plot quickly because unbeliveable (ah yes, I'll let my sick daughter play in an old steel mill even if she's supposively afraid of sharp things and on top of that, how did Terry know to listen to the half blind old lady in the mill? and let's not forget, to get to the site, its \"feardotcom.com\" not \"fear.com.\" the doctor got ripped off on his site) By this point in the movie I begged my boyfriend to let it keep playing just to see if it saved itself. It didn't. The ending was cliche', and the special effects when they killed the doctor were the only positive things in the movie. The basic story for FearDotCom was a creative one...but poorly executed (no pun intended). Save yourself a rental and go see something else. You'll thank yourself later.",

            "content": "Having watched this last night on SyFy without having heard of the movie prior to watching it, I am SHOCKED to find out, based on the IMDb info, that FearDotCom was a real movie. By 'real movie' I mean a movie released in theaters that actually had a big budget (45 mil? What was that spent on?! Certainly not the movie I watched) and that people paid money to see it because I just assumed, based on the quality of the film as well as where I watched it, that it was one of those low budget, poorly acted, nonsensically over the top, made for TV SyFy original movies. I am honestly taken aback by the fact that this wasn't - I don't even know what to say. It wasn't even reminiscent of a good original SyFy movie - it was at the low end of the stick. FearDotCom is horrible - everything about it is bad. The acting. The script. The camera work with the flashing images that are more annoying than impactful or scary. The weak plot with epic plot holes. The fact that it's like a poor man's rip off of 'The Ring' only that is even too generous of a critique for this dreck. It was just boring and bad and not worth even watching for free on TV late at night. Heck, I couldn't resist flipping the channel quite a few times and am questioning why I even stuck around most of the time in the first place. Wait I know.. nothing else was on. Lastly, the movie is about a website (feardotcom.com) that when visited, causes death in exactly 48 hours. What I found amazing was the lack of actual victims mentioned on screen. Where were all the victims? We saw what... 3? mentioned and of course I am not including those who fell victim b/c they viewed the site while working the case of the initial people killed. I don't expect feardotcom.com to be the most popular website ever BUT I do expect more than 3? 4? people to visit it. This is the internet - people are on it all the time and sites spread and word gets out. Where were the hundreds if not thousands of people who must have visited the site and also died? It surely wasn't painted as some worldly epidemic - it seemed to be contained to the few people mentioned on screen. Huh? This is not some video tape like in 'The Ring' where you physically need to have the tape to watch it and get your death sentence. It's a WEBSITE - anyone can view it at any time - the death count should have been monstrous. HUGE plot hole.Skip this - 1/10 .. and I am still in absolute awe that this was a real film and not a made for TV horror attempt. Ridiculous.. and if I didn't think the movie was bad enough, the preposterous ending was something unreal. SMALL SPOILER WARNING- Lots of plot holes but the spoilerish one I need to voice was the lipstick tube swallowed by the victim who was found in the steel mill. Just like the new victim who we saw taken on screen, she must have been accosted by the Dr. - immediately grabbed, sedated and stripped so how did she magically not only get a chance to swallow her lipstick case which apparently stayed water proof for years, but plant the note in there and wait a minute.. actually write that message about justice/revenge on the back of the address? Makes no sense at all - poor writing/plot to go with the poorly made movie. Go figure.",

            "content": "FearDotCom is by far the most stylish horror film to come around in a long long time; unfortunately, that's about where the good points end.  Its lighting and cinematography is intriguing to watch while the - ahem - `plot' unfolds.  William Malone and Christian Sebaldt have carefully crafted everything in this film at a barely visible level that will drive your average bright-happy-picture audience member from the theatre.  This is a very dark film, and I'm not speaking in the metaphorical sense.  If your TV's brightness is off a hair, this is the film that will let you know.From beginning to end the film paints a very dark nightmarish world and just bursts at the seams with this artistic intrigue until about the middle of the film you get sick of it and crave a normal shot with normal lighting again on the first viewing.  Upon a second viewing with commentaries on, I didn't mind the never-ending dutch shots so much so I think my initial reaction was solely based on the fact that this film breaks from the pack so dramatically in its craft . . . okay that and the first time I watched I had to hear the dialogue and plot too. The exposition flat out sucks and any web-literate person will give up counting the number of inaccuracies the film tries to pass off as cyberspace.  The main problem I had with the first viewing was the fact that only in one obscure and virtually meaningless piece of dialogue can you interpret that the film is about two web-sites: the ghost conceived feardotcom.com and the maniac conceived death site (which has no URL ever shown onscreen).  `He never stays at one URL very long,' does not convey what needs to be conveyed. Sure they show a different set of graphics and interface for the second site, and in retrospect its easy to see what they were after.  But any web literate person can testify that there's over a hundred thousand poorly conceived sites that do abruptly change styles/interface . . . that and from the title we're only expecting the movie to be about feardotcom.com.  I think one bit of info would have cleared that up - if they showed a URL for the death site, but then again, web-literates may have assumed it to be a mirror site.  Go figure. Likewise, the events in the film also never seem to click together very well; everything has a vague and illogical connection to each other, but before long you stop worrying about trying to follow it and just enjoy the visuals or turn it off to find a movie that makes sense and you can follow (and if that's what you're looking for, why the hell did you visit a horror film in the first place?). I actually liked this film's characters, surprisingly.  While it does rely on devices that have been used before, it never uses the clich\u00e9 end of them and typically finds an interesting spin on everyone.  That and this film actually takes a more realistic approach with its characters versus fulfilling the typical horror-character roles of who lives/dies/has sex/when/etc, etc, etc. On a final note; I'll never understand how this film acquires such harsh criticism while bad films with shock value, specifically TCM and Last House, have a cult status.  They had shock value 20 years ago; now they're just bad films.  Feardotcom isn't the greatest horror film I've seen, but I'd recommend it over some so-called `cult classics.'",

            "content": "\"FeardotCom\" does not have a good reputation. It was lurking on the Bottom 100 movies on IMDb, and even though it's off the list right now, it still has a very low score (as of this moment, it's 3.1). I'm wondering if I saw the same movie as everyone else. Granted, the film is no masterpiece, but it's actually a pretty good movie.Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) is tracking down a sadistic killer who calls himself \"The Doctor.\" But more importantly, is a series of mysterious and gruesome deaths which may or may not be a disease. The latter possibility attracts the attention of Terry Huston, from the Department of Public Health (Natascha McElhone). Their investigation leads them to a connection between The Doctor, the deaths, and a website called \"FearDotCom.com.\" The synopsis I gave doesn't make much sense, I know. But if you watch the movie, it is actually pretty easy to follow. Unfortunately, the editing, particularly in the beginning, is a hackjob, which makes the story sometimes border on the incoherent. But if you pay attention, it's relatively easy to piece together.There are a number of terrific qualities about the film. First and foremost, is the cinematography, credited to Christian Sebaldt. The setting of \"FeardotCom\" is grim, dark and raining. In other words, the perfect place for a horror movie (I immediately thought of \"Seven\"). Second, are the special effects. If you read Roger Ebert's review of the film, he noted that the special effects are so good that \"this is one of the rare bad films you might actually want to see.\" Indeed, this is true. But when I say special effects, I mean the setting and how the film is shot. The story gets us from one intriguing image to the next (albeit not very well), but they are so visually interesting that they make the movie worth seeing. It also helps that the atmosphere is effective enough to generate a few chills, something many horror films, even the most critically acclaimed, cannot do.However, the acting doesn't really hold up to the visuals. Stephen Dorff plays Mike in a low-key manner. In a film where the atmosphere didn't call so much attention to itself, it might have worked. But here, his performance seems lifeless. Natascha McElhone is bad. She has the acting chops to pull off her character, but she speaks so slowly that it's almost as if she's reading off cue cards. British character actor Stephen Rea is not as chilling as one hopes he would, but he has his moments.William Malone directed the \"House on Haunted Hill\" remake, which I hated. I guess he had to have the right cinematographer. This is an effectively made film, although the editing is bad, and the story is stolen from better movies (\"The Ring\" in particular). Yet I still liked it, and as long as you understand how to watch this movie, it's a solid choice to watch alone with the lights out.",

Directed by the person who brought us the underrated House On Haunted Hill, many horror movie veterans (Dorff, Combs, and Kier), and at the time a fresh concept (released just before the Ring and all the other \"ghost uses everyday thing to kill you\" movies), and a dark atmosphere. So movie starts to begin, things are mixed. Cool death scenes, but scares are nonexistent (and believe me, I'm a wuss at horror movies in the theater and jump at even the fake scares). Use of Rammstein song, major check! But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself, the movie starts to go downhill. Maybe it was because of how confusing the movie got afterwards or my mind just doesn't choose to remember it at all, or maybe even both but I can't remember too much of what happens in the second half right until the predictable climax. The characters are just too uninteresting too, no matter who is playing them. It just ticked me off how Combs was given a crap role, and a small one too. OK, maybe he didn't have a big one in HOHH, but he still owned a lot more than what he does here.So in summary, I guess everyone has a few speed bumps in their career of movies. This is one for Malone, and I hope his next movie will make me bow at his feet and forgive him for the 5 bucks I wasted on this movie",

Why go the whole long, roundabout way of forcing people racing the clock against her 'curse' to figure out the puzzle clues, solve the murder and catch the killer? I know, I know...because the movie needs to make the viewer feel slimy and guilty about his own susceptibility to the temptations proffered by the website, blah-blah, bow-wow, woof-woof. I'm just saying, after 19-20 people die without catching the killer, maybe the ghost should just take the hint and go take care of business, eh? I think that the basic difficulty springs from the fact that the story is either 'inspired by' or 'ripped off from' the vastly superior 'Ringu'/'The Ring' movies - it's about a cursed/haunted medium that kills you shortly after you watch it. Having swiped the basic premise, the filmmakers then go through so many contortions to avoid obvious comparisons to 'Ringu/Ring' that they also throw away most of the story and pacing and acting elements that made 'Ring' so watchable, and what they come up with to replace the missing elements just doesn't work.Also, I think that the movie chose to emphasize the elements of Japanese cinema that make American viewers uncomfortable - the depraved, graphic and detailed portrayal of victimized women, the idea of invasive, unstoppable, irrational forces that can't be appeased or evaded, the relative vulnerability and helplessness of the protagonists, who are forced to watch the horror strike again and again.And visually, the movie is a sloppy, grainy, under-lit mess. I realize that this is a deliberate choice, and the lighting and camera-work was probably altered extensively via digital effects and CGI to make it even more like a live movie version of 'Silent Hill'...but it's damned irritating to look at for 90+ minutes at a stretch, especially when all the actors are emoting like crazy, and trying to be fey, wan, stressed and spooked.I have to admit, I admire Stephen Rea as an actor for what he pulls off here. The Mad Doctor is a completely repulsive and slimy character, and you can't see a trace of the Rea who played in 'The Crying Game' or 'Mean Guns' in the MD.As other viewers have noted, there are some serious lapses of logic, consistency and taste here, and the movie appears to have been edited with a hedge trimmer. Combine that with the depravity of the proceedings, and you have a recipe for a film experience that makes you long for a hot bath and a DVD copy of 'Bambi' to get the taste out of your brain.",

I enjoy watching many of these films because they are unintentionally hilarious.The story begins with a very white little girl luring a man into the oncoming path of a subway train. He, of course, is killed and the credits begin to roll. So much for hilarious. Soon other folks die or are drug into the police station...screaming and with bleeding eye sockets.

            "content": "It is amazing how similar films get released so closely together.  You can recall when Armageddon came out, Deep Impact beat it to the punch.  When Tombstone was released, the makers of Wyatt Earp claimed that they copied their idea and then hoodwinked them.  Same can be said for the body switching films in the 80's and so on and so on.  However, with Feardotcom and The Ring, I have a theory that may not so flattering to Franchise Pictures.There are too many consistencies, similarities and flat out duplication of the plot between these two films that you have suspect foul play here. Two films cannot look so similar without there being some sort of sabotage. And if you ask me, it went something like this.  Keep in mind that this is all my own theory and I have nothing to corroborate my story.When it discovered that Dreamworks had interest in the Ringu, other studios probably got interested as well.  After all, Ringu was one of the biggest horror movies to hit Japan in decades.  And when DWSKG secured the rights to the film, it may have left rival studios p***ed off and thus the wheels were set in motion.  Someone had to release a film very similar to the Ring, only a bit different.  So they threw a script together, hired a second rate director and got a very grade D cast and made this film and then laughed as they beat SKG to the punch by about 6 months.  Thinking that they had won the battle, they forgot a few important things.  One being that the story was not as intriguing or as well thought out or as conceivable as the Ring was and the other thing that they didn't count on was that The Ring would clutch the collective psyche of North America the way it did.  FDC left the theaters in a matter of weeks and went on to make a few dollars where as the Ring shocked a continent, made people afraid of their TV's and made stars out of Naomi Watts and will probably have a few technical Oscar nods thrown their way.I loathe films like FearDotCom because they are not creative enough to come up with a story of their own and to say that one of these films did not borrow aspects, and a lot of them at that, from the other film is myopic and silly.  Every major plot theme in The Ring is in FDC.  You can go right down to antagonist being a little girl that didn't deserve to die, to discovering that little girl preserved in water, to technology having something to do with the deaths, to the disturbing contents of the film, to the time that they had to live and figure out the mystery to the reason why they had that time.  And since Ringu came out in 1998, I'm going to have to go with FDC being the culprit here in the infringement game.  This is abominable when you look at what they have done, hoping to catch the nation sleeping and make a few bucks doing it.  But the joke is on them.  Not only is the film a box office bomb, it is one of the lowest rated films in imdb.  That is about as low as you can go.Having said all that, there is something redeeming about FDC.  That is to say that I didn't hate it.  I can't say that I liked it but the film got underneath my skin and it made me very uneasy.  Director William Malone is definitely a man that can milk a scene for all it's worth and just as he showed us in The House on Haunted Hill, if he is just given the right material, he may be inclined to do some great work.  Because as it stands, this film made me uncomfortable and it was borderline too disturbing. The last film I saw that bothered me this much was Last House on the Left. That was Wes Craven's sick sado-masochistic rape/revenge film from 1972. FearDotCom almost duplicates that with it's sick nature and twisted plot pieces.  So if that is your niche, if you like to see sick pictures like that, then this is something that you will enjoy.  There is also some twisted scenes that traduce the victim down to a generic slab of meat that will either keep you awake at night or entertain you with it's macabre story.  Either way, this film is not for the faint of heart.FearDotCom is a well made movie in some aspects.  But it is also a Xeroxed script that the producers should lose their producers hat for.  It is not an entertaining film but it will appeal to those that may like watching what it is like to suffer through the ultimate iatronic transgression.  I cannot recommend this film, it bothered me too much.  But you may have to decide for yourself.  Just remember to check out the superior Ringu when it comes out on DVD and please, please watch The Ring.  It is the best horror film to hit the big screen in 18 years.  As it stands, FDC is just a pale imitation of it.5 out of 10",

And the pacing is okay until about halfway in when it takes Dorph to the hospital in a very clunky way, that whole transition is just not done well and his lines sound confused as well.It's a failure because the script is terrible. We have a young hemophiliac girl who plays in an old steel mill as a child... yeah that makes sense... not. What mother would even let their daughter play in an abandoned steel mill, let alone one with hemophilia. But I digress.The movie touches on all sorts of thought processes, and story arcs without following any of them through.The site, there's no investigation there, just the poignantly idiotic excuse that he leaves the site after each kill... well question... how do people get the new site? And if he owns the domain and has his dynamic DNS site bounced to the domain to remain anonymous, would there not still be someone paying for the domain and hence a paper trail of some kind? I mean that's not even gone into at all.The picture in the camcorder.. the blurry face...we never figure out what or who that is.The woman... come find me... if you win you get me if you lose you die... so who is the woman? Why was the mother so calm talking about her daughter? It feels like the actors were simply given very confusing direction if any at all so the characters like conviction, depth and believability throughout the film.The movie lacks cohesion, the script lacks decent dialog, character development, and story progression, typing up of loose ends.The whole hide and go seek thing - there's no sense of searching for anyone, there are no clues, no figuring anything out, just a white ball, and being led by the hand to an unknown destination.The Ring was a great movie because Naomi Watts has to figure things out and we go with her through the movie figuring it out along with her at the same time.It's a good script that makes sense and takes skill to piece together...and is really scary and tension building, this movie was just a silly failed attempt at the bizarre.Sort of a cross between Prince of Darkness and The Ring with a Doctor Phibes type thrown in without explanation or reason.The ending phone call... what was that about?

The only feet more repulsive that this that I can recall seeing on film were those of Uma Thurman in \"Kill Bill v.1.\". Oh, and the feet of any given dinosaur in \"Jurassic Park\".But I digress...This horror thriller \"smelt stupid\" from the word go. The dialogue was too often silly or totally unnecessary, plus the pairing of 6-foot-8 McElhone and the 5-foot-5 Dorff was quite misguided. Combs, Dorff's assistant, is a disinterested moron who gets killed by Rea with ease.However, as it almost always is with these modern horror films and thrillers, the stupidest was left for last: the big, dumb finale. In it Dorff and Rea engage in your typical good-guy-argues-with-criminal dialogue, instead of just shooting the bastard. After all, Dorff was an experienced enough cop to know that mass-murderers carry weapons with them and anyway receive life in jail or a comparably light death sentence consisting of a gentle needle injection. And, of course, as we know all modern serial killers are not only omnipotent, but also immune to bullets and knives; hence even though Rea gets shot in the leg and stabbed in the back (which would normally incapacitate even a Tolkien oliphant) with a very long instrument, he simply gets up, pain-free apparently, and starts strapping Natasha onto his favourite torture-chair. And then gets killed, with Dorff's help, by the movie's ghost.That ghost reminded me of something... The premise in the Japanese \"Ring\"? And the video-footage seen on the internet that draws you into madness and eventual death, that also reminded me of something... Hmm... \"Ring\", yet again.

The film is about a New York detective, Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff). After some strange deaths occur within the city, Mike is one of the primary workers on the cases. He meets a health inspector, Terry (Natasha McElhone), and the two team together on the case. It seems that a new virus may be spreading around the city. At least, that's what they think - until they discover one thing that all the victims have in common. Each of them died 48 hours to the minute after they logged onto this bizarre website, \"Feardotcom.com\". Meanwhile, a psychopath (Stephen Rea) who runs feardotcom is kidnapping young girls from supposed acting auditions, and torturing them over his website. After Mike views the site, he has 48 hours to solve its mystery or he will become its next victim.I have to admit, I liked the idea of this movie. It was fairly unique and I think had the potential to be alright. But unfortunately, this movie fell flat on its face. The movie becomes tiresome as it goes on, and it gets more and more dull until the viewer is hardly coherent by the time it reaches the bizarre (but visually appealing) showdown with The Doctor. The plot is confusing and it fails to make sense on many occasions. The whole subplot with the Doctor's daughter was flat-out weird, but the daughter character herself was undeniably horrifying (her face is featured on the film's poster). The acting was competent and the performer work well with what they're given\u2014 Stephen Dorff and Natasha McElhone play their roles believably. The acting is probably the strongest thing about the film, along with the glossy visuals and slick, flashy camera work.There are plenty of disturbing and very scary visuals throughout, which seems to be a trend in Malone's work. I'm not complaining, because his style and spooky imagery works wonderfully. The whole atmosphere to the movie was very dark and grey, all of the sets reminded me of something from the 1940s New York, which made for a spooky atmosphere. Even with these minor strong points, this film still lacks a lot, mainly because of the story, which was potentially good. I enjoyed William Malone's previous \"House On Haunted Hill\", but this film is nowhere near as good as that film was, in my opinion at least. Overall, \"Feardotcom\", visually, is an interesting movie. Otherwise, the plot defies any and all logic, and it becomes uninteresting by the middle point of the film. The sad thing is I think this had some potential, but it was very underdeveloped and needed work. You could probably pass on it, but the great imagery makes it worth watching at least once. Visually, it's complete eye candy, but story wise, it's weak. I'd say it's just a point under average. 4/10.",

Thing is, none of that stuff actually shows up in the film anywhere. It's either a con job, butchered editing or the industry's hugest distribution error. For years I was petrified by those images, only to finally get a chance to see the thing, and go: \"This?! This is the film that that wickedly memorable horror show of a cover advertised!? Weak\u0085\" All we get out of it is a dour, boring, barely conscious bottom of the barrel shocker outing that leaves no lasting impression whatsoever. You're better off buying the DVD, whipping the disc off your balcony like a frisbee and framing the cover on the living room wall to freak your kids out.",

            "content": "There was a good story somewhere in Feardotcom and the actors involved do have some halfway-decent talent. Plus the poster for the movie was great. It is such a shame that the execution was as bad as it turned out.The best thing about Feardotcom is Stephen Dorff, he was quite decent in his role. Gesine Cukrowski also brings a touch of creepiness to her role but is not in the movie anywhere near long enough to save it. The rest of the acting is terrible, with Udo Keir and Jeffrey Coombs completely wasted and to say that Natascha McElhone's atrocious here is being kind. Stephen Rea is a very anaemic villain and didn't seem very involved, this did hurt Feardotcom a lot because it focuses a fair bit on him(too much perhaps) and not enough on anyone else. And when the villain fails to grab you, that gives you an idea of how painfully underdeveloped and unconvincing all the characters were, some even came across as pointless.Story-wise, Feardotcom had a good idea going for it, but is let down by it being structured in a very jumpy and borderline incoherent way, a number of scenes where very little happens and went on too long and a complete lack of suspense scares or atmosphere. The music is little more than a stereotypically loud drone that crescendos in parts meant to be scary or suspenseful, which dilutes their impact and makes them predictable instead. The script is weak, structurally it's confused and it does little with giving personality to the characters, some of the dialogue is forced it's enough to make one cringe and induces unintentional humour in a number of places. The movie neither looks great or cheap, there was clearly effort into making it but it came across as the director/photographer trying too hard to please, some of it looks garish and blurry in alternative to clear and a lot of the camera work is incredibly random.Overall, not as bad as has been said here but a very bad movie all round apart from Dorff that wastes the potential that it had. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

And very, very good.True, it's ruthlessly unpleasant to watch (in this regard, the comparisons to Se7en are very accurate) but the visuals are brilliant and the film succeeds in creating a true atmosphere of suspense that relies on genuine terror rather than cheap sound effects for its scares.  The script is amazingly well written and demands as much from the viewer as the generally more sophisticated _One Hour Photo_.The downside: although the actors are effective, the leads leave something to be desired.  Some of the lines were grating and flat, leaving me to wonder if the Mr. Malone was actually instructing them to act badly.  The bad acting doesn't really get out of control though, so the movie maintains cohesion.All in all, a really good ghost story that is really closer to _What Lies Beneath_ than _House on Haunted Hill_.

Don't make it with a slow pace, which runs too long for a 101 minute movie, and have the usual horror clich\u00e9s.The last 20 minutes of the film is probably the best part because it actually uses some action and special effects (which were good), which obviously gives a homage to some films.

            "content": "First of all I have to say I never usually bother with registering for internet accounts to leave comments but here I feel the need to help right a great wrong.The other reviewers (OR) tell us this film is awful, not worth watching even for the fun of watching a bad film, in a new dimension of awfulness, save your rental money and other cruel comments.So I decided to watch it just to see how bad a bad film can be. I was so disappointed - it actually *wasn't* half bad!! I think what is happening here is everyone is jumping on the band-waggon and is afraid of saying anything against the general consensus. I say this because a lot of these (very) negative comments only seem to highlight the same aspects of the movie.OK the film is not perfect or an epic of our times, it has its faults of course which I can't remember really - mainly as the incongruities don't impinge on this film nearly as much as the OR would have you believe.SPOILERS COMING UP!! If you like films like Videodrome then you will like this movie (though not as intense as VD).The basic tenet of this movie is the internet is behaving like a neural net (an interesting proposition and not beyond the realms of possibility - i like the bit in the movie where the cop/female scientist meet the guy who had this theory and he tells them its a load of crap: he only wrote it because he needed money for a new car - so in a way the film debunks its own silliness!) and has evolved its own energy/consciousness born of all the bad vibes going in, and the ghost of the murdered woman is utilising this energy for her own website (feardotcom) to lead people to her killer (the Doctor), and as the stick to make them succeed if they don't do it in 48 hours (the time it took for her to die at the hands of the doctor) well they die too, which is fair enough considering it is internet users logging onto the Doctors 'swot' site which drive his online killing spree, plus the ghost of the woman uses the 48 hour time limit to develop a pattern in the deaths which finally gets noticed by the cop/female scientist.I think this is where some OR get confused - the doctor's site and the ghost's site (feardotcom) are NOT the same thing! The victims of feardotcom die a grisly death - they begin to suffer hallucinations based on their own mortal fears which become so insufferable they are driven to suicide, or given a nudge anyway by the ghost of the murdered woman to keep them in the 48 hour time-frame! So the cop/female scientist inevitably, and separately, look at feardotcom and themselves become affected and start to suffer hallucinations. Now the film gets interesting - it becomes difficult to distinguish between the reality in the film and the hallucinations they are suffering - there is an interaction taking place between the cop/female scientist and the ghost who is leading them to her killer.There is an interesting symbiosis developing: internet users log on to the doctor's site to see people die which drives the doctor's insanity but increases the negative energy in the neural net making feardotcom and the ghost of the woman stronger and more able to affect feardotcom visitors and thus influence the physical world, leading to the whereabouts of the Doctor (if only they could understand the hallucinations).Eventually they all catch up with each other: but it doesn't end like most horror movies with the protagonists holding hands and laughing about it.So in praise of this film: The plot is ingenious and contains themes worth more thought eg. can there be feedback from an anonymous medium like the internet which can impact individually on the user or collectively on society as a whole: by making this more explicit is where this film departs from Ringu, which OR have said this film 'rips off'. This is a large and interesting theme and I am sure there will be more films based on it - will they all be 'rip-offs' too? The actors *can* act (except for the bimbo who gets lured to her death - but then what do expect from a bimbo in a horror movie who gets lured to her death?!).The hallucination sequences, as said by OR, are great.The production values are high enough.The gore is as graphic as it needs to be - the fate of the young Germans at the beginning is largely left to our imaginations which lends an atmosphere of impending menace to the film.The cop/female scientist *do* call backup - he just ends up pinned to the wall! The female scientist is *not* stabbed with a big knife in the neck - it is a close-up of a hypodermic syringe being plunged into her neck to drug her and incapacitate her, to facilitate the Doctor making her his next victim - a truly terrifying prospect for her.So maybe its not a 10 really (at least 7 though!) but as I said the balance needs readdressing!",

Though, soon later the two come across the Website and race against the clock to solve the mystery before they become a victim of the site. While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities? Does this idea ring a bell, it sure does. Flimsy rip-off comes straight to mind while watching this very bland and trashy film, despite director William Malone's best efforts. Elements from other (better) films show up and you just can't deny it or even forgive it for being uninspiring. Though, actually I didn't hate it, but I could've gone without seeing it. The premise starts off pretty interesting, but after that it just fizzles out. It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills. The deaths scenes and torture moments are unimaginative and rather tame. It's glossily executed, but illogical and flat sums it up.",

Amelia Curtis as Denise, the forensic programmer was very memorable, as was Gesine Cukrowski as Jeannie Richardson, the Doctor's first and favorite victim. I watched it twice when I rented the dvd and I am seriously thinking of buying it on dvd so I can watch it again. The locations were extremely dark, dank and creepy. I checked as the credits rolled and noticed US, UK, Germany and Luxembourg in them.

Notorious examples include \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (a gratuitous Video Nasty whose leering, hypocritical eye failed to convince me that it was really against the violence\u0096both real and staged\u0096that it was perpetrating), the controversy-courting \"Natural Born Killers,\" and the ugly, exploitative \"15 Minutes.\" \"Feardotcom\" fits into the latter category of failed efforts, though I would say it transcends the examples I cited (which really isn't saying much), if only because it sits comfortably in the insulated sewer of horror-genre conventions and clich\u00e9s that provide a suitable reprieve from the stabs at social commentary (and, if the trailer is any indication, the film wasn't marketed as some mind-blowing statement against consumer-grade electronics influencing homicidal behavior, anyway). While the film has one of the horror genre's most creative stylists at the helm and major-studio support, \"Feardotcom\" quickly becomes an absurd, narratively rickety slog through tonal inconsistency.First things first: I think William Malone (the remake of \"House on Haunted Hill\") is one of the most under-appreciated directors working in the genre today\u0096while he deals in the same quick-cutting and ultraviolence of the \"torture porn\" school, he imbues his imagery with a palpable conviction that is by turns artistic and visceral. With \"Feardotcom,\" he exhibits the same fascination with different film stocks and effects in an attempt to create a visually arresting experience\u0096unfortunately, the drab color schemes are so desaturated that the film often had me squinting to make out what was going on through the omnipresent darkness.The plot\u0096in one of many echoes of \"Videodrome\"\u0096revolves around a string of deaths seemingly caused by viewing a snuff website (the laughably redundant URL is \"feardotcom.com\"), presided over by disgraced-doctor-turned-serial killer Alistair Pratt (Stephen Rea); bitter young cop Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) has the typical bad history with the killer, and is aided by Department of Health inspector Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone); also, the restless spirit of Pratt's first victim is apparently inhabiting Cyberspace and wants revenge on the good doctor.If nothing else, the imagery (that isn't shrouded in darkness, at least) is stylish and effective enough to hold your attention, but the other aspects of \"Feardotcom\" are so staggeringly uneven that the film winds up a muddled hash. The performances have an oddly detached quality, and the characterizations poor; McElhone's line readings are so off-center that the character becomes an outright distraction; and Dorff lacks the driven intensity to truly bring Reilly to life (the relationship between these two is frustratingly ambiguous). The supporting performances of Rea (doing a gloss on Kevin Spacey in \"Seven\") and Jeffrey Combs are considerably better, but given their limited screen time, are hardly enough to redeem the film. Basically, without a single character worth relating to, \"Feardotcom\" fails to connect.With a better script, Malone's direction might not have been wasted on an undeserving film, but \"Feardotcom\" comes off as a rushed, confused cash-in on technology that, at the time, was becoming a dominant American standard\u0096the supernatural angle might have paved the way for some deeper metaphysical meditation, but the end result is merely a silly, tedious revel in the grue-stained trough.

This film, however, was THE closest I've ever come to walking out. For those of familiar or unfamiliar with the plot, while investigating the ghostly visage of a little girl (dressed to the nines in her Sunday best, complete with accompanying bouncing ball) our protagonists track down the girl's mother. While interviewing this pinnacle of parenthood, the mother explains that her daughter was (1) a hemophiliac that (2) used to play, alone, dressed in her Sunday best (complete with her Wilson) at (3) the old, abandoned steel mill that was (4) conveniently located a mere mile away from the perfect suburban neighborhood. WHAT?!?! First, most female hemophiliacs don't survive past puberty (for hopefully obvious reasons). Second, what mother of a child in such a condition lets her daughter play in AN OLD ABANDONED STEEL MILL?!?!?! I've seen some mighty far-fetched plot contrivances in my day (e.g., the wolves in Day After Tomorrow comes immediately to mind) but this was terrible. I actually groaned. My displeasure was abated, however, by the rest of the audience (outside of me and 3 friends, the audience consisted of 4 other people -- opening night) revolted! That's right we no longer \"watched\" the movie as atomistic movie fans. Oh no. We banded together to fight back this cinematic horror MST3K style.

The suspenseful moments, horrific scenes, and sudden frights build on this dark setting, and create a truly creepy, scary film. Because the film focuses on a website, something modern and real, it can afford to (with a little artistic license) intermingle the paranormal with crime scene investigation\u0097and it does this quite nicely. Also, as the web is anonymous and pervading, the hopelessness factor, an effective tool a lot of horror films use to create panic in their viewers, is increased. The film's plot, without giving any of it away, has enough twists and turns to keep one interested\u0097there is a lot of mysteries and detective work.

            "content": "What chiefly made me want to go see this was that all the professional critics seemed to hate it, but then after seeing it & reading some of the viewers' comments here, I'm taken somewhat aback.  Gee whiz, people, it's just a movie, nothing apocalyptic about it.  It was filmed in Luxembourg & \"feels\" very European: dark, moody, amoral, amorphous, ambiguous & ambivalent, that's how they like their flicks.  It doesn't always play well in America.  Back in the 80s there was a nifty little movie called \"Angel Heart\" with Mickey Rourke & Robert de Niro, similar gloomy/doomy mood, came & went pretty fast.  I guess we like our Euro-filmed flicks big, bright & splashy like \"XXX,\" complete with happy ending filmed in Bora Bora. I see no huge point discussing the plot here, partly 'cause it didn't mke a ton of sense while I was watching it & partly 'cause other reviews here have delved into it thoroughly, \"spoilers\" & all.  It seems safe to say the concept seems mostly borrowed from \"Videodrome\" with elements of \"Ghost in the Machine,\" \"Lawnmower Man,\" \"Strangeland,\" \"8mm\" & others.  Internet voyeurism certainly isn't a novel topic but gets some nice exploration here. \"What are you willing to watch if it's free & no one can see you?\" I don't agree that this movie was particularly \"grisly.\"  Most of the torture stuff is suggested via eye-blink editing & sound effects.  (There was only one shot I found really \"nasty,\" of a woman's mangled teeth.)  We do see many degraded corpses, but mostly in dark lighting.  I didn't have a problem with all the darkness, by the way.  This was supposed to be NY City, maybe it was during a \"brownout\" period.  This director in his last 2 movies has demonstrated skill at creating an overall cinematic miasma of unpleasantness that keeps us jumpy & susceptible to stuff he'll want to fling at us, or hint he'll be flinging it. I also had no problem with the acting or varying accents.  Walk 3 blocks in NY City & you'll probably hear umpteen different accents.  This is the first movie in which I thought S. Dorff was actually well cast: as a \"bad guy\" he was never remotely menacing; here as a \"good guy\" he's just menacing enough. Ms McElhane seemed a little too wide-eyed & ditzy but maybe that's just how the part was written.  The supporting cast were all fine, especially the guy playing McElhane's boss, he practically stole the thing trying to get a cigarette lit.  I also think Steven Rea has received undeserved abuse as the \"whack job\" killer.  I don't at all think he was a \"poor man's Hannibal Lecter.\"  He actually managed to sound American  & he dispensed with any attempt at smarmy charm.  This guy was just a sick twist who deserved to be killed, the sooner the better.  He also had the best line in the flick, how violence should be painful or we get too comfortable with it, but then, ironically, the director kept \"letting us off the hook.\"   To make violence really \"painful,\" just let the camera run.  There was a Japanese movie called \"Tetsuo\" in which a guy pounded a piece of metal into his leg, all unblinkingly on camera.  Suffice it to say I squirmed a little watching that.  Another performance I liked was an unrecognizable Michael Sarrazin as a boozy hack writer. Bottom line: ignore the professional critics & just take the ride.  You'll get a genuine latter-day \"noir\" flick instead of another lame homage to the genre.  (If you liked \"Seven,\" you may well dig this.)  Some of it may even stick to your cinematic ribs a while.  You'll just need to put up with some dumb behavior by the characters here & there, especially at the end.  (I really had thought we'd moved beyond the era of characters turning their backs on dangerous chacters when they're not absolutely sure the latter are dead.)   And oh yeah--as you've probably heard--it's pretty dark.  Maybe rent \"The Shining\" as a counterbalance. By the way, at the beginning of the movie we see a guy in a subway station with DR GOGOL written on the wall.  Unless this is just a nod to Peter Lorre in \"Mad Love,\" I have no idea what that signified. Pretty cute cat in several scenes, but the notion a cat would painstakingly deposit a dead mouse into someone's shoe is pretty ridiculous.  Rather, it would be \"Look what I did!  Aren't you proud of me??\"",

To redeem this mess, the first thing to do IMO would have been to decide WHAT the main concept was supposed to be.  Was it all about what motivated \"The Doctor\" (with apologies to Tom Baker), or perhaps his first victim?  Was it about the possibility of a complex electronic network gaining the ability to store mystical \"energies\"?  Was it about the relationship -- such as it was -- between the two main protagonists?  Was it about the sinister side of voyeurism?  Was it about pushing people to the point where they beg to be killed?  Any of those things might have been worth building a film around -- but NOT ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME.  Where was the emotional center of this film supposed to be?I like some of the actors in the film, so I hate to put it in the bottom 100 of all time, but it really is very much a mess.

I was not disappointed at all watching this one and I have watched it several times. I am an avid Sci-Fi, Horror movie buff who enjoys any movie that is well done. I will offer an appraisal of \"Feardotcom\" without giving too much away. *SPOILER ALERT*If we compare \"Feardotcom\" to \"the Ring\" and say they are basically the same, then we would have to lump all the Freddy, Jason, Final Destination, and so many others into the same category. We would have a lengthy list of movies having a simple plot where there is an evil villain chasing and killing young adults in some gory fashion.With this movie, an underlying moral is imposed upon the viewers as they make their individual choice to enter the Feardotcom website. Whereas movies like \"Poltergeist\", \"The Haunting\", and \"Village of the Damned\" offer up retribution against innocents, in this movie there is only one true innocent. This is the only true similarity shared by this movie and \"The Ring\". Both movies have an innocent being murdered only to return as a vengeful spirit.The internet and networks in general offer a conduit through which various forms of energy may pass, not only electrical but supernatural as well. This is no different than movies that offer water, air, and even dreams as a conduit for some form of energy to flow through. It is only a natural progression that our most common form of technology be used.It's not a matter of there being a villain but rather a judge, jury, and executioner who take the form of one woman's vengeful spirit seeking revenge against the one who tortured her. As people enter the Feardotcom website, this spirit is there greeting them and ready to impose the ultimate punishment for viewing the site's content.The only way to save one's self is to oblige the spirit.One of the underscores of the plot might refer to what the victim went through at the hands of her tormentor before she died. This mental form of torture can only be imagined if at all possible. This may have something to do with her spirit being so angry and focused on revenge.The doctor running the website has his own underlying issues being void of emotion so that he is completely analytical up to the point he is facing his own demise at the hands of his victims.All in all, I would say that this movie was fairly well put together, characters were rather believable as is the plot. It's a nice change from the usual \"slasher\" flick. I would consider \"Feardotcom\" to be unique in its own way much like \"Nasferatu\", \"Metropolis\", \"Pleasantville\", \"DUNE\", \"Dr. Phibes\" and others.I rate this movie at an \"8/10\" because I feel that there could have been some more consideration given to what victims go through while being tortured. This was done rather well with regards to the most recent victim but not quite enough with the main character. More detail could have been given to the programmer's demise.",

A train approaches but despite not being struck he dies with a look of terror on his face and blood coming from his eyes. Detective Mike Reilly is given the case and, because it is feared a virus may have caused the victims bleeding, he is helped by Terry Huston from the Department of Health. Inevitably there are more victims; each found bleeding in a similar way. Together Mike and Terry work to discover a link between the victims... the only connection appears to be that they died forty eight hours after visiting a strangely disturbing website that depicts torture and death. Mike is also loathe to give up on a serial killer case that has been taken over by the FBI; it involves a killer known as 'The Doctor' who tortures his victims until the beg to die.While I don't think this film is as bad as many reviews suggest I certainly wouldn't claim is its particularly good. The plot is a bit of a mess combining fears of dangers on the internet, the supernatural and a serial killer. There are plenty of plot holes although I won't list them to avoid spoilers. It isn't particularly scary but does have some disturbing moments. The cast is okay although those I recognised have all been in better things... most obviously Stephen Rea and Jeffrey Combs... I kept waiting for the latter's character to become more important but he never did. Overall I'd not really recommend this; it is just about okay but nothing more.",

These victims fell prey to a creepy website, \"feardotcom\" where a homicidal rejected medical surgeon, Alistair Pratt(Stephen Rea)commits grisly torturous acts to female victims until they beg to die. It seems that once a person logs on to this site(..and is willing to play), in 48 hours each one dies under horrifying circumstances, often through suicide because the hallucinogenic fears they see are too much to deal with. Pratt is a serial killer Reilly has been unable to capture, with the mad doctor sending him letters as a way to tease the detective. It seems that victims are falling under the supernatural spell of the first Pratt surgical casualty, Jeannine(Gesine Cukrowski)whose restless vengeful spirit lives within the Internet wires for which her death was publicized. She wants her body and Pratt found before her soul can rest..both Reilly and Terry will take part in her game so that this can happen.I loved the way this film looks and the dread and unsettling nature that exists. But, the preposterous premise and lack of chemistry between Dorff and McElhone left me rather underwhelmed and frustrated. The visual work, through the technical collaboration of director William Malone and cinematographer Christian Sebatldt, is stunning. They create quite the nightmarish landscape..this world we inhabit, particularly at night, is both beautifully conceived(..using light, with fluid camera-work, and highlighting the murky world of a city with a moral plight) yet unpleasant and disturbing. The hallucinations of those who enter the gates of feardotcom often are quite ominous and skin-crawling(..such as roaches or apparitions which visit our heroes looking for the killer). Rea's cold and uncaring psychopath, seen constantly tormenting a recently kidnapped and bound female victim, is quite a chilling interpretation and his hellish environs certainly only add to the evil of his character. Dorff and his police station is modeled after those noirish types from the 30's. He's hard-boiled and laconic, but maybe a wee bit too young and unimposing for a leader of a force seeking murderers. McElhone is maybe just too beautiful for us to accept her as a blue-collar lonely-heart with a crummy Health inspector job. I say see this movie for it's \"Hellraiser without the Cenobites\" look and feel and expect a rather far-fetched premise. The film is extremely dark with minor moments of humor injected sparingly thanks to Terry. Malone may need work as a story-teller, but his visual eye can produce some striking images and set-pieces.",

            "content": "FeardotCom is set in New York City & starts in a dark & grimy subway station where a man named Polidori (Udo Kier) stupidly gets run over by a train... Detective Mike Rilly (Stephen Dorff) & his partner Sykes (Jeffrey Combs) are on the case which has several mysterious elements surrounding it like the fact Polidori was bleeding from his eyes & nose. Two more unexplained death's occur that feature bleeding eyes & nose's, Rilly decides to call in the Department of Health & gets sent Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) whose, by total coincidence of course, boss Eddie Turnbull (Nigel Terry) gets a nose bleed & dies shortly after. After Rilly does some checking the one thing all four victims have in common is that they died 48 hours after visiting a website named Fear.com. The website belongs to a notorious serial killer named Alistair Pratt (Stephen Rea) nicknamed 'The Doctor' because he likes to slowly torture & cut up his female victims to on-line subscribers & is a particularly nasty piece of work who Rilly has been after for years but 'The Doctor' is flesh & blood so what are these unexplained supernatural elements? The temptation becomes too much & both Rilly & Huston log onto the site after which they only have 48 hours to unravel the mystery & save themselves before they become the latest victims on an ever growing list...Directed by William Malone I thought FeardotCom was an OK time waster but could have been so much more. The script by Josephine Coyle obviously takes it's inspiration from the cult Japanese horror Ringu (1998). Instead of a videotape the film turns to the internet which doesn't really work that well, millions upon millions of people use the internet everyday without any supernatural curse's being placed upon them & they are not going to be scared by FeardotCom purely because most of us are so desensitised & accustomed to the internet already & see it as a perfectly normal & safe thing to use in our everyday lives (which it most certainly is). Also, the filmmakers obviously couldn't get the rights to use Microsoft Windows so the internet browser used in FeardotCom looks totally fake & unconvincing. The supernatural side of things just don't sit that well & it all becomes a bit muddled. As you would expect FeardotCom tries to say something about the internet & how it can be abused presumably. FeardotCom moves along at a reasonable pace & never became overly boring but the story didn't really grip or engage me as I'd have liked. The best thing I say about FeardotCom is that I found it an OK way to pass 100 odd minutes but at the same time nothing special.Director Malone tries to bathe the film in atmosphere as he uses all the tricks in the book, washed out colour schemes so the film looks almost black and white at times, constant beams & shaft's of light coming through windows, ultra quick edits, slow motion, extreme close-ups, constant rain & dripping water, swinging lights & the contrast between old & new like derelict abandoned buildings & location's against modern computers & shiny chrome scalpels. Unfortunately everything in FeardotCom looks & feels so staged & forced that it become irritating, you never shake the feeling that your just watching a man made film. The violence & gore is disappointing as Malone cuts & edits so quickly that it almost seems like a collection of random imagery, you know that something nasty is happening it's just Malone doesn't let us see it, the scenes where 'The Doctor' threatens his latest victim with a scalpel are pretty grimy & definitely have a repellent sexual element.With a budget of $42,000,000 FeardotCom is undoubtedly well made & has that Hollywood polish to it but again it feels too much like a film & too forced. Also 42 mil sounds like a lot of money considering what ended up on screen, no major A-list actors, no big stunt or effect scenes & not much else that would account for 42 big ones. FeardotCom was filmed in Luxembourg & Canada & you can tell, no one who has been to New York will be fooled. The acting was OK but I never really felt much for any of the character's.FeardotCom could have been better as it fails to mix the real life internet angle with the supernatural part of the story that well. Having said that I found it kept me watching right to the bitter end, not brilliant but not bad, average at best. Probably worth watching once if there's nothing else on the box!",

            "content": "The premise of \"FearDotCom,\" director William Malone's latest excursion into paranoia, promises more than this utterly contrived and confusing cyberspace chiller can ever hope to conjure up. Basically, Internet users who enter the demoniac Web site www.feardotcom.com have 48 hours to live, unless they can solve the mystery behind the disappearance of the site's peroxide blond hostess. Although visitors at www.feardotcom.com. may log off, this wicked Website wields ultimate control over their browser and bounces them right back to it against their will. Anybody who suffers through this moribund melodrama won't need 48 hours to know how badly he or she have blown their bucks. \"FearDotCom\" belongs to a sub-genre of horror thrillers about inanimate objects that assume a life of their own and channel destructive energy into their victims. N.Y.P.D. Det. Mike Reilly (scruffy-looking Stephen Dorff of \"Blade\") and Health Dept. Inspector Terry Houston (Natascha McElhone of \"Ronin\") join forces to figure out what killed four people with nothing in common. Initially, they suspect the Ebola virus infected them, because they bled to death from their eyeballs. Later, Reilly consults computer expert Denise Stone (Amelia Curtis), and she discovers all four had accessed the fear dotcom Web site. Stone commits suicide not long afterward. Hallucinations about cockroaches swarming all over her body and out her mouth prompt her to take a plunge from her high-rise apartment. Intrepid Terry goes on-line and learns that the Web site blond (Gesine Cukroswki) challenges guests to unearth her missing corpse or die themselves. Anyone who cannot find her body perishes from their worst phobias. Meanwhile, Reilly believes the culprit is his old nemesis Alistair Pratt (Stephen Rea of \"The Musketeer\"), a \"Hannibal\" style serial killer who performs 'live' autopsies on bound-and-gagged babes at the fear dotcom Web site \u00a1. The villainous Pratt, who murdered the hostess and hid her corpse, has managed to elude not only Reilly but also the FBI. Inexplicably, while she haunts Pratt's demented Web site, the blond hostess cannot kill him unless someone else logs Pratt on-line.The only original idea in Josephine Coyle's derivative, estrogen-driven script is the use of the Internet as a poltergeist. Superior paranormal sagas like David Cronenberg's \"Videodrome\" (1983), Rachel Talalay's \"Ghost In The Machine\" (1993), and Hideo Nakata's \"Ringu\" (1998) explored similar themes with greater success. Christian (\"Bloodfist IV\") Sebaldi's sinister cinematography and Jerome Latour's grungy production designs qualify as the creepiest contributions to \"FearDotCom.\" Unfortunately, they cannot conceal the fact that this New York City-based spine-tingler was lensed on location in both Luxembourg and Canada. Blame incompetent producers Limor & Moshe Diamant for neglecting to insert scenic New York City stock footage to provide geographical authenticity. Sadly, even die-hard horror fans that groove on marginally menacing gorefests won't find much here to give them goose bumps. Malone, who helmed the highly underrated \"House on Haunted Hill\" (1999) but the shameless \"Alien\" clone \"Creature\" (1985), relies entirely on a clamorous soundtrack to curl your spine rather than anything remotely shocking in this superficial, misogynistic mayhem. Altogether, \"FearDotCom\" fails to fill your marrow with harrow.",

Belatedly jumping on the Internet-thriller bandwagon, the film follows a brooding detective (Stephen Dorff) and a public health inspector (Natascha McElhone) as they investigate the deadly influence of the titular Web site, which channels the innermost fears of its visitors until they die of fright 48 hours later. Why 48 hours? Don't ask; Josephine Coyle's screenplay is as incoherent as Malone's grasp of narrative momentum, leaving Dorff and McElhone with little to do but look frightened and doomed. But Fear Dot Com has its moments, especially after mad doctor Stephen Rea's gruesome villainy is fully revealed, and the proceedings take on the monochrome pallor of silent German expressionism.

Oh a little girl picks up the ball. Oh he's in a leaky subway station. The little girl follows the bouncing ball onto the tracks. The man, irregardless of the subway train sounding the horn, he follows the girl onto the tracks. The train hits him. As he dies, the flickering figure of the girl appears to him. Was it a ghost?? Apparently it was. But he's dead now.So a big crew arrives to check out the body. Detective DorFF , and oh my they got Truman's dream girl from Truman show in this??? Nice. Also she had a great series in Californication as Duchovny's girl. Now that was an awesome show. Okay I digress!!So disease , and bugs , seem to be a big topic here. Det. Dorff and who is this Dr. that Karen is playing, ride around talking about bugs. Then they are watching some recovered videos which are pretty interesting.And then he have this girl who shows up to this address some guy iwth a camera gave her, and she gets snatched up. Looks like its in a theater. She almost pulls the fire alarm but it doesn't look like she's gonna make it.Dorff is investigating the subway dude's death. And he interviews the guys wife. She says that he was ALWAYS working. And ALWAYS on his computer. DORFF says he wants to take the computer with him.Now the girl who got nabbed, she's tied up and getting filmed being what? Tortured by her captor? Ahh cool her captor is Stephen Rea. Rea is an underrated actor. Haha, 'Of Course I'm going to kill you' he tells the girl.Dorff and Karen are working on this. Now why is a bug expert involved?? She's not police so I don't get why she's driving around iwth Dorff. And they get these hard drives from the victims and give htem to some other computer forensic expert. Okay of course the forensic expert, the hard drives sort of ...come to life on her.Okay I kinda got lost wiht this one but hte forensic chick I know she died. And Dorff is in some elevator with osme woman who drops her glove on the way out. Okay what kind of not scary weird scene was that???-1 Star for that weird scene with the ghost woman wiht the gloveAnd bug lady Karen finds a note that Dorff is gone and goes to look for him. And they drag him out of the building he's in on a gurney. Dorff tells Karen that 'she's alive in the wires.' I guess theres some ghost alive in the computers? Because Karen goes straight to the computer after Dorff tells her not to.Terry, is Karens name I guess.Ahh so the captured girl is the one now haunting the 'wrires'. I get it now. Her spirit is in the computers or whatnot and wants revenge. Revenge for her own murder so she murders others? Okay are they guilty people I'm not sure but I'm assuming they must be. So Dorff kicks in the door of some apartment. He tells Terry to wait outside but she doesn't there are photos and computers on and TV on and wow a lot of evidence that seems like a suspect must have just been there seconds ago. Where is the suspect???Okay I'm not even sure what happened at the end but a phone rang and Terry answered Hello?? Okay I guess I'm totally lost.-1 Star for the End.3/10",

I haven't seen those films and maybe \"FeardotCom\" is tame in comparison. . . .In 2002, when this movie came out, Western audiences had begun to pick up on an innovative new wave of Japanese Horror (J-Horror) movies that had been coming out of Japan since the late 90s. These movies explored the fright potential of audiovisual media and the Internet. The title \"FeardotCom\" kinda suggests an Internet-inspired spook fest along the lines of the Japanese film \"Pulse\". What we get here is a muddled plot and, more to the point of it all, lots of dehumanizing sadomasochistic imagery. The word \"misogynistic\" is often overused, but in this case it applies perfectly.",

And some of my favorite actors are in this mess. Why can't Jeffrey Combs find a decent role anymore (Beyond Re-Animator better be unbelievable)? Feardotcom, or Feardotbomb, wanted to be The Ring so bad (just compare the two movies). It ended up being 976-EVIL, however. It's hard to make technology scary. The premise is goofy, one of the worst I've heard of in a long while. Maybe it could have been pulled off, but I doubt it. It just made no sense. That's where it loses The Ring. That flick made sense. The characters here were completely wasted. Udo Kier was billed fourth and he's featured for about three minutes. The story flip-flopped back and forth and was filled with nothing but confusing crap. And you know what, Udo Kier dies, Jeffrey Combs dies, Nigel Terry dies, Stephen Rea dies, Stephen Dorff DIES!!!! Everyone dies. What were these actors doing in this movie and what was Rea's awful accent about? I can't remember one good thing about Feardotcom. Camera tricks, CG effects, and the latest technology do not make a great movie. I lost a ton of respect for William Malone and I hope Dorff can re-cooperate from this terrible film.

When I think back to when I saw the Ring and compare it to my reaction to the other William Malone (director of Feardotcom) films that I saw that year, House on Haunted Hill, I came to realize that had I seen Feardotcom that year, it would have scared the pants off me. The Ring was simply a freaky thriller, while Feardotcom is a thriller that inspires real fear through terror. I wouldn't even be comparing these two films if all of the other critics out there hadn't constantly compared it to the Ring in every single one of your reviews. Do you honestly think that the writers for Feardotcom ripped off the script for the Ring? They'd be sued for sure. I also noticed that Feardotcom is a much more sophisticated film. Especially because It actually makes sense. Part of Feardotcom is a murder mystery that leads up to an explanation that is easy to understand. So, I conclude, that if the Ring deserves 8 stars, then Feardotcom at least deserves 10. Not 3, which you would clearly see if you actually took the time to watch the film instead of turning it off at the first Ring similarity that you see.",

As with that earlier effort, Malone has given us a film containing several frightening images, but a plot that is sorely lacking. Most people will not be satisfied with the picture as a whole, but some of the scenes we see may pop up later in our nightmares.The film basically centers around a website where unlucky voyeurs can witness a man known as \"The Doctor\" torture and murder victims. Anyone who chooses to officially enter the site will die of their greatest fear exactly 48 hours later though! Gasp! They won't actually die of what they fear. The fear itself kills them... or something like that. The plot is a bit muddled, but all we know is this is a site you don't want to visit. Some people do, however, and our heroes Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone are out to find out what killed them. He's a cop, and she's some sort of public health official. At first they think some sort of Ebola-like virus is killing the victims since blood gushes from their eyes. It's not long before both of them are trapped and forced to play by the rules of this website.All I can say regarding the plot is forget it! There are too many loose ends and contrivances for anything to possibly add up. We are never even sure who's in control of the website. Is it the doctor, or a young woman he tortured to death years ago? If the site is in fact a way for the young woman to seek revenge against voyeurs who want to watch sadism, then why does it star the man who killed her??? There are other problems besides plot to focus on. The acting is not particularly outstanding. This may be due to some of the European actors struggling to sound like Americans. Also, I know this I a horror film, but many of the scenes in this film are badly under-lit. Much of the dialog is sub-par, as well. The gore was trimmed drastically after this film was threatened with an NC-17 rating. Only in the last half hour does the film seem to find the right note. The dialog is toned down, and Malone gives us some dazzling visuals as our heroes enter The Doctor's lair to rescue a victim. The color is absolutely amazing in these late sequences.The verdict: 5 of 10 stars. The film is creepy to look at, but that's about it. Perhaps the best way to enjoy this film would be to turn the sound down and have it playing in the background of a Halloween party. Now there's an idea! The Hound.",

We decided not to find out, and put in FEARDOTCOM instead.Damn it, we should've watched SWEPT AWAY!Shame on you, Bill Malone. In substance, structure and style, director Malone pulls everything out of the trick bag he used in HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. Then, it was superbly creepy and unsettling. It still is here...creepy and unsettling how much he ripped himself off, as well as THE RING and its Japanese predecessor, RINGU, which has already been noted in previous reviews ad nauseum. The only thing missing here is Geoffrey Rush (whom Stephen Rea seems to be standing in for.)At least he gets creative with the casting, featuring the always-dependable Jeffrey Combs (who is seen too little and dispatched far too soon), Nigel Terry, Udo Kier and a surprise cameo by one of my favorite WEHT subjects, Michael Sarrazin, who acts rings around the leads, (no pun intended.)What plot there is should send you scrambling for the Comedy isle, to rent DUMB AND DUMBER for the eighteenth time. A hard-bitten cop (Dorff) and a comely Department of Health investigator (McElhone) discover that people are literally dying of fright, bleeding from the eyes and nose being the common symptom before death. Another common thread? The victims are dying forty-eight hours after visiting the titular website, a leftover enterprise of a serial murderer known as the Doctor (Rea), who gets off trying to recycle soliloquies from old Vincent Price movies, as he tortures and carves up his lovely victims via live webcast. (Except that Vincent had much better scripts to work from--yes, I DID say that!--and was much better at it on his worst day, than Rea is here.)What the Doctor, the cop and the investigator don't know is that one of the Doc's old victims isn't quite as dead as he thought, and she's looking for more than a little payback, ala GHOST STORY, GHOST SHIP, take your pick. It's up to the heroes to log on and solve the mystery, blah, blah, blah.Everyone here has done better work in better movies. So why not go rent those instead?

Of course, they both promise each other (because they seem to be in love, although no one gets the love: but the romance is obliged) they won't visit the site. But you know, sooner or later, they will.I have to admit it: This a good premise, but it's not well developed. It all seems to point directly to an ending. Yes, it should, but at least we should see some interesting characters. Even the man who is supposed to have all the answers doesn't have them. He acts totally uninterested. There's also an interesting plot point, about the main character's past. He's been trying to catch \"The doctor\", who is supposed to be the villain, but we don't get much about him either. We just know he is the villain because it is obvious.Always, in these movies, we get regular performances. Because, who cares if someone acts well when you're so scared? In regular movies like \"The Ring\", we sometimes get good performances (Naomi Watts).This brings me to Natasha McElhone. When I see a movie, and she's in it, it doesn't matter how important her character is; I always remember it. \"The Truman Show\" and \"City of Ghosts\" come to mind right now. I'm saying this because she gives her character that kind of depth we are not used to see in horror films. Take my word or not, but she could be the only reason to watch this movie. Sthephen Dorff is pretending, trying to be serious. I wanted to believe him, but it wasn't working. The one character that was, though, was Jeffrey Combs's Sykes. Too many things could have been done with a character of this type. It could have been more developed, but I'm really sorry: You'll see him four times. Three times alive, the other time dead. This doesn't affect the ending of the movie. I mean, it would have been the same with him alive, because someone is going to save the day anyway, as always.There's usually one only objective in horror films: to scare people.

It was on the top ten list for about a week, not even, and then it was taken off, and I missed out on seeing it in theaters. There were not very many notable performances in this film but I was slightly impressed at the intelligence of some of the characters. They are believable in the sense that some they are about to die and stuff. What I don't understand is why the people in this film log onto the killer website when they know it will kill them! That is my main complaint as the characters have to brains in these scenes at all.The cinematography was very well done by Christian Sebaltd, who has a little bit of the great Janusz Kaminski (LOST SOULS) in him. The film is darkly similar to David Fincher's SE7EN in the sense that the sky is always tinted with the gloomy gray color that resembles something like a dark blue. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL director William Malone has done well in creating ghoulish, horrific images to fit in with a sound stream that is so loud that it made my walls shake even on the terrible surround sound system that I have. The story and premise to this film were very well done and I was actually enjoying myself until the film began to get towards the end.I began to lose interest until the very exciting climax which is actually worth waiting for. Not the best handling that could have been done for the making of the first \"killer website\" film, but William Malone's horrific vision is still great eye candy for the gothic images that tear up the screen that somewhat ring of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. The film is worth seeing if you are into horror or if you like the typical \"cop tries to find serial killer\" scenario. This film is great on that level.As I said, not the best movie ever made, and doesn't really make you afraid of the internet like how I was hoping, FEARDOTCOM has a message this speaks all to true: People love to watch.FEARDOTCOM gets 3/5.",

Twenty years later, I gave it spin, hoping the techno themes would have become hilariously dated. It may not be everything I bargained for, but it did manage to hold my attention.The concept of \"what if the internet, but like, evil\" is as ludicrous today as it was in 2002, and while they may lack flat screens and social media, the technology on display isn't as laughably archaic as it is in say, Lawnmower Man.The film is surprisingly high budget, so it gets more things right from a production perspective than you might expect. Still amazing though that even with 40 mill in their back pocket, they still couldn't land the rights to the fear.com domain, making for a good laugh every time a character types out feardotcom.com. (Side note, fear.com does seem to be available right now, in case there's a remake in the works, haha)The plot is all suspiciously familiar, but when you take the time to examine the timeline, the film can be forgiven, somewhat. It merges together several common 00s ghost horror tropes with a bit of a torture porn feel at times. While this owes an obvious dept to Ringu and Se7en, it also manages to predate both the American The Ring remake as well as Saw and Hostile. So it kind of sits at ground zero of two horror genres that would be driven into the ground over the coming decade.Whether it's a trailblazer or a copycat, it's still painfully predictable. The human antagonist is a stupidly over the top, Dr Giggles like character with none of the campy charisma, and the effects are a similarly try hard graphics overload.

Unlike The Ring, though, this story is pretty messy and in all honesty I thought it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. It just ends up jumping about from one scene to the next and for me it just loses track of itself. Even Stephen Dorff as Detective Mike Reilly couldn't save this from going down the pan. In fact, none of the main stars are really that good in it. Natascha McElhone, as Terry Huston, is quite dire (but she was excellent in Ronin) and even Stephen Rea, as \"The Doctor\" Alistair Pratt, is as bland as a weak cup of tea.All in all, this is a very disappointing movie and if you haven't seen it then don't worry because, believe me, you're not missing much at all.",

There's nothing redeemable in this movie, despite having the potential to be a great cinematic experience. My biggest pet peeve with this movie would be the focus of the supernatural element. Had they just worked the killer angle, this movie could have potentially been another 'Se7en' however, the writers/director felt it necessary to add the paranormal element. It was extremely misplaced in this movie, adding nothing to the plot line aside from confusion. The movie falls flat for a variety of other reasons as well: (a) The acting in this movie was horrible, particularly that of Natascha McElhone. (b) Alistair had the capacity to be an amazing and memorable character.but Stephen Rea didn't bring the passion and sadism to the role that this character desperately needed to standout. I'm not sure if it was Rea's acting skills (as he has done well in other roles) or if was poor writing. I tend to go with the latter. (c) The supernatural element just didn't work. I can't really put my finger on why. All I can say is it seemed superfluous and nonsensical. Additionally, incorporating any aspect of horror should create fear. There was nothing scary in this movie. It simply felt like the writers/director couldn't decide rather to do a thriller or a horror movie. They did a little bit of both, and it didn't work. (d) If they wanted to go with an internet-based entity, I feel like the theme would have worked better now as opposed to 2002 because of the relevancy in social media and social interactions in present day compared to the early 2000's. (e) This is a small gripe, but why is the website: www.feardotcom.com? Really?! It is a small detail, but the small details are so important to the overall story. There are various other flaws within this movie, but those are the ones that standout the most. Basically, I don't recommend this movie. I would love to see it be remade into the movie it was meant to be. I can see it having potential. But, alas, I'm sure that will never happen, so we are left with this atrocity.",

Even the MASTER Del Toro got his frigg'n nuts handed to him the first time around by the ever-so-brilliant Weinstein Brothers when he directed his first excellent U.S. film 'MIMIC' - THANKFULLY, with his current stature, he was able to go back and re-edit it, so it is even better now. Even the great, ESTABLISHED Terry Gilliam had a creative board shoved up his @ss by the Weinsteins on the very entertaining 'BROTHERS GRIMM', but it still turned out pretty good despite their meddling.Anyway, back to THIS film, sorry...

However, a few notable flaws can be mentioned. The storyline is far from cohesive. Characters simply pop out of nowhere and are instantly forgotten. It is not clear who we're supposed to care about and who we are supposed to despise. The entire premise of the website is dubious and confusing up until the conclusion of the film. Are we to pity the dead girl or fear her ability to indiscriminately destroy anyone who haplessly visits the website?There could have been some promise in the idea of unexplained energy existing over the internet. However, the concept is resigned to a single conversation and adds nothing to the overall understanding of what forces are at work. It is also unclear whether the filmmakers were intending to shock the audience into submission or to create a jump-out-of-your-seat scare fest. Thankfully the film's gore never gets nauseating due to poor editing during the exploitative scenes of female torture. Admittedly, the imagery is inventive and has potential fright value, but the cheap scares are so separated by vast expanses of trite boredom that they fail to deliver at all.Dismal acting and conventional characters. The lunatic doctor is a serial killer, why? The cop who falls in love with a coroner in a span of a day somehow arouses her utmost devotion and concern. Stephen Dorff's acting career went from the toilet to the sewer with this film, and rightly so. Director William Malone has obviously studied the dark crafts of David Fincher, but his ineptitude at producing even cheap carbon copies of thrillers is aptly demonstrated with \"FearDotCom.\" Consequently, this movie makes \"Saw\" look like \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"In short, the editing is terrible, the acting rank, the cinematography recycled, and the continuity is out the window. Why movies like this are allowed to be made on such budgets is beyond me. Skip this one at all costs.",

After a crazed German enters the police station screaming and shouting before dying in his cell, Dorff realises there's a link between the doctor and the website which kills.McElhone is a DOH employee who, for some baffling reason, is at the scene of the latest 'murder'. And the rest of the movie basically focuses on her and her pursuit of the killer, which, as we all know, is exactly how the DOH works (!)Abandoning all logic, Fear Dot Com never intended to be believable but there are plot holes big enough to fit the Titanic through here, but I shall leave it to you to 'enjoy' them yourselves.It also makes way too much use of darkness - about a third (Or it felt like that) of the movie is plunged into abject blackness.As for the fact it's supposed to be a horror movie, it managed to give me something approximating a chill on a single occasion. Even then it was just something unexpected, as opposed to something genuinely chilling.

The movie has good production values and the atmosphere it creates is  full of doom and gloom (it reminded me of \"Bladerunner\" and even \"Seven\"). The story line is really annoying and confusing. We never know where the \"bad\" guy (the doctor, for those of you who've seen it) came from or what were his motives for killing people, \"snuff\" style on line. The thing about the \"ghost\" on line wasn't too convincing, and, near the end, all the visuals and make up effects scenes look like they're left overs from some Marylin Manson videos (the S&M costumes, the goth make up, the little girl with the \"shivering\" head, etc.). The director could easily do a Manson video with outstanding ease. And the acting was unconvincing to say the least. For a horror/Sci-fi fan like myself, I was thrilled to see the likes of Jeffery Combs (Re-Animator), Udo Kier (Dracula) and Nigel Terry (King Arthur in Excalibur) in minor roles, but their talents are shamelessly wasted with unimportant scenes and characters.

Agreed, it's an unsuccessful movie, but dozens of bad horror movies come and go without arousing such widespread and vocal opposition. But the criticism was irrelevant because nobody reviewed it in terms of what it was trying for. The evident aim, and certainly the result, is a fusion of Asian horror film and European horror film, with a little horror anime thrown in: `Ring' meets `Suspiria' meets `Serial Experments Lain': an industrial-Gothic phantasmagoria; and the story and the visual design achieve it. But the music, which could have done it best, is just conventional horror-movie music, the script is patchy, and the direction is ham-fisted. The images which are disturbing are edited and scored so badly as to rob them of their effect. Whoever laid out the story must have seen every horror movie ever made and has swiped from a lot of them, in particular New Wave Asian (`Ring,' `Pulse,' `Cure,' `Evil Dead Trap'). The actors look inept (except for Michael Sarrazin, impressive as a cyber-prophet in decline) but, again, were evidently working toward a distinct style which didn't come off. Stephen Rea performs in exactly the same camp-Gothic manner as Geoffrey Rush in the director's last horror film.The tv ads for this film, like those for the film \"Pet Sematary,\" suggested that it was about something other, and scarier, than what it's actually about. The ads suggested--and at the outset the film promises--a story about a violent and perverse web site that so corrupts its users as to infect them physically. I suspect that the unusually hostile reaction to this movie had a lot to do with an unwillingness even to consider the idea seriously. But the actual story turns out to be about a serial killer who sets up a live webcam feed of himself torturing and killing his victims: a disagreeable but scary idea, and one that someone was bound to stumble on sooner or later. And there's more: the ghost of one victim is haunting the website and, having died in the way she feared most, is taking revenge by doing the same to the site's users. This is an okay premise, and her inner child makes a good ghost (and a scary image). But it works only while we take it to be a pedophile image from the site; once we know what it is, it stops making sense: why would her unspoiled child-self look like something out of kiddie porn, and why would it be that side of her that leads people to their doom? And another thing: if, as it seems, her image on the site which interfaces with the users is her ghost, rather than what the web-designer-cum-serial-killer put up originally, how is it that he isn't on to this himself? We know he has the site up for viewing because in one shot he points at what is presumably a monitor and in the next shot we see the counter on the home page ticking off the number of subscribers. Which they're not, incidentally: people get into the site by clicking on a couple of buttons, not through CCBill. How does the site operate normally (so to speak)? Which of the things on it are the killer-webmaster's work, and which are the ghost's? We never know. And there's a lot else we don't know. A less opaque script, or more articulate direction, could have really made this into something.",

Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz3) FEARDOTCOM.  I think I slept towards the end out of a sheer defense mechanism, to get away from the embarassment of it all.  I felt bad for the performers, I guess.  I won't go into all the various reasons, but for a movie supposedly set in the US, why did it so BLATANTLY look like it was filmed in Europe?  Could it be that the exterior establishing shot for 1) police station 2) her apartment  3)a victim's apartment & 4) his apartment were all filmed on the same city block?  Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building.  The story ultimately makes no sense, really, and it's just yucky.  I don't mind gore one bit, if handled well.  I even stomached stuff like DAY OF THE DEAD back when it first came out and people were hurling in the aisles.  But feardotcom was so distasteful, so indulgent in its love of the gore (mild though it was) that I mostly felt a little dirty for watching, kinda like I'd watch a snuff film.  And no filmmaker should actually want you to feel that way, but the movie is so amateurishly made that you feel like you're watching home movies of these brutal acts.  Sounds good and edgy, some might think.  But if you like something resembling COHERENCE in your movies, guess again.  It was momentarily amusing to see Jeffrey Combs (he of the unusual but entertaining performances in REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND), but in the end, he was pretty darn bad.  Natascha McElhone, whom I usually like, generated no heat whatsoever.  And I can only believe that it was actually Geoffrey Rush's untrained twin brother who acted in this movie and not the real Geoffrey Rush himself.Never have I wanted my money back more.

Let's just forget for a second that the main subject of the movie (a Web site that kills you 48 hours after you access it) is ripped straight out of the far creepier Ring films. What else is left includes a Hannibal Lector-esque serial killer named The Doctor (ooh, how scawy), some very silly mumbo jumbo about how the Internet can store negative/positive energy, and a couple of uninteresting detectives who are so thick headed that they actually visit the site that could supposedly kill them. Oh, and apparently www.feardotcom.com (which is a pretty dumb title) whacks its visitors with their greatest fears. One victim drowns, another winds up in a car crash, etc. There is also an ominous looking little girl that only slightly reminded me of the ominous looking little girl from THE RING. My biggest complaint about this movie, however, is that half the time I couldn't even see what was going on because everything is shot so dark and muddy. Seriously, there were times when the screen was just pitch black with dialogue and sound effects. In the end, however, it wasn't as Good Bad as much as it was Boring Bad, kind of like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I just liked pointing out the many dorky cliches littered throughout the running time, like how one of the detectives, at a loss for clues, simply goes through some video footage frame by frame and (not so surprisingly) finds something Strange and Spooky-Ooky. 1/4 stars",

There are movies I've seen that truly frustrate and boggle the mind, movies that barely/don't really qualify as movies, movies that shouldn't be. I'm talking your Rollergator and your Things. Watch either of those two films and this movie will seem competent by comparison. But don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying people shouldn't complain, only that it's not the worst.Why they thought Europe could pass for NYC, I don't know, but they certainly don't make it any less European with the poor lighting (in a morgue? Really??), Rammstein, style, and the accents. Also, if the ghost is web-based, why can't she just directly attack the killer...who is STREAMING his murders?? He's online more than the investigators or anyone whose life she took! Why is she killing innocent people who 1. Didn't ask to watch her little show, 2. Clicked choices that said they didn't want to hurt her or whatever. She calls them a liar, which implies she doesn't care about the truth, only about whatever she wants to believe. How can people help her under duress and increasing insanity? What if they were very poor and didn't have the resources to conduct an investigation within 48 hours? What if the unwitting viewer was a single mom working three jobs that will disappear like a vapor if she misses one shift? The \"victim\" ghost seems like a d-bag; having her take the lives of innocents makes the audience unempathetic. If she was as stupid as the one chick we saw be easily picked up by the killer, she has no one else to blame but the killer (and her poor choices).The film seemed like a proof-of-concept of something by a music video director. People keep saying it's like The Ring (which hadn't come out yet, assuming they mean the U. S. one, considering the style), but I very much got edgy 90s alt-rock video vibes. Actually, it'd totally work if it was recut into a music video, like someone did for The Cell (another utterly boring \"horror\" film that banked on aesthetics but forgot that the leads needed chemistry and appropriate acting ability).S/N: I think it's funny one of the 2002 reviews was so sure Stephen Rea was Geoffrey Rush. His performance, especially the truly awful (not as in evil, just awful) dialogue they had him say, was the worst thing about the film for me. So vapid and clich\u00e9.",

Take this as some kind of nightmare with the same kind of logic (almost) and you will probably like it a lot more than if you expect a linear plot and nicely rounded up ending. Director Malone sure has plenty of style to spare...the question is WHO'S? There are shades of several other movies here like \"Seven\" (a lot), \"Silence of the lambs\" and Adrian Lyne's \"Jacobs ladder\" along with the influence of other directors (like italian horror maestro Dario Argento and others). The movie sure looks great! And it's entire atmosphere is heavy with a sense of doom and evil. We get some truly disturbing images that flash before our faces. On the bonus side is also a very good score by Nicholas Pike.But the script and some performances are less than noteworthy. Once the whole gimmick of the plot is settled we are not granted any surprises at all and many things are left unexplained. There are plot holes big enough to drive trucks through!! And most of the actors are sleepwalking for their pay-checks, but somehow think that this was director Malone's intention just to match their mood with the environment they live and work in. Only Stephen Rea manages some sort of \"real\" acting and even he is not up to his usual standards (but admittedly he has very little to work with and develop). At times I thought that some of the actors were dubbed...at least there is something not quite right here (the movie was shot in Luxemburg apparently).A rather ambitious movie, but there were just a little more talent needed in the script to pull the whole thing off.

This movie wasn't horrible, but it was so lack luster and lame that it wasn't fun in any way. I can appreciate filmmakers making bad movies and people having fun with their films because they're bad, but this wasn't really bad enough to make fun of.The plot is that people are logging on to a snuff web-site. Two days after logging on, they die very horrible deaths. Stephen Dorff is a cop who is trying to track down the killer running the site. He's assisted by a health agent who is assigned to find out if this thing is a virus or what. They find out that one of the killer's victims (her ghost) is using the web-site to kill anyone who looks at at. There's some German kids, Udo Kier (who was probably thankful for a small, non-speaking part), and Stephen Rea as the killer.I'm not sure this deserves to be on the bottom 100 because it actually did have some budget. The plot was somewhat cohesive (even if incredibly lame), and the acting wasn't the worst I've seen. The film's major downfall is that it wasn't interesting or even fun to watch. I'd rather sit down and crack jokes at \"Giant Gila Monster\" for the 7,000th time than sit through this film for a second time.

How did the Bukowski-wannabe know about a 'site' from hearing of his co-author's death? What's with the \"look, the sun is out\" when our heroine puts on the sunglasses she already held in her hand?

            "content": "The most memorable aspect of  \u0091FearDotCom' was the amount of walkouts witnessed during a press screening of the film. Expectations were low regarding the film and Director William Malone had the regrettable \u0091House on Haunted Hill' to his credit, yet this film sinks cinema to a new low and begs the question: Why? How can such a perverse and sick tale make it to the silver screen where legends are born and magic is made? This film is both an abortion and a perversion of cinema. If the above sentences seem vented and unprofessional, it is because they are. Cinema is an artistic medium in which professionals aim at conveying a message through film, whether it is a brainless actioneer, or a well made suspense, there always seems to be a purpose. In this instance, if the aim was to disturb, then Director William Malone and his dismal freak of a film have succeeded, yet in an improper and crude manner. Stephen Dorff (Blade) tarnishes his resume by taking on the lead in this quasi-thriller/horror that is not scary \u0096 just disturbing. Films such as \u0091Seven' and \u0091In the Mouth of Madness' were disturbing films but they had a nucleus to them, this film is just a debacle in every sense of the word. It aims at substituting storytelling with dark visuals in an attempt to create mood, when it all creates is an urge to walk out.      Dorff plays a New York detective who investigates the deaths of citizens who die exactly 48 hours after logging onto a website of the said film. Written by long time Hollywood producer Moshe Diamant, this deplorable film aims at being something it is not. Malone aims at shooting a film taking a page from the Alex Proyas (The Crow, Dark City) book of filmmaking. He makes every attempt at shooting this film in dark palettes and including thunderous bolts complimenting the rain whenever he can. That might be fine in some films, yet when it is overused and unnecessary, it becomes overtly distracting. Furthermore, although Malone has an innate sense of framing his subjects, he simply uses his characters to take up space in his frame and does not use them to tell a story. Is he to blame? Or is the ludicrous script to be fingered? In any event, this is a disturbing and vile film that will be indelibly etched within the viewers mind for how profane of a film it really is.      This film does not connect on many levels and while the script has been highlighted, it does not help when you have a second rate cast leading the way. Dorff suffers from a case of wanting to make himself standout cursing every possible second and looking scruffy. While the leading lady Natasha McElhone, dons the unfortunate investigative cap as she plays a Department of Health official sent to investigate these bodies that are appearing all over the city. Suffering from internal hemorrhaging and bleeding noses, these victims appear to all have died from a slow and menacing descent into torturous pains. Yet, they all share that one element, they have all accessed the site. Alas, the only way to resolve this mystery is to enter the site. Up to this point in the film, I contained myself and went on watching and tried to distance myself from the stupidity of the film. But, with every bad film; it just gets worse before getting better. And as the audience slowly dissipated only one hour after the film, I watched as this formulaic and generic piece of film was being projected and I ultimately decided I had had enough.     As our main character was accessing the site and as more sick and vile images were momentarily flashed onto the screen, I knew there no art in this film. Just trash. I refused to be insulted any further and for the first time ever, I left a screening. Up to that point, the first hour demonstrated a weak script, trepid direction and a feel that caused much discomfort. Movies are not supposed to make you feel uncomfortable.     For all you cynics out there, the Fantasia Film Festival is this critic's favorite film festival  (too bad it was cancelled this year) and this festival has allowed the true screening of such schlock films as the early Dario Argento films and other twisted films. There is good schlock, and then there is just plain stupidity. This film falls into the latter.       Perhaps the Director was aiming for sheer stupidity, if he did, then he succeeded. But the first 60 minutes were regarded as a punishment in my book. I do not know if the author was trying to be a cross between David Fincher and David Cronenberg, trying to be John Carpenter and Clive Barker. What is even scarier is that a great actor such as Stephen Rea has demoted himself in appearing in such a disgusting film. Granted, the whole film was not viewed, but I can guarantee no matter how great a climax, it could not have redeemed this disastrous waste of celluloid. This is why I have not taken an analytical and academic approach to this as I usually do. It does not deserve it. I heard many within the film questioning whether this was a commentary on how the Internet affects our lives? To them I reply, from what I saw, computers were barely used in the film, that is how much of a commentary they were aiming at. Giancarlo's rating: N/A",

I just sat down and re-watched it after some 8 years. The film that left me confused, I then realized had haunted me over the years. The images and feelings were always in the back of my mind. There's a tone or feeling that I get when I think about this film that is soaked in a creepy melancholy.I wanted to know why this film gets such a bad rap when clearly it's well put together. After re-watching it, a few things became clear. First, the plot is a bit convoluted and requires that the audience pays attention to what's exactly going on. I don't think most people get that there are two websites. One that Alistair (the Killer) now runs called \"Distressed Furniture\" which is a \"Snuff\" website and one of his old websites called Feardotcom which he has abandoned so as not to get caught. The old site is now seemingly inhabited by a ghost or a residual evil in the wires. It is suggested in the story that possibly the internet has taken on a life of it's own as a Neuro-Net and that Jeannie (one of the killer's victims} is now become part of the internet's programming . An interesting, if Sci-Fi, idea for a horror film. Another fault (not really) is that the film's morality is one of attacking the \"watchers\" of the killing of Alistair's victims. In some respects, we too are the watchers and revelers of the pain and suffering. Something that most audiences don't want to have to think about. The filmmaker has also chosen not make us feel all cuddly and fluffy in the end of the movie by rewarding us with a happy ending. There is a genuine sense of loss of life and innocence. I can easily see why the \"let's see some naked cheerleaders and slashing\" crowd would be pressing the #3 button on this film. The ideas in this film are actually quite interesting . All in all, a much better film what they would have you believe. I think this film is really an 8 but I gave it a 7 because I can't actually recommend it to general audiences or the \"Hockey Mask\" crowd.",

It wasn't the worst, but a polish use it could... Hang on, how would Yoda actually say that?The point is that the total darkness that you face nearly continuously throughout the movie and the shots themselves were like watching a moving painting. I only remember one scene where the sun was really shining and one other where it was at least light all the time. The visuals just really appealed to me and pleased me and I had to sit back, kick back, and think about why I did like this movie because of them.It could have used some more digging into the whole mythology thing. The explanatory scene of the Internet working as a neural network capturing a consciousness, although it was somewhat funny due to the fact that the guy that had the idea in the movie thought it was bull-crap, the way it was expressed it cut the exploration of this notion short.I suppose the relationship between the two main protagonists could have received added depth if they would have used the scientific exploration of this myth to figure out what was going on. You might figure something like this : Maybe the first guy they met that actually came up with the idea that it might happen didn't believe it, and they couldn't make him see even though he was the only one that could help them, even during multiple attempts. This would have broken the stereotype of him immediately being like, \"Shit! This shit is real?\" but an underground society or conspiracy-theory kind of group that did believe these notions wouldn't have hurt.Anyway, yes, there was room for development, but I'll be damned if I ignore the visuals that I really loved from the get go. So I liked this movie. Maybe it isn't the movie of the year, but I'm going to give it a seven out of ten simply because it's a heck of a lot of fun to just watch the visuals.",

There is nothing here that makes any sense and it is surprising to see that a script like this even got greenlit.

It is in a completely destroyed city where it is almost always night and almost always raining. (Just like in Seven)  Some of the death scenes are very creepy and the best parts of the movie are the black and white camera scenes.  These scenes are very creepy and well shot.  This movie is extremely graphic and contains many scenes of realistic torture, mainly to nude women.  If you are easily offended you will probably not like it.

            "content": "The Conceit here is that if you look at the website you'll be dead in 48 hours.  But there are interesting sidetracks.  The reappearance of the missing Michael Sarrazin, for instance.  Now 62, Michael spent his early career playing boys next door to generally stronger heroines like his former girlfriend Jacqueline Bissett.  Here Sarrazin has little more than a cameo as a wizened bar denizen, who has cowritten a book on the Internet.  Then there is the curious effect of cigarette smoke on characters. I'll get to that.  But if they're going to give us Sarrazin in his first movie in years, why not have him just sit down and explain to us what happened between him and Bissett, and how his career entered the toilet.The Art director has managed to take gloomy old apartments and wrecked buildings in Luxembourg and make them look like a forbidding Manhattan. The gloomy atmosphere is the most striking part of the film.  StephenRea is beginning to get work as a Bruce Dern-like Wierdo.  This time he is cast as a mad doctor, carving away at winsome women with a scalpel, among other implements, in a steel mill.Steven Dorff scowls his way through this one.  The scowling is a joke, a cosmic reaction to this fairly ridiculous horror movie. Dorff's police officer Mike Reilly is trying to get to the bottom of these grisly murders with the aid of health department beauty Terry Houston played by Natascha McElhone.  Here's where the cig business comes in. Reilly has a swinish partner who is a pain  to Reilly and to the Audience, and he is always smoking.   Houston has a fidgety boss who is always lighting cork-tipped filters and looking stressed.  Both of these grainy character actors wind up dead in LESS THAN 48 hours.  Their Joint sin: There's no question.  Director William Malone and writer Josephine Coyle have sentenced the two of them to death for lighting up  maliciously. The cig-death relationship is the closest thing to a moral in the picture. That is fine with me.  I will take my morality where I can get it.Dorff and McElhone fall in love of course.  But there is so much mayhem and sheer horror about, Dorff can't stop scowling long enough to make out with the girl.  The natural thing to do would be to find out who launched the website and maybe close it down.  But Rea is actually getting his victims with the standard ploy of offering would-be-starlets parts in his home-brewed video productions.  The website has almost nothing to do with Rea's theater of blood.   Rea has sort of a mushmouth approach to dialogue in this one.  In the ultimate mad scientist scene, where one of the starlets is held with  hands tied above her head in Rea's steel mill lab,  carefully white-lighted scenes ape similar lab scenes in James Whales' Bride of Frankenstein.  Its as if lightning were flashing through the ceiling of the steel mill while the mush-mouthed Rea prepares to apply scalpel to female epidermis.  The film establishes about as much of a relationship between Rea and the website as the Bushies have managed between those 19 Arabs of September 11th and Al Quaeda.  There's more. There is a little girl with a white, bouncing ball and an army of murderous ants, who atack those foolish enough to thumb up fear.com on their browsers.Horror films are now, at a minimum, unintentional comedies.  My advice is to take this film in that spirit.  And don't bother thumbing up WWW.Fear.Com on your browser.  Nothing there but promotion for the movie.",

After years of teeny-bopper Scream crap and failed attempts to resurrect horror, it stands to say that I think the general interest of horror in the eyes of the moviegoers is fading fast. No one likes them anymore and they're getting fewer and far between in the theaters (although several are released on direct-to-video now and then). Really, it's a shame, because this movie should be appreciated more than it is, but of course, it never will be. There's nothing fantastic about the movie in general. The plot is a switch from the tired serial killer formula, being that the \"real\" killer isn't exactly a serial murderer. It's basically about people dying 48 hours after logging on to a site called feardotcom. How they die is a mystery to even the viewer, as it's not really explained well. As usual, an investigation ensues and two people work together to solve the mystery of the dead bodies with the bleeding eyes and noses. Many complain about the logic and say the movie makes no sense. Well if the people who made it tried to explain it all, they would complain about that too, so there's no winning. I think it does just fine without revealing too much. The soundtrack is good. Really dug the music. It fit perfectly with the other best element in this movie: the PHOTOGRAPHY! The photography is short of amazing. Really, I can't remember the last time I saw such a visually profound hour and a half in a horror movie. The lighting, angles, look...it is astounding for a film such as this and I would recommend seeing the film for this alone. It is really art heaven. If only all movies looked like this. If you're looking to get scared you might miss out. What you'll get is disturbed, as one of the killers (yes, there's more than one) loves to torture his victims by doing autopsies on them while they are alive and torturing them, etc. He also likes to hear things about their hopes and dreams so as to \"make a connection so the death will have more impact.\" Needless to say, many will be disgusted at it's perversion. Many have complained about it. To this I say what did you expect? A guy is murdering girls and torturing them first, what did you want to see, HAPPY, UNDISTURBING deaths? Come on. The atmosphere in this film bleeds right out of the screen. There's oodles of it. If you have any interest in horror see it for a change of mood, but really go see this if you have an appreciation for great visual work. You'll love it.

            "content": "I had some ambition for \"Feardotcom,\" but that was asking too much. I will say that this film comes off as one of those horror films that are so bad, it could have been good because of its strange ideas, but I doubt it will be around in twenty years and anybody will remember it. Other than gruesome violence, and horrific torture being the primary subject matter and not rising to anything else, this picture does not offer much and has about as much stupidity as the title suggests. This film was not easy to get through.It's about an NYPD detective, Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff), who gets called to a strange death and discovers the victim mysteriously died with a peculiar case of bleeding from the eyes. He teams up with the department of Health researcher, Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone), to attempt to get to the source of the problem. When another person dies similarly, they discover that all the victims died 48 hours after they logged on to a website called \"Feardotcom,\" which depicts torture and murder. With time ticking away, Mike and Terry log on to the site and race against time to take down an extremely vicious serial killer, Alistair \"The Doctor\" Pratt (Stephen Pratt,) who's been eluding Mike for several years.It shocks me that a better horror film could not have come from this. William Malone is the director, and I have never heard of him before. This horror show will probably be his only film. It has interesting ideas going for it and an engaging story. It's intense, and it's what a horror film should be, but the screenplay is such a mess that the plot is so cluttered and falls apart before you can figure out what is going on. It tends to be scary by using horror violence and disturbing sequences that result in torture or screaming, and it has a few intense moments, but that's it. It's a very basic supernatural thriller, but the graphic violence makes the film so repulsive that it is extremely tough to watch.The visuals of the film are great and add to the moments of intensity. There is a little girl throughout the picture that bounces a red rubber ball, and she makes you wonder who she is and why she keeps popping up everywhere. She is the main reason why everything is happening. Set in New York City, where everything looks gloomy, and like something out of a bad nightmare, It always seems dark and disturbing. It reminds me of the look of the same city in \"Se7en,\" another alarming thriller, albeit good.The website has something to do with the little girl, and it seems to operate by channelling a person's deepest fears into reality, somehow. I suppose the supernatural element is the excuse. Our first glimpse of the site is an explicit barrage of dark subject matter with shock waves and sounds, images of death, dark hallways and knives; you pretty much get the point. We don't learn anything about the site until you attempt to piece together the ending, and you discover why the website got conjured up, but what the real purpose was doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It makes you wonder why the entity who is causing all the mayhem with the website didn't just go after the one person that caused her suffering. Why do others have to suffer?Most of the story revolves around Mike and Terry chasing clues to find \"The Doctor\" serial killer who has kidnapped a woman and Is subjecting her to horrific situations. They log onto the site and have 48 hours to find the source of the website or they will die? They must find the killer, or they will die? Or the supernatural element will kill them for trying to find her killer? See, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The scenes of torture are severely upsetting to watch, and we see a woman under duress screaming quite a bit.Now, what I can't understand is how this picture got away with an R rating? It has NC-17 written all over it due to the brutal torture and to the look of the little girl. I believe she is in her teens on the poster. Anyway, every form of sadistic pain and anguish you can think of is here, and it doesn't hide anything. Stephen Rae's character, Alistair, is psychotic and brutally vicious. Rae's acting, however, is stellar, and he genuinely comes off as a sophisticated killer. He may be the only good thing about this film.It's not a great movie by any means, and the ending of this film is entirely pointless when someone dies for no reason. The revelation with the girl comes full circle, but, again, it makes you wonder why she didn't go after the killer and why she set up a supernatural website to kill people? There, that is part of the ending that doesn't have an explanation and will hopefully keep you away from this movie, but it's dumb and makes the movie and the juxtaposed conclusion of the film worthless.Okay, I will reveal a piece of the ending to the picture. I never do this, but I feel compelled to convince you to save your money. The little girl I mentioned earlier happens to be the killer's first victim, Jeannine (Gesine Cukrowski). She was kidnapped and tortured by Alistair, and she came back as a ghost and created the website. We don't even get a detailed explanation as to why Alistair began murdering people and why he only kidnaps women, we are left to assume, and it's not essential. The whole situation of women being captured and treated like an animal has been done many times before with horror films, and enough is enough. Do I recommend the movie? No. Is there so moviegoers out there that might like it? Yes or possibly. These people are the ones that love every horror film out there, and nothing seems to bother them. Save your money; you will be thankful for not being assaulted by this violent garbage.",

No? Not surprising, given the fact that the plot of this movie is rather incomprehensible and flies off in every direction, a fact which the creators further try to obscure by means of the effects I mentioned earlier. I even have to wonder whether I explained this right, as the events are often rather disjointed. I added a spoiler flag for good measure to go with my attempt to explain a few of the plot twists, but I don't think it really matters. I kept wondering whether there was any way that the story could redeem itself, a bit like a train wreck from which you can't look away. In that sense this movie proves its own point somewhat, if there was any, and I suppose that will remain its only merit. However, by the time your reach the scene that is supposed to be the big showdown, where our hero saves the day by performing yet another nonsensical act, you've given up trying to explain all of this and just go \"Yeah, whatever...\"I suggest that if you do attempt to sit through this one, you find something else to do in the meantime, like a crossword puzzle or a Sudoku, because here's one movie that definitely does not deserve your undivided attention.",

Every interior shot is the same gray walls with no decorations.Lighting is another luxury that few can afford.  The entire movie is one of those cheap dark movies whether you are in an office, home, and walking through a busy diner. Even the day shift cops work at night instead of the day and have no overhead lighting, just lamps.The entire movie was shot in the rain.  During the one and only scene that it is not raining the actors actually comment on this only to be reminded that it should start raining again shortly.The villain in any movie should not have curly clown hair.In this magical city smoking is permitted anywhere, anyplace, anytime. Everyone smokes to the point that you really wonder if perhaps Phillip Morris paid the production cost of this movie.The CDC will examine a potential deadly virus with no suits on, explain that anyone without a suit on is already contaminated, and then can rule out a deadly virus in less than 10 minutes while apologizing for scaring anyone when they did put their suites on.  Our government needs to hire these people!If you work for the CDC, become involved with a local cop, and then act strangely, you can stroll into his office over the objections of his partner and go through his active cases with no problem.  In fact, the partner will help you if you threaten to trash the office.If the feds take over a case you do not have to turn your records over to them.  You can also keep all the evidence at the local police station too.Never dump a body in the water!  It will sink to the bottom, turn white, but remain perfectly intact for years.Technology is a strange beast; the top computer whiz girl can take a burned hard drive and make it fully operational but has a rotary dial phone to call from.  I am not even sure how the prop department found a 40's style phone to even use in the movie or why.Speaking of technology, you can compare three hard drives against each other and the only thing they will have in common is feardotcom.com. There will be no other files with similar names, no operating systems with the same files, and no other websites (such as the one you are on now) that are common to each drive.  With a clue like that it is hard to figure out why cops can't solve crimes faster.If you should ever get shot directly in the heart you will still have time to do heroic feats.If you should ever get injected with a powerful and instantly acting sedative, you will immediately regain yourself seconds later to accomplish similar heroic feats equal to being shot in the heart.If your a villain you can be shot and stabbed but heal quickly enough to continue fighting.  While being a crazy, serial killing villain, you can also lecture on the vulgarity of guns to the police trying to arrest you only to then shoot them with your hidden gun.If your a cop remember:  Your partner will do nothing but eat all day; make fun of you; advise you to drop the case; remind you that it belongs to the feds; never back you up; allow civilians to go through your office and files; will not actually call the backup you requested to catch the most dangerous serial killer ever but simply show up alone prior to your arrive at the site and die.And lastly, if you watch this movie you will never get the two hours of you life back that you just wasted.",

Although the acting was not of the highest order it was not bad as some have suggested. Overall though there was not anything that really stood out about the film, so I WOULD NOT recommend it as something you must buy, however if it appears on TV or you have seen everything else available for rent then you could do worse than this reasonable little thriller (Hollow Man 2 for instance, which somehow has a higher rating).

I pray this does business so that somebody gives director Bill Malone the cash to do whatever the hell he wants.

So, of course when a horror movie comes out in the theaters, I flock to it.FearDotCom, sent to us from the same folks responsible for the disasterous remake HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, has a great scary basis for a plot.  The plot really pulls you along, however, you cannot help but to feel disgust.  The movie, like HAUNTED HILL, is overly graphic and is too much into the perversity of the supernatural (i.e. naked bleeding creatures, a doctor who strips down his victim and the filmakers allow us to view her in many uncompromising positions).  What could have been a truly scary and mysterious movie, the filmakers had to go and screw it up by adding a strong, unecessary sexual factor.The movie had a dark tone, however, it made no sense.  The acting was off the wall and the characters were each confined in their own little square and could not push the borders.  The scary scenes do for the most part scare you, but after the initial jump scene you are left uneffected.The ending is also a major disappointment as we are left without a clue as to what happened to anyone.  I was overall left very disturbed and uncomfortable, and I couldn't help but to wonder what the filmakers believed they were achieving with this film.Big screw-up once again by the filmakers of HAUNTED HILL, only because the movie did have me trembling at certain times, I rate FearDotCom a 3/10",

Place this next to \"Witch Story\", \"Spirits Of The Dead\" (the Fellini segment), and others, up to even \"The Last Temptation Of Christ\", as films borrowing from Bava's classic \"Kill Baby Kill\". \"KBK\" is a ghost story about a young girl, killed during a town celebration, who returns to take vengeance from beyond the grave. It's quite notable for inducing fear through non-graphic means, (although there is a bit of 60's level grue.)

At least HOUSE had a fairly coherent plot, and GHOSTS had Tony Shaloub and Matthew Lillard trying their best.  What does DOTCOM have? Not a coherent plot, that's for sure.  There's a point in the movie where the plot just disapears altogether, and you're left scratching your head (with a gun barrel) in confusion.  And in place of appealing actors?  Stephen Dorff. I honestly don't know how Dorff has a career at all.  He's been in several movies over the last few years, very few of them any good.  But think of movies like BLADE or DEUCES WILD.  His characters have never, ever stood out.  He's always just... there.  Never has that been more true than here. The one main thing that most horror filmmakers fail to realize is that well fleshed-out characters that we like and sympathize with cause us to care if they live or die, thus creating suspense.  What do we know about Dorff's character?  His name is Mike, and he's a cop.  Is there any kind of romantic tension between him and the pretty medical examiner (Natasha McElhone)? That's never cleared up.  Come to think of it, it's never explained why she even sticks around to help solve the case.  Or what the actual case is. Or who the sicko torturing girls on the internet (Stephen Rea) is, and why he does what he does.

Many have complained because it has so many inconsistencies, things that don't make sense, etc. A lot of the time, fear doesn't make all that much sense. OK, getting back to the film. The acting is not spectacular, granted, but neither is it THAT bad. With the exception of Natascha McElhone who was poor and rather livid, all the other actors put in solid performances.It appears as if \"The Ring\" and this film have many similarities, with people calling \"FearDotCom\" a cheap and nasty version of the former. As I haven't seen \"The Ring\", I can't comment but it seems to me that it's a little like the chicken and the egg situation. What came first? Both films were released in 2002 so they were both being produced at around the same time. Could it just be a coincidence that they both have a similar plot? The cinematography is deliberately dark and gloomy, as William Mallone tells us in the audio commentary. I personally think it works very well and really gives the film an uneasy atmosphere. The quick camera shots also work well, since we never actually see any really violent scenes of torture or mutilation. Mallone said that many people complained that the film was very violent but as he rightly points out, there is very little detailed, graphic violence. The shock factor is much higher than the gore factor.The storyline? Well, as most people have given a detailed description already, I feel as if it would be pointless for me to go over the same thing again. Suffice to say, it doesn't always seem to make sense but if you want to get more information on why Mallone used particular images, then have a look at the featurette and the commentary. What I like about William Mallone is that he directs films that say something to HIM, that mean something to HIM. If other people like it, fine, if they don't, that's life. Not quite as good as his more popular film, \"House On Haunted Hill\" but certainly not so atrocious that it should be in the Bottom 100. Certainly an above average horror film.",

What no one else knows (since it's a hallucination) is you're experiencing your own worst fear and dying of it.The website in question is a creepy snuff-site, where you can simulate torturing and mutilating a victim (one of the screens even shows your cursor selecting an appropriate knife...).For all its flaws, I still liked it. I love the creepy tone, the freaky website imagery and the general idea, which I won't give away except to say (SLIGHT, BUT NOT CRUCIAL, SPOILER) that I think one reason many people found the movie disappointing was that they came into the movie expecting a big techno thing (bad vibes from the computer, radiation, something) and didn't make the adjustment to IT'S A GHOST STORY very well.No, the story doesn't quite hold together.

Why then was this film so utterly panned by the critics and 'The Ring' so universally applauded?  I, personally, do not get it.  Each works in the universe in which its own rules apply, and niether is so outlandish in its execution as to warrant ridicule because of a weak plot line.Granted, 'The Ring' is much more subtle, and less graphic than 'FearDotCom', but the former is more of a Thriller, while the latter took the Horror route.  This film is indeed graphic, actually showing the scenes of horror and torture, while 'Ring' typically implies these until the climatic ending.Herein may lie the answer.  Both films are beautifully filmed with repetitive surreal thematic scenes recurring throughout each.  Each has monochromatic artistic portions that blend in well with the rest of the film to give a bleak, dreary outlook of the worlds in which thier events take place.  However, since 'Fear' has chosen to show the blood and viscera, it has earned the reputation as a \"slasher flick\"- a genre that has long since fallen into disfavor with critics and thier following of minions.  Who could critically laud another \"Friday the Thirteenth\" regardless how good it was.I challenge you to watch both movies again and make your own comparison. Try a viewing without any preconceived bias against this film...I feel it will stand up to an equal comparison to the critically lauded 'Ring', female-lead acting notwithstanding.  7 out of 10, IMHO.",

The movie has a lot of similarities to the American version of \"Ring\", except Feardotcom's plot is ultimately incomprehensible, even though its cinematography's a lot more interesting. The female lead's acting is wooden and was infinitely more cringe worthy than the homicides in the film. The other acting is passable. Movie is slow-moving and goes in too many directions. This movie is surprisingly low on gore, but has a high squirm factor, with its torture scenes. It definitely needed several more script rewrites as it follows every horror movie cliche but still doesn't make sense at the end. You could navigate the Titanic through some of this movie's plotholes. An epilogue would be nice, too. But seeing as many horror movies forgo this, that was definitely not unforgivable. The movie's atmosphere, which was created by some great camerawork and visuals, is what sells this film. At times the camerawork, blocking and shots were reminiscent of the exorcist, chinatown, and seven. Sure, most of the good shots were \"borrowed\" in their entirety, but if you're going to do something, do it right. Not a bad movie, not a good movie, but a decidedly mediocre one with a very poor script and one wooden lead. If you're a horror genre buff or want to see some pretty quirky cinematography you might want to rent it, or better yet watch it when it's on cable TV. Otherwise, you should probably avoid this.",

I think the effects were cool and creepy, but visual candy can only carry a film so far and unfortunately the script was ridiculous.I really feel bad for Stephen Dorff, because I do like him and think he's a good actor, but for some reason he's continually done mediocre work for the last two or three years. Someone help this guy pick out a decent script, please!

I don't understand it in a story sense AT ALL, but my God if director William Malone doesn't make it beautiful.That portion of the movie is part Tarsem Singh and part Quay Brothers, and I don't think the movie gets the credit for having the balls to do something like that in a fairly mainstream horror title.

            "content": "This movie is extremely similar to The Ring, as others have pointed out. However, The Ring was a success because it got the point that Feardotcom seems to miss completely - which is that it's much more frightening to use subtlety and the power of suggestion than it is to bombard the viewer with disgusting images. The fact that the story was just plain laughable wasn't helpful, either. The Ring has a compelling story and a truly terrifying villain. If there was something you missed in that film, you could usually get it on the second viewing. FDC doesn't even try to make sense. For instance, who in the world would let their child - especially a hemophiliac - play around in an abandoned steel mill, for cryin' out loud?! Losing a child is a terrible thing, but if you're THAT neglectful, you're just asking for something bad to happen. That part was only one of the many that made me roll my eyes. I enjoy a crappy movie as much as the next girl, but this one isn't even bad enough to be entertaining. It just reeks in every way.The characters were totally forgettable, as well. I didn't really care what happened to them. The fact that there are two villians just made it confusing, and did we really need to see young women being molested and tortured? That kind of thing doesn't scare me, it just makes me angry and sick to my stomach. I know, I'm an adult, I don't have to watch it. But when I watch a horror movie, I watch it to be scared, not to see young girls hung up like sides of beef and subjected to unspeakable cruelty by some sexually warped scumbag for no apparent reason. Maybe some people get a thrill out of that kind of thing, but I'm not one of them. The fact that it upset me so badly is the only reason I decided to review this stinkfest of a movie. If you want to watch a genuinely scary movie that will keep you awake all night and make you think, see The Ring. This movie will only make you want to throw up.",

I'm one of these people that doesn't sit through a film trying to guess the ending, even if it IS incredibly predictable (Sixth Sense) as I much prefer to sit back and be entertained. I'm also one of these people that hates to pick anything apart, be they films, pieces of music or books, but I felt with this film certain things that normally wouldn't bother me were just SO wrong that I needed to point them out. For example, there is bugger all character development throughout the entire film. Characters which could have been elaborated upon weren't even seen again, including the charmingly offensive police partner, who ends up displayed like the officer in Silence of the Lambs, only not as scarily and not as effectively. Also, I felt that the history between the main 'hero' and the villain was really not established, and the reasoning behind his psychotic tendencies was not fully explored (for example, did he have a troubled childhood?). The whole supernatural aspect of this film was totally unnecessary and just generally awful. Why, for example, did they die 48 hours later and what the hell was with their strange illness? The whole film had an aura of \"The Ring\", when personally I feel that it would have benefited from having more of a \"Saw\" atmosphere, concentrating more on the actual killer and less on the ridiculous supernatural storyline. Was there anything good about this film? The answer is yes, or I wouldn't have awarded it any marks (well, maybe one for managing to film it etc). However, there isn't a whole lot I can say. There was some impressive and disturbing, and also some implied images which certainly made me uncomfortable. The acting wasn't completely wooden, in fact, it was pretty good. Good enough to stop you from laughing at the dreadful links between characters (why the creepy little girl version of his first victim? Nothing happened to her as a child, why did they need to use this image? Was it to try and freak people out because they don't like seeing weird little girls?). Bits of the original concept were also good, but completely ruined by the overall production of the film. Now for the awful stuff. Somebody switch the light on, please! For God's sake, a film doesn't have to be pitch black to be dingy and morbid. I hate it in films when people don't switch the lights on, it's just unrealistic. How many of you come home from a night out and decide \"Hmmmm.... I'd rather sit here in darkness than switch the light on.\" ? Not many, I'd wager. I was squinting through most of the film, which really grinds my gears. The most gob-smackingly terrible thing about this entire film was the horrifically anti-climactic ending. Firstly, their \"back-up\" is one, count them, ONE police officer, who subsequently proves to be completely and utterly useless because he arrives before them (how?) and gets himself killed. Now, this bad guy is so twisted, you really want to see him have a horrible death. Even before he gets his comeuppance he manages to kill our beloved male lead, Mike, so surely something really bad is going to happen to him? Maybe he gets tortured to death, like his victims? Maybe he spends eternal damnation in hell? No. In fact, the ghost of the little girl/woman that he first killed comes out of the computer at him, and kills him inside his brain... I THINK. It's very unclear and just bloody awful. In short, not worth spending \u00a37.99 on, that's my lesson learned.",

The plot--a vengeful, murderous ghost, victim of a sadistic fiend, had promise. I liked the idea she was killing people who were cruel and sicko enough to want to watch the torture site--she was filled with outrage, I guess and rightly so IMHO. BUT having said all this, I want to say that the lighting, cinematography, cast(excluding McElhone), plot execution, all made me physically ill and needing a shower after viewing it.Yeah--this was a mentally disturbing, soul dirtying thing IMHO, because it was shot as if the producers and writer WANTED TO PURPOSELY cause revulsion and disgust! Natascha's character, and her lonely world(just her and her cat), and her obsession to do SOMETHING valuable with her life, and her desperate grope for love with Dorff's character, was a more intriguing, and interesting plot/story than the hunt for the serial torturer and the shutting down of the website!I picture a good version of this going something like this: A lonely investigator for ----agency finds out people are dying from a seizure inducing digital video on the net(real life animation of POKEMON was shown to cause seizures and epileptic reactions, so have strobe traffic lights). It ties into a website thought closed down after the death(in a gunfight with cops) of a pervert. BUT, the site is still running! She is assigned along with a cynical, burnt out cop, to solve the mystery. They find the place where the site's computer is running, and have to fight one of the pervert's victims who died of starvation and dehydration because the cops shot him but did not know she was hidden in his \"lair\". The lonely girl confronts the ghost, convinces it to stop, by showing her autopsy photos of the dead pervert and all ends well, as the ghost goes to heaven, and the lonely girl feels a true sense of accomplishment, satisfaction with herself, and realizes she is hot and attractive enough that she can go out into the world and meet a decent guy!

Seeing the trailer on the net a couple weeks before it came out, I thought, `Awesome, the guy who did House on Haunted Hill is coming out with a new movie.'  And really, it helps to be a fan of House to fully appreciate this flick.  No, it's not a sequel, but there are a lot of subliminal things that are very similar to some of the stuff seen in House.  Creepy little girl bouncing a ball, weird looking woman spewing blood out of her mouth.  Pretty much, all the weird subliminal single frame stuff in House that didn't really fit in with that plot is explained in this movie.  I truly think the two are connected, if only on that subliminal level.William Malone has got to be one of the best horror directors I've seen.  I mean, he really has a great style down.  He knows how to create a good creepy atmosphere and throw in some genuinely freaky scares.  While I wasn't as freaked out by Feardotcom as I was House, it still had some great scary moments.  The sets and locations in the flick are also great and creepy. There was a little bit of a Se7en quality to it, while also having the strange, old, creepy architecture from House, as well.As for the plot, it's not totally original.  It's a little reminiscent of Strangeland, only with more of a paranormal twist on it.  The death scenes are pretty cool and the movie starts with a bang\u0085 or a ka-pow really.  Some good make-up effects with some creepy House on Haunted Hill-like ghosts, or was it just one ghost?  Can't remember too well.  Seems like in one point there was more then one, but I can't be sure.The cast has a few cool genre cats in it.  Stephen Dorff, who's first billed but really doesn't seem like the main character.  That would be Natascha McElhone, considering she's the one doing a lot of the action and Stephen's MIA through a few large sequences.  The other Stephen of the movie, Stephen Rea, plays the Captain Howdy-like serial killer.  He's supposed to torture his victims until they beg for death, but they never really show him torturing too much and mostly he's just babbling about one thing or another. Jeffrey Combs is awesome as usual and has an interesting little part as Dorff's partner, Sykes.  He manages to take a fairly small part and add a whole unspoken subplot to it.  I really wish they had had him in more of the movie.  There's also a brief appearance by genre great Udo Kier, who's usually either playing a vamp or is in a vamp movie, but not this time. It's a small part, but it's still cool seeing him in a flick.The problem with Feardotcom is not much different then the main problem with House on Haunted Hill.  The ending.  While being better then House's, it still leaves a lot to be desired.  It's almost like the movie is good up until a certain point, and when it comes time to wrap everything up, it starts to fall apart.  There's a lot that isn't explained, but it's fairly easy to figure it out if you're paying attention.  The clich\u00e9s also start to pile up near the end, and the final scene is just\u0085 strange.  But at least it's strange in a good way.Overall: Feardotcom is worth checking out.  If you're a fan of House on Haunted Hill, you'll probably like it quite a bit.  Still, it almost seems like a clone of Ring, and the fact that the American remake is coming out soon seems a bit to convenient to be a coincidence.",

(Actually, I voted it a three, though I meant to give it a two -- go figure! I must have been possessed by the spirits of the damned souls who had to market this garbage, let alone watch it.Speaking of \"Spirits of the Dead\" (the omnibus film of Poe stories from the mid-'60s), did the visual trope of the child with the white ball lifted from \"Toby Damnit\" irritate anyone else? Is it supposed to be pleasing, lifting a cherished image created by the master filmmaker Federico Fellini and plopping it down in this garbage? What about the gloss on \"Brazil\" in the climax, where the doctor is caught in his torture chamber? Once again, the purveyors of \"fear dot com\" have glossed modern classics and far better filmmakers in the service of dreck, leading one to ponder a question for our age: Has film school destroyed creativity among directors? That's about as interesting an angle as I can make from this mess.Pity poor Stephen Rhea, \"one of today's leading actors\" according to the movie's web site. His performance as the doctor makes Bela Lugosi  in \"Bride of the Monster\" seem like Olivier's Hamlet by comparison! Watching him, a far far long way from his Oscar nomination for the Crying Game, I actually began to visualize him cashing his pay cheque while trying to maintain some kind of dignity; I feel that likely he failed, and the face he presented to the bank clerk that day must have looked as forlorn and ravaged as the visage presented here in this film. The only reason I can imagine the producers hired Mr. Rea is that they didn't have to pay for a fright wig to costume him with, such is the quality of his own coiffure, which along with the Brobdingnagian bags under his eyes, are about all that passes for characterization on his part IN THIS PART.Brad Dorf and Natascha McElhone are too WASPY, too California good looking-youthful vitality to be convincing as New Yorkers, let alone New Yorkers working for the NYPD and health department, respectively. Dorf is too young and doesn't \"look Irish\" to play Doghouse Reilly (when I heard his character's surname, I thought of fellow WASP Humphrey Bogart's joke, calling himself Doghouse Reilly to the little sister in Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\"; Dorf as a mick detective is a joke, though less funny.) McElhone looks like a fashion model. When she says she doesn't go out much, it was another unintended joke; a gal that looks like Natascha wouldn't be begging for male attention -- she'd be able to make a living as a kept woman, to put it less vulgarly. Both the leads just don't look right for their roles. In addition, the \"New York\" of the film is so patently false that they could have filmed it in Uzbekistan for the lack of verisimilitude.I went to see this turkey 'cause the L.A. Times critic said it was so bad it was funny. Well, it was as bad as the critic said, but aside from a couple of belly laughs triggered by some unintentionally awful lines, this wasn't enjoyable like \"Plan 9 From Outerspace\" or \"Bride of the Monster.\" It just plain was AWFUL.

The answer is a resounding \"no.\"  The plot is thin and nonsensical, the dialogue is laughable, sock puppets could express more emotion than the actors, and, most importantly, it is not scary nor even mildly creepy.\nBut why let that stop you from watching it?  Invite friends who have a great sense of humor and have fun.  You'll be able to rip on it from beginning to end.  Trust me, you'll laugh out loud.  Where to begin?Did someone else own the domain name \"Fear.com\" so the killer had to register \"FearDotCom.com\"?  Is Stephen Dorf's character the wussiest New York detective ever?  Did the filmmakers really think they could pass Luxembourg off as New York City (I wasn't aware African-American, Latino, or Asian-American people no longer lived there)?  If I was one of \"The Doctor's\" tied-up victims, I would beg him to kill me so I wouldn't have to listen to his inane babble.And for those who have seen the film and those who SHOULD see it for a good laugh: Last but surely not least, what mother would let her hemophiliac daughter play around a rusty, old factory?",

I have a scenario playing out in my head, it takes place at one of those oft rumored closed-door Hollywood meetings where a series of executives are worried that audiences will catch on to the pattern of crappy movies that are filling the multiplexes. As an offering, or maybe a sacrifice, what have you, they green light a script with a director and a cast that is guaranteed to be so bad, to be the UBER-CRAP film of the year, that the rest of the cinematic fodder will seem mildly acceptable by comparison.The UBER CRAP here is most definitely FearDotCom. It is so void of all original ideas and logical thinking, that such a void must have been created deliberately. From the script, to the casting, to the camera work, to the editing, even the special effects, all had to have been planned very intricately to provide us with a movie so very, very bad, Ed Wood is laughing in derision. This black hole is so dense, that surrounding theaters showing mildly entertaining movies actually lost some of their potency to entertainment.The plot itself is so overly done I don't know how anybody could have thought \"Yes, this will be cool.\" It involves a website that makes your eyes bleed, and yet there were no dancing hamsters anywhere on the site. After 48 hours from viewing the site, you die by your own worst fear. But these fears have no creativity or style. On guy is afraid of `car crashes' but we don't learn that until much later. Others include water, bugs, sharp things, and to fit this pattern I guess there has to be a guy afraid of trains, but if this is true, what the hell was he doing at train station? The main characters are a police officer and a public health worker trying to discover how the site works.Now I didn't know enough about computers or the internet to scoff wildly at the screen confidently, but I still scoffed, knowing that ACTUALLY GOING TO THE SITE YOURSELF is probably the WORST IDEA EVER. Imagine a room with a hyena: anybody that goes in that room gets eaten. Says the police officer \"I wonder why . . ?' and goes into the room himself. My opinion? They all deserve what they get at this point.But the script isn't done being . . . well, stupid. It also involves a completely different website, where a serial killer broadcasts the murder of his victims. For about 90% of the movie there is absolutely no relation between this guy, who is essentially Hannibal Lector Lite, and all the victims of the OTHER website. It feels like you're watching two movies that have been spliced together, one accentuating how bad the other is like it was a science.My only hope is the dolts in the closed-door meetings have had their laugh, and will soon go back to making bad movies by accident. Doing it on purpose seems to be the only thing they're good at.",

And that which is not directly lifted from elsewhere is pretty terrible, as the leads (Dorff and McElhone) seem joined together by the thinnest of premises and then become romantically entangled in ways that would strain the credibility of even the worst Lifetime movie.  When I learned that it was Stephen Rea as the evil \"Doctor,\" I was even more shocked as his work here was rather pedestrian.  The link between the \"website\" and the Doctor is even more confused and bewildering, as though the screen writer couldn't make up their mind as to how they were connected, or why the vengeful apparition would kill those who helped her through her own supernatural prowess but somehow was incapable of getting to the Doctor on her own.Only a few things are really worthwhile here.  First, genre legend Jeffrey Combs is great as Dorff's partner (although the way that his character is killed off also strains temporal credibility as the Doctor is somehow able to kill him before the other characters arrive, even though Dorff phones Combs while Combs is firmly ensconced in a bar playing poker and Dorff and McElhone are already en route to the Doctor's lair.

Instead, it's a cruelly sadistic enjoyment of torture and death for their own sakes. That made me uncomfortable, but I sat (or squirmed, rather) through the movie anyways. On the plus side, this movie *did* scare me. It scared my sister's boyfriend, too--we watched the 10:00 showing of it along with my sister, and the two of us were paranoid the whole night. My sister laughed at us--she thought it was decently spooky, but nothing that great. Since that first viewing, I've watched Fear.com twice. I don't know why I did it, but I continued to get just as scared. That's why I gave this movie a rating of 6/10--it scares me, and that's the point of a scary movie.As for the intelligence I love so much in movies... I think that Fear.com was trying to be smart and unique with its premise. It succeeded, but only for a few seconds--I enjoyed the young couple with the camera for the way it was shot, and the idea of the little girl with the white ball was nice as well. Everywhere else the would-be intelligence failed. You thought things were explained, but then matters changed and more confusion came in. Just who is the lady that asks \"Do you want to play,\" and why wasn't she satisfied with being found? Why tell us that the male detective knew the killer from a previous case, only to completely ignore that until the last few minutes of the movie? Things pulled together about mid-way, then unraveled horribly. I was left confused, but in a bad way.Like I said, I gave Fear.com 6/10 points, but that's only because it scared me consistently. I think that's because I'm constantly online, and the idea of an evil, deadly website--however improbable and silly that seems--terrifies me at some basic level. For people that only use their computers to check e-mail and type up school reports won't have that problem, and a lot of the scare-power will be gone.

While we `know' about the Internet, there's still a great deal we don't know about it, and you add in a `ghost story' and it could work.The reason it doesn't work, unlike the Ring, is because it's far too concerned with showing us things that will `freak us out', like torture scenes or death scenes, but it doesn't really tackle the spaces between the spirit world and the technological world the way that the ring does.Also, the bad acting/directing don't help. I tried watching this movie twice and both times I found myself nodding off or just being plain bored with it. That's not the type of reaction you want for a film like this.",

A detective and a woman who studies viruses team up to stop the girl behind the computer as they logged on.One thing that always gets me is how this movie actually isn't any more popular due to it coming out when computers were getting big. I find the film haunting beautiful since it is shot in a rainy New York scene for all of the movie. The woman portraying the girl on the screen is good at doing a seductive killer who is haunting yet beautiful. I will say the acting is good but Natasha slightly lacks expression. If you know me, I am a big Stephen Dorff fan and this is just another movie he has excelled in.",

I enjoy high-brow and low-brow, expensive and no-budget, classic and modern. I have seen thousands of films and I can say, unequivocally, I have watched at least a dozen worse films. Okay, that was a little facetious. The movie wasn't too bad though I think it proved that horror movies should be made with budgets far less than 50 million dollars. You start throwing money at it and it ends up looking like a government project. You spend it because you have it, not because it needs it.To begin, it is truly atmospheric. It's use of darkness and shadow is commendable in spirit though in practice it somehow misses the point. With almost 50 million dollars spent you do think that you should be able to actually see most of the movie. This isn't Orson Welles doing \"War of the Worlds\" on radio, this is a visual medium so lets see just a little bit of what is going on. The characters: Does the actor say, \"like maybe I could be this world weary 32 year old cop with a three day growth of beard and a melancholy tone in my voice?\" Come on, unless he is working vice or undercover his chief is going to have a serious discussion about his personal grooming. And let's add about 15 or 20 years to his age if he is going to be that weary. A horror movie by nature gives us permission to set aside the concept of rhyme or reason, but please, give us a couple of believable, non-method actor's interpretations of the real thing.A health department official in the middle of a murder investigation? O.K., after all, Kelly McGillis was a civilian combat flight instructor in Top Gun so I can let that one slide. Jeffrey Combs is totally wasted as is Stephen Rhea. I guess that when adding names to a high dollar film you inevitably waste a few good actors along the way.Modern technology meets a fabricated 40's Noirish world, that is New York as portrayed by Luxembourg, in a cyberspace that takes suspension of disbelief to a new level.The director was obviously influenced by Ringu/The Ring as well as by Italian horror by directors like Dario Argento. Throw in a dose of \"M\" with the the little girl and the bouncing ball and a small dose of \"Saw\" for a bit of B-movie flavoring. Of course if you are going to be influenced by the masters then at least use some of what you learned. Where is the gore? Color is made for mayhem. I guess it was lost in the blackouts.Was it a waste of two hours? No, but it isn't a two hours that I would nostalgically relive either.

One of his victims' ghosts takes over the internet in an effort to wreak vengeance on her killer.  Which begs any number of questions: why doesn't the ghost go after the killer directly, why does the ghost kill cops trying to catch the killer and why doesn't the ghost -- who has the power to communicate over the net -- simply reveal the killer's whereabouts to the police?Oh, that's right.

About 50% of the film made me feel like I was watching a cheap, early 2000's music video for a Nine Inch Nails cover band. I think they may have been going for something similar to Se7en in tone but fell very, very short of the mark. The one redeeming feature of this film is its internet naivety - its set shortly before the whole Web 2.0 thing and because of this the titular scary website appears to be hosted on an angelfire or tripod site which I found amusing.

That version is why there are so many bad reviews. The 18 certificate UK release, and versions in other parts of the world doesn't have nearly as many cuts so it makes sense. This version is a great film.First off this is a dark film noir horror. It's not a slasher or a creature feature. It's closer to something like a Hitchcock slow burn but with more violence and gore. The noir aspects just add to that. There is a science fiction element to the plot as well, it takes a scientific concept dials it to 11 so it reaches the edges of implausibility, if you enjoy a lot of Sci/Fi you'll have not trouble with that.Of the cast Natascha McElhone is the stand out. She isn't a scream queen or a victim. She is a competent professional woman who holds it together under extreme duress. However she isn't pushy or overcompensating. She has inner confidence and it makes for something very different.Because of the butchering by the MPAA this film was DOA. Yet the alternate cut available in the UK and elsewhere shows that there is a great film in there, and it has a cult following. However even then this is a film for grown ups. It doesn't spoon feed you, you have watch and you have to think. If your idea of a horror film is a PG-13 teen scream then this isn't for you. However if you want something that looks unique and makes you think then you should hunt down the uncut version.In a just world there would be a Directors Cut available.

            "content": "There is so much wrong with Feardotcom that it's hard to know where to start, but the most cardinal of sins that it commits is that it fails on pretty much every level to be even remotely scary or, indeed, horrific.Seasoned gore-hounds will find the sub-Event Horizon body horror blink-and-you'll-miss-it bondage gear montages laughably tame, whilst the completely incoherent script rob the film of any sort of atmosphere that could possibly rescue it from the celluloid scrap heap; really, the script is quite staggeringly bad - characters seem to communicate primarily through non-sequiturs, with the two leads seemingly falling in love (? - like so much in this picture, this is never particularly clear) via the single utterance \"please don't go look at that site\" only for the very next scene to be Stephen Dorff's cardboard cutout of Brad Pitt in Se7en doing exactly that. The site, so the story tells us, is something akin to the tape in The Ring; a cursed url that brings the unsuspecting viewer into contact with the spirit of a victim of Stephen Dorff's imaginatively-named serial killer, \"The Doctor\", given unlife by the collective energies of the internet (bear with me, this gets even less coherent) in order to exact revenge for her livestreamed torture-death by... killing anyone who watches it in 48 hours. Why this ghost, manifesting most often as a decidedly unfrightening little girl with ludicrous hair, is intent on murdering random people instead of the actual man who killed her is never adequately explained.Said victim, by the way, was a haemophiliac with a fear of knives, whose mother inexplicably alllowed her to play at an abandoned steel mill (which, you guessed it, is where \"The Doctor\" has taken his latest victim, a terminally stupid cinema usher who decided to go to a creepy abandoned theater because said creepy serial killer said he would cast her in a movie upon first interacting with her, with predictable results), and thus her method of supernatural murder is to kill people via their worst fears, causing them to stroke out and bleed profusely from the eyes.So we get Udo Kier hurling himself in front of a subway train for no apparent reason, a forensic programmer swarmed by poor CGI bugs hurling herself out of a window, a character introduced randomly then inexplicably translocated to the abandoned steel mill so that the ghost can spiritually drive his car into a wall, and lingering shots of a german student's corpses nipples after she apparently thought she was drowing in a bath tub. None of this is handled in any way scarily; we don't care about any of these characters, we are given no reason to care about them when the ghost unceremoniously offs them, and their deaths are so poorly-handled we care nothing for them afterwards.Anyway, back to the plot! Natasha McElhone's CDC investigator rushes to the psych ward where Stephen Dorff's detective has been - without explanation - committed, screams randomly at a nonplussed receptionist, is directed to his room, where he is in the throes of a fit that no doctors are present administering to. She recieves a phone call from the ghost, for some reason. I can't actually remember if this is before or after she herself visits the eponymous website for no apparent reason.She then goes to the abandoned steel mill in order to encounter the spoooooky blind old woman (who takes no further part in the plot in any way and is just hanging out in a run down industrial complex to be spooky to Natasha McElhone for some reason) and finds the corpse of the victim-cum-murder ghost. Yay! The haunting's over! ...Nope. Despite the movie outright yelling at us that this would end the haunting, it doesn't. Why? I don't know.Anyway, despite being the absolute worst detectives in the world, Dorff and McElhone finally track down \"The Doctor\" and rescue his latest victim, in the process Dorff gets offed and \"The Doctor\" gets Top Dollar from The Crow'd to death by the internet ghost. We end on McElhone, alone again, recieving a phone call. Is it Dorff? The Doctor? The Ghostly Victim Girl apologising for murdering the shit out of a bunch of random people?No! It's just the sound of static! What a fittingly stupid end to a 'horror' film in which the second most shocking thing present is the exposed nipples of a murder victim, and the first most shocking is the absolutely incomprehensibly bad script. Watch only if drunk and with friends, for some MST3K action, otherwise find something more productive and horrifying to do with your time like clip your toenails or grout the bathroom. Oh, and Jeffrey Coombs (the rather excellent Weyoun from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) is entirely wasted as Dorff's asshole partner who communicates almost solely through orphaned sentences that have no relevance to anything going on around him.An absolute stinker, and legtimately one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I'd rather watch Manos: The Hands of Fate twice back-to-back than subject myself to this cinematic turd again.",

Not only the disturbing colors and graphics, but the way Alister(the killer) tortures her. Like how he tortures her with blades and knives (Jeannie's worst fear), and cutting her open when she's alive. This is the main reason: Alister tortures women with there greatest fear until they beg to die. He sets up a camcorder to record how he tortures the woman. Then he puts it on his website, but if you see if, you'll die within 48 hours of your greatest fear. WHY? Jeannie's spirit wants revenge, and she had torture for 48 hours, and she wants to payback who wants to see women getting killed on the site. This movie was FINE...but not the best horror flick if your looking for something really scary. Try \"The Ring\" or \"Saw\"( more like feardotcom)",

The film offers a brief moral treatise about the dangers of reducing human relationships to electronic impulses, but does little to back it up.In fact, a feigned relationship between the two main characters lacks substance or strength. What is offered is classic horror images of ill-lit rooms, mysterious corpses, and the cliched, yet determined detective. The director's love of random montage, smoke-and-mirrors, sado-masochistic sequences is so overused as to lack purpose in plot development or even visual interest. It is a shame, as the concept is there and Stephen Dorff can be a most volatile and interesting performer, but the tension is never really built up enough due to the film's focus on superfluous, aesthetically random scenes.",

Why these people were dying made NO SENSE AT ALL.  It boggles my mind how such a poorly written film can get made.  I pray to the highest power that screenwriter Josephine Coyle never works in Hollywood again.  Her script is full of moronic characters and awful dialogue that makes soap operas seem like Hemingway.\nThe talents of everyone involved were wasted, especially Udo Kier, whose only line was, \"Nooooo!\"  I was looking forward to this film because I enjoyed director William Malone's House on Haunted Hill.  I think Malone was asleep behind the wheel during production on Feardotcom.

            "review_title": "Rented with low expectations; movie failed to meet them",
            "content": "Wow.  That's all I can start out with is `wow'.  No, it's not the type of `wow' one uses after watching `The Two Towers' on the big screen, but the kind of `wow' after watching `Manos, Hands of Fate' on the small - without the MST3K commentary. I new this movie was crap long before I rented it, but I've always been a lover of bad movies.  I proudly admit to owning the Dark Castle remakes of `House on Haunted Hill' and `13 Ghosts' on DVD (discount prices, of course). They're bad, but they're fun.  Director William Malone brought a certain visceral style to `House on Haunted Hill' that at times seemed reminiscent of music videos by TOOL.  Except for the cheesy kaleidoscope ghost at the end, the movie had a nice creepy gothic feel to it, with a few sadistic twists, even if it never came close to being scary.  It looked good, and the actors ate up their lines like classic B-movie stars from the heyday of Price and Lee. I rented `FearDotCom' with low expectations, the same I had had for Malone's previous outing.  Strange enough, they were not met, and I mean they weren't met by a long shot.  Despite a decent ghost design, which is blatantly pictured on the poster and video cover to ruin any chance of surprise, the film is boring, the script is stupid, and the acting appalling.  Malone shows that he is out of ideas in this movie by using the same exact split second montages from `HOHH': twisted viewpoints, bleached naked women spitting out ultra-red blood, etc.  This also shows up in several other scenes where the script and the directing borrow from other films *SPOILER ALERT* but none more blatant than Denise's (Amelia Curtis) death sequence, which starts out by directly stealing from the cockroach sequence in `Creepshow'.  Another scene involves the ghost's body being found in the water, and appearing to come to life briefly ala `What Lies Beneath'. *SPOILER ENDS* But the borrowing doesn't stop there.  The plot uses segments of the American remake of `Ringu' (The Ring) with giving the viewer a certain timeframe before death.  The death's sequences are also laughable -the feardotcom.com (yes, that is the web address) viewers are supposed to die from their greatest fears.  Of course, the ways these are staged are just awful.  For example, one death that happens early (and is easily broadcasted ten minutes beforehand, so I don't consider this a spoiler) is that of a businessman who goes to get in his car and go home.  The car becomes possessed and crashes into a wall because he's scared of auto-accidents. That his car is parked hell-and-gone from his workplace in some completelyabandoned and bombed-out ghetto is never questioned.  Ugh.  I don't even want to start on the numerous web-related goofs . . . I kept picturing John Lovitz in his satin robe on Saturaday Night Live, yelling `Acting!' the entire time I watched this.  Stephen Dorff is there. He doesn't do jack-squat except ignore a warning not to look at a website link to people's death's.  He's made out to be the star in the trailer, but the beautiful and talented Natascha McElhone gets the most screen time; rightly so.  She's the only character the viewer can remotely connect with, and she does her best dealing with a ridiculous script.  (Go watch her opposite of Robert DeNiro in Ronin -much better.)  And, we've got to have a bad guy.  Unfortunately, it isn't really clear who the bad guy is.  A possessed death website is killing innocent people in retaliation for watching live killings.  The ghost doesn't discriminate, even when those watching are doing so while trying to solve her murder.  So while the ghost is killing away, we have the demented doctor who killed her, killing people on the website.  Apparently, the doctor never looks at his site when he updates it, so he's managed to not only escape the curse, but is unaware of it killing off his viewers -a huge plot hole, as the counter clearly shows hundreds, but only a handful of bodies turn up.  A good madman was needed for this part, and Malone brought in Stephen Rea.  The crazy person might come off scarier when their part is played down, and the madness is under the surface (Silence of the Lambs; Wrath of Khan), but when it's not evident at all, and they talk like an adolescent with a whining falsetto, it just doesn't work.  It just makes one laugh. In the end, this movie just isn't worth seeing.  Most bad movies have redeeming laugh value, but this one just makes you bored and angry with the number of blatant plot problems.  Wait for it to play on regular television. At least the commercials will be entertaining.",

This movie is not scary and it is not artistic (note to director, dark sets and rainy streets don't make a film a masterpiece.  Can we see an end to the 'dim and damp' genre please?')  There are so many things that this film is not, I can't list them all.  But I hope you will believe me when I say it is most certainly not worth your money or your time. The acting is anesthetic - as if the two main actors realizing that the movie was a horrible career error, had taken some nerve killing drug to deaden their pain.  The dialogue doesn't reveal character or advance the plot - it just seems to fill in time until the next dark scene in some colorless room where the scary music builds to a crescendo and then the hallucination scene takes over, or maybe we will get to see a dead/decomposing body.  The plot is so full of holes and inconsistencies that there's hardly a plot at all.  The errors and logic gaps are scattered all over the movie, in fact playing \"find the fallacy' might be the most fun you will have if you go to see this movie.  My favorite goof-up is the hemophiliac daughter - since women are carriers of hemophilia but can not actually have the disease, it's genetically impossible. And if you had a child with hemophilia, of course you would let them play at an old abandoned steel mill. But never mind, you aren't going to see this movie because of the plot or the acting, you are seeing it because you like to watch scenes of the torture of women.

Trust me, you won't.Sitting there in that theater, I wish'd my death, only so that I could be released from it's torment. I don't even know where to begin, it was the most awful movie I have ever seen. Right up there with 13 Ghosts, The Golden Bowl, and The Man Who Cried.Feardotcom.com had no plot.But that's to be expected, it's a modern \"teen\" horror movie, of course it has no plot. I could have handled that, after all, I was just there for Jeffrey Combs.It wasn't the lack of plot that bothered me, it was the sheer awfulness enough to drive one deep into the fiery heart of madness. Half of the film was just the same six or seven blurred scenes being played over and over again to the tune of a rabid strobe light.The other half of the film had no plot development, no character development, no humor, no sex, it was like there wasn't even another half of the film. Where did it go? I don't know.The strobe lights were awful. I think they were just there to trap you in the theater. They were much too strong and bright for an able person to be able to crawl out of their chair and stumble down the aisles.So there you sit, trapped, watching characters you don't even care about (the main character dies for absolutely no apparent reason at the end), watching a plot that doesn't go anywhere, and the little bit it does go really does not make any sense.And here's the real kicker, this health department chick, who has probably never dealt with anything even remotely disturbing in her life, suddenly jumps into deep foggy water in an abandoned factory, grabs a rotting corpse from far under the water, and brings it to the surface. I do not know anyone that would be able to handle that all in a split second without a second thought, not even a homicide detective, not even Superman.You do not swim with a rotting corpse.You do not see Feardotcom",

I can't say much about the acting, I'm not even sure there was any, with the possible exception of Stephen Rae, who looked as though he didn't know whether to snicker or run screaming from the room.  My bet is the people who visited the website in the movie were really trying to kill themselves in order to get their paychecks and go home.  I can't say I blame them.",

A blatantly horrible rip-of of 2002's \"The Ring\", \"feardotcom\" makes absolutely no attempt at establishing a plot, nor does it provide any insight as to why these bizarre deaths are occurring in the first place. Was I supposed to believe that Stephen Dorff(Mike)and Natascha McElhorne(Terry)had become so enamoured with one another (in a matter of hours) that they were willing to risk life and limb to save the other? Horrible dialogue, terrible cinematography, and laughable acting (or lack thereof). It's really a wonder how this entire movie didn't end up on the cutting room floor.

In the Ring, the person was given seven days to live, get their priorities in order, then they were killed by an unknown to us force. In this movie, the person was given 48 hours, then they were slain by their worst fear. Granted I found this movie to be as excellent as The Ring, the narrative was superb, and not much gore, only in places where it was getting dull.I also found it interesting how the crime lab people were interested in finding out exactly how people were being murdered, and it seemed as if curiosity was definitely killing the cat so to speak. Overall, I found this movie to be a shy bit disturbing, but only in the sense of TCM mixed with a slice of Hannibal.If people liked this movie, I would suggest they see TCM, Tourist Trap, hannibal or any of the other \"Lecter\" movies, Strangeland, Nekromantik, or any film by Lucio Fulci.",

It is also another example of modern horror where the entire point of the movie is to use special effects and dark gray screens to portray very graphic violence (in this case graphic torture scenes) that disturb and nauseate and further attempts to desensitize watchers to violence and murder. There are couple of attempts at witty humor and style with the characters but these are way off base. The music score does contain some creepy sounds which would have set the stage for a good ghost story, however the over-use of graphics take away any enjoyment of the creepy feeling the music may have given audiences. Many scenes focus on the torture of the victims prior to death and I found these to be unnecessary as they contribute nothing to the film's progression. The movie isn't shocking and doesn't present anything that hasn't already been in other modern films of gore and murder. The tone of the film is overly serious making it quite stupid in many places, especially toward the end. I don't recommend it because it is a bad film that is just a waste of time to watch. Not to mention the subject matter of torturing people to death is just not something that I feel comfortable entertaining myself with. By reading the reviews and message boards I don't think any adult did like this film. However, there seem to be quite a few teenagers who did . In fact, the film itself seems to be marketed toward those who glorify violence and murder without consequence and is a good example of some of the movies that contribute to the societal problem of children being overly apathetic and quite anti-social -  but that is an issue best discussed elsewhere.

            "content": "There have been some really great things said about this film in some of the other comments on here, and it was worth seeing this marvelously atrocious movie simply for the sake of hearing other people complain about it. I'd just like to add a few observations of my own.First of all: My take on the plot.BACKSTORY: This little hemophiliac girl whose caring mother allowed her to play in a steel mill for some reason grew up to be some sort of dominatrix looking chick or whatever, and then some guy tortured and killed her on his website. She wanted revenge from beyond the grave, so she somehow inhabited his website and killed everybody who visited it. For some reason, he did not know about this.IT PLAYS OUT LIKE THIS: The two stupidest people in the world need to solve the case. The smarter one isn't even a cop. They basically just look at a bunch of weird clues, jump to a bunch of weird conclusions, and find the killer torturing people based solely on dumb luck. Also he dies for some reason and injures one of the main characters or something.OBSERVATIONS: Why the heck was the German couple filming themselves visiting the website? After this, why did they film each other freaking out? When they were all hallucinating and seeing their fears trying to kill them and all that, why the in the world would their first impulse be \"hey, I think I'll grab the camcorder for a couple of seconds and videotape my boyfriend from a well-framed angle while we both scream our lungs out\"? The operating system, and the browser that all the computers in the film were using were painfully ugly and impractical. For instance, a new window needed to be opened every time somebody wanted to type in a URL. Then suddenly after they type it in, they get this amazingly organic website that lets you talk to the ghost before you die. First of all, I really have to wonder just what the evil doctor thought his website looked like, because he obviously hadn't visited it in a while. Things would have been a whole lot easier if he had. Second, shy did the seemingly vengeful ghost take such pleasure in being delightfully vague? Why did she make it a game? Did she really want revenge, or did she just want to screw around with people's minds? Third, why did nobody ever bother to revisit the site and maybe ask her some more questions? Why oh why, whenever the doctor started torturing a woman did the viewership suddenly spike? Why didn't we hear of deaths like these all around the world, since apparently tons of people were visiting? How did these people know exactly when to visit and see the torture, especially considering that they were all presumably first-time visitors, since the visitors were dying grisly deaths? Why was his his webcam show not even really actually featured on his website? And why did he refer to every visitor as a subscriber? Why? PLEASE tel me why the little girl's ball sounded like a ton of bricks hitting the floor every time it bounced.WHY are we repeatedly shown images of topless women with their chests all sliced up? Is there supposed to be sex appeal in this? I don't get it.I think that the best part of this film, though, is that it decries the exploitation of torture as one of its more prominent incoherent themes, and the movie itself indulges in flagrant torture-sploitation at every opportunity. Badly. It is as if the film is TELLING you, \"Hey, don't watch this!\" And unless you really like really bad movies, it's totally right.",

First off, that person has clearly no real working knowledge of film because cinematography and camera work are the same thing!! I don't want to sound like I'm some film snob, but I have taken some film courses in the past and I know the difference between creating a dark, creepy mood by use of lighting and a total lack of lighting altogether. This movie was flat out dark so much so that at points you had trouble making scenes out. Shadows are essential to any horror/thriller/suspense movie, but it's a fact that you can't have shadows when you don't have light. I felt like the lighting was looked at as an acceptable loss by the producers as long as they had the weird computer generated montages that reminded me of a Tool video. Now I have no problems with a movie doing something like that as long as it advances the plot, but this just seemed like they added this stuff for the sake of adding it.

Are they afraid of scaring us?  Are they afraid of acknowledging our intelligence?  Are they THAT scared? Please give us fans good horror, but stop assuming we are morons.",

Toss in a little color and a little more light, for pete's sake--that alone would've made the film more enjoyable, so I wouldn't have to go blind trying to watch it.I give \"House\" a 9, but this...

I'm tempted to listen to the director's DVD commentary to find out what the HELL he was thinking. We get a plot-hole per minute, but some gaping examples of vacuous nonsense gave rise to these questions as I watched: If there's a web site that kills, how come they're only happening in this one town, being investigated by only two cops and a (ack!) Health Dept worker? Wouldn't there be a global epidemic? When cop passes out, half the precinct and hospital show up, but crime scenes are abandoned for curious restaurant inspectors? If there's danger of a viral contagion, aren't there protocols for quarantine, notifying the CDC, etc.? If you had a little hemophiliac daughter, would you let her play with a ball, much less let her play in the abandoned steel mill next door!? If you were looking for the girl's body, would you jump into a bottomless pool of water in that steel mill, at night, alone, in winter, with just a flashlight, just because some blind homeless lady pointed in that direction (and why was half the steel mill underwater?). And then would you pull that body out!?!? Why is every room, even working autopsy labs and hospitals, lit with one 60 watt bulb in the hallway? Why is this dumbbell doctor even running his snuff site--for money? Why does he care about the # of subscribers he has? Why couldn't the doctor shell out a few bucks to get the fear.com domain so users don't have to type the redundant feardotcom.com?There was an especially stupid scene where the food inspector runs into the hospital and loudly demands to know where her cop-friend is. The nurse says something like, \"I won' tell you unless you ask nice.\" So food inspector calms down and asks nice, and the nurse points down the hall and says, \"He's in that room down there.\" I couldn't figure out why such an utterly useless scene like this was even in the movie, even in a movie as generally useless as this one.

On another you have the tragically bad; movies that had a chance but were undermined by something out of their control, usually budget, like Time Chasers to a degree. Then you have the plane old bad, like this offering. This is that movie where after you see the trailer you already know it's going to be awful. It has no redeeming features. Zero. It \"stars\" that annoying vampire guy from Blade and that chick that DeNiro totally should've hooked up with from Ronin. The plot itself is basically that of The Ring, except the driving plot point is \"don't go to that website\" instead of \"don't watch that movie\". The picture seems to be filmed in \"Night-time-o-vision\" as each scene tries to outdo the previous in being more like it was seen through the eyes of a glaucoma victim. The vampire and the chick from Ronin muddle around stumbling onto \"clues\" that include an incomprehensible speech from a man apparently living under a table in a bar, being stalked by a child's toy novelty ball, and the most insincere mother of a murdered woman ever. Spliced into the intense investigation are awkward scenes of some doctor brutally torturing attractive, young blondes who he kidnaps with the littlest of effort. Some people die confusing deaths, our heroes shockingly view the website Feardotcom.com which apparently will cause their untimely deaths in 48 hours since I guess 7 days was already, and the movie boils over to it's heart-stopping climax inside the doctor's surprisingly well furnished torture pad/abandoned water tower. I won't ruin the ending lest you won't have to sit through movie like I did, but I'll say this: no, I have no idea what the phone call means either. If you're considering viewing this work, I would recommend something of better quality, perhaps Space Truckers or Undercover Brother.",

John Carpenter and David Cronenberg brought some interesting comments on how our minds worked, bill Malone goes for the action. It's not a bad movie, it's just an ordinary horror movie, well done and not boring, just as enjoyable as the House on Haunted Hill or 13 ghosts were.",

            "content": "When I first saw a preview of FearDotCom, I thought it would be just another bad horror flick following the same old story [You know - show the ghost/ghoul/bad thing, get sexy people involved in the age-old myth/legend/history of the bad thing, get the girl naked, beat the bad thing (after the Black guy dies), kill/defeat/dispose of the bad thing.]  After giving it a chance, however, I was pleasantly surprised.In the film, Det. John Reilly (Stephen Dorff) is frustrated by an old case that he just can't crack - a string of murders by a man known as The Doctor (Stephen Rea).  Reilly has to put that case aside when a string of people die strange deaths with one thing in common - bleeding from the eyes and nose.  After Dept. of Health officer Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone) rules out any sort of virus, the deaths are unexplainable until searches of the victims' computers are made.  Two things are discovered - that all those who had died had visited FearDotCom.com, and that the visitors died exactly 48 hours after logging onto the site.  Reilly and Huston team up to try and get to the bottom of the mystery - a mystery that brings Reilly to an old friend...The biggest surprise for me was the acting, which was (brace yourselves, people) pretty darn decent.  Stephen Dorff isn't all that impressive, but McElhone works well as Terry Houston.  She comes through as believable and the brightest spot of the film.  Plus, she's the first horror-film heroine in a long time whose selling point in the film isn't massive mammaries or a sex scene.  Stephen Rea comes off as a poor-man's Hanibal Lecter, but is effective.The gross-out factor is high (There are some torture scenes in here that'll make your stomach churn), but if you can handle that, then you'll be pleased with this one.\nP.S.  The film's official website lists the horror site in its synopsis as \"feardot.com\", but in the movie it is \"feardotcom.com\".  It would have been nice if \"fear.com\" hadn't been taken by the time filming began.  FearDotCom - though inaccurate - does sound better than FearDotComDotCom, or FearDotDotCom.",

A male friend of mine said, `Just because you can make it, doesn't mean you should.'The Fear Dotcom plot was flimsy at best and the acting was worse than an elementary school play.

Suffice to say the only thing that got me edgy in this movie were the disturbing images flashed. The directing was par and I enjoyed the effect given.Now for the bad news. The writing for this was horrible. Horrible horrible. For example, there was supposed to be a love story goign on but it was so badly developed that it didn't make any sense. Actually most of the movie didn't make any sense. There seemed to be scenes that were mostly pointless. There were also some weird flaws. For example, in the scene where Terry goes and asks a few questions of Jeannie's mother. The woman tells Jeannie that her daughter was a hemophiliac (No blood clotting), and then minutes later Tells terry she let her daughter play at and abandoned saw mill two miles away when she was little. Yet no one found that odd. WTF?!?!?! Otherwise, Scary parts of the movie were predictable. I would not suggest this movie to anyone who can't appreciate cinemetagraphy.",

This particular day there were about 20 others in the theatre with me. Not a good sign. As the movie began, I already noticed a pattern. You sign on to a web site, something weird happens, you die. This pretty much goes on for the entire movie, with little else to hold your attention.The director tries and tries to make this a Hitchcock-style thriller, and fails miserably. In mo personal opinion, if you're going to have a movie be as repetitious as this one, at least make it a slasher flick with some good bloody special effects.At the end of the movie, I stood up wondering how it had ended. The whole finale left everyone in the theatre with an empty feeling. Overall, this movie fell flat on its face before it even learned how to crawl.

Overall though, it was just highly frustrating. Perhaps they tried to save money by cutting out the lighting department so that they could afford the few special effects in the film.I watch a horror movie in an attempt to be frightened. This movie did not frighten me in the least. Yes, I screamed once, but that fell under the category of sudden, surprising, disturbing image. And yes, the sudden startlement passed after only a few moments.If you wish to see a movie that will truly frighten you, watch Ringu, if you have a few hours with nothing better to do...this movie will suffice. I did not want my two hours back after watching it, but I must admit that it left something to be desired.And, in closing, I cannot stress just how frustrating the dim lighting of the film was.

Of course the man tries to heroically save the child only to be predictably run over (well, more pushed to the side strongly than run over) by the train in a lousy edited and acted sequence.\nSo, what about the plot? I won' t start going into it but let' s just say that this movie borrows more than a little from Ringu (wich as already been remade in the surprisingly effective The Ring): a female spirit exerts vengeance via an electronic medium, this time being the internet, people dying 2 days after seing what was not to be seen instead of a week. To solve the murders, 2 people are put on the case, Stephen Dorff and Natascha McElhone, and as the nemesis behind all the madness, Stephen Rea. One note about the acting: it is completely and utterly horrible!! How could talented actors be wasted this way??!! The acting is so bad, it' s like watching headless chickens running around screen for a hour and a half!! Man! Stephen Dorff has seen some better days (his Deacon Frost in Blade was pretty effective) but I am totally shocked to see Stephen Rea and Natascha McElhone  make complete fools of themselves in this trash!! And they' re American accents are actually funny to hear!Especially Rea for putting too much of a southern twang on it! Only the always reliable Jeffrey Combs seems to have fun with his role.The director, William Malone, does a overblown attempt at conveying a creepy atmosphere, mostly by underlighting everything (even in broad daylight) and by shooting every scene \"music video\" style. It almost worked before in his last movie, House on Haunted Hill, a movie that I enjoyed a great deal more than Feardotcom because it didn' t take itself too seriously in the first place (come on! Chris \"Corky Romano\" Kattan was in it!). It's true that the script really is not the greatest material available (from an original story by Moshe Diamant, producer of countless Van Damme movies: that tells you about the quality at work here!) but come on, really, how can a director can expect us to be scared by a scene in wich Dorff tries frantically to close a elevator door because a bouncing ball is coming fast towards him??(I'm not making this up!)So, in the end, if you are a serious film buff, avoid at all costs, but if you are like me and are a fan of bad cinema and want a good laugh, Feardotcom is worth it! It' s so bad, it is good! I particularly liked how the love blossoms between the 2 leads: McElhone asks Dorff to promise to not go see the damned internet site, then he comes to hug her, dissolve to McElhone asleep in a bed, Dorff getting up and going away, but not before looking at her in a caring, loving way (well, as much as he can portray!). And before that scene, there was no real sign of the two of them being attracted to one another! This scene is priceless I tell you!Oh, and if you plan on watching this with your buddies, I have got a good drinking game associated with this movie: every time McElhone says \"Oh my God!\", everybody take a shot! You' ll be pretty drunk by the end!",
