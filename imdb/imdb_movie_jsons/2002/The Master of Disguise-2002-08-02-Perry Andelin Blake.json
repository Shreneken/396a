            "content": "i'm in my early 30s and i thought it was funny. it's certainly not on par with the brilliant comedies made by monty python, but it's much better than 95% of the PG-13 garbage that continues to be released.it was refreshing to see a PG comedy that wasn't centered around children. i really liked the gammy num nums disguise, and i wish they had been able to work the Mayor Maynot disguise in the movie along with the painting guy. thankfully they were both on the DVD.i've watched it twice now, and will watch it again. dana talked (on a DVD featurette) about how he originally wanted to make a mission impossible type comedy with the master of disguise being part of the team, so maybe he'll go to back to that for a sequel; although, it seems unlikely since the first seems to be rather unpopular.6/10",

I don't know what most of the voters were expecting, it was obviously a family movie, and I appreciated that. There was no graphic violence, just some slapping, nor were there any sex references, nor any inappropriate jokes (the flatulence jokes were a bit overdone). The movie was humorous, nothing gut busting, but it had enough funny parts to keep me smiling or chuckling the whole time. There were no real lulls or low points, just a nice even keel.This movie is middle of the road. I give it a 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "`The Master of Disguise' raises \u0096 and indeed answers \u0096 the question of whether or not it is possible for a movie that bills itself as a `comedy' to run from beginning to end without offering a single funny moment.  (The answer, by the way, is, yes, it can be done).  Thus, while his `Wayne's World' partner, Mike Myers, is out there making both a fortune and an indelible impression on pop culture with his `Austin Powers' franchise, poor Dana Carvey is reduced to appearing in disastrous vehicles like this one. Now don't get me wrong.  I love Carvey's work on `Saturday Night Live,' especially his impersonations of many of the major political figures of our time.  However, Carvey's manic, over-the-top style is, apparently, a whole lot easier to take in small doses.  Watching him mug, cavort and pratfall his way through a laughless script for the better part of an hour and a half ultimately becomes as wearying as it is embarrassing to watch.Stealing much of its concept from `The Mask,' `The Master of Disguise' involves Carvey in some nonsense about a family of crime fighters who are able to magically don all sorts of disguises at a moment's notice.  This allows the filmmakers to enlist the aid of a number of real life celebrities who end up making cameo appearances, in the misguided belief, most likely, that this was going to be a fun, entertaining movie comedy.  Boy, were they misled.  Actually, I have rarely seen a film in which the jokes, `bits' and setups fall as consistently flat as they do here.  To get a general notion of the level of humor in this film, please note that the running gag involves one character's tendency towards uncontrollable flatulence.  It isn't funny the first time it happens and, believe me, it is even less funny the fourth, fifth (or is it sixth?) time around.In addition to the celebrity walk-ons (Bo Derek, Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, among others), Harold Gould, James Brolin, Jennifer Espinoto, Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here.  So is Carvey when you come right down to it. But then Carvey wrote the screenplay, so he HAS to be a good sport about it. After all, he handed HIMSELF this material.  I hope the other actors trapped in this mess at least got paid well for their endeavors.The only good news is that, in the closing credits, we get to see many of the scenes, lines and characters that were, apparently, filmed, then dropped from the final product.  One can only imagine how much worse the film would have been had they all been allowed to stay in.",

After two viewings over the weekend, the kids were quite solemnly quoting lines and then laughing. OK there's a fart joke too many, big deal, Carvey has a good time putting on tons of costumes and following the obviously silly story line as if it was something credible. The 2.9 average here is completely off base. It's not gonna be anybody's all-time classic favorite, but the way this film got sent to the cleaner really is almost unique. If you have a roomful of 11 to 13 year old boys, it's raining and it's absolutely necessary to kill a couple of hours, you'd probably rate really high if you brought this back from the rental shop.",

            "content": "Sheer genius cannot even begin to properly address this cinematic achievement, to call it any less is an insult. Dana Carvey, on the surface, plays a bumbling Italian waiter who inherits the power of disguise; however, if you dig a bit deeper & peel away the layers, you'll find a motion picture which is a scathing, yet biting social political statement on society as a whole. One cannot begin to hopefully comprehend or decipher all the psychological & stereotypical boundaries this film breaks. It is a surprise to find this film in mainstream theaters as a film on this level & caliber would normally only be found in the finest arthouse theaters. If you plan on seeing Master of Disguise, I suggest keeping your afternoon free, as after viewing, no after witnessing it, you'll need the rest of the afternoon to invest in deciphering the dense narrative. Admittingly some of the jokes were over my head, but all truly great comedies take a bit of effort for comprehension. Only for serious film viewers & students of the artform as a whole.",

This was awful. I don't really think they meant it to be awful, I mean the story sounded good, I'm sure...on paper..to a bunch of film executives who were drunk at the time they heard it. Then it probably got by a bunch of other folks in various forms of development who thought, \"This could really be a silly little film that would catch on\". But it wasn't and didn't.In some other universe, I wish there was a better script to punch up the story but they relied too much on Dana's characters that were god-awful and unfunny. This movie was painful to watch -- painful to see talented people on film in a very untalented movie. Someone should have pulled the plug..ceased production for a decade..something..anything.But here we are. This is a major pass..under any circumstance.",

Looking at the user rating of 2.9, one may think that its one of the worst movie ever made but that would not be right. I saw this movie a few years back on TV and thought it was really funny. Yes, this movie doesn't make any sense but that's why its a silly movie but it sure makes you laugh and that's the reason why we watch a comedy. By the way, not many great comedy movies make sense or adhere to logic all the time because they need not do that, they are just suppose to be funny.

I can understand why most of you people didn't like it because he made this especially for his children who are under 13. I loved his little Italian accent and I thought he looked so cute. I went with my dad (who's in his 40's) and my 10 year-old sister and they both laughed! My sister was laughing out loud and there were some parts that I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes. I think I laughed the hardest at the Turtle Guy part. I really liked the guy from India who was charming the snake. I loved the voice he used. Yeah, this movie ain't nothing like the work he did on Saturday Night Live but he does use his talent here and I just enjoyed it. I laughed and that's what Dana wanted the people to do when they saw this movie. It was so great.  Oh, and I will own this movie when it comes out on video!!!",

If you are forced to watch this film, that is probably the only time you should waste watching it. It tries to be funny, but fails miserably. I believe one review I read of it said that it disguised its funny moments better than the main character disguised himself. Sadly, that's the complete truth. Adults, you will find nothing here that's amusing, unless you're really into totally lame, flat jokes. Kids, you will neither find anything amusing in the movie, as the actors are not funny enough to entice any one of any age. The direction was also poor, and the crude humor was (as is in most movies) pointless and dumb. I felt embarrassed just watching it. Skip this movie, and you will miss nothing.",

Spiner proves once more that he is a genuine comical talent, as the likable villain.Dana Carvey is worth so much more, but 'Master of Disguise' isn't bad.

You can see the gags coming, but that only adds to the anticipation, as the goofiness is delivered in spades. We all loved Turtleman, and many of the other nutty characters invented by Dana. It is so difficult to find a family movie that we all can enjoy, that is harmless fun, with no scariness, no mom getting killed (a la Disney), no kidnapping, etc, etc. Only wish there was a sequel!",

He creates one of his best characters ever (The Turtle) and does some of his best impersonations ever as well (Robert Shaw from \"Jaws\" was a personal highlight of mine.)When I saw this film, everyone in the theater laughed the whole way through.  This is a film that will completely go over your head if you try to intellectualize it.  It's just good, dumb fun.

While most would take this as a sign to avoid the film, I am, oddly, trying to complete the list...mostly because so many of these films are actually unintentionally hilarious.The story features Dana Carvey as the cleverly named(?) Pistachio Disguisey, a man who has a strange affliction...he cannot help but imitate those he meets. Not surprisingly, it often results in people disliking him in the film (as well as the audience).Early on in the story, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by an evil-doer (Brent Spiner...whose character farted throughout the movie). So, with Grandpa's help, Pistachio learns to hone his skills to that he can be a true master of disguise and have some hope of rescuing his folks.So what did I think about this film? Before doing this film, Dana Carvey was a bankable comedian...and throughout he seems almost to be trying to destroy his career. In the film he is thoroughly unlikable and grates on you...with his constant mugging and annoying impersonations. The worst was the turtle character...which was truly horrid to watch. On \"Saturday Night Live\", his impersonations were often funny...here they almost never are and come very fast...too fast to bother making these impersonations funny or hash them out in a meaningful way! Apart from Lucas Cruikshank (who made the horrible \"Fred\" movies), I cannot think of a single performance by an actor that is less likable and enjoyable than Carvey's and it's very easy to see how it made the IMDB list. I'd rather watch 80 minutes of a blank screen than see this sort of film again....mostly because some bad films make you laugh because they are unintentionally funny. This one, instead, is supposed to be funny but it just makes you angry and annoyed.By the way, Carvey apparently made this film because he wanted to do a film great for kids. I could only see this if you plan on using it as some sort of punishment. Boorish, awful and easy to dislike.",

            "content": "Dana Carvey was very smart for bringing a movie to the screen like this. Barely ever to SNL veterans do family comedys, but Dana Carvey(SNL, Wayne's World) did. This movie is a bit kiddish in the jokes at times, but it has it's moments. The audience in the screening of this film laughed at a lot of hidden adult jokes, like the Geoge Bush stuff(in SNL, Dana Carvey used to impersonate the elder Bush, in MASTER OF DISGUISE, at one point he does the new Bush). Anyway, even though I doubt very much it'll do first at the box office(my theory will be goldmember, or a very close SIGNS at 1st, and Master of disguise 3rd), I'm still glad Dana could make a great kids movie, without a lot of unneccesary things in films that give it a PG-13 rating. There are a lot of films that would be great family movies, that are loaded with PG-13 material. I'm not saying all the movies should be family, I just hate when there is a really stupid kid movie, I mean take Stuart Little 1 or 2, which could be rated g, and right at the end of the first they throw in language, to give it a pg rating. They didn't even have to do that. Same with pg movies jipped to pg-13. Sometimes you don't need to do it, moviemakers, when it clearly is a kids movie, and filmmakers try to throw in things to make it pg13, when it's kiddish, and no teen's going to go see it anyway, so they're stuck with 6 year olds, going to see pg-13s! I hope that more people realize, that some movies are adult, and some are family. Don't throw things in family movies that don't need to be there, just in hopes of getting older audiences. They're still not going to go see it. But take my advice. See master of disguise, either in theaters, or on video. I saw the screening a few weeks ago, and I did laugh.

Arguably the dumbest movie I have ever paid money to see in theatre (thanks to \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" being sold out), this does not fit in the dumb but funny category of most of Adam Sandler's or Chris Farley's films, but in the jaw-droppingly dumb category.  My wife and I often gazed at each other in amazement during this movie, unable to exactly process that something this truly silly and dumb was made (much less by Dana Carvey and Adam Sandler) and even stranger that others in the crowded theatre were laughing their heads off!  We were excited to see Dana Carvey back in the movies, but there was good reason why this movie was not screened for review ahead of time.To continue, I should say we had misgivings about seeing the film after the TV trailers that kept showing the \"turtle\" sequence, but decided that part was just silly fun and there's no way the rest of the movie could be so unclever and dumb.  To our amazement, that was easily the most intelligent and serious part of the film!  Think carefully before wasting your time with this one..  I score it a generous 3/10.",

If you want to see Dana Carvey in his element, being goofy and playing a bunch of different characters . . . if you know you're watching a movie that's an Adam Sandler production . . . if you just want to kick back and enjoy some silliness (especially fun watching with kids), then this movie can't be beat. IMHO, the \"laugh quotient\" ranks up there with any Jim Carey movie (mention Jim Carey because he was originally offered the part, and would have fit the part played by Carvey well too). What the heck; if you choose Master of Disguise for what it's worth (ie: you're looking for a movie to evoke some mindless laughter), and you have even a semblance of a sense of humor, you won't be disappointed.",

In my opinion, this movie is very poor. Some of the make-up is diverting on a mild level, but that is it. The editing feels cheap and slip-shod, the colours feel diluted and to be honest gave me a headache and the sets and effects are flat. The humour is also of quite a crude kind, including the idea of the villain breaking wind when he laughs, you can tell these are not the ideas of comedy geniuses. The direction is sorely lacking and Dana Carvey clearly looks embarrassed playing a character that is not so easy to relate to, though in fairness none of the characters are that well written at all. The worst parts of The Master of Disguise though are the screenplay which is very lame, the plot which is barely coherent and the mugging which gets increasingly desperate. In conclusion, very poor. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I remember seeing a trailer for this movie several times in 2002, back around the time it came into theatres, and could remember the \"Turtle, turtle, turtle!\" clip more than anything else I saw in that trailer. So, I knew about the film when it was current, but also heard that it was getting really bad reviews. Since then, I have become more familiar with the work of Dana Carvey, who co-wrote and starred in this flick. I have now seen several of his \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches, and also the two \"Wayne's World\" movies, for which he and Mike Myers brought their headbanging alter egos from SNL to film, so I know that Carvey can be funny. Nearly nine years after \"The Master of Disguise\" was unleashed upon the world and disgusted many people, I've finally seen it, and am now not surprised that I can't contradict the majority's opinion.Pistachio Disguisey is a young Italian man who is totally unaware of the fact that he comes from a long line of secret agents who have all been very skilled in disguising themselves for missions. His father, Fabbrizio, decided it was best not to tell his son about the family's legacy. So, instead of being one of these \"Masters of Disguise,\" like his father once was but not anymore, Pistachio works as a waiter in his father's Italian restaurant in the United States, where his mother also works. One night, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman, a criminal whom Fabbrizio brought to justice during one of his missions as a Master of Disguise, but this criminal has just gotten out of prison! After this kidnapping, the youngest Disguisey's grandfather comes to him and tells him about the family's legacy, and then trains him to use his Disguisey powers, so he can take on Bowman himself and rescue his parents. Meanwhile, the kidnapper is now forcing Fabbrizio the help him with his criminal activities! I've seen too many unfunny comedies lately, and sadly, this one is no exception. Like probably most people who have seen this universally panned 2002 comedy adventure film, I didn't laugh at all. Two or three gags did force the corners of my mouth up, with one or maybe two of the slaps for example, but even those aren't usually funny, and perhaps get a bit tiresome. The turtle costume clip I saw in the trailer in 2002 may not have looked so bad, but this part of the movie is a great example of the lameness here, with Dana Carvey as Pistachio trying to be funny, but basically just being ridiculously goofy, and the same can probably be said about most of the other disguises. Many of the jokes in the film involve the lead character's fondness of large female buttocks, and this is never funny. There's also a running gag showing that whenever Devlin Bowman laughs, he is soon silenced by his own flatulence, and this doesn't tend to be funny, even if it ALMOST made me smile later on for some reason. Not only is the humour in his film consistently lame, the plot is also boring and clumsily written.After this film was made, Dana Carvey went on hiatus to focus on his family life, and I can't blame him for that, but this sure was a poor piece for him to leave us with. Since then, he has returned to show business, making several TV appearances and showing that he still has his talent, which is something he didn't show when he made \"The Master of Disguise\". It appears he is also returning to the silver screen in the upcoming \"Jack and Jill\", coming from Happy Madison Productions, the company that was also involved in the production of this 2002 disaster, but no matter how good or bad this movie turns out to be, it looks like Carvey will only have a very small part in it. Well, even if he never plays any major film role again, he has proved to be a talented comedian through his decades in the business, despite this terrible film. I'm not sure if my 2/10 rating is too low, even if most people wouldn't think it is, but now that I've seen it after nearly a decade, I can understand why it was so poorly received.",

But like the curse of SNL goes, that doesn't mean he was able to make a movie.There are actually very few SNL alumns that have made it in Hollywood. I'd say Bill Murray would be the reigning king and, while I don't get their appeal, Will Farrell and Adam Sandler have managed to make a good career of it as well. Sure others have made it with varying degrees of success but it's usually a story that these people just don't go on to bigger and better things afterwards and nobody seems to show this more than Dana Carvey.He had some good skills at making voices, mimicry and characters and so they figured why not build a movie around this and have him take on different roles and characters. But the problem is they forgot along the way that it's not a character that makes a line funny, it's the actor playing the character that does this. And honestly, this failed because the characters he played were just one dimensional and had no point in existing other than to be in this movie to show Dana's range.In the end, it's a highly forgettable and very disappointing movie from somebody that could have done a lot better for himself.",

I can't believe The Master of Disguise got such harsh reviews. It opened in Denmark nearly a year after it did in America so I had plenty of opportunities to read the bad reviews. But I decided to ignore them and to form my own opinion. I went to see it with my sister and I genuinely liked it. Word must have got around, because we were the only ones there, but on the other hand it was one of the smaller theaters in a multiplex cinema on a workday. Actually it added to the whole experience because we could laugh as loud as we wanted. And boy, did we laugh. There were so many funny scenes like The Turtle bit and the all too specific pop-up book, not to mention the slapping dummy. I especially enjoyed the references to other movies like when Grandfather Disguisey shows up Father Merrin style or when Pistachio shows up at Bowman's party disguised as Tony Montana. Another thing I liked was the cameos by for instance Bo Derek. I thought it was a great movie. The characters were both well cast and acted, furthermore I found that all the jokes were well carried out and none of them fell flat, not even Devlin Bowman's flatulence. It's nearly impossible to miss with a good fart joke.What can I say? Sometimes you just can't rely on critics. I can't wait to see Malibu's Most Wanted. I know it too got some harsh reviews but I don't care. I've seen the trailer and it looks good to me. I'm going. Even if it doesn't open in the Danish theaters.",

Honestly we never heard so we thought it wouldn't hurt to see it. Now I love movies and I try to watch some with open minds this one is actually pretty funny.Is it a masterpiece? No but did I enjoy it? Yes because there is actually more to this movie than many give it credit for.The plot of the film centers around Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) who must train to become a Master of Disguise after his parents Fabbrizio Diguisey (James Brolin) and Mother Disguisey (Edie McClurg) are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) Devlin has plotted revenge on the Disguisey family after Fabbrizio set him up to spend 20 years in prison so Devlin blackmails Fabbrizio into becoming a master of disguise once again to help him get the world's rarest treasure. So it is up to Pistachio to save his parents with help from his assistant Jennifer Baker (Jennifer Esposito) along with Grandfather Disguisey (Harold Gould) Plot wise it works for the theme of the film and it actually was interesting for a family film. And it feature some of the most creative comedy I have seen in a long time such as the \"This is what you're doing this is what I want you to do\" and I just roll with the \"Turtle,Turtle,Turtle\" I still laugh at the quotes even now.I recently watch the film again and still found it to be quite enjoyable as the first time I watch it. Now that being said it is not a perfect movie but I actually was entertain by the film so how could I care?Also I enjoy seeing how the cast made their characters work in the film. This is just one of those films if you just watch it with a open mind you might find it to be enjoyable. I mean it has some creative humor that is not seen anymore along with some creative disguises for the film and it's fun there is not too many movies being made today that are actually fun anymore Just give the film a try you might be surprise how well it is actually is Dana is funny in this film and Jennifer makes a good love interest for the protagonist and I never thought I would see Brent as a villain. If you sit down and just open your mind you'll see that there is more to this movie than you are lead to believe it just one of those films you should look past the junk and see the treasure.I give The Master Of Disguise an 7 out of 10",

I went expecting to see Dana Carvey go crazy with all kinds of disguises, but he is in costume for only the last 20 minutes or so, and basically every single one of the disguises is in the trailer. Don't waste your time, watch something else.Elements of the plot that attempt to keep the movie going for the first hour are immature and crude. It isn't suitable for young kids and adults have nothing to laugh at. Nothing is clever or creative. The movie is a sad jumble of wasted film.

The fact is that this movie was not made with an adult audience in mind, and thus appeals much more to kids. I first saw this when I was 8 years old, and I loved it. Watching it again as an adult, I can see why anyone above the age of 12 would not like this movie, but as I said, that doesn't mean it's bad.The plot is simple enough; an evil criminal kidnaps Pistachio's (Dana Carvey) parents in order to steal prized possessions from around the USA, and now Pistachio must learn how to utilize his family's ancient tradition of disguise to get them back. As the story goes along, we see Pistachio utilize many different characters to gain access to information, the most memorable being \"Turtle Guy\", and that really is the main point of seeing the movie: It has Dana Carvey doing all sorts of funny stuff. To this day, my friends and I still say quotes from his characters.Unfortunately, aside from Carvey's performance, the movie doesn't have a lot to offer. Most of the other jokes are very immature and not funny even to little kids, such as a running gag where the main villain farts in the middle of his evil laugh.For what it is, it's not worth seeing if you're a teenager or older, but if you have kids of your own, put this on for them and see if they like it.",

Currently this film has 2.8 at 10 stars and is at the bottom 100: #57. In My opinion this movie doesn't deserve it because its just plain silly and there isn't many films like this one.

I've been meaning to watch this movie for YEARS, due to my LOVE of Dana Carvey, but EVERY TIME I reach out for it, I would put it back down, remembering the awful reviews! But I'm telling you here and now that those reviews are WRONG! This movie had me laughing, rooting for Pistachio to get his happy ending, and angry at DATA from Star Trek TNG, which I couldn't believe was possible, ESPECIALLY with those GORGEOUS blue eyes of his! But I digress, this movie tells the story of a inexperienced, socially awkward man, working as a waiter in his parents Italian restaurant, and he's bullied by about everyone in the world, except his Papa, even when Pistachio has one of his \"episodes\" and fades out and starts channeling a customer's voice and mannerisms, his Papa sees what's going on and tells the customer he's not welcome there, and about a dozen diners leave, but his Papa tells him how special he is, and how proud of him he is! At THAT moment, I fell in LOVE with this movie, became personally involved, and without giving away plot details, Pistachio ended up with a MAJOR crisis on his hands, and I just couldn't even pause it to go to the bathroom, I was too personally invested! This is a fun, funny, enjoyable movie from start to finish!!! The ONLY reason it didn't get a 10 was because the script had some issues I didn't care for, the grandfather's \"help\" bordered on abusive and bullying at times, and everyone's seen the \"turtle\" suit art the turtle club because it was on all the commercials, butt in the actual movie, it bordered on RIDICULOUS! He wouldn't shut up to talk to anyone, he just kept saying \"turtle\" and related things... he was sabotaging himself! ANYONE would have seen through that miles away!!!

I think this movie should have been named \"Spy Kids\" because the real Spy Kids makes this movie look infant.Where to start...Where to start...Dana Carvey's Character, Pistachio Disguisey, is not a lovable character...You feel sorry for him. He has the mind of an eight-year-old and you can tell that from the beginning. And it boggles the mind that Jennifer Esposito's character...Named Jennifer could even fall in love with a moron like him. James Brolin might as well stick to his AAMCO commercials, because after his character gets kidnapped, James himself spends the a good part of the movie in the back seat of a car, not to mention his overly played Italian accent that sounds more like an Italian-American accent. And Brent Spiner, what were you thinking? His character, Devlin Bowman, is just a villain without a cause, or should I say a villain without a reason for his cause. His character wants to steal all the world's rarest items but instead, for what reason was not disclosed at all.Master of Disguise is like connect the dots without dots...Its nothing to connect to.

The story revolves around an Italian family called the `Disguises' that are all, guess what, `Masters of Disguise.'  The family tries to keep this secret from the young Pistachio Disguisie(Dana Carvey) but he soon finds out and then takes it upon himself to also be a `Master of Disguise.'  In a movie like this, we really don't care about the plot but we just want to laugh and there are plenty of laughs in this movie.

            "content": "I felt so bad watching Dana Carvey in this series of skits impersonating a film but he was partly responsible because he helped write this script. Story is about an inept Italian waiter Pistachio Disguisey (Carvey) who works with his parents (James Brolin and Edie McClurg) in a restaurant but one day they are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) who was locked up for many years because of Pistachio's father Fabbrizio who was a master of disguise. Then Pistachio's grandfather (Harold Gould) shows up and tells him that his family has been masters for a long time. Grandfather gives him a crash course in disguises and they find him an assistant named Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito) who helps him track down his parents. They follow clues and this gives Pistachio an opportunity to use his new skills. Bowman makes Fabbrizio steal famous items for his collection like being disguised as Jesse Ventura and stealing the Liberty Bell! This film was directed by Perry Blake and its his first attempt at directing. Yes, it shows. Blake is really a Production Designer and has worked primarily on Adam Sandler films and here he shows no skill at pacing or editing. The film is a mess. Its just a series a skits and all of them are unfunny. Carvey is a talented performer and during moments in this film you can see his true comedic abilities. My personal favorite is when he impersonates Robert Shaw from \"Jaws\" and you can see that all he needs is a good story to showcase himself. We haven't seen much of Carvey lately and thats due to illness so maybe he needed the money badly. Esposito is very attractive but she doesn't show much flare for comedy except for playing everything straight and reacting to Carvey's antics. This was filmed on the studio backlot and it shows. It kind of reminded me of a \"Seinfeld\" episode posing as New York. The film is slightly over one hour long but the credits and outtakes drag on for another 15 minutes! Obviously the story ran out of steam early and to try and make this movie about 75 minutes they tacked on every deleted scene and actors flubbing their line. It all seems so sad and pathetic. Can somebody please write a good script for Dana Carvey!",

I wasn't terribly impressed with the trailers, but I just had to see this to support Dana nonetheless.The film is most definitely a kids movie.  The story is very silly and VERY bizarre at times.  Overall though, Dana Carvey does a fine job.  Some of the humor is right on, and just hilarious, but at other times it really isn't that funny (but maybe it is to a kid, I don't know, I'm not a kid).  Some of the jokes struck me as very odd, here's an example:  There's a scene where Dana Carvey is blatantly parodying Al Pacino in \"Scarface\".  It's actually quite a funny scene, and he does it quite well, but I can't imagine ANY kids of today have seen \"Scarface\", and I hope they haven't.  I myself just recently saw the film.  So, jokes like that really struck me as odd.All the cast members did a fine job.  Dana Carvey does what he does, and does it quite well.  I think Jennifer Esposito is reason enough to sit through this movie.  She looks absolutely fantastic in this film!  The instant her face is shown on the screen, my jaw hit the floor, she has NEVER looked better!  I was happy to see Brent Spiner (aka Data of Star Trek) in the film.  I've always liked his acting, and he did a fine job in this film. One other notable thing is the slew of cameo's in this film.  I won't mention any of them though, I wouldn't want to take away the surprise.If you like silly children's movies or just like Dana Carvey or any of the other cast members, then you should go ahead and check this out.  If you didn't like what you saw in the trailers, I don't think there is any way you are going to like the film.  Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",

Basically Pistachio Disguisey (Wayne's World star Dana Carvey) is a sweet-natured Italian waiter at his father's restaurant, his father Fabbrizio (James Brolin) happens to be a member of the family, one of many, who possess the supernatural skill of disguise. Pistachio's father and Mother Disguisey (Edie McClurg) are kidnapped by Fabbrizio's former arch-enemy and criminal mastermind Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) who is attempting to steal the world's most precious treasures, including the U.S. Constitution, the Liberty Bell and the Apollo 11, using Fabbrizio disguising himself as celebrities to gain access, including Razzie nominated Bo Derek Predator's Jesse Ventura (also a governor) and singer Jessica Simpson. Grandfather Disguisey (Patch Adams' Harold Gould) shows up up the restaurant to show his grandson the power he has inherited from his family, and it is up to Pistachio, as the Master of Disguise, to save his parents and stop the villain in his tracks. Disguises Pistachio assimilates throughout the film, and in the end credits, include the Turtle Guy, Mr. Peru (Tony Montana from Scarface), Quint from Jaws, Terry Suave (David Niven), Cherry Pie Man, George W. Bush, Mayor Maynot, Bob Ross, a Vampire, Charlie McCarthy with an Edgar Bergen mannequin, Groucho Marx, Captain America, Gluteus Maximus from Gladiator, Forrest Gump and a Caveman. Helping Pistachio in his mission, and slowly becoming his love interest, is Jennifer Baker (Jennifer Esposito), going through the various guises the hero gets closer to stopping Bowman's plan, in the end Pistachio stops the villain and saves his parents. Also starring Maria Canals-Barrera as Sophia, Austin Wolff as Barney Baker and Paula Abdul. Carvey apparently does not want a superstar status like Mike Myers, that is a relief to know considering this film, he is a predictable Italian goof ball who only made me titter dressing as a turtle and some recognisable character impressions, he is definitely not a rival for the original \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" Lon Chaney, the disguises with makeup are mildly diverting, but it cannot hide a silly script and a daft plot that hardly makes you laugh at all, it was surprising to read it did well at the cinema, now thankfully it is recognised as a ridiculous and pointless fantasy comedy.

He was great in both \"Wayne's World\" movies, he was one of the reasons \"Saturday Night Live\" became funny again, he's always been hilarious when he's guest hosted SNL in later years, and his stand-up comedy, most especially his 1995 HBO special that aired frequently on Comedy Central, is uproariously funny.For those reasons, I really wanted Dana Carvey to make a big screen comeback and have a movie career as illustrious as Mike Myers'. However, I hope he gets another chance in the next few years with a supporting role in a better movie, because \"The Master of Disguise\" is so much of a disappointment I feel embarrassed for Dana Carvey.That's not to say that Dana Carvey doesn't have some moments of brilliance. His Al Pacino and George W. Bush imitations are both funny and on target, but everything else from his annoying Italian accent to his basic dialogue to his name (Come on, Pistachio?) bury those funny moments like a huge pile of rubble and scrap metal. This movie isn't like a car crash: it's like a wrecker carrying away the aftermath of the crash to the dump, and it's much easier to look away from that scene.Even though James Brolin, Harold Gould, and Jennifer Esposito obviously did their best with what was given to them, the movie as a whole just suffered. You can't blame them for not trying though. Highly anticipated movies like this usually suffer from a weak script, a disappointing ending, or the primary cast being so eclipsed by their fame and reputation that they show up to shoot drunk and stoned, and their jadedness shows through the screen. Fortunately, the latter wasn't true for this movie, but it still needed some major work.Since this movie bombed critically and commercially, Dana Carvey hasn't made any public appearances that I know of either in movies or on TV. I have the feeling, however, that the next project he works on, whatever it may be, will truly be a big comeback for him. Ellen Degeneres, Ben Affleck, and Woody Allen are among those who have made noteworthy and surprising comebacks during this decade so far, and Dana Carvey has the potential to do the same.",

The trailer made it look pretty funny, but when I watched it I only laughed once (Mr. Peru joke) and that one moment was the only good thing I can squeeze out of this poorly executed comedy. I feel bad for Mr. Carvey, he knows how to make people laugh, but the plot was ridiculous, and the character he plays was actually annoying than likable, making Inspector Clouseau look like a genius. This movie made me further appreciate his other work.",

The script is threadbare and not near as inventive as the many disguises Carvey inhabits.  The whole movie feels suspiciously stitched-together and it's a good bet that a lot of material hit the cutting-room floor (a suspicion further enhanced by the short running time; it clocks in at just over 80 minutes, with a good 10 of those stretched out over the end credits with various outtakes and bloopers).  There are moments of inspired lunacy here and Carvey is to be commended for attempting to make the movie suitable for all age groups, but if he'd spent just a bit more time on his script, he might have found himself with a lucrative franchise ala his former SNL and \"Wayne's World\" buddy Mike Myers.  Hopefully next time out he will connect with a script worthy of his considerable talents.  \"TURTLE TURTLE!!\"  My rating:  ** stars",

You'd think he'd be able to tell that considering his name is literally Disguisey? This movie is unbearably idiotic and it only gets worse and worse as it goes on. Pistachio meets up with his grandfather who helps him after his parents were kidnapped. He literally asks him how he was able to know that. He literally never answers, he just does.There's a rule that the grandfather of a master of disguise can't directly help him. Who made this rule and why? Also, how is it that his grandfather is able to help him learn how to put on disguises and slap people when he isn't allowed to directly help him? The master of disguise needs an assistant so they go through a lot of tryouts. Um, didn't they just say that the master of disguise was supposed to be a secret? Why are they allowing all these people to try out for his assistant than? At the end, the villain super glues his own face mask to Pistachio's father and he...just shakes it off? They do the same joke three times where the villain farts followed by twelve seconds of silence. Then he farts three times in a row and farts underwater and the end credits go on for eight minutes to make the 80 minute running time. Pistachio has this really obnoxious voice throughout the whole film too. I think this is the worst thing Adam Sandler ever worked on and that's really saying something. Jesse Ventura has a cameo and I bet this awful movie drove him insane and made him believe in 911 conspiracy theories. 1/2*",

Must be a lot of dopers out there with ready cash for the movies. Movies like this are the best evidence yet for the long-term effects of dope. Every one of Dana's characters sounded nearly identical to the others; just different clothes and teeth.

The best one is of course the Turtle Man, who for those renting the DVD, is used more in order to introduce the deleted scenes.The script itself, well, even the talent of Carvey couldn't disguise how lame it was for the most part.  There seems to be little connections between scenes, and they waited too long into the movie before Dana's character started with disguising himself, which slowed everything down right from the start.If you like Carvey, at least give it a watch, because it is entertaining if you let it be.",

I always liked Dana Carvy and always enjoy seeing his impersonations and comedy routines. I felt like they played it a little too safe though. I'd like to see him and Mike Meyers together again. Maybe Austin Powers vs the Master of Disguise or something where they can both play a lot of roles. Sure Austin Powers is much funnier than this, but it's for adults and is allowed be edgier so it's not exactly a fair comparison. I'd like to see Dana Carvy do something a bit edgier.

I still enjoy the \"This is what you're doing...this is what I want you to do\" joke.  To put it simply, this is pure stupidity. Now, Dana Carvey is a talented comedian.  He was hilarious on SNL and he used to be hilarious altogether.  Is he really gonna depend on this dopey movie to make a comeback?  Dana is best known for his excellent impressions, especially of political figures like George Bush and Ross Perot.  So basically the script (which he co-wrote) enables him to flaunt his abilities as a great impressionist.  His impressions are great all right.  He just doesn't know where to go with them.  In one scene, he does a perfect impression of Al Pacino as Scarface.  That could've been a hilarious scene, but instead he breaks into the same mindless schtick.  How 'bout he says \"You cockroach!\" or \"Say hello to my little friend\"?  Every joke, no matter how silly, has to be based on an element of truth.  There are many other mindless bits like the \"Turtle\" scene.  In the previews, it looked pretty funny.  But in the movie it drags out into a boring, 5-minute scene in which he basically goes around blurting out the word \"Turtle.\"  That's the whole joke.  When Dana is trained to fight from his grandfather, he teaches him to slap people and say, \"Who's your Daddy?\"  Just when did people say, \"Who's your Daddy?\" when slapping people in the face?  And finally, there's a running gag involving Brent Spiner (as the villain) laughing maniacally and suddenly farting.  That's the kind of humor that can only make the youngest of youngsters laugh.    If there's anything to look forward to, it's the sultry Jennifer Esposito. But even she's given a thankless role.  Come on, she gave up \"Spin City\" for this?  \"Master of Disguise\" has some mildly amusing scenes, especially in the first 30 minutes or so, but all in all this is pure silliness.  And by the way, Carvey's George W. Bush impression (which I was desperately waiting for) doesn't come until the end.  So if you've seen the previews, don't bother shelling out your 8.50.  My score:  3 (out of 10)",

Okay, my parents go off and see \"Austin Powers 3\" (BIIIIG mistake) and my little sister and I go and see Mike Myer's scrawny little blond buddy, Dana Carvey. So far so good. Right. So the movie starts and I'm wondering if we wondered into Harry Potter, with the candles and everything, but it wasn't, because I don't think Brent Spiner was in Harry Potter. But it starts- and it goes- for quite a bit, and I wonder if maybe I'd better go to sleep. Even when Carvey shows up, his Italian accent is SO IRRITATING I still wonder about dozing off, if that's even possible anymore. Not a great beginning by any means.But wait...sun shining through the clouds a little? Well, my little sister's laughing anyway. So okay, Carvey's charming a snake. Well, he charms me if he's trying hard enough, so the snake's no big deal. So what? Okay...he's dressed as a turtle. Oh my gosh! He's a big turtle with a bald head and a pointy lip and he's bugging everybody and THE AUDIENCE IS GOING WILD!!! I'm sorry, but I have to stand in Carvey's defense. The main character is a bit of a one-joke, and the joke isn't all that good (keep away from 'funny names'). But the people he slides in as are funny! The turtle, the old lady, the, the, the, and my personal favorite, the British Fellow. I love the British, even if they do look like Dana Carvey and actually aren't British. The British Fellow was my favorite. And the fact is, after the movie got going, and except a few parts when Carvey was being Pistachio (one-jokio) the movie was very funny and good for an entertaining evening, especially if you're with somebody of a youthful mentality who laughs at every fart that comes off the screen (okay, so it was funny once, but they shouldn't have put it in every time). It was ridiculous and fairly badly-written and it wasn't the dialogue that was funny, but the characters! SNL's wild cat is on the movie screen again. Plus I was picturing Carvey teasing Mike Myers about it (\"Wooh! Whupped YOUR butt, didn't I?\") And frankly, the only un-enjoyable thing that evening was the idiot teenaged boys we were sitting next to. Every time there was one of the less tush-deficient ladies on screen, they were...well, making noises. I was driven to adopting my best Graham Chapman voice and saying \"Shut up, you loopy brothel inmate!!!\" Well, no, not really, I made that up. Anyway, the movie really brightened my day, and I laughed all the way home, causing great concern to my parents, who had only seen Austen Powers and therefore couldn't figure out what there was left to live for in the world.",

            "content": "\"The Master of Disguise\" (2002), this might as well be called \"How Not to Make a Movie\". This \"film\" is yet another one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I remember when this \"film\" first came out, I was in elementary school. Back then, I was kind of interested in seeing it. But, I never got around to it, or even buying it on video. Yep, that was still during the VHS transitioning to DVD era. I never saw it when it was first released, and thank God for that! Just over ten years later, I saw it On Demand for free. So, I thought: \"why not? I think I'll give it a watch.\" What a waste of 80 minutes of my life! I'm just all the more grateful that I didn't watch it as a kid. If I did, it would most likely have taken away half of my brain. Seriously, who green-lit this steaming pile of garbage?! This \"movie\" has a boring story, horrible acting, dated special effects, dull sets/locations, and a cheap generic soundtrack. The \"story\", or lack thereof, is one of the most dull and cliched I have ever seen. When I watched it, there was no laughter, there was no enjoyment, nothing salvageable at all! This \"movie\" is only 80 minutes, so it doesn't sound like it's that long. But when I saw it, it felt like I was watching it for days! Another thing, is that this \"movie\" has an extremely long end credit sequence. For a movie to clock in as a feature film, it has to be a minimum of 70 minutes to reach movie length standards. The \"movie\" ends after 65 minutes of runtime, and then there's the infamous 10 minutes plus end credit sequence, but even that's not the end. After the credits, there's not one, not two, but three post-credit scenes! All three of them go absolutely nowhere, and tie into nothing, just like the rest of this \"film\". However, there are movies where a long end credit sequence can work if it goes along with the context of the film itself. Like, if you want to showcase some bloopers, a behind the scenes featurette, etc. When executed properly, long end credits can be fun to watch! But that is not the case for this \"movie\". One thing to point out, the \"most popular\" scene is the Turtle Club scene. That, supposedly, is supposed to be the comedic highlight. It appeared the most frequent in all the commercials and trailers. Believe me, I know! But, when I watched it, I was very disappointed (big shock). It's nothing but Dana Carvey in a cheaply made costume shouting \"turtle\" over and over again. Boring! As for the acting, where on Earth do I begin? All of the actors do a horrible job, especially Dana Carvey, who plays the main character, Pistachio Disguisey. No, seriously.... That's his name! Before I tear apart Dana Carvey's performance, I just want to say one thing. I don't hate him as an actor overall, Dana Carvey is a great comedian. He has played good roles in other movies, and I do enjoy watching clips of him on \"Saturday Night Live\". Dana Carvey is famous for voice impersonations, and that is the concept idea for \"The Master of Disguise\". Now that's a decent idea, and it surely had potential. But it was just so poorly executed! Dana Carvey gave one of the unfunniest performances I have ever seen. He just smiles with his mouth partially open for 95% of the time. Listen, that may entertain kids under five years old for an hour. But if you're older than that, watching that expression for over a minute will want you to pull your hair out! Don't even get me started on his over the top accent. Wow, as if his annoying expression wasn't bad enough! As far as the rest of the actors and actresses performances go, they all suck pretty much as bad as Dana Carvey's. The special effects are dated, and have not aged well. All of the sets/locations are dull and boring, and all the interior scenes are obviously filmed on a sound stage. Now I don't want you to think I'm against sound stages, when utilized properly, they can look like a real life setting. A movie with perfect use of sound stages is \"Flubber\" (1997). Most of the interior scenes are filmed in a studio, but are properly laid out so it's not obvious where it's actually filmed. Back to \"The Master of Disguise\" review. As far as the soundtrack goes, it's just as cheap and generic as the rest of the \"movie\". Bottom line, there is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. \"The Master of Disguise\" is a waste of cinema, and is not worth watching even if you have an opportunity to watch it for free. Life is too short to watch it, go watch real movies instead. Turtle!",

I went into this movie expecting cheesy schlock...y'know, like 'The Animal', 'Little Nicky', 'Wayne's World', etc. Not bad, per se, just would never win an academy award. This movie was the cheesiest of the cheesy. But Carvey's character was just so irritatingly cute in some areas, that I couldn't help but laugh.I would never add this movie to a collection, nor would I go out of my way to watch it again...it falls into the 'Zoolander' category of 'well, I saw it, it was kind of neat, but...I'd rather have bridge work without anaesthesia' category...but I did enjoy the one and only time I ever saw it. Probably because my expectations were so...I was pleased to find there was a little comedy in this movie.Ah, well...back to the slice 'em and dice 'em horrors that keep my interest these days.

Dana Carvey's Turtle Man disguise and performance is as good as any Peter Sellars turn; his homage to Robert Shaw's Captain Quint in \"Jaws\" should have been given a fuller platform; his invention of a high end, antique auction matron vis-a-vis Kate Hepburn and Hermoine Gingold and his send up of a David Niven espionage operative were spectacularly funny. A linear story with believable main characters and situations are not always a requirement for children but would have carried Carvey's talent in a much more enteraining fashion.That said, Harold Gould, James Brolin and Jennifer Esposito deserve, if one exists, the Screen Actors Guild version pf a Purple Heart. Each performed bravely and beautifully in an amiable and harmless mess which probably wounded their careers but was not of their making.I hope Mr. Carvey is forgiven and gets another shot at a full movie.",

Only then did I get to see what attracted me to the movie in the first place, seeing Dana in the different disguises he did, and some that I don't actually remember seeing in the film.  The ones they show on the commercial are not that funny when put into the actual movie.  Unfortunately, most people get up and leave when the credits start because they assume the movie is over.  In most movies the movie is over when the credits start.  Here, there was another 10 minutes of footage after the credits!  But the plot is stupid, and in the role of Pistacio or whatever, Dana's accent is so fake.  It started feeling kind of like a warm and fuzzy Disney movie in the beginning, but then it just goes into Dana's character constantly acting like a jerk.  And as for Brent Spiner's characters running gag, it dulls quickly.  I would not recommend this one to anyone, save your money.  And to Dana, this is not your usual calibre of effort, what gives?",

            "content": "What eye-catching opening credits! What a cast list! What marvelous production design, and art direction! I've been well aware of the film's reputation from the time it was released, but I admit some aspects impressed me after curiosity won out and I began watching. The picture is popping with color both literal and figurative in the set design and decoration, costume design, hair and makeup, and lighting. In smaller, more careful moments of interaction between characters, I think the ensemble illustrates some of the acting abilities we know they have, demonstrating some cheeky nuance. Why, as silly as it is, I think the concept has strong possibilities as an outlandish comedy. And the sound design! Even on a basic, cost-friendly laptop, the audio experience is frankly incredible.I'd love to say that 'The master of disguise' surprised me, and was characterized with still more quality than I anticipated. But that's simply not the case. There are, in fact, some instances where the humor is just right, where the movie achieves a level of farcical energy that earns a laugh or two. These are far outnumbered by instances in which the comedy is hopelessly cheap and juvenile - such as a recurring quirk illustrated by the villain - or outright scatological. Bewilderingly blunt, plainspoken jokes and sight gags, if done right, can add an unexpected cheeky spark to a scene; here, they mostly fall very, very flat. Referential humor is rarely clever, and only dates the picture, while modern pop songs are emphatically inserted at times when they could hardly be less appropriate. The sheer number of costume changes that star and co-writer Dana Carvey has through the runtime is supposed to lend to the exaggerated fun, but that fun is missing in the first place, and the costume changes instead only seem pointless. And then there are the fat jokes, the racist stereotypes, xenophobic caricatures, and sexism.In fairness, there's no mistaking that this feature is intended as a kid's movie. The unswerving simplicity of the plot development informs as much, as well as a lot of the dialogue, and no one but an adolescent could possibly find some of the humor here actually funny. With that said - maybe I was just born a cynic, but I recognize in 'The master of disguise' an astonishingly low grade of would-be amusement. I know to a certainty that if I were 8 years old and seeing this for the first time, I would have been altogether embarrassed to watch it with another person, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it any more then than I have now.This is well made from a technical standpoint, and I do appreciate the contributions of the cast, but what does this truly matter when the comedy is so abysmal? As if to emphasize the point, the small clips shown throughout the end credits, including bloopers, are far actively engaging than the feature, with more (unrealized) potential for laughs. I gave it a try, I really did - I've watched plenty of films that were not regarded well, only to be delighted by how good I thought they were. This is not one of those films. 'The master of disguise' not only consciously rejects the intelligence we know Carvey is capable of as a comedic actor, but frankly patronizes children with its assumption that only the most base humor will provide their amusement. What value this does possess - and it does, indeed, have slivers of value - is far outweighed by tedious, unfunny pablum. Sure enough, there are worse movies you could watch, but few that are as visible and easy to find as this one is.Not recommendable, for any age group.",

In fact, this is what I was counting on. Instead, I was subjected to the most purile and sophomoric humor I have had to endure in a very long time. The entire film seems to have been haphazardly constructed to string together the many character impersonations he has developed, unfortunately, at the expense of an actual plot.The result is a disjointed storyline that even the pre-pubescent target audience must have found confusing, if not down right annoying. Considering that this film was obviously meant for a much younger viewer than the previews would have you believe, I was shocked when at one point in the story, Pistachio is taught that it is wrong to strike someone with a closed fist, but perfectly acceptable to slap them with an open palm, a technique used heavily throughout the film.Unless you are under the age of six, or just a die-hard Dana Carvey fan who can't miss a single one of his performances, I highly suggest you steer clear of this dog.",

So to the other reviewers who don't think this is a kids a movie, not only it is so, but its a Dana Carvey's kids movie.  Its a couple of laughs, but probably not worth the $7 to see it in theatres.

Like many childrens films these days there are jokes and references that only the older audience will appreciate, but overall the film is for you little ones.  And they love it.  I saw Carvey do an interview around the time of the release and he said he wanted to do a movie for his kids.  He felt that all of the stuff he had done in the past he really didn't want kids to see, until they were older. My nephews and all of their friends love Master of Disguise and watch it all the time.  Their constant impressions of the turtle guy and the slapping dummy midget get annoying sometimes, but they enjoy it.  While it is a kid flick, there are plenty of jokes that adults will enjoy, as this is a film that highlights his ability to do impressions.

The most entertaining part of this movie was the ending credits - not that the credits were bad, they actually were funny, with out-takes and probably one of the longest lingering ending to a movie ever. Dana Carvey really missed an opportunity to write and make a breakout comedy here. Unfortunately, the talent of Mr. Carvey is wasted because of too many silly jokes, discongruent scenes, and a pretty flat comedy movie. There are brushes with attempts at great comedy here, but they are not enough to save this movie. If only somebody had been really serious enough to spend more time with the script and make it into a focussed, thematic, serious comedy attempt, then this movie might have done a lot better. Dana tries some new stuff, but experimental comedy is one thing, but using a feature movie to try it out is another. I made it through the entire movie, including the end of the credits which must mean something, but the movie wasn't as funny as it could have been and some of the characters played by Dana just weren't interesting or enjoyable.

However when his father Fabrino(James Brolin)gets kidnapped by a ruthless criminal Bowman(Brett Spliner) who uses Fabrino to steal stuff for him such as the liberty bell and the constitution by posing as famous people from Jesse Ventura to even Jessica Simpson and Bo Derek(who we see in the beginning of the film)it's up to Pistachio to team up with his grandfather(the late Harold Gould) who trains him to become the best master of disguise ever to save his father. So Pistachio and his grandfather find an assistant for him who turns out to be a single mother named Jennifer (played by Jennifer Esposito) who Pistachio starts to like. Will Pistachio save his father from Bowman. Overall it's a silly film that shouldn't be taken seriously. It's so bad it only got 1% on Rotten Tomatoes Tomatoes was dubbed the worst comedy of all time. Dana Carvey is very irritating in this film as he puts on this annoying Italian accent throughout the film and donning silly disguises from an Indian to an elderly woman to even a suavy ladies man.

It's not funny at all!Well, at one week, I had the pleasure of watching 3 American comedies: Problem Child (1989), Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector (2006) and this piece of fart, sorry art. And if you were in my shoes, you have to ask yourself the same question: WHY?!Did the international taste become that desperately in love with the dirtiest limit of toilet humor? Then what a nasty world we're living in, to transform its people into ugly suppressed monsters, who love those disgusting bad movies, and ask for more! Or is it the production companies? As they used to present any hasty comedy, as long as it had the huge amount of farts, vomit, and overall bad tasting?, or is it some bankrupt dull artists, who just want to make any possible nonsense to gain money and fame?!!ANYHOW, it's sick. And here you'll be both disgusted and sad, since it had a good potential indeed with nice new plot, a comedian who's determined to be a big star, the powers of make-up, and the opportunity to create a different parody out of famous cinematic characters. But the final result was truly unbearable!I guess that there wasn't much of actual script in this. There was nothing but improvisations. However, very stupid and unfunny improvisations. You'd feel the rashness in everything, otherwise why the police ordered (Pistachio) not to call them again?! Why the grandfather came while nobody called him? How the grandfather came in the bubble?? How all the thefts were done so easily because all the guards all over America deliver all its treasures to famous people just because they're famous people??!! How the lead managed to be that James Bond at the end, to beat 20 strong men?! Not to mention: How to disguise as animal's manure?? How to create a whole character just to fart all along? In fact, it's much simpler than making something novel, distinct, and less sickening!As for the acting, the crime is much bigger. I've never seen (James Brolin) in worse movie, and I kept asking myself how he could bear all of this? (Brent Spiner) is a wonderful comedian, not a machine to manufacture farts. And (Dana Carvey) here is quiet awful to an extent that you won't believe it until you watch it. He intolerably overacted, being dead set on destroying himself with all that detestable continuous Italian accent, lengthy jokes and inept physical performance. That wasn't laughable inasmuch as horrible. Sometimes he was over any standing's possibility, to turn eventually into the master of silliness. The only watchable thing he did was the impersonation parts, especially (Robert Shaw)'s one. However with another treatment, that could have been so enjoyable in a complete movie, because what we have already seen was a complete pain!It's obvious that the best thing in this movie was the creative cartoon of the opening credits. It was the sole thing that was done with intelligent talent. And as for the worst thing, it's - of course - the sequence of the turtle man. OH MY GOD, it was disturbing and ambiguous, and maybe disturbing because of being ambiguous! The only explanation I see for that crime of a character was that they wanted to insert an impersonation of (Kermit the Frog) of The Muppet Show anyway, so they put it in a human form, and maybe not owning the copyrights led to not giving it a name. At any rate, it was totally abominable, especially when he eats someone's nose then puts it back in its place!Just who would hate himself more: (Carvey) for making a movie that nearly ended his cinematic career after promising ones like Opportunity Knocks (1990), and Clean Slate (1994)? Or ourselves to watch this kind of farts many many times those days? After reading some reviews, where I found how this movie being so loved (the turtle man part in particular!), I felt that this comedy could make you doleful, not because of witnessing bad movie that could have been better, but also for witnessing how people began to love ugliness, filth, and low level, passionately... And they made a DVD of it with the director's commentary?! Now here's finally something funny about this movie!",

All that said, I have never seen such intensely horrible IMDB reviews (e.g. `the worst ever') for a movie that actually wasn't that bad.  Its no great work of art, but I actually enjoyed watching it through adolescent eyes.  It's was intended as a kid's movie for Christ's sake\u0085!  Its supposed to be stupid with goofy repetitive gags and lame humor.  But done with a good wink and a nod, if anybody was watching. People saw Dana Carvey's name on the label, thought it was going to be the next Wayne's World or whatever, and were disappointed when it wasn't.  But Dana's charm is there in spades, I loved all the characters he created in this senseless little movie, and the story actually wasn't much lamer or thin than Wayne's World's 1 or 2 \u0096 if you want to complain about plot within comedy skit-driven movies.Its also pretty obvious from the brevity of the film (only 65 minutes of movie), and the fact that a heap of scenes in the 15 minutes of end-credit outtakes are not in the film, that this flick is an abbreviated version of what Carvey and director Blake originally intended.  Who knows what were the reasons, but I'll bet even money that some cost overrun, studio intervention or other problem resulted in at least a third of this film winding-up on the cutting room floor.  Before watching this movie, just put yourself in the same mind frame as `Spy Kids', but without all the big budget special effects, gadgets and elaborate sets, and you'll probably have a much better chance of enjoying what you see.  I can see why some folks might only give this movie a 4 or 5 (out of 10), but one of the worst films ever?  Never\u0085!",

            "content": "_Master_of_Disguise_ is a niche market movie made and designed by Saturday Night Live folks of today or recent yesteryear. It stars Dana Carvey and also has SNL Adam Sandler in it and he produced it. But, the movie under credits the other stars of the film and fails to mention in its ads the cameos in it that might bring in other niche audiences other than the SNL audience. Brent Spiner plays the villain, Devlin Bowman, and this is one of his bigger non-Star Trek roles.  He seemed to be having a lot of fun in the movie. He gives the character the relish and the glee he gives Lore and some other characters he has also played in the past, but in some ways, it is a new character, but I do see some common denominators between this character and one or more characters he has played in the past.  The other actors and people in the film who were playing themselves, seemed to be having some fun with it also. It is good to watch a movie where one or more actors/actresses really seems to be enjoying what they're doing.  That often seems to be the case with Mr. Spiner. He never leaves his heart behind, but always includes it in any given role. That's one thing that makes Mr. Spiner different from a lot of other actors - he acts with his heart and not just with his head. One catch in the movie is the Cigar Club Turtles which Mr. Carvey has some fun jokes on and Mr. Spiner's character smokes its cigars. But, there really is a Turtle Club out there. It is a secret society. I hear that Johnny Cash is a Turtle. An ex-boyfriend of mine is a Turtle. I may count as a Turtle, too, because I know the secret answer to the secret question.  Anyrate, I laughed all of the way through and saw it 2 extra times for good measure and I don't normally watch SNL because I'm bizzy watching BritComs a lot on Saturday Nights on our local PBS station. But, this was indeed a very funny movie.  Go see it, if you haven't.  Niche markets that might enjoy the film are: SNL audience, Star Trek audience, other actors/actresses/personalities' fans such as Jesse Ventura, Turtles, Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity (most APOs are usually Turtles also), and ages 10-mid-twenties or whenever most people outgrow bathroom humor. But, older people may enjoy it also. The movie has the added flavor of most of the actors/actresses having had stage experience. There is always a different feel to T.V. and movie stuff when the actors are people who are used to performing live, on stage for some reason. Maybe it is the over-the-top feel which more recent Star Trek series tend to be lacking on.  It is your basic silly movie that I've heard Patrick Stewart say is, \"America's gift to the world.\" (our silliness)",

It is a very campy and childish movie about a man named Devlin Bowman who kidnaps Pistacio Disguisey's father so he will be able to steal world treasures. To save his father, Pistacio must learn how to become a \"master of disguise\" with help from his grandfather and his sidekick, the Jennifer Esposito. Antics ensue.

The characters are bland, the jokes aren't funny at all, and while the story could be interesting it just falls flat on its face like the kid earlier in the movie who the main character (Dana Carvey) tries to cheer up with impersonations. Speaking of which the main character's name is Pistachio Disguisey and he's a doof. I have nothing against Carvey but needless to say his talent was wasted in this movie.The story is him trying to save his family from the main antagonist Devon Bowman (Brent Spiner) with the help of his Grandfather (Harold Gould). His grandfather teaches him disguises he can use which you'd think would be funny but again they fall flat. Stay away from this movie as much as possible. It's god awful.

He talks with a silly yet endearing Italian accent, and he puts on lots of disguises in his quest to save his parents, who have been kidnapped by a bad and rotten evil-doer who wants his father to use his disguise mastery to do bad and rotten evil things, blah blah blah.

But the villain is too predictable and he has a stupid farting problem, his henchmen are to dull, and the whole idea of coloring the movie to match it's main actor for purpose was just too idiotic. Can you kill ninjas by slapping them, can Jesse Ventura steal the liberty bell, are there masters of disguises? NO! This film is pure rubbish, skip this film. You will be happy without it.

My daughter laughed but then again she is 8 and jokes about farting (of which there are many) are just so darn funny to her.   The story was flat, the acting poor.

The previous review here further cemented my decision to see this movie immediately.  What I found, however, left me irritated and empty.In short, the only funny parts of the movie were during Dana Carvey's caricatures.  The rest of the movie was a sorry attempt at screenwriting. First off, I didn't realize beforehand that this movie could've been rated \"G\" except for one \"nuts and weiners\" joke;  thus, most of the humor in the screenwriting was more akin to 8-year-olds than fairly mature adults.  But, keeping this in mind, there was still a chance this movie could've been pulled off.  However, the cliche-filled plot wasn't even worth following because it had so many holes in it, it was more akin to a collander. Combine that with only passable acting and very shallow character development (especially in the lead woman character, who had a lot of potential that wasn't realized), and what you have is a movie that is utterly pointless.And this is a real, real shame considering Dana Carvey's obvious comedic talent.  Honestly, the funniest part of the movie was the credits, with all the outtakes and characters that never made it into the movie.  If you're a real Dana Carvey fan, get it on video and fast-forward to his impression-bits and the credits.  Otherwise, see something else.",

            "content": "Being a big-time Dana Carvey fan, this movie was such a disappointment. This movie does even more damage to Dana's poor track record of movies.We all know Dana's strengths as a comedian.  He is a great person at performing different characters and impersonations.  So one would think that `The Master of Disguise' is a perfect forum for Dana to showcase his talents.  So what could go wrong?Let me start.  Most have called this a kid's movie.  But is it?  I think others mistake a movie that is SO STUPID that it must be a kids movie. Let's just say it was a kid's movie.  Which I doubt but let's assume that Dana would make the first kids movie he has ever made and let's assume Happy Madison productions decides after about 20 or so movies to make a kids movie.  Why the heck is Dana Carvey targeting kids?????  Do any kids even know who he is?  Do any kids want to go see a kids movie by a guy who was on Saturday Night Live in the 80's?Anyways, here is my opinion of why this movie was terrible.  First of all the main character was a total:  imbecile, moron, dufus, man-child, etc. This Character made Pee Wee Herman seem like James Bond.  The character was so idiotic that it wasn't funny.  It was ok for about 5 minutes but he was that way the whole movie.  He was so dorky that I don't believe anyone in the movie theater hoped he would get the hot girl.   Of course he did.Even his disguising wasn't funny.  Let me give a few details on the Turtle Man.  Here's all there was to that gang.  Pistachio (Carvey) found a clue that the bad guy would be at the Turtle Club.  So he thinks the best way to get in is to dress like a turtle.   When he gets in the club do you think he does anything clever?  Of course not \u0096 his character is a moron.  Besides standing out like a sore thumb in a high class club dressed like a turtle all this moron does do is say `Turtle' over and over again.  That is it. Oh, yes he lifts his head in and out of the shell a few times.  Picture this a guy in a turtle costume in a high class club lift his head in and out of the shell and saying:  `Turtle\u0085\u0085.Turtle\u0085..Turtle\u0085..Turtle\u0085.Turtle\u0085\u0085.' etc. Is that funny?  Sounds like reject material for another Happy Madison movie called the Animal.This is what I think Dana should of done to correct the script.  Do more impersonations, less of the `turtle guy' humor (which is all you get).  He had two somewhat humorous Dana Carvey type parts.  One with Dana as George W Bush and another of Carvey playing the Robert Shaw character from Jaws. But even there it could have been funnier.  But back to my recommendations: More impersonations (not two).  And MOST of all the main character should have been played more straight.  Maybe even like his characters from his other movies:  Clean Slate or Opportunity Knocks.If  you must see a Dana Carvey movie see the Waynes World movies or even Clean Slate and Opportunity Knocks were better.  Take if from a fan of Dana's from the SNL days this movie was SO DISAPPOINTING.",

I've seen serious drama that was funnier than this movie. Even Greek tragedy is funnier than this movie. Basically, this movie is supposed to be funny, but instead it's cringe worthy. The raison d'\u00eatre of this movie is that Dana Carvey is good at impersonating people, so that's what he does throughout the movie - but it just isn't funny at all. Yes, there is a really stupid throwaway story about a lineage of \"masters of disguise\", but that's just a setup for Dana's impersonations. And they're not funny. He does an impersonation of Scarface which people seem to like, but even that one is overacted - which is kind of impressive when you consider how Al Pacino did chew the scenery in the original movie. Dana Carvey just CANNOT ACT, and he doesn't even try. He can make stupid \"mime\" style faces, that's all. I cannot imagine who their target audience was? This is way too juvenile for the Wayne's World crowd, but this wasn't presented as a children's movie, but rather a Dana Carvey vehicle?The producers of this must be blamed.

Some of the bad ones have redeeming qualities; they're dumb, but fun, (Armageddon), or have a really cool premise that just missed the mark, (Southland Tales), or are just so silly and ridiculous they become cult classics, (Kung Pow). 'Master of Disguise' is none of those, and is not even bad - it's god awful. A film so bad it deserves it's own classification. On the level of films like 'Cats' or 'Showgirls', it's a film so bad it's a wonder how it was even green-lit in the first place. At a glacial 80 minutes, (including the beginning and end credits), it feels like 8 hours.Starting with a weak premise, (a 'Master of Disguise', whatever that is), that's merely an excuse to get Dana Carvey to do impressions - the audience gets to experience Carvey's nonsensical training which includes; dressing up in brown-face and doing racist accents, objectifying women, (they literally ask a woman her measurements and them mock her for having a small backside), acting like a creep to kids, and an avalanche of other despicable, unfunny moments. The supporting cast, including Spiner, Brolin and Esposito all give it their best - but when a recurring fart joke is the funniest thing in your movie - you've got major problems.Although I've never liked his comedy or skits, Carvey seems like a nice person, and is hilarious in interviews, (his series of interviews on the 'Conan Needs a Friend' podcast are a riot). Maybe Carvey should just stay in the writers room; when he's on screen, it's an absolute disaster.",

For instance, jokes about Al Pachino and butt measurements are fine, for adults, but children will not get them. Dana Carvey's lead is almost too simple. For example, he channels the energy needed to impersonate people well by simply chanting, \"become another person\" or \"become someone else\", kids will get it, but I think even children would prefer something a little more cryptic and clever. One thing I will say, on the positive is the flatulence gag. As an adult it's not funny but the running gag with the villain laughing himself until flatulence would probably be very funny to a kid. The most confusing thing about this whole movie is the \"blooper reel\". There are entire sketches in the reel that look as if they put in almost as much effort into as the actual movie, it wasn't very long, why not put them in? I'm serious, this is a short movie that probably has the longest blooper reel in history. In conclusion, this one is painful. However, it's not just boring like \"Super Mario Brothers\" nor is it a complete waste of time like \"Disaster Movie\", so I give it a 3.",

            "content": "Ever seen a film that makes you hate life? This one is really close....I'd start off with saying 'spoilers', but the entire film was basically shown in it's trailer. If you saw the trailer, you saw what may have been worth watching. After plopping down my 5 bucks (matinee's are the only way to go these days), I sat down in a nice theatre awaiting a new film by Dana Carvey. I will admit a liking for him, he has made me laugh in the past. I was even willing to look past the fact that he has never shown he can carry a movie, playing smaller parts much better and coming across as less annoying.The movie: The movie follows a...well.....retarded 30 year old named Pistachio Disguisee. He's not supposed to be retarded, but there is no other explanation for him. He comes from a long line of Master of Diguise's, but his Papa (James Brolin)elected to hide this from him in order for a more normal life. But the family way was always with Pistachio as he mocked people from the day he was born. His father owns a restaurant where the whole family works and, apparently, other waiters are allowed to keep their jobs while making a fool of Pistachio. Anyway, a long ago bad guy (Brent Spiner) of his father comes back to town and kidnaps the parents and forces Papa to do his bidding by disguising himself and stealing rare artifacts. He does this by threatening Mama (Edie McClurg), who is kept under a drug induced haze. That's when Yoda... I mean Grandpa comes to town. He's never met his grandpa, so he calls him his sister. HAHAHA!! WOW! Wait the Laughs are just getting started. Everytime you see the bad guy, someone farts and stops the entire screen. FUNNY!. Listen, Grandpa teaches him the art of the Jedi...I mean Disguisee, he hires an assistant, Jennifer Lopez, or someone like that. They both go under cover in all sorts of suits and such to find out who's doing the evil bidding...and.....and....URGGH!!!!! At this point in the theatre, the 6 people have dwindled to 2,  me and my mother, who was begging me to take her back to her group home!! I was tempted to, but, it was my weekend with her and we had to do something to pass the time. The rest of the film is filled with pointless story, bad characters that make you cry and shameless hamming by Carvey. Turtle Man made me frightend for the future. The fact that Pistachio only liked woman who had child bearing hips was the only thing I could relate to. The running fart joke made me laugh, but it was because I was farting along with it. Sadly, I left to use the restroom (chaining mother to her chair), came back and found that the movie wasn't over, and yet, I hadn't missed a thing. I couldn't tell if something important happened or not. The best part of the movie is when the credits are rolling and it says something about what type of film they used and shows the little symbols for the companies. That meant it was over and I could go home. SO the morals of this film are: Accept the fact that you're not a lead actor, never advertise using the bits that may have been funny if not seen before, and always make sure you see these movies with people that can't run away. Amen.",

            "content": "OK. First off: The only bad thing in this movie is the short scene where the main actor plays GW Bush.Bear in mind this flick was produced (paid-for) by Sony Entertainment USA.Of course, their headquarters (boss-etage) are in Japan, which still bears a grudge against USA because of Pearl Harbour and Hiroshima/Nagasaki.But Japan was allied to the German Nazis, and USA had to defeat fascist Japan in those times. Much later, in the 60ies and 70ies only, America became corrupt and abusive in the Corean and Vietnam wars, which were unnecessary like the later Bush Senior and Bush Junior propaganda money oil wars. Both Bushs caused the biggest economical crisis in mankind's history, bigger even than 21 and 24 in Germany.Because of Bush alone, who let 911 happen in spite of some 10 warnings and 5 FBI investigations prior to 911, crushed by the Bush administration to have a reason to cease Saddam's oil, because Cheney found out USA's oil would soon run out, as well as the Saudi arabian oil, because of Bush alone, USA is now filled with poverty and racist hatred, a very bad development.The main actor, \"master-disguised\" as GW Bush, retrieves the stolen constitution from crook Devlin Bowman, after which the latter is thrown into the pool by that faked GW Bush.Therefore, GW Bush is displayed positively, as a \"hero\" in this movie.The whole rest of the movie, foremostly the main actor's impersonation of not only Robert Shaw's \"Jaws\" role, but also of Peter Sellers doing an Indian chap, as well as Peter Sellers playing a female role (\"you foool\"), and some other persona clich\u00e9s, is just great.This movie is good, but sadly, and be it only in a really short scene, it had to pay tribute to the former awkward US president GW Bush, which like his father is a complete idiot.I personally don't care for people who don't share my political view.What I say here and how I see it all is the truth, and nothing but it. Anyone contradicting me is simply wrong.The first commentator was embarrassed about many other negative comments. If that big number of negative comments is not based on the much too positive, slimy GW Bush scene, I don't agree to the majority of other commentators. Anyway, American people are known nowadays for a long time already to be totally, helplessly stupid, because under-educated.The slapstick including structural violence also in this movie is one sign how the American crowd is made to laugh: By primitive, violent, in fact not funny jokes, which are only funny because of the scenery, the music and cutting of the movie.And why Brent Spiner never EVER alludes to his Data Star Trek role, is out of comprehension. Would that be too much dis-illusion for the average, dull and racist American crowd? Probably, yes. Those repeated fart-jokes are really not so funny after some time, anymore.It depends what the other criticizers refer to in their critics. I think most people are too stupid to judge anything. And I think, oh, I'm lying; I KNOW that I am high above the average IQ of most people.Cheerio to all people who think and see as I do. Live long and prosper and ciao!",

He is an amazing comedian.Overall, this film is nothing horrendous. It doesn't have much of a message, the comedy can only be enjoyed by small children, and it's quite forgettable.

Dana Carvey stars as Pistachio Disguisey, an Italian waiter who has a strange and uncontrollable addiction to mimicking his customers. When his mother (Eddie McClurg) and father (James Brolin) are kidnapped by a criminal mastermind (Brent Spiner), Pistachio learns with the help of his grandfather (Harold Gould) that he has inherited a magical power that allows him to disguise himself as anyone in the world, which he must use to save his parents.I don't know what Dana Carvey was thinking when he decided to take part in this film. I believe that it was a waste of his great acting abilities and this has probably ruined his career (in fact, according to his IMDb page he hasn't been in anything since this.) My main problem with this film are the childish, unfunny jokes. There just aren't any laugh-out-loud parts of the film that I can remember. For example, there is a running joke in which Spiner's character has uncontrollable flatulence and it fails terribly to gain a laugh.I think that they had a good plot line in their hands, but it got lost in the terrible writing. This could have been a classic, fun family film that both parents and children could enjoy and could have made Dana Carvey very well known and more of a household name. It's a shame that this film was so bad because Dana Carvey has so much talent.The only good thing I can come up with about The Master Of Disguise is that kids will love it.

Dana Carvey is a funny guy, but unfortunately the director of this half-hearted effort clearly knows nothing of timing. SNL alum Carvey (Wayne's World) plays Pistachio Disguisey, a well-meaning Italian waiter with an annoying tendency toward slap-stick idiocy. Take for example, an early scene where he trips and dumps spaghetti all over the heads of a wealthy family. He then proceeds to grate cheese on them. If you find this description hilarious, this is a good movie for you. The plot, although completely inconsequential, involves Disguisey's revelation that he is a member of the legendary Disguisey family which means that he has the god-given talent to transform himself into anyone or anything he wants. He uses this talent to find his parents, who have been kidnapped by the evil and flatulent Devlin Bowman. To help him out, he joins with sexy partner Jennifer Baker (Jennifer Esposito, doing her best to save this movie) with whom he has some romantic tension, even though, in his opinion, her butt is too small. That's basically the level of intelligence in this movie. Other winning jokes include gags about cow pies, explosive flatulence, and wearing> underwear on one's head. Blatantly quoting lines directly from `Shrek' serves only as a testament to how few new ideas this movie has. Are there no funny moments? To be honest, there are a few. Carvey pulls off a dead-on impersonation of Robert Shaw's character from `Jaws' in one of the few scenes that hits its mark. Jennifer Esposito puts in a charming performance. And, in what is unquestionably the movie's funniest moment, pistachio quotes from Madonna's `Papa Don't Preach.' But will kids appreciate any of the elements I just mentioned? No, of course they won't. and hopefully, they'll be intelligent enough to not appreciate anything else this tired and unfunny movie throws at them. (*/****)",

The acting from EVERYONE in this film is terrible, the storyline is weaker and more helpless than an insect in a blender and the jokes are the height of immaturity and child like toilet humour. The \"Turtle\" Sketch is incredible.. When it comes to showing how unfunny this film is. Adam Sandlers production company has really got to be shaken up. If they thought this would be a good film then heaven help us if they want to make a second one or any other film along the same lines as this film.It was terrible.

Is it thereby worthy of more stars? I think so. The weirdness and lousy effects makes this film really funny, and if watched between 23:00 and 04:00; hilarious. Many quotable scenes that won't make sense to anyone who has not yet seen this masterpiece and many other scenes that are just cringe-worthy and better off forgotten about. Despite of the terrible rating and overall mediocre performance this really is a film worth watching.

            "content": "For my purposes, this title gets a 8 out of 10. Five for the movie itself, an extra two points for Mr. Spiner's diamond blue eyes, and one for the set designer who had the presence of mind to arrange Spiner's character's color scheme around them. Everything around \"Devlin Bowman\" is blue and white and the effect is quite striking.The movie is a ninety minute fart joke. I'm not kidding.Harold Gould, by far and away, delivers the best overall performance in the movie (such as it is). Casting James Brolin in this movie was a definite stroke of completely ridiculous genius. Austin Wolff is, of course, adorable, and Dana Carvey's particular brand of multiple personality disorder is as entertaining as ever (I got a definite chuckle out of Mr. Peru).Like I said, the movie is a ninety minute fart joke and is quite clearly directed at males between the ages of eight and twelve. If you have a roomful of those kind of people and you'd like them to stop breaking things by playing baseball with the ceiling fan, this movie will at least put them all in one room and occupy them with disgusting noises for about an hour and a half. There's no swearing. The (incredibly) mild \"blue\" content is really tame and based on a cartoony visual gag, as is the \"violence\". It's supposed to be a silly, sight gag based comedy and that's exactly what it is.As for Spiner (you knew I was getting to it); first of all, he's gorgeous. Like I said, the character's entire color scheme is a shade of electric blue that compliments his eyes to the point of being captivating. I was hitting the pause button just because I *had* to look. The jokes are (of course) at his character's expense (he *is* the bad guy, after all), and he, appropriately, rolls out his very best \"smarmy/irritated\" act (the one that stole \"Out To Sea\" right out from under two legends). It's amusing and relatively gentle right up until the climax of the movie, where he hits the \"crazy button\" and doesn't look back. Then it's just plain hilarious. In terms of Spiner-related content, I got exactly what I wanted out of this movie and just a little bit more.By the way, Classmates.com owes Spiner a big, wet kiss (trust me).",

Parts made all so familiar in the trailers such as Dana repeating over and over and over again \"Turtle, Turtle\" was one such instance. Yet another would have to be him saying, \"I want to be a master of disguise\". If I had any doubts of how unoriginal and untalented Dana Carvey was, I have none now. I will make it a point to avoid ALL of his movies. I just wish he hadn't dragged 'Data' down with Dana, however he DID make a couple of parts in the movie laughable... Avoid this movie at all costs. If you are like me you will want to scream and stop watching it.

            "content": "Go see The Master Of Disguise, the new film staring Dana Carvey (Garth from Wayne's World). It's best if you take a kid with you aged between 6 and 10yrs. Any younger and they won't quite get it... Any older and they'll be horrified!! But in the middle, they'll just laugh their socks off and quote all the disgracefully unfunny lines until they're sick (or you are!!)\nJust got back from seeing it with my daughter Sally - she has bellyache from laughing so much, and me and her dad were laughing a LOT too. Just not for the same reasons. It's delightfully crap, and in ALL seriousness, the very best bit is the end credits. No, really!  The final credits sequence contains some funny bits and pieces either not in the film or specially made for the credits, of the actors goofing about in a very embarrassing way. A kind of 'Something About Mary' style combo of out-takes and stuff. It's cut much snappier than the rest of the film, which was never gonna be American Beauty, but which suffers terribly from half-arsed direction and bad editing to give a very sluggish, embarrassingly badly timed, only-for-the-kids comedy film.It's gonna be famous though. Just probably not in a good way. Already touted as the Worst Film EVER Made, the critics are having a ball going on and on about Dana Carvey trying to be Mike Myers, and it being a vanity project. This is a little unfair. I don't think Carvey was trying to do that at all with this film, I think he just wanted to make a goofy comedy for kids, and it succeeds as that, if my 8 year old daughter Sally is anything to go by.It's not a good film by any stretch. It's a very very bad film. But kids will love it, and adults will just LOVE to see how very BAD it really is!! However, nowhere near the Worst film ever made. It's better than Forget Paris. Better than The Avengers. And at least as good as Howard the Duck! :-DI reckon the Vanity Project bandwagon that most critics have latched onto is just a little harsh. Carvey was on the right track here, but fell prey to bad editing and directing. The film needed pace and timing to pep up the obvious comedy enough to make the mums and dads enjoy it as much as the kids. It's very physical, goofy and embarrassingly puerile in places - just right for 6 to 10 yr olds who love Mr Bean, Emu and The Chuckle Brothers. Dana Carvey is harmless and unthreatening, but a long long way from cool. Kids will be fine with this - they aren't as judgemental as us grown-ups - but the critics will (are) have an absolute ball ripping it to shreds. I just wanted to redress the balance a bit, and maybe Dana Carvey will have the sense to draft me in on his next film to pep up the pace for him!Personally, it was great to take my daughter to a silly, goofy, old-fashioned, funny movie without worries about overt violence or sexual references, and she had an absolute whale of a time. I too really enjoyed screeching at the bad bits in a kind of Plan 9 From Outer Space frame of mind.Brent Spiner (Mr Data from Star Trek:The Next Generation) is perfectly awful. Truly. In a good way, though, and he's obviously got the crap comedy villain market covered. Fair play to him - someone has to do it, and it's nice that it's not some Englishman Clich\u00e9 for once. I just hope he can laugh at himself there. A lot. A very lot.\nJust go see it. It's Car Crash Comedy! It has to be seen to be believed.\nMiss Gossage - Connoisseur of Very Bad Films!",

I don't normally write negative reviews on IMDb, since tastes may vary and movies I didn't like might be good for others, but this one was so terrible that I felt the urgency to come online and post a warning to anyone who might conceive the idea of watching it. Please don't do it - this movie possibly classifies as one of the worst films ever, and not even of the \"bad but involuntarily funny\" type; rather of the \"I'd rather be dead than watch this again\" type.Basically, the movie revolves around Dana Carvey, who plays an idiot (or is an idiot - at least that's what I think now after watching the movie) who learns to disguise himself perfectly as other people. The entire movie is just an endless series of gags with Carvey disguised as characters who are supposed to be funny and are designed only to let you say \"oh how good is Dana Carvey in disguising himself\"; unfortunately, they instead are so obvious, dumb and hopeless that even a 4-year-old would find the movie boring.To make things worse, the writers decided that this was enough for the movie to work, so there is no real plot whatsoever, and you are even confronted with plain inconsistencies in the script - such as when Jennifer Esposito gets invited to the villain's party and introduces herself as \"Barbara\", but once she's there she's repeatedly called \"Jennifer\" by everyone. The villain is played by Brent Spiner and now I understand why his career started and ended with Star Trek; moreover, several supposed celebrities (Bo Derek in 2002? Jessica Simpson?) play cameos that should make you think how good is Carvey to disguise himself as these people, but they don't, since he doesn't disguise at all and just hired the real people instead.And when you eventually think that the movie has reached the minimum length to be allowed into theatres so to reap your money and let you go home, Carvey pops up again with just about the worst imitation of George W. Bush ever made, and then tortures you with minutes and minutes and minutes of unfunny bloopers, and no, that's not enough, after the bloopers and final titles end, he feels the need to add an even less funny scene in which he reveals the dwarf that operates the wooden puppet in the movie, and starts to chat with him, and you just want to shoot him, the dwarf and the entire TV set.Bottom line: Dana Carvey should not be allowed in front of a camera again, unless he can expiate by watching Naked Gun and Hot Shots at least a hundred times to learn how to do stupid movies properly!",

There's no problem with the beats (they are the foundation of every successful movie) but they stood out like lumps in oatmeal. And they were neither funny nor dramatic not believable. This movie was a waste of a talented comedian and I wondered why it was so bad. Then I remembered that Happy Gilmore Productions is Adam Sandler's movie and, except for \"Punch Drunk Love,\" all of Sandler's movies are sloppy and juvenile and not very funny. Watch this movie only if your are besotted with Adam Sandler's humor (?) otherwise give it a wide berth. If only Carvey had had the strength to say no.",

I love Dana Carvey, and I'm convinced he's one of the best comedians around, so I'm simply incapable of understanding how, and why, he could put such a painful failure on the silver screen. To add insult to injury, he also co-wrote the script, which means he has absolutely NO excuses!Have you seen \"Dumb and Dumber\"? Well, \"The Master of Disguise\" will make it look like \"The Godfather\". Heck, even \"Battlefield Earth\" will seem like a majestic masterpiece by comparison! The characters are cliched, flat, and deadly boring, and there is not a SINGLE joke or situation that anybody aged 3 and above will find even remotely funny.I always feel I owe the creators of any movie at least as much as to watch their film from the beginning to the end once I rented it, but this time I actually had to cover my eyes to survive this torture, and ran the entire garbage with the time-counter on-screen to keep my hopes - and thus myself - alive. There is not a moment, not a single scene, not a single character that's interesting. The only part of this movie that's remotely watchable is the opening credits, which do have a certain Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider feel to them - in spite of the fact that it's supposed to be a comedy.\nBefore I've seen it, I thought the critics were overly harsh. I really WANTED to enjoy this movie. I was ready to overlook a lot if it had at least one or two redeeming scenes. Now I can understand why they talk about \"The Master of Disguise\" as the worst movie of the year; I'd call it the worst movie of the century.",

And to all of you who honestly thought is was a movie for older people and thought it would have \"adult humor\" how damn stupid can you be. what in the previews or trailers made it sound adult, was it the slapping machine, the turtle scene, the meant-to-be-fake Italian accent, because all those things just scream \"PG-13\". dumbasses. this may seem a little harsh and rude, but from what i've read about this movie and the harsh criticism its been getting, you all deserve it.",

That's how bad the film is. There isn't a single scene that isn't embarrassing. The characters are absurd, the acting atrocious, the plot non existent. No question, this movie is a wonderful example of why IMDb should allow zero stars for their reviews. It absolutely doesn't rate the one star I gave it. The idea that people would recommend this movie with a straight face only goes to show what kind of trouble the population at large is really in.

The only reason it worked in Austin Powers is because they were smartly done. Here most of them are so hammy you can't enjoy them. On a worse note we have James Brolin as the father and Edie McClurg as the mother. It seems like their only purpose is to have two big names. Brolin's performance is so over the top it's embarrassing and McClurg is well... McClurg, she can only do so much. Spiner as Devlin Bowman is a fart happy crazy man who was put in jail by Brolin's guy. And I do mean fart happy. He does it as comedic relief expecting we'll think the joke is funny if done enough.

Much of the jokes were references to pop culture, a cheap trick that will date the movie very soon.  The only laughs from the audience were the cheaply low reoccurring fart jokes.  The plot was incoherent and it jumped around too much the editor must have been drunk. The outtakes and gags while the credits were rolling would make even Jackie Chan woozy.On a positive note, this movie was very clean.  There were a few minor PG jokes, but this movie could be shown unedited on TV.  In an age where crude jokes are the norm to get a laugh, this movie, for the most part, avoided it.

            "content": "My initial impressions of Master of Disguise were those of disgust and, frankly,  non-interest.  Yet,  I found myself in the movie theatre opening night,  captivated by the genius of Dana Carvey (who after appearing in this role,  will probably be in high demand for more prestigious,  academy award worthy roles).  The film I saw could be just a precursor to something more magnificent,  because I hate to say that this is the pinnacle of Dana Carvey's career.  For this well-known comedy actor,  the highest respect has come a rough path of sketch comedy on SNL and the much loved \"Waynes World\" films.  Most successful comedy actors rarely get this opportunity in their careers,  and Carvey will more than definitely ride this phenomena of success from Master of Disguise to fame.  If you are unfamiliar with the film and would like to be surprised,  then don't read below here because this section may contain spoilers and give away much of the intricate plot (reminiscent of great works like Chinatown or the Big Lebowski).Pistachio Disguisey is a professional assassin named Leon.  Leon is an adroit mercenary,  able to take on several deadly thugs at one time.  As skilled as Leon is,  his achilles heal is amiable nature,  which jeopardizes his ability to accomplish the one task that has haunted him throughout his life:  to kill the drug cartel leader responsible for the death of his pet goldfish,  Walnut.  Throughout the film,  Leon's gregarious nature and ability to fit in at parties blindly negates his motivation to take care of this one thing,  and that is why movie is so long. The film,  if my watch isn't mistaken,  came slightly in under three hours.  The disguises have no practical application other than to amuse the children,  which is the only disappointing thing;  it is tiring to see Hollywood exploit it's focus groups to the point where it is blatantly obvious, especially on a film that might be an Oscar contender.  There are some loveable characters in the film like Darryl the blind Tupperware salesman,  the irate overweight housewife, and the notorious heroin addict police officer most deservingly named Neddy Needles.  The violence is mostly tongue and cheek,  however,  it must be said that it may be inappropriate for the younger children.It's a rare treat that such a fine film comes to theatres on major release and not just to art house movie theatres in larger cities.  I recommend seeing this film at least three times just because it makes so much more sense after many viewings.  My judgment:  9 out of 10 stars",

The film is slow and unfunny in the beginning, but I thought it would pick up when Carvey started doing characters/disguises...it didn't.  Its sad when the running fart joke is funnier than Dana Carvey.  The film is a HappyMadsion production, which means Sandler was involved, but it didn't help.  Sandler was also involved in Hot Chick, so what.  Dana Carvey and the guy who wrote Deuce Bigalow wrote Master of Disguise.  If you want to laugh, rent Deuce Bigalow.  If you want to entertain the small kids in your family, rent Master of Disguise. Carvey is funny and a skilled impersonator, but in the right context. Master of Disguise never finds that context.  Maybe the movie was meant only for small kids, like Pokemon and anything with Frankie Muniz in it.  If thats the case, I feel dumb for even reviewing it.  I'm not the audience.

If that not a sign of a bad movie I don't know what is. Anyway his father is kidnapped and his grandfather enters in Exorcist fashion and tell him that he is in a family of people who can change their personalities to fight crime and Pistachio must find his inner master of disguise to save his parents.I wonder if this looked good on paper because that cherry pie man was a little childish even for this movie, not to mention stupid.

It is a just a little over 80 minutes long, another plus. It's not like you are investing \"Lawrence of Arabia\" like time into this. It has some mild comic violence, think Three Stooges for level of violence and then crank it back a little bit. This movie suffers from what several movies made by refugees from Saturday Night Live have suffered from - it is incredibly difficult to make a full length motion picture out of a three minute skit. Dana Carvey does over the top caricatures familiar to anyone who watched SNL when Carvey was in the cast. I watched this film several years ago and thought it was pretty dumb. I watched it again with my eight year old grandson and his appreciation of it made me rethink my opinion a bit. It is not a \"date night\" film, for sure, but if you are a babysitter of boys 6-10 years old this will hold their attention and make them laugh.",

A word of advice for those who haven't seen \"The Master of Disguise\": for those of you - like me - who loved Dana Carvey's impressions and comedy on SNL, remember him that way. I thought he was in the top 5 SNL cast members ever, and it was always a mystery to me why Adam Sandler & Chris Rock (fair-to-middling SNL alumni IMO) became stars while some of the true comedic geniuses like Phil Hartman and Dana Carvey didn't get top roles. In Mr. Carvey's case, the mistake of being in this film show that making good choices is of paramount importance to those aspiring to move on to the big screen. The movie is never funny and isn't even \"bad\" good. It just stinks. He plays a character named \"Pistachio Disguisey\". COME ON - my 5-year-old nephew could come up with a wittier name, and believe me, he wouldn't laugh at even the most infantile jokes in this flick. I defy any adult to even crack a smile.

I agree with the guy above when he says:\n\"One cannot begin to hopefully comprehend or decipher all the psychological & stereotypical boundaries this film breaks. It is a surprise to find this film in mainstream theaters as a film on this level & caliber would normally only be found in the finest arthouse theaters. If you plan on seeing Master of Disguise, I suggest keeping your afternoon free, as after viewing, no after witnessing it, you'll need the rest of the afternoon to invest in deciphering the dense narrative.\"If humor is caused by the momentary break down of logic in our brains or surprising results, this movie takes full advantage of each of these.

It was rather obvious from watching these outtakes and additional tidbits that entire scenes and sequences where removed from the film.

What a great idea!\"Perhaps the emptiness of the comedy in this movie can be summarized by the fact that the biggest laugh they get, and one the movie goes back to perhaps ten times, is flatulence.  Farting.  Wow.  Really funny.  Maybe I am unable to appreciate that kind of comedy any more, but even my eleven year old didn't laugh at that, or anything else.  I didn't even crack a smile.

From his days with Saturday Night Live, when he kept audiences in stitches with his rendition of Church Lady and Hanz and Franz, Dana Carvey is, hands down, one of the best comedians, and this movie has been long in coming.Compared to the summer's other highly touted offerings for kids -- Lilo & Stitch, Scooby Doo, Crocodile Hunter, et. al. -- The Master of Disguise wins, hands down. Not only was it truly targeted toward its audience with a lack of cursing, but the crude humor that accompanies any SNL's performance was far enough over the head of the kids in the audience that only the parents were laughing.Obviously, the movie wasn't intended to have a plot that will garner any Oscar nominations. That was never the point. It's mindlessly stupid, which is what Dana Carvey is all about. But when you enter the theater, you know that. So you sit back with your drink and your candy, take a deep breath, and get ready to laugh your way through the entire thing, which is exactly what all 9 of us did.Thanks, Dana Carvey, for giving my kids and me one good laugh at this movies this summer before heading back to school.",

The main problem, it seems to me, is that they seemed to allow Dana Carvey to simply ad lib almost throughout the film.  People like Carvey, Robin Williams (when he's doing comedy) and Jim Carrey need to be restrained somewhat by a more cohesive script or plan.  They wear you out after awhile! Carvey didn't shut up throughout the whole movie.  His approach seems to just be silly for about 95 minutes (lots more because a lot seemed to have been cut).  It's like throwing stuff on the wall to see what sticks.There were some funny moments and Dana Carvey is talented, after all.  I'm just saying that the film could have been of much better quality if it were better scripted and controlled. I'm not saying Carvey should be stifled. But the writers (Carvey and another guy) and producers (Adam Sandler - one of 2 executive producers) need to develop a better format, not just let a comedian run wild.There were a lot of comedic situations and much silliness.

It definitely grows on you.One of the reviews I read here said that the characters Dana does aren't funny, but they couldn't be further from the truth. He does a character based on Tony Montana from Scarface that is hilarious! He also does a character named Gammy Numnums, which is an older snobby woman and is one of the funniest characters in the movie. The problem is that he does so many characters that none of them last long enough. His turtle-man character is really funny and gets funnier the more you see it.Dana Carvey is an absolute brilliant comedian and this movie SHOULD HAVE been his gateway to super stardom (i.e. Jim Carrey).

It could be funny but lacked any follow through and unity, despite the 1979 reference) followed by the never ending slapping, slapping, slapping that ran throughout the film - I felt something was amiss followed by compounding disappointment.----------------- In brief: Disappointed that the Disquisiey family setting lacked warmth and believability, disappointed in the one dimensionality of all the female characters (\"you disgust me\" said grandpa D to Pistachio's assistant after she asks about her new jobs benefits), and the tenets that seeing Carvey gaze into space after being dope slapped (yet another time) is enough to make me believe that this is acceptable because he plays it cute, and in the big picture -substantive enough to carry the thinning story line to its blunt and anti climactic end.---------------- The theater I went to had about 35 to 50 suburban (Colma CA.) kids (ages 7 to 13) in it and the only laughs came from the predictable fart's that the bad guy let go from his own jokes, and excitement (and these laughs were slow in coming i.e., four fart's in).  Other wise the theater sat silently.-------------- I'm going to like to think that the outcome of this production this is not reflective of Carveys innate talent, but perhaps it is the result of having been surrounded by a few too many \"yes men, and women\" when putting this one together. --------------",

However, there's only one thing that keeps this from being such a movie: Good actors. Sure, Dana Carvey did a brilliant job with what was handed to him and probably deserves praise for his performance in this god-awful movie. Everyone else, though, came across simply terrible in their efforts, which, I would suspect, were minimal to begin with. As a result, there is the sad likelihood that this movie has ruined Dana Carvey's career. I haven't seen him resurface since this movie, though perhaps I am not looking hard enough.

It might have been a little funnier back in the early 90s, with such over-used phrases like \"whose your daddy\" and frequent fart jokes, but they just aren't funny nowadays. The movie lacked any sort of coherency or point--it seemed to be a mishmash of unfunny spoofs and take-offs of various well known movies, many of which the target audience probably hasn't seen yet.  This movie seemed to be an excuse for Carvey to show off his impersonations.  They were funny on SNL, but they just don't work on the screen.  He says that he designed the movie cause he thought his kids would like it, but that's the problem, HIS kids are the only ones who will probably really enjoy this.  This movie seemed to be one big inside joke, and a bad one at that.  Plus, the shameless inclusion of well known celebrities was pointless.  At least the Austin Powers films actually put famous celebrities to good use.  I will say that without a doubt this is the worst movie of the year.

Even at just \u00a32.95 on DVD (less than $5 for you American readers) to buy this was a waste of money. The best part of the DVD was the deleted scenes, namely the Mayor Maynot scene which despite being the funniest scene that was filmed by an absolute mile, still managed to end up on the cutting room floor.\nI dread to think what was going through the heads of the producers when they were making this. Surely they must have realised that it was complete crap before they even got the cameras out. Or maybe not as on the DVD commentary they talk about the film like it's a masterpiece.

In my eleven year old mind at the time, I actually thought we were laughing at the funny scenes. It was literally one of the funniest movies I watched. However, watching it again seven years later as a college freshman, I realized everyone, especially the adults were laughing at the over done gags, poor acting, and really childish style the film was made. Really the previews and TV spots showed all the funny parts and the rest of the film was just as bad as a straight to DVD Disney sequel. There were some scenes in there that I thought was to over the top like changing into a new costume in a matter of seconds even more annoying than the last. Jokes at the start of the film I realized on the second time watching it, were recycled through out the entire film like the villain's constant farts after his maniacal laughs. I didn't even laugh once like my eleven year old self almost died of in the theater. I really was surprised to read that Rotten Tomatoes rated this in the 100 worst movies of the decade, but I guess a lot can change in seven years regarding as to what some sees as funny and over the top.

I assume that this was intended as a vehicle for Carvey's talent for impressions. I expected something like the Seven Faces of Dr. Lao, or homage to Inspector Clouseau. Nope. With no plot, no character motivation, and flatulence jokes as the film's highpoint, this flick deserves a quick death. Jennifer Esposito has a thankless role, Harold Gould plays some weird grandfather-cum-Deus Ex Machina, and James (Mr. Barbara Streisand) Brolin looks virtually embalmed.The costumes, sets, makeup and costumes all point to a big budget, yet this film is so bad, you'd almost think they were making the script up as they went.

The only redeeming quality this movie has is that it is really, really short, but this is negated by the fact that those 80 minutes will feel like an eternity.If jokes that were never funny in the first place being repeated up to 8 times is your thing, look no further. If standalone fart noises - that is, an out-of-place fart noise unsupported by any action or dialog whatsoever - can make you laugh, this is definitely your film.

Flailing confusion followed for the next 75 minutes, which seemed a stretched out version of a 45 minute script.The acting never convinced you of anything but the effect of weak directing. It was as if director Perry Blake was too afraid to tell his actors what to do. Few of them turned in a scene that didn't seem like a first take. The cameras just kept rolling anyway, perhaps trying to save money on film by not re-shooting anything.The costume-based jokes all fall flat in seconds. When a character is more creepy and awkward than funny, there's a problem. On a scale of 1 to 10, one being amusing and ten being creepy, the \"Turtle Guy\" scene was the proverbial 11. Note to all involved: A guy saying \"turtle\" in a weird sheepish voice isn't funny, and it certainly isn't funny when you've had him repeat it 20 times within five minutes as the only attempted joke in the entire scene.If the only comic relief next to the performance of confused, awkward \"straight man\" Jennifer Esposito is a guy repeating the same line over and over again, you're scraping the wood off the bottom of the laugh barrel. There's just nothing there to find remotely amusing. All the audience feels is pity for everyone involved in the movie, including themselves.That type of unnerving awkwardness repeats over and over again throughout the movie, halted only briefly by comedic gems left completely unexplored like the \"Classmates.com\" profile in which the evil villain (played by Brent Spiner, who once again had nothing to work with) gives away his entire plan.What you get is an unfunny, unbearable view of Dana Carvey and many of his cast mates committing career suicide right in front of you. If you want to watch a movie that makes you feel joy, laughter, intrigue, and other positive feelings, watch something else. If you want to ride a roller-coaster of unrequited emotion as you hope over and over again that Dana Carvey is funny for his own sake, only to be let down over and over again until you push the stop button, this one's for you. It's not funny; it's sad.",

I also have 4+ other friends who adore this movie to no end!! Yes, it is VERY silly and VERY stupid, that is the entire point. It is definitely suited for young young ages like elementary school, but, as I have learned, once you thoroughly enjoy this movie you never stop loving it. I'm now 17 and rewatched it with my friend, and we both had lots of laughs!!\nThe only thing I could say that's slightly negative about this movie is that you have to have a very specific type of humor to be an adult and really appreciate it. For example, if I saw this movie for the first time when im 20, it would not be too impactful the way it has been since I first saw it when I was younger (and the fart joke becomes a little overdone, but kids seriously LOVE it when jokes are repeated often since they have goldfish-attention-spans!). As a kids movie, this movie is 100% my favourite from my childhood! And since I have the type of humor that this movie consistently serves, it is one of my favorites still today.",

No, it's not a great movie; but it is a funny movie. You just have to have a taste for silliness, a childlike taste.When the nefarious Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) kidnaps his legendary father (James Brolin), Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) has to learn the ways of \"Energico\" and go to the rescue -- not just of his parents but of numerous national treasures besides. Ably helped by an assistant Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito) and his mystical grandfather (Harold Gould), Pistachio slowly becomes the Master of Disguise.Carvey, who has always cracked me up anyway, whirls through an army of loopy characters -- Granny Num-Nums, Mr. Peru, Terry Suave, Constable Muller, Cherry Pie Man (\"Look! It's Cherry Pie Man!,\" like everybody knows him), and the great Turtle Man. There are also Robert Shaw from Jaws and even President George W. Bush at a crucial moment.The DVD (yes, we own it) special features show those weren't all he had in mind -- Mayor Maynot is so well done, but was cut out completely, for instance.Special kudos to Spiner, who was evil, and Esposito, who played along hilariously. And the guy offering hors d'oeuvres to Mr. Peru, just for keeping a straight face.The Italian accents are uniformly awful, I'll admit, and the gags are sometimes dopey. But they're funny dopey, not painful dopey. If you're not too sophisticated to enjoy a simply enjoyable movie, rent this movie or pick it up for $5 at Half Price Books like we did. Watch it with some kids, about 10 years old. It will be difficult for you to stop laughing.",

The commercials gave the impression of a very witty and funny Dana Carvey movie that was released about the same time as his friend Mike Meyer's movie, Goldmember. The problem is, the commercials WERE the movie. Any, and all funny material presented in the movie were contained in the 45 second spot that ran on TV. That means 79 minutes and 15 seconds of the movie were a complete waste of time.So much more could have been done with the premise of a 'Master of Disguise', but instead they made the movie into a borefest of awful acting, horrible cliches, and a running fart scene that popped up every time the villain, played by Star Trek's Brent Spiner, laughed and lost control of his bowels.If you wish to be entertained, I would recommend you watch Tombstone, Saving Private Ryan, or maybe endless re-runs of Lost in Space. To quote Dr. Smith from Lost in Space... \"Oh the pain... oh the pain!\" Master of Disguise rates a perfect score of ZERO in my book.",

The jokes are usually immature sometimes and mainly consist of Carvey disguising himself as different wacky characters and doing impressions. Here is where the problem lies. While the impressions range from good (Tony Montana) to hysterically funny (Quint from Jaws) to downright surreal (Turtle Turtle) the plot in between and the actual jokes are a little on the poor side.The biggest problem is the editing. The third act in particular seems to have about 15 mins of plot sliced out of it and there are some noticeable holes in the story. In fact the whole ending seems to have not been completely filmed. This makes an already silly movie very difficult to follow at times and the film ends at just under 77 mins.Many of these faults could be attributed to the fact that the film is aimed at pre-teens, however in this case they have no excuse. Most of the cast are good comedic actors and watching this film you can see the humour trying to get out, you know this film could have succeeded if they had just tried a little harder.Instead we are left with a film that will make you laugh if you watch it with your kids, but will never fully entertain anyone, not even the audience it was intended for. 5 out of 10.",

Harold Gould was the balance back from the comedy though also inputted some himself which I found was well put in. Brent Spiner as the \"bad guy\" was a perfect match and played his part brilliantly opposite Carvey, Gould and Brolin. This film was brought to its great level by the story and the way it appeals to children and Carvey's character with his simplicity. I also think this film was one of the great ways to allow Carvey to use his talent of impersonation in the big screen. I had personally not heard of him before this film and am now finding myself looking for more of his work. I have now watched the film quite a few times and still enjoy it.

Credit people with some intelligence, film-makers - if you want to make something that panders to the ego of particular actors with almost total disregard for the quality of the film as a whole, then advertise it as that & your audience will be selected/selective accordingly. This was a waste of money to make & a waste of money to watch.",

This was meant to be nothing more than a goofy movie, like \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.\" You shouldn't expect a seamless plot or complex characters in a movie like this. I thought Dana's \"Scarface\" impersonation was brilliant, and Brent Spiner turned in a very funny -- but not over-the-top hammy -- performance (based on his work here, I wish he had been cast as Count Olaf; it would have been the perfect role for him). Look, I like witty repartee as much as the next person with a graduate degree, but fart jokes and Rob Schneider also crack me up (especially that scene where he's romancing the goat in The Animal).

It was a joy to watch my 3 sons laughing and enjoying themselves so much.

The instructional video that they show new employees at Kinko's to clear a paper jam is The Godfather compared to this pile of crap. Whenever Goodfellas or Casino comes out, Italian-American groups complain about negative stereotypes, but Dana Carvey's character is called Pistachio Disguisey, and talks with a corny pseudo-Italian accent, and nobody says a word. I'm not Italian, but if I was, I'd rather have people think I'm a gangster than a no talent hack named pistachio disguisey.

In order to lengthen the lame 70-minute running time, the producers padded the end credits to TEN minutes with lame-ass Carvey impressions that surely couldn't even make the last few minutes of that God-awful Saturday Night Live TV show. In it you can see Carvey imitating other notable actors who surely don't deserve the indignity. Did I mention it features Jessica Simpson in a cameo? Yech!!

(that is for another time) His impressions were always the reason I watched him on SNL.. (Saturday Night Live for those who are Comic impaired) I also agree with another comment about studios wasting money on people that were huge in SNL without seeing a script.. had they read this one the movie might not have been made. and as a hard core Trekkie I found Brent Spiners role.... intriguing.. to say the least.. and the fart jokes..
