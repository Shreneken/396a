            "content": "As cadets, Lau and Chan both show promise as police officers.  However, Chan is removed from the training and send to be a long-term undercover in Sam's gang.  However, unbeknownst to the police, Lau is also a long-term mole who is feeding information back to Sam.  When Sam and police chief SP Wong both have their operations scuppered, each realises the other has a mole and sets out to uncover each.  With each other's lives at risk, Lau and Chan must be the first to uncover the other.I decided to see this after hearing good things about it but I was conscious that often foreign films can be given more leniency than Western films doing the same thing.  After a slightly confusing opening few moments as characters settle down (not helped by using completely different actors for characters at late teens and late 20's - do people change that much?) the film immediately becomes gripping.  The plot may well have the occasional hole and have unnecessary personal details (Lau's girlfriend and Chan's ex weren't really needed) but the central story is well written and told with such urgency that it is hard not to be totally engaged.The film doesn't have many massive shoot outs or action scenes but it has a pretty consistent sense of tension that is enjoyable right up to a typical but impacting ending.  The direction is stylish and only occasionally overuses the slow-mo jump cuts.  It may owe more to American cinema than that of the Orient but it is still a very good film and I hope the inevitable remake will be as good.The cast don't need to do that much apart from look intense and portray the tension of the story in a realistic fashion - something that they do well. At times the lead two actors are pushed out of this by the personal asides but they happily keep things on track.  Both Lau and Leung play it very well - it never came down to good guy/bad guy and the audience was pretty well split.  Wong is a solid officer while Tsang is good as Sam.  Chen and Cheng may not have a great deal to do apart from slowing the film but they both look good doing it.Overall this is a solidly enjoyable cop thriller, regardless of what country it comes from.  It will eventually be remade I imagine and when it is I hope that it manages to retain it's consistent sense of tension, double-edged characters and a real tight hold on it's audience just as this did here.",

I must say that I liked the original movie better: 50 minutes shorter than Scorcese's magnificent remake, \"Infernal Affairs\" is tighter, faster, more compelling and tells the same story better. It does not have a grand acting Jack Nicholson who basically plays Daryl Van Horne with the attitude and \"Infernal Affairs\" characters don't talk and don't curse as much as they do in \"The Departed\" but the Hong Kong's movie only benefits from it. As much as I admire Leonardo DiCaprio as Bill Castigan, Tony Leung (Yan) in his role is simply unforgettable.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed' was probably one of the most critically-acclaimed films of 2006, and, upon hearing the tumult of praise that accompanied its release, it was a film that I desperately wanted to see. However, I couldn't do so until I had seen the 2002 Hong Kong film upon which it was based, 'Mou gaan dou {Infernal Affairs},' directed by Wai-keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak. Fortunately, not too long ago, my local movie rental store was having a sale on their superfluous VHS tapes, at a price of $2.00 apiece. Among the cheap movies that I snapped up was a copy of 'Infernal Affairs' that looked like it had never been opened. Having now watched it, I must say that, despite my limited experience with Asian cinema, I very much enjoyed the film. 'Infernal Affairs' combines an irresistible story of intrigue, loyalty and betrayal with some extremely slick editing and camera-work; it's no surprise that the film has acquired an impressive following in the West.Tony Leung plays Chan Wing Yan, an overwrought undercover cop who has spent the last ten years infiltrating numerous dangerous gangs and exposing their criminal dealings. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Andy Lau plays Inspector Lau Kin Ming, a police mole who is secretly working the Triad, the same gang with which Yan is currently affiliated. After an expensive drugs transaction goes wrong for both the gang and the police force, each side suspects that they have a traitor in their midst, and, in a bitterly ironic turn, it falls to each of the two moles to find out who it is. Both main actors do a good job of maintaining the intensity of the story. There are certainly countless parallels to be drawn between the characters, but what struck me most were the contrasts between the two: Ming is a cold, devoted and ruthlessly efficient, whilst Yan has been reduced to a tired and neurotic wreck after a decade of living in fear.The plot of 'Infernal Affairs' moves forward at a ripper pace, probably owing more to Western action cinema than that from its own region. The cinematography is bright and stylish, and the climactic scene on the rooftop, with the vibrant sunlight beaming overhead, was captured to great effect {Australian-born Christopher Doyle, who has worked on such films as '2046' and 'Rabbit-Proof Fence,' contributed to this film, so you already know that the cinematography will be good}. There are several moments when the storytelling was not handled as well as it might have been: the film made too frequent use of unnecessary flashbacks, and, following the death of Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong), we are treated to a video montage that feels like the final episode of a long-running sitcom. Also, the failed attempts of Ming's wife to finish her novel (\"I don't know whether he's good or bad\") was a blatantly-obvious attempt to draw parallels with Andy Lau's character. Despite my trivial complaints, 'Infernal Affairs' is an entertaining and thrilling film that I'd certainly recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "Most western viewers will only know the Asian crime scene from the bleak and lyrical canvas of Takeshi Kitano's work. Here we get something that at first seems far more westernized and very close to the work of one Michael Mann. Okay, enough allusions: yes \"Heat\" comes heavily to mind at first. but this is no simple \"Heat\" in Hong Kong. This a splicing of everything Asians do best in a moody, stylish tension-based thriller. From the beautiful cinematography(reminiscent of Wong Kar-Way's films)- step forward visual consultant Christopher Doyle! - and music to the graceful ying-yang undertones (mirror-images are a key theme), the film's most heroic achievement lies in its leads and in the bold ending.Hearing that this is being considered for a remake stateside comes as no big surprise, but how Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio could possibly compete against Andy Lau and Tony Leung evokes cynicism at best. Both leads are perfect. Lau's cold calculating intellect against Leung's anguished and tormented heart, complimentary opposites. There aren't enough words to commend this fresh, invigorating film with...",

Add to that the customary double-agent-doesn't-know-which-side-he-is-on-anymore subplot (doubled, of course), and you have plenty of ingredients for a plot, although it's to the movie's credit that although a little stylised, it never seems false or contrived. Fast-paced and bold, with a generous score, it never insults the viewer's intelligence either, and features just the right level of moral ambiguity. At one level, it's just another thriller, and there's little in the way of wider political or social subtext; but on the other hand, it's a textbook lesson in the art of making this sort of film.",

            "content": "This movie has been regarded as the cream of Hong Kong gangster and cop movie. And has won 22 awards. But we all know awards don't mean a thing sometimes. The God Father of America cinema \"Martin Scorsese\" himself is making a American version of the movie, titled: Departed. I'm somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master, but distraught to the possibility of disappointment.A little history of Hong Kong film industry, being in somewhat government free state for over 100 years, Hong Kong movie industry proliferated to the state of hysteria. On one hand, everything goes as long as people get what they want for 2 hours worth. On the other hand, lack of political drama has afforded the gangster and cop drama to truly grow and mature.Now back to the movie itself. 3 years ago, when I was still a poor student, I was loitering in the local Chinese video store as usual, looking for something exciting. The owner handed me a VHS copy of this movie, he personally recommended it and said it's new and unique. So I went home and watched it immediately. And then I said in my then dark and dingy apartment for 30 minutes, in utter silence.There was no plot twist, and no surprise ending, no Mr. M Night's heavy handed gimmicks and Hollywood's camera tricks. But from the beginning to the end, for full 2 hours, you can cut the tension with a knife. In the end, you still don't want it to end. The story goes on in your mind, questions, bits and pieces start to put together, characters start to take shape even after the movie ended.In my entire life, I've never seen a movie that there isn't a single excessive frame, until I saw this movie. It has forever changed my expectation on crime drama.The story is genius and simple enough. A mole in police department working against an undercover cop in drug trafficking mafia. They don't know each other's identity, so it is like a invisible tug war between the two competing against each other's wits. I won't reveal too much of it even though like I said, there's no plot twist.It's a fairly popular movie that has generated huge buzz when it came out, and since been talked, compared and still highly regarded as unsurpassed by countless fans worldwide. It has an all star cast in Hong Kong cinema, and of course, the screenplay, the acting, the editing, the camera work and overall directing is flawless judging by all standards.If you are adventurous enough to try even one Hong Kong movie, try this one.",

            "content": "I'm late in discovering the Hong Kong crime thriller genre so I can only compare \"Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou))\" to its Hollywood compatriots. It grippingly is the equal of such intense examinations of the anguish of undercover cops as \"Donnie Brascoe\" or dirty cops such as \"Narc\" or \"Training Day.\" Key is the dynamic opposite pairing of two leonine, charismatic actors, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the self-sacrificing heart throb from \"Hero (Ying xiong)\" and the languid lover from \"In the Mood for Love (Fa yeung nin wa)\" here as an antsy, anguished too long undercover cop versus Andy Lau as his crisply efficient, ambitious counterpart. The plot, propelled as well by the music, unpredictably twists and takes hairpin turns from the beginning so that even with helpful flashbacks it's a thrilling roller coaster ride to try to follow the constantly changing loyalties, manipulations, deals and revelations, not unlike the TV series \"The Wire.\" Regardless, you get that the real battle is for the characters' souls as much as their lives and you hold your breath to the last surprising minute. The initial motivations for how the men came to be at this crossroads will doubtless be explored in the prequel and sequel that haven't been released in the U.S. yet. The women are just the girlfriends, but they do have separate lives, jobs and choices that impact the men in their lives. With noted cinematographer Christopher Doyle is listed as a \"visual consultant\" in the credits, the great bulk of the film takes place at night, like a comparable chase film \"Collateral,\" so it was unfortunate that the print I saw was not pristine. It was also annoying that the subtitles were white on white illegible and that ideograms that are shown in the scene are not translated, even when the camera rests on them for a length of time that makes one assume something significant is written there.",

Both undercover cops try to outsmart each other in an intricate web of undercover deceit.Quite complicated to follow this stories subtleties at moments. There are so many people double crossing each other, that it is hard to keep count. This movie has got a continuous suspenseful mood, which is quite fascinating to watch.The drama is a bit lacking though, because the characters are very introvert and there are many of them, whom we all dont know very well.So it's rather difficult to really relate to 1 leading character, because there basically isnt one. This lack of a clear and defined leading role dillutes the power of this drama somewhat. Furthermore the editing is too fast at moments, making it hard to understand where some of the characters come from.It could have been a more gripping movie, with better (slower) editing and a more restrained and focussed build up of the story. Still a worthwhile detective drama, which is probably only suited for those who like intelligent detective stories.",

            "content": "This is an incredibly sad movie.Its because it is pretty good. Its tight. Its completely coherent. The narrative veers in odd directions just before you expect it to. The pacing is just right for a mainstream picture.What's sad in watching it is knowing Scorceses's remake, something that follows this very closely. People seem to like the fact that its sparkly in terms of the characters. It was almost tolerable for me when I watched it. But seeing how this roots the story, and how Scorcese's blind spot kills him... its enough to make you worry, even cry for the state of cinema.Scorcese's a good man. He loves cinema and the world is far better off for him in it, just on his preservation efforts, and promotion of film as a sort of art. But his curse is that he is locked in an Italian mind. He has only one way of telling a story. In his world, all creation flows from individuals. Those individuals bend the universe. If you understand their motives, you understand how the world works, at least the world you experience in the film.Actors think they love this, because it empowers them. But it also gives them no support, no cosmos in which to exist. They have to carry the entire narrative burden on themselves. That's why you have such colorful characters: thugs and such. And its why you need such extreme and un- nuanced actors, who can only bulldoze through. He's been doing it long enough that he knows how to make it work.But then you see this. Its eight dimensions more full. Yes, it is less loud, less aggressive in terms of personal projection. But it works at such a deeper level that one wonders why we even tolerate Scorcese and his friends. In this film, the filmmaker and writer have created a world, two worlds actually. These two worlds interact, but largely stay statically opposed. As with ordinary noir, a simple soul finds himself caught up in the dynamics of the world he is in, mostly hapless in terms of what happens. He can only respond. How he responds is what makes the narrative.The trick in this story is that there are two worlds, and people from each caught in the other. So the tension between the two worlds can be dramatized as the tension between two men (and their sponsors). Not as bombast, but as human. Honor and survival mean something because there is a context, not just an assertion.In this story, some men don't survive. They are the Scorsese types.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "This movie should be compared to movie like Heat, even when the storyline are not the same. Movies like Hardboiled and A Better Tomorrow are predominately action-based, whereas this movie is more dramatic and emotionally-driven.The main attraction is the mole hunts but it would not be as brilliantly done if not for the fireworks between the major characters.The title from the explanation in the intro means \"Endless Purgatory Road\". This philosophy, to me, really made this movie more thoughtful. The two central characters both had to walk their road, in life and in their minds for a long time. Both had no choice but to keep walking. As they cross path, they were forced to play the game of cat and mouse by their superiors. While it is not certain who's the cat and who's the mouse, one thing is certain - the loser will die.While there are four main characters, they are all males. This should be bad for any movie but I think this is one of the exception to the rule. The emotions and tension between the four were well-scripted and brilliantly played. It is no surprised each had at least one best actor awards in the Hong Kong industry. The sequels(2 prequels) will delve deeper into it.Plotwise - it is hard to see any holes.Seen it around six times, a lot for a drama.I think you should ask yourself after the movie, \"what would I do if I am in the same situation?\".

Watch Infernal Affairs, and think again. It's a smart, expertly made film, which succeeds in telling a good story without relying on slo-mo shots or hyperbolic shootouts.The Hong Kong-based film revolves around two men working on opposite sides of the law: Yan (Tony Leung) is a talented cop who's been doing undercover jobs in the Triads for ten years, Lau (Andy Lau) is a mole placed by gangsters inside the police. They know nothing about each other, at least in the beginning. Pretty soon, though, the situation gets complicated, as Lau's unit decides to take down Triad boss Sam, for whom Yan is \"working\". Both sides realize there must be a traitor, and it's only a matter of time before someone loses in this cat-and-rat game.Unlike many other Eastern action flicks, Infernal Affairs deserves praise not for the inventive camera-work or bloody climax (though there is some of the first), but for the foolproof screenplay. The plot is brilliantly constructed, with believable characters (most notably Yan, given tragic intensity by Leung) and remarkable, intelligent twists, mixing genre archetypes with Shakespearean sadness and grandiosity.In short, one of the best Asian movies of recent years, and a great appetizer to enjoy before watching Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a remake that, for once, manages to be as good as the original, if not better.",

So I am putting in my piece.Hong Kong movies have changed a lot in the last decade and when Infernal Affairs came out it was a real change. I noted 'Golden Chicken' was mentioned earlier, and that sums up many of the lame comedies that have recently been churned out. However the comedy is a large part of Hong Kong cinema, as is the gangster genre. Infernal Affairs breaks with the comedy, keeps the gangsters (lau being a first class clean cut one - whilst Leung acts a remarkable strained police officer) and adds clever and intelligent tension. The acting is first class, as is the mood that truly captures the zeitgeist.This movie is about the two characters and their similarities and moral obstacles. It also has something subtle to say.This film was huge news in Hong Kong and the mainland. It is an important Hong Kong film. The US remake will be more clich\u00e9d than you can imagine.

But who will find out the identity of the other first? Plus, Yan's job soon becomes a lot more difficult when his one and only police contact, Superintendent Wong, is murdered! Now no one in the police force knows who he is or can offer him any help...and everyone thinks Lau is beyond reproach and the full power of the Force is behind him...as well as the mob.This film surprised me.

However, as stated by the review from a Hong Kong viewer, there is also depth and subtlety rarely found in action/thrillers. It is this depth that makes this movie brilliant. The depth of this movie is best served by the understated yet deeply moving performances of the main characters. Viewers are allowed into the inner changes of these characters and before long, the viewers begin to care about them, be it the \"good guy\" (Yan) or the \"bad guy\" (Ming). The rest of cast successfully relate the complicated and exciting plot to the viewers, and all the supporting performances are almost flawless, perhaps with the exception of the female psychologist who seems sadly one-dimensional. I grew up in Hong Kong but has since lived most of my life in Canada. With this duo-cultural background, I have mixed feelings about the Hollywood remaking of this movie. On the one hand, I am happy for the Hollywood recognition of this great movie by remaking it. On the other hand, I would hate to see how badly sabotaged the end result would be. Some things just do not translate. As a minimum, I hope the great director Scorcese will make good use of the major plot line and generate a haute thriller and with the excellent cast, develop some in-depth characterization.

Because it turns out that one of them is an undercover cop infiltrating the triads, while the other is a mole in the police force reporting directly to a powerful crime boss.As in The Departed, the setting and the central idea is truly fantastic here. The duality of these two men is quite fascinating. Both very similar in character, in skill and in conviction. They simply happened to start from different sides. And yet their paths are eerily similar. Both shoulder the burden of secrets they cannot reveal even to their loved ones. Both have crisis of identity, for ten years is a long time to live under pretense without it sometimes seeming like reality.The film is also beautifully acted and shot with skill. Andy Lau as the mole and Tony Leung as the undercover cop are easily the best, but the supporting cast is also strong, though not quite all of them receive the screen time they perhaps would have deserved. Both love interests, for example, are barely in the film.The only other gripe I have about the film is the fact the the plot lost me a couple of times. I always got back on track relatively quickly, but it still meant that I spent a minute or two wondering what had just happened. I've had this problem with Asian films before and it's a matter of style. They simply tell their stories a bit differently. So not really a flaw, but something to keep in mind.Overall Infernal Affairs is a great crime film and I can see why they wanted to make The Departed after seeing it.

No, Hollywood's greatest accomplishment is its ability to take a great movie and remake it into something infernally inferior. If you haven't seen either of these films, ignore The Departed and watch Infernal Affairs. After you watch Infernal Affairs, continue to ignore The Departed. In IA, the story is tighter, there are no wasted or superfluous scenes seemingly thrown in to give the top-billed some extra face-time, the romantic appendage is simpler and actually logical, unlike the hack-job in The Departed, and the ending is better. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah, there is more ... no Nicholson over-acting, no bad Boston accents and the cops don't all act stupid all the time.",

None of them bothered to discover that \"The Departed\" was a remake of this movie.Happily, some of the classic lines such as chopping one up and feeding him to the poor survived the Hollywood chopping block, but the fabulous method of communicating secretly via Morse Code did not make the transition from Hong Kong to Hollywood.My suggestion: if you loved this original, then do not disappoint yourself watching the Hollywood remake.",

He has nothing to loose because he has no identity, he hates his job. in one word he is desperate to get his life back.

Expect to have to concentrate on who is who, especially at the beginning, who is or might be on to whom and how, and what they might decide to do about it. Others have said that the two leads are excellent and I'm sure they're right, but I especially appreciated Eric Tsang as Sam.It's elegant without being heartless. I felt the main characters' longing for truth in their lives, and the various different virtues, flaws, loyalties and motivations of many others too.I was interested to see that virtually all the violence happens off-camera. It reminded me of 'authentic' productions of Classical Greek plays. Their plots often included murders, but violence was not permitted to be shown directly. A character would describe what had happened, and then a tableau of corpses would be revealed, on a wheeled wheels if I remember correctly from one production. Almost the same device is used in this film, and it's very effective when it's done well, as here.The friend I went with would have liked to the female characters given bigger roles. Personally (I'm a woman myself, if it makes a difference) I don't care about that. I did notice, though, the way the female characters were used as symbols to represent the good and truthful side of life. It struck me, in connection with this, that sex and violence were being treated as opposites, whereas in many US films they are treated almost as two aspects of the same thing and as depending on one another, hardly existing independently. How many plots are driven by the kidnapping or other ill-treatment of the hero's wife/girlfriend/squeeze, so that the violence against her - whether she resists it violently or not - is used to justify and supposedly motivate the whole towering nonsense by virtue of her sexual relationship with the hero? It often seems that the villian's real offence is thought to be less assault on a person, than theft of property. And I wonder if, when the US remake appears, this tedious plot device will have crept in? But I digress - it was just an idea that occurred to me on the way home, and it tells you little about \"Infernal Affairs\", except that it may be one reason why I found this film refreshing.An absorbing experience, and has made me more inclined to seek out Asian films in general, as well as films by the same director.",

Indeed, much of the film is told in dialogue, there are no ridiculous action sequences, and the final rooftop confrontation is both incredibly intense and masterful in keeping such a sprawling tale enclosed in such a small, yet fitting finale.

Although I don't understand why different actors were used to portray the younger versions of Lau Kin Ming and Chan Wing Yan (I mean people don't change that much in 10 years, do they?). There are a few plot holes here and there but otherwise the central plot is very well written. It's executed with great style. With fine editing, effective background score and excellent camera-work, the suspense and tension is well maintained. There's also some interesting symbolism, for example the use of the rooftop meetings (perhaps the place where Lau Kin feels safest), contrasting with the 'continuous hell'.Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai are fantastic actors, no doubt. Here too they're performances are suitably restrained. Anthony Wong Chau-Sang is also very good as SP Wong. Kelly Chen and Sammi Cheng don't have much to do in terms but they look good.I had seen the Hollywood remake, 'The Departed' before and it does not come close to this movie in terms of quality. However, 'Mou gaan dou' too has its share of flaws. Apart from the few plot holes and the different casting of the younger version of the two leads, some questions are left unanswered. For example, why does SP Wong and everyone at the force trust Lau Kin. Given the situation, everyone was supposed to be a suspect. Yet Lau Kin is not only never-suspected, he's also fed all the information.Yet, even with a few flaws, 'Mou gaan dou' remains an entertaining slick fast-paced copper thriller.",

Like Hard-Boiled, The Killer, and many other Chinese gangster films the film revolves around two men who are never what they seem. Both are undercover cops, both graduated from a prestigious academy, and as time passes the two become entwined in each others' lives once again. Each man is working for a different group, and trying to work out who the mole is in their respective gangs. The complex and complicated plot slowly and beautifully unravels until the devastating finish where we find out certain truths.The film has been likened to Heat, and is being remade in Hollywood. This has greater depth though, and if done properly and with skill it could be a critical hit in America. There are few action scenes, with more emphasis on the relationships in each man's life, their loves and their friends. What action there is is well done, nowhere near as exquisite as Woo's work, but that what give the film a different feel completely. Andy Lau and Tony Cheung are both mega stars in China, but are highly skilled and intelligent actors. Indeed the entire cast is impressive if you are a fan of Chinese cinema. Part two is a prequel, and the recent final installment is set just after the events of this one. A subtle, clever and worthwhile modern crime blast.8 out of 10",

Unlike hollywood they really don't have to adhere to focus groups or near sighted Hollywood suits. They are able to take their stories to places that we as North American viewers are not fully accustomed to.\"Infernal Affairs\" is a film that emphasizes this point. I realize that it has been optioned by a group led by Brad Pitt in the hopes that it will be developed into a big budget Hollywood flick. If they succeed I really do hope they remain true to the source material because this is one beautifully resonate film.First of all I must admit that it took a little bit to get used to, especailly the kind of karaoke feel some scenes have. But as the story played out, the more involved I became. I was truly routing for both of these guys, and hoped that some way everything would work out. Probably the main thing that kept me glued to the screen was the performances of the two leads, especially Andy Lau, I am not too familiar with his work, you know I have just recently been introduced to Asian films(thanks to Ain't It Cool News for pointing this one out along with Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance) he is amazing, his face alone can hold a scene. Fantastic actor.I am not going to go into details about the plot, but like I said some scenes are kind of done like bad karoake, but they are few and far between. What struck me the most was that it didn't really dumb down the plot, not everything was fully explained, except maybe a last moment of reflection that was not really necessary. The film makers really assumed that we as the audience were smart enough to figure some stuff out on our own. I was also amazed at the lack of violence and lack of strong language. I mean don't get me wrong this is an intense flick but it didn't need to resort to that kind of thing to get the viewer involved, I found that pretty interesting. I am not sure if the cultural differences had anything to do with influencing my opinion, meaning that I am not familiar with police laws in Hong Kong or the relationship the Triads have with the police and so on. I just took everything at face value and it all seemed plausible to me, but again what do I know.Anyway aside from an occasional oddity and my own ignorance this is one refreshing film. Smart, intense and beautifully acted. Thank God for Toronto's China Town or else I would never be able to see this film, unless it starred Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.",

The younger ones look nothing like their older versions. To further confuse things, the younger guys are taller than the older guys.

There is also a great sense of tragedy at times, although I can't really talk about that without spoiling it so it's best for you to see it yourself.This is a very intelligent film, much like \"Heat\", which doesn't talk down to the viewer by explaining absolutely everything that happens - we are assumed to be smart enough to work it out for ourselves. The plot twists and turns until its unforeseen (albeit sense-making) conclusion and leaves the viewer thinking about it for some time after watching.I find very little to fault here, perhaps with the exception of the introduction which can be a little confusing regarding who's who, but it all becomes clear within a short space of time.Highly recommended.",

When you also include the biggest names around in HK showbiz into the cast - Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Sammi Cheng, Kelly Chen, Edison Chen, Shawn Yue and Elva Hsiao all have iconic popstar status with huge followings - you'd expect either an explosive story or sheer disappointment, nothing in between. Fortunately, it is the former category, and how well did they do it at that.Infernal Affairs tells of two top police cadets who choose or are forced to choose to follow different paths. Inspector Lau (Andy Lau) is recruited by a triad leader, Sam (Eric Tsang) to infiltrate the police force and act as a mole. Meanwhile, Yan (Tony Leung) appears to have been kicked out of police academy, but has been secretly been recruited to act as a mole in Sam's gang. Suddenly both come under the pressure each organisation suspects a mole, but can they keep themselves under cover.With three of my favourite actors headlining this film, I was hopeful for some quality performances. Andy Lau turns in a brilliant performance on a level with A Fighter's Blues (aka Ah Fu). It's emotional and gritty, and indeed very human. Not much to say about Tony Leung, other than he produces everything that we expect of this veteran actor. Eric Tsang plays the boss convincingly.  Ok, I have to admit it is hard to pinpoint where the quality of their performances is for each of them, but that's the so-called 'X-factor' and they've got tonnes of it!As for the remainder of the cast, they are fairly short cameos, but it is nice to see Sammi Cheng in a role removed from her traditional RomCom roles. Kelly, Edison, Shawn and Elva's roles were really too short to comment on.But take away these stars, and you see the underlying plot and script were simply excellent. There was drama and intensity keeping your adrenaline pumping. Action scenes weren't innovative, but fit in nicely with the film. And there's plenty of subtext, emotion, roller coaster rides and beautiful scenery (they love their rooftops) to add.Infernal Affairs was the highest grossing movie in Hong Kong according to the MPIA, which is not bad for an industry that is suffering from imports to Hong Kong. And it certainly deserves that award, because it is probably the best HK film I've seen in a very long time.One to watch over and over again.\n*DVD review* Media Asia have released an 'alternate endings' version of Infernal Affairs in Hong Kong. Please note that without spoiling it, the second ending is much shorter than the first, so please don't be disappointed. (Guess, that's why they put the first one in the real version). The extras are on a second disc and are packed with lots of additional bits, but most of them do not carry subtitles. Nonetheless, a worthwhile buy I think.",

To start, I would give them the same rating (8) and praise them equally. But the strengths are uneven.What follows is TOTAL SPOILER and meant only for others who have seen both.* Religion In Mou gaan dou, the mob boss Sam is religious. He indirectly attributes his success to his faith and ties in the disciples through a ritual of loyalty. He rules by this ingrained sense of loyalty and is never portrayed as fearful. In Departed, mob boss Frank rules entirely through fear, violence and intimidation. He caps this off with utter contempt for the Church. Who would stay loyal to a guy like that?* Class The Departed's greatest strength is in the in-depth analysis of the class conflict in New England's Irish community. References to \"lace-curtains\" and \"shanties\" is an allusion to long-standing symbolism of this conflict. This was a compelling introduction to the characters that Mou gaan dou left out, and went very far to explaining their motivations. * Language The language in Mou gaan dou is richly oblique (\"At least I am not afraid to let the sun shine on me\" says Yan toward the end.) and only occasionally rough. The language in Departed is relentlessly coarse and filled with coarse metaphors, puns and references. The language in each fits with the consistent tone of the acting. The two main spooks are cool in Mou gaan dou, and nearly hysterical in Departed.* Overall The Departed's beginning was utterly brilliant, far outclassing Mou Gaan Dou. But the high level of violence in Departed wore thin on me. By the time of the big bust, I felt that Mou gaan dou leaped ahead in crafting a complex drama that was not just another shoot-em-up. The cat-and-mouse chase between the spooks was FAR more compelling in Mou gaan dou, and the last scene in Departed proved that not even Scorcese can avoid the demands to give 'em a happy ending.",

I'm happy to report that none of the confusion evolves out of all the Chinese characters looking alike, because I can easily distinguish, for instance, the \"good\" mole's Dr. Lee from all the other characters. She's gorgeous. At any rate, as the plot unfolds the characters become a little clearer and the plot, while still thickened, never quite clots.I saw Scorsese's \"The Departed\" before seeing this, the original. They're slightly different. I'll mention three ways. One is that in \"Infernal Affairs\" Sam, the capo of the gang, is merely a tough businessman who will, when necessary, stoop to murder. In Scorsese's remake, the role is much juicier and goes to Jack Nicholson who makes the most of it.In the remake, the \"bad\" mole at the end is assassinated by a secondary character. His last words are something like, \"Go ahead and do it.\" In this one, the punishment is less violent and more subtle. The bad mole suffers a crisis of conscience, having lost his girl and his self respect, and become instead a genuinely honest but guilt-ridden cop, suffering from what in Buddhism is called \"continuous hell.\" (The title, \"Infernal Affairs,\" would be silly if it weren't for this notion.) Americans evidently are not Buddhists, don't believe in hell, don't believe in self-imposed suffering, and are all for blowing the bad guy's brains out.Finally, while \"Infernal Affairs\" is not exactly free of violence, it is practically anemic next to the blood bath that is \"The Departed.\" This is an impressively executed film. The photography is splendid and Hong Kong has never looked so clean. There's nothing special about the dialog, judging from the subtitles. I once found myself in the position of having to study Chinese and was pleased to learn that I could follow some of the dialog here. The parts of the dialog that I could follow were the English phrases, \"Sorry,\" \"Yes, sir,\" and \"Okay.\" Thank whatever God governs world history that Hong Kong was once a British Crown Colony.The performances were surprisingly good, the characters mostly believably ambiguous, with not a stereotype among them. Officer Yan -- the bad mole -- who had infiltrated the police force and worked as a spy for the mob for ten years, even managed to convince me that his climactic epiphany was genuine. And that was quite a task. The ends of Chief S. P. Wong and the good mole were honestly presented and, for me and I suppose most viewers, extremely regretful.It's well worth catching but keep your eyes and ears open, particularly in the first third of the film.",

I watched the recent DVD release available in the US.The movie has a great premise, a triad mole in the police force hunting a police mole in the triad, and vice versa. Its such a great idea, I was wondering why I didn't think of it first.While there wasn't as much action as I had hoped for, there was a great crime story and the suspense grew solidly throughout the film.For a movie to impress me, it has to be overall good, but almost most importantly is the ending. There have been a lot of movies that I thought were good, right up until the ending. Underworld is an example. If the ending sucks, I cant enjoy the movie.This ending was fantastic. At first I thought they were going to sell out on me, but no, this ending spun me in circles, tore a hole in my chest, ripped out my heart and kicked it off the wall, then put it back, gave me the shock paddles and sent me on my way. I was 100% pleased with the way it ended. Like a perfect cigar after a delicious meal.See this movie. 9/10 I'm looking forward to obtaining the sequels!",

            "content": "\"Infernal Affairs\" is the Hong-Kong based crime movie that eventually led to the birth of the \"The Departed\" by Martin Scorsese. The film certainly has its own merits, but also its own faults. The story is centered on two moles: one of them infiltrates the mob and the other infiltrates the police force. When both parties become aware of the infiltration, a game of cat and mouse (or should I say mouse and mouse?) ensues, as each try to uncover the other one first.For the most part, \"Infernal Affairs\" relies on its strong and intriguing premise to keep the viewer hooked and succeeds. It's a competent crime film, but if you begin to scrape the surface it quickly gives in. While the two main characters are reasonably interesting, their love interests are extremely underdeveloped and lack any of the emotional depth of the characters in \"The Departed\". The direction is also far from brilliant. \"Infernal Affairs\" tries too hard to be stylish, cramming obnoxious fade-outs and pointless slow motion shots in many scenes. Still, I could have let all of this go, were it not for the most annoying fault of the entire film: an atrocious soundtrack, which isn't only incredibly cheesy, but intrusive as well. I admit I had seen Scorsese's remake prior to \"Infernal Affairs\" and, no matter how hard I tried not to compare the two, the superior work is obvious.If you are looking for a decent crime film, \"Infernal Affairs\" will meet most of your expectations. However, if you are hoping for something more, I strongly recommend Scorsese's version.",

            "content": "When I was first introduced to the 2002 hit, \"Infernal Affairs\", I was anticipating a Hong Kong John Woo type Action film with lots of shooting and high body counts. Infernal Affairs did not meet that anticipation nor was it a cookie cutter action movie of someone else's idea. The film is considered one of the best all time. I can agree with the movie being good. But that is about it. I think the reason why I thought it was decent was because I just finished watching the Korean 2003 sensation \"Old Boy\" and compared these two movies accordingly. What the story of \"Infernal Affairs\" didn't lack was story and plot line of each character. The biggest attribute of this film was story line. The story of opposite sides of the law were very impressive and kept me interested.The scenes of organized crime was articulately plotted and almost matched that of \"Heat\" and \"Jackie Brown\". The god cop/bad cop image was well played by Andy Lau and Tony Leung. The delivery of the plot wound up being somewhat straightforward in the beginning with a couple sub-plot twists later on near the end. There was no real guess work needed. The heist in the beginning was rather impressive and the opposite sides with the undermining battle between the moles of each side of the law. Uses of intel and surveillance techniques were pretty darn good. One thing I do wish, was some more action (a car chase, a shooting, something...) but this type of scene was like a long chess game that ended in a stalemate. I guess direction wanted to apply a sense of realism that not all surveillances and heists end up in violent casualties (fair enough...). Throughout the rest of the movie was all story and proper execution of each scene. Direction did at least that. Acting was okay but none of the characters were convincing enough for me to fall in love with. Dr. Lee, the psychiatrist in which the hero Yan was involved with, had only 4 distinct scenes. Both Yan and Inspector Lau each had a good story with a certain degree of depth, were actually a bit bland. I don't even feel for some of the role playing characters that get killed. There is no real stirring emotion or drama. There was some action but it wasn't focused on any specific action scenes. Overall, \"Infernal Affairs\" is like watching a chess game and rematch of a chess game with different outcomes. I can't discredit this movie for being an intelligent police story but don't expect an old school Chow Yun Fat action movie like I did. I recommend watching this movie as long as you take it for what it is. 7/10.",

Throughout the film, we get a real sense of their predicament as their personal lives fall apart while maintaining a facade. Not to mention they are both tasked with uncovering the moles, something they can't easily do while concealing their own roles. Near the end, this culminates in more bloody violence that really raises the stakes, adding to the \"continuous hell\" and making the story very unpredictable.

            "content": "You can pitch Infernal Affairs in a sentence. There are two blokes: one's a cop who's undercover with a criminal organisation, the other works with said criminal organisation and has gone through the police training programmes and garnered for himself a place at the top of the organised crime prevention taskforce. There you go, one sentence. The fact Infernal Affairs is as good as it is ought to be quite surprising in this regard, shouldn't it? I mean, how often is it that films one can pitch in a line are not much more than decent B-movies with a snappy pace and a reasonably good idea? Infernal Affairs is a rare exception to the rule; a really cracking, burning thriller about two men on the edge; on the front line; on the edge of the front line with their respective sides whilst working deep in the opponent's.The film will perhaps be more famous for inducing that botched, overly long 2006 American effort at the same sort of thing; a piece, of which, finally (somewhat shamefully) brought about Martin Scorsese's Oscar win after decades of tireless effort in propping up the American film industry with effort after effort. There is a degree of irony behind the fact that, in the hands of the Americans, the piece often came to resemble precisely what I established: A B-movie, a cut and thrust cops and robbers piece which was more interested in the getting to where it was going than the nature of what was darting along in the first place. Besides, I don't see Infernal Affairs' foreign language Oscar anywhere. What WAS the film that won that year? Hold on, I'll look it up..... It was Canada's The Barbarian Invasions. Turns out Hong Kong's entry was in fact Infernal Affairs, but it didn't even make the finals shortlist.Fickle nature of the Academy aside, Infernal Affairs is about two men on opposing sides of the law. Then, they transpose these sides and end up on the other side, but they're still on opposing sides of the law. We begin with Leung Chiu Wai's Chan Wing-yan, a man \"expelled\" from the police academy who eventually ends up being placed out there onto the bustling Hong Kong streets, amidst the underworld and such, in order to tie himself in with a local Triad gang the police force would love to quash. At the other end of the spectrum, the Triad boss Hon Sam (Tsang) as already hit upon a similar plan wherein he plagues the police entrance tests with young moles of his own \u2013 the man who rises to the challenge in this respect is Lau Kin-ming (Lau), who garners the trust of the policing peers and encroaches on law-run ground for sake of the gangsters. What makes the film work as effectively as it does is its writing, its confidence that what it's depicting is interesting and can be made to work. Here is a writer being granted a nifty little premise and being asked to run with it. Run with it he does.Play between the two sides begins to unravel with Chan's desire for something to give born out of living this double life. An observant man, he offers his thoughts on how the superintendent was perhaps in a rush on a particular morning born out of the fact his socks do not match, an instance wherein we are essentially invited to play along in our observing of what seems out of place or out of sorts, something that comes to plague the minds of those centrally involved. Once each of the respective sides come to realise they possess a mole distributed by the opposing side, the meat of the narrative gets going. It is the narrative above all else which grips us throughout, a project covering two hardened people already too deep into their respective roles living under facades for there to be any real shift in dynamic either between or involving one of them. Away from the central story, Chan has a relationship with his psychiatrist, an individual whose couch forms another instance of 'cover' in that he frequents it in order to catch up on sleep. This bond with Kelly Chen's Dr. Lee carries with it its own powerful tract, in as such Lee arrives in his life as the one, genuine item. Their fondness for one another is the lone 'real' element in a man's life of forgery and deception.The sense of cinema at work in Wai-keung Lau and Alan Mak's thriller is omnipresent, a film with its varying interior scenes shot differently and creatively what with its varying filters and contrasts; exterior sequences too, which are constructed around a camera always watching on from afar as if to suggest what we're seeing is top secret \u2013 as if how we're seeing it is the perspective of a spy given the sensitivity of the conversation's nature. There is a sense of loss or pain when a character takes a hit, or even dies; Infernal Affairs being the mainstream film that happens to be unafraid of killing off some of its more important characters if it means keeping the drama flowing. The thrill is in the delivery of the premise; the balanced approach to either side, the decision to depict either one as a character all unto themselves with their own problems and such; the unpredictable atmosphere of the piece wherein one genuinely feels no one is safe. Where I'm under the impression that Hong Kong thrillers are often a Hong Kong-dollar-a-dozen, Infernal Affairs stands out.",

The two films follow the very same storyline and while I prefer Scorsese's versions this here is still an incredibly well made film. The one advantage this film does have over the remake is the stuff dealing with the drug deal and what follows. I thought that entire scene worked better here and I also enjoyed the confrontation that followed at the police station in the next scene. All of the performances here are very good and the director's style is quite nice. The music score plays a big part here but I thought the ending was rather weak.

            "content": "It's a sentiment that has been echoed many times since the release of Martin Scorcese's \"The Departed,\" but it's worth saying once more. Without \"Internal Affairs,\" \"The Departed\" would not exist. The film is not without its flaws-it is, at times hokey and lapses between scenes derail the continuity at points. But the intriguing premise, vivid characters, slick visuals, and break-neck pacing come together to produce a film that isn't only fun to watch, but substantive. It would be unfair to place Scorcese's re-make on the pedestal it stands to occupy, without acknowledging this film.This isn't Nicholson, Damon, and DiCaprio, but the acting is no less compelling. Tony Leung, ragged and feral is a stark contrast to his adversary, played capably by Andy Lau, who traverses dangerous ground as a Triad packaged as a charming and talented detective. Eric Tsang and Anthony Wong both turn in performances that buttress the theme of dichotomy as two weathered veterans, engaged in a human chess match with the lives of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9es at stake.The story revolves around a would-be officer, played by Leung, a former academy standout, hand-picked to infiltrate the Triads for an indefinite amount of time. Simultaneously, the Triads send a young solider to establish a vein of intelligence within the police department. Both men quickly rise in their respective agencies, enmeshing themselves in the operations, finding it increasingly difficult to see the way out and as years pass, increasingly difficult to separate reality from the lives that they've built on a foundation of deceit. Their paths come to a head when those who commissioned them inform them that they each man must identify and expose the other, all while avoiding being discovered by their own.Thematically, the film showcases the delicate interplay between truth and deceit, safety and death, crime and justice that subtly manifests itself in the fabric of this film and never wavers. Masterfully crafted tension is broken up in parts by comic moments that are as fleeting as any sense of security afforded its protagonist.The most important aspect of this film, the notion that the two leads are reflections of one another, that every man has a propensity for good and evil, that dilemmas of justice like morality have no easy solutions is not new, by any means. But here, it is treated in a manner that is neither stale nor heavy handed. The two lead characters are as connected as they are opposed, something which is explored here to a greater degree here than in the Scorcese remake.Although \"The Departed\" borrows much from this film, it does not achieve the level of cohesion or the richness of connection between its characters. That's not to say that Scorcese's film is a failure; it's an entertaining film with viable themes. And though this came first, the Westernized version is still worth watching even if only for the star powered cast, for a taste of Scorcese's signature gangster lean, or for Alec Baldwin's scene stealing banter. After reading so many responses to the film on this site, it's clear that some of the credit for its warm reception is due to the film being set in the city of Boston. But for whatever reason, this story just seems more at home in the alternately murky and glowing streets of Hong Kong.",

The reason for that is that without the remake I would probably not even have heard of \"Infernal Affairs\", yet and if I did, I probably wouldn't have understood it.Whereas \"The Departed\" took its time to develop the background story of the characters, \"Infernal Affairs\" rushes straight to the first big coke deal - a real Edge-Of-Your-Seat moment in Scorsese's movie. In this version you just try to figure out what the hell is going on. Unfortunately, it goes like this for most of the movie. The undercover cop doesn't seem stressed enough. The bad gangster boss isn't really threatening. We don't feel any real emotional connection to the heroes and villains at all in \"Infernal Affairs\".I know it's not fair to compare the Hong Kong original to the American version scene by scene, but you just can't help doing it when you've seen \"The Departed\" first and enjoyed it as much as I did. Except for the main story and some key scenes, however, \"Infernal Affairs\" and \"The Departed\" don't even share that many similarities. Apparently, Scorsese has never seen the original before he made his movie, which would explain why he made his version so differently.Lau's character was arguably more interesting in \"Infernal Affairs\". Also the ending may have been a little bit \"romanticized\" in \"The Departed\". Personally, I still think Scorsese and his crew did a much better job at bringing the original premise to life in every aspect. \"Infernal Affairs\" is a decent movie, though.",

If you ask me this is a pretty awesome concept. Neither side is able to get anywhere with the other because they're both constantly receiving information from the other. It's a conflict that can't end with either side winning until they take action specifically against their opposing moles. I'm not doing it justice, but it's pretty cool.Unfortunately, it doesn't handle it nearly as well as it could. The acting, for starters, is okay. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bland. It really depends. Most of the time it was pretty good, but it does falter enough for it to matter. The movie suffers from it's lack of ability to develop any of the characters or their relationships. Some of them have romantic relationships that are treated like a major part of the story, but they're so poorly written and unfocused that it makes it hard to really care about them. My biggest frustration with the movie is the editing. It's hilarious how dated it is. Multiple scenes end with a still frame while dialogue continues to play, followed by the screen fading to black. When did this movie come out? 2002? Yeah, it's a little late for that. Clearly someone didn't get the memo. Overall Infernal Affairs has an awesome concept that it couldn't quite pull off. The writing and characters aren't fleshed out enough, and the editing is hilariously dated. In the end I'd really only recommend this movie to a handful of people.",

            "content": "Two things I didn't know about the film until I came to it's reviews section on IMDb. First, this was remade in 2006 as \"The Departed\" by director Martin Scorsese. And second, the two principal characters, Yan and Lau, are portrayed by two sets of actors. While watching, I kept rewinding footage back to the police training academy scene for the younger versions of the two men, and couldn't reconcile their appearance with the older (by a decade), undercover versions. Another reviewer made the point, would their looks have changed so considerably in the span of ten years or so? Not to my thinking, and that confusion at the beginning of the picture was a nuisance.Once that bit of business gets out of the way though, this is a fairly effective gangster drama, with conflicted undercover mole Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau) providing his mob boss Sam (Eric Tsang) the attempts by the police to bring Sam's organization down. Lau's counterpart is undercover detective Chen Wing Yan (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung), embedded in Sam's gang and walking a tense tightrope after a major drug deal gets foiled. Both Yan and Lau are entrusted by their superiors to expose each other, but at the point where they both wind up figuring things out, a series of twists occur that spell doom for one of the principals.It's been a while now since I've seen \"The Departed\", but on the basis of my memory and rereading my review of that film, I think it holds up a bit better with the double crosses and unexpected turns in the story. I don't think that has to do with any bias toward an American film versus this Hong Kong product, because as I stated earlier, I thought the casting of two sets of characters in \"Infernal Affairs\" was an unforced error. It's still a good story though, with a couple of nuances I want to revisit at some point later on.",

            "content": "The given is that a remake will not be as good as the original. It may be there for reasons that a studio needs to put out something, they have the rights now, let's do another spin on it. And it's not like remakes are new, they've been around since the 1930's in film, maybe even before that (were silent films remade from other silent versions, maybe, but I digress). The Departed was one of those rare occasions where not only did the filmmakers and actors improve on the previous story, they added to it, enhancing the plot. Of course the main ingredients were there in Lau and Leung's film, but it's like taking a bite out of a piece of fried chicken from your local Chinese food delivery, and getting a crisp, golden-fried piece from that awesome restaurant in the city - same bird, different spices and oil. I should let this film on its own speak for itself, and to be fair it does work on its own as a film. But the work of Scorsese, Monahan, DiCaprio/Damon/Nicholson et all took the main plot (and ironically Scorsese quipped it was his first movie that had a plot) and added humor, subtext, extra characters, real romance and stakes that weren't there before.Infernal Affairs is a good movie though because its plot is strong and compelling - you got the cop undercover in the mob, and the young mobster picked by the boss to be undercover in the ranks as a cop. The dramatic possibilities are on a silver platter for any writer (though on the flip-side it could become clich\u00e9 and trite in the misguided hands). Here, we get a story that has very little fat story-wise, as we follow the drug busts, the twists, the tracking of one cop to another and the deaths of certain cops and criminals, and it's ultimately about the price paid, morally speaking, in this world - which can be a lot or a little depending on which side you're on.Again, it's hard to under-sell how much The Departed looms in my mind seeing the film. It's not totally fair, I know this, but it's also hard when so many scenes are much alike... and yet you can see where, in the opposite of what happens in adaptations, the new filmmaker adding to what's already there. And yet there's certainly good things to recommend about Infernal Affairs, especially if you like specifically HK cop movies - actually, if you're a die-hard follower of those, this seems to be a quintessential watch.At the top of what's good here are the two main actors, Tony Leung and Andy Lau as the cop and criminal undercover respectively. Leung has the more intense part - when we see him after a prologue he has been undercover for 10 years - and I was astonished by how much he dug into the turmoil of this character (normally I see him in more romantic stuff like Wong Kar Wai's films, but here, as in The Grandmaster, he shows he has the cops for it). Lau is also very good, but has to play more... reserved isn't the word, but he has to show fewer emotions, unless he's with his psychiatrist girlfriend (not that developed as a character, by the way, just enough to get by). The two actors, how they play every scene, is captivating.But while the villain here, Sam (Eric Tsang), is fairly strong, I never felt much of a threat or sense of danger about him. Again, hard to stay away from its American version, but there's much less there than in Nicholson's character (albeit that had the boost from Whitey Bulger's story from Boston). With the exception of maybe a couple of scenes, like when the drug deal goes down in the first act of the film, he too doesn't seem to have much to do except act sort of menacing, in a subdued sort of way, to his underlings. It's not that he has to be fun or exciting, but... maybe he does. Maybe he could have been the wildcard or piece of mania to give the material that extra boost.Infernal Affairs works as a kind of well-oiled machine of a thriller, and hen those major turns happen - the reveals of who is really who and not what really seems is what it is - it's satisfying. But it's got its share of flaws, namely in a score that is sappy-melodramatic, like right after when the death of a particular character happens and the hero looks on in despair. And while the directors here have a lot of excellent shots and cinematography to work with in the HK sky-line (and always with the rooftops, a joke is made at one point, which is nice), there's flashbacks once too much. I can give it to this movie that, unlike some other HK action thrillers, this isn't convoluted, it's straight-forward enough really. Actually, so straightforward it doesn't need certain obvious moments repeated for the audience.So, in short, even if I'd seen this before the Departed, it would still work as a movie. But it has short-comings as it is, I didn't find it to be that All-Time Great HK Cop Thriller that some have elevated it to, and if one puts it up against a interpretation by a master filmmaker the faults show more.",

A decade passes by and the two cops maintain their same positions but are confused about their identities. Both bosses eventually learn that the other has a mole working for them and loyalty turns into betrayal, then things begin to unfold.Renowned action choreographer Dion Lam (THE PROMISE, EXIT WOUNDS, SPIDER-MAN 2, and DOOM) also stepped in to take part in the film as one of the triad members who takes down an important character in the movie.The movie featured masterful cinematography, nice action sequences, suspense, and a strong cast to help pull the strings and earn it Best Picture at the 2002 Hong Kong Film Awards. Famed director Martin Scorsese (GOODFELLAS) would take inspiration from the film to helm the 2006 American remake, THE DEPARTED, which would also earn multiple nominations and awards due to its success. This tells you that if it was not for INFERNAL AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTED would have never came into existence, which is more evident that the movie was a crime-thrilling phenomenon and a highly recommended film for American audiences.This movie is a phenomenal classic due to its excellent story, a supporting cast, and a nice twist, which makes it an enjoyable cop movie and a masterpiece in cinematic excellence for years to come",

Their objectives are the same: to find out who is the mole, and who is the cop.Some of the film's brilliance is lost in translation. The Chinese title means \"The Unceasing Path\", a reference to Avici, the lowest level of hell in Buddhism, where one endures suffering incessantly. Translations tried to give the English title a reference to Dante's Inferno, a parallel that Westerners would understand. But is it really the same?The film gets increased American attention because it was remade as \"The Departed\". This extra attention is good, but the comparison of the two is not. While it is, indeed, a remake, they are not exactly the same film. Martin Scorsese moved away from the Triad theme and used Whitey Bulger as his background instead, at a time just before the Bulger story really broke. The context and connotations are completely different.",

Infernal Affairs is proof that to find increasingly good films we are all looking abroad to places like Hong Kong and Japan. This movie was a cleverly constructed piece of art with no room for silly nonsense and a buddy cop feel to it. The 2 main lead characters not to mention the main gangster were all out-standing. The acting was truly superb and flawless, the film had a certain attitude of its own which made it great! although I am aware that it went on to spawn two more sequels I will definitely make an effort to check it out. Too basically conclude , Infernal Affairs is how to make a good text book thriller with no time wasting and silly sub-plots running about and because of that time will just fly by and it will want you leaving more. Make sure that this movie is on your '100 movies to watch before I die'list.INFERNAL AFFAIRS : 8.9 OUT 10FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NITE !",

However, I will give Scorsese credit for recognizing that he could not improve significantly on Andy Lau/Alan Mak's screenplay, cinematography and direction and realizing that a straightforward remake would be the best alternative. Nevertheless, Lau and Mak's film is better paced, less openly/graphically violent (though the body count is about the same as in Scorcese's film), and as well shot as The Departed.Andy Lau and Tony Leung are phenomenal as the mob mole and undercover cop whose careers are painfully forcing them to triangulate in on each other, with their bosses somewhere in between. As their careers advance, both men develop regrets which even redemption will not cure, and the tension builds continuously as the film's mood darkens.Infernal Affairs is one of the most cleverly plotted crime dramas I have seen. The plot, however, does not overshadow the film's exceptional characterization, acting, dialog and cinematography.Highly recommended",

Lau is a triad plant in the Hong Kong Police force working for your typical big-boss-bad-guy (Eric Tsang). Meanwhile the cops have a plant of their own (Tony Leung) \u0096 a man who's been working under cover for so long, he's beginning to forget who he is.Not a naturally stable position, and it is not long before all hell breaks loose as both sides tear themselves apart trying to find the moles.This is, of course, a hugely interesting set up \u0096 not least because Tony Leung is not the only one with identity problems. Lau, aided by that most powerful force for moral rectitude known to man - The Wife (Singer and actor, Sammi Cheng) - is also suffering from late onset conscience. What possibly can happen next? Infernal Affairs is the classic example of a film that is a victim of its medium.It is a gangster movie. Moreover, it is a Hong Kong gangster movie. It needs to deliver on action. It needs plot twists. It needs fortune cookie rambling on the nature of good and evil. And boy, does it deliver on these things. If you want a gripping, tortuously plotted gangster movie with some amazing, stylised, set piece action you're going to score this as an 8 or 9 at least.As a genuine exploration of character (which it promises to deliver all through the film) it will score less well. I really wanted some depth and some signs of development in the characters. Unfortunately, all the character development seemed to happen when the guns were being re-loaded.On the box to the UK version of this film there is a quote which says that Infernal Affairs \"Out Heat's Michael Mann\".Not quite.It is possible that Infernal Affairs is better plotted than Heat, which rambles a bit, has a soggy mid-section, and at least two characters too many. But the ground that Heat loses in plotting it more than makes up for in characterisation.Both films play on the idea that the cops and robbers are just two more warring gangs. Both suggest depths to the lead characters. But what Infernal Affairs alludes to, Heat explores. This means we care for the characters so much more.Infernal Affairs is a good film. It's a hugely entertaining film \u0096 and definitely worth a look before looking at The Departed. 7/10.",

Rapid and concise, it speeds impressively through some very tricky waters, effectively ratcheting the tension to an almost-unbearable level through both plot and cinematography. As a non-Mandarin speaker, it's often tough to keep pace with the lightning-quick subtitles, but strong performances from the two yin-and-yang leads saves the day on more than one occasion.

His objective: to find the mole who's been leaking police proceedings to Hon Sam, the veritable emperor of the Hong Kong underworld. Lau Kin-Ming, Hon Sam's right-hand man, infiltrates the police department, hoping to blow the lid off the mysterious fink who always tips off the authorities right when the stakes are highest. The moles, of course, are one and the other, and as each mole's pursuit leads him closer to his counterpart, the odds wind down for a bloodless conclusion.The Departed, Scorsese's Oscar-winning remake, was mistakenly announced at the 79th Academy Awards as the adaptation of a Japanese movie, a harsh example of how marginalized Andrew Lau' original had already become. I loved The Departed, and I'm the first to admit it. While perhaps the better film from the standpoint of editing, writing, and narrative complexity, its strengths are less the product of artistic clairvoyance and more the perks inevitably included in the writing of a second draft; the perks that come from approaching the work of another artist and, with the benefits of hindsight and a modicum of distance, making a tweak here and a tweak there and pushing the story to a subsequent level of excellence.To be sure, the original has it downsides. The flashbacks are annoying, the music is cheesy, and the melodramatic deaths of Wong and Wing-Yan are vastly inferior to the heart-stopping abruptness of corresponding fatalities in Departed, but so many of the moments that made Scorsese's film great \u0096 the cell phone motif, the intro, the spectacular finale of mole vs. mole \u0096 are modeled so closely on the original that \"adaptation\" starts to feel like an understatement.This leaves Infernal operating on two levels, first forcing the virgin viewer to step back and re-evaluate Departed as translation rather than re-make, then standing apart from its successor, drawing us in, letting us dwell on all the scenes that still feel original, scenes Scorsese chose to abandon.Perhaps the strongest of these moments sees the moles meeting one another in a pawnshop, Chan-Ying working the store, Kin-Ying shopping for speakers, the two sitting down together to enjoy an epoch of quiet respite, neither aware of the other's identity. Later on \u0096 with Scorsese selling out for the zero-sum game, all parties dead or dying \u0096 Lau takes a more thought-provoking exit, allowing Kin-Ying to survive the final showdown, leaving the viewer to ponder questions of guilt and atonement, to wonder how long it will take before Ying's demons catch up with him.Both Leung and Lau give strong performances, and weighty assistance from the supporting cast fills out the edges of this explosively original film. I'm left hoping that Infernal Affairs will win out in the long run, and stand outside of Scorsese's shadow. Failing that, I hope subsequent billings for The Departed will at least give Hong Kong its due, and leave off thanking Japan.",

While there are varying viewpoints on remakes, most come from seeing the original first. On its; own, Infernal Affaiars is great story packaged in a fast paced, action laced, Miami Viced and MTV spliced send up to to the Cops & Robbers genre. Interwtining the two sides from the beginning to the end is the twist that is twisted. On the anti side, I found the Directors' storytelling rushed and emotionally forced. The supporting characters state their lines to tell us about the main characters, both of whom are charming. Lets' face it, the charm in our polarized stars can not be equal in style. Within 10 minutes, it was clear that The Departed was plotted step by step and that watching the other 90 minutes was to see how the Chinese Cinema entertains their public and I felt as if this were TV paced, no room for real emotion or explanation, just enough time to collect sponsor money and credits. My summary above describes our two moles who want to reset the clock, but is also about just as much about listening to the original rock and roll albums as it is seeing movies that inspired new movies. The past era in which the art was generated in now gone, so propping it up in any other era is placing it out of context. Is time a hero? Not in this case.",

Certainly it couldn't look any better, or sound better. Any attempts to remake much of the film would only end up as pale shadows to this version. One can almost see how Scorsese will redo scenes, say by using Sinatra when the stereo is purchased. This is as good a Hong Kong film as I've seen in quite some time.BUT, and as you can tell by the capital letters its a big but, the film slows in the second half a bit. Despite the fact that on every technical level the film never sags, and some nice plot shifts that are very good, the second half slows down just a bit too much.

The bitterness of both the lead characters about the choices they have made or had thrust upon them by circumstances \u0096 dating back in the character Ming's case to his time as a trainee police officer when he envies Yan's being kicked out of the force, and in the character Yan's case his increasing bitterness about the loss of a normal life that the decision of his younger self has caused \u0096 inform their characters' actions and add a layer of subtlety to an action packed movie.Other critics here refer to the female characters as peripheral, unnecessary, idiotic.

Her comments lead to Ming's decision that he will restore Yan's place in decent society and become a \"good guy\" himself \u0096 a plan which is taken out of his hands by events beyond his control.

This film has an excellent \"New Wave\" HK Director, a first-rate cast, great script, good production values and an overall rich and elegant style which defines it as being one of the best HK films in the last few years.The film is a cat and mouse tale of two undercover agents, operating on different sides of the law, working to bring down each other's organization and expose each other's true identity. Chan Wing Yan (Tony Leung) is a Hong Kong Police officer undercover within the HK Triads; led by the intense and unpredictable Sam (Eric Tsang). On a long term undercover assignment, his real identity is only really known by his close friend and senior Policeman, Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong). On the opposite side of the scale is Inspector Lau (Andy Lau), a Triad working for Sam who is climbing the ranks of the Hong Kong Police Department in an attempt to restrict their monitoring of the Triads' activities.Needless to say, the film goes into far more detail than that, emphasizing strong character development, personal relationships, and issues surrounding honour, love and sacrifice. The film succeeds best on the basis that it draws on so many emotions and convictions, emersing the audience in the lives of the characters and genuinely engaging with the events on screen. The audience also grow to very much like both lead characters, in a strange sort of \"Heat\"-esque kind of way, and can relate to both characters problems.The film contains a very interesting non-linear narrative including flashbacks to explain the early lives of Lau and Chan, and also contains some elaborate, but not excessive direction techniques. Andrew Lau, famous for kicking off the \"Young and Dangerous\" popular film franchise seems to \"grow up\" somewhat with this film and experiment further with narrative styles and techniques. The cast is nothing short of excellent. Tony Leung, in particular drives incredible emotion into the torturous lifestyle of Chan, and Andy Lau gives a subdued and anxious approach to Lau. Eric Tsang delivers what is probably his best ever performance as the Triad boss, Sam, which is at times both funny and terrifying. Anthony Wong gets a rare opportunity to play a good guy, and seems to adopt naturalism and non-theatrical conviction, reminiscent in performances such as that in \"Hard Boiled\".The film is a powerful reminder of how fantastic a movie can be when all the necessary elements come together.

It is well-written, thoroughly thought through and it is a storyline that is every bit as entertaining every time you watch the movie. And that is some accomplishment from the writers. It is the type of storyline that grabs the audience by the wrist and doesn't let go before the movie comes to an end.And the cast ensemble in \"Mou Gaan Dou\" is just spectacular.

They both have to figure out the same thing, who is the mole and who is the cop. I really enjoyed the choppy editing back and forth between Lau and Chen. It made for some very intense sequences.My favourite part of infernal affairs is the score and soundtrack. The main theme was great but it was also used as a brilliant leitmotif for inspector Lau and Chen. When Lau was on screen by himself one half of the theme would play and when Chen was on his own the other half would play. But when they were together and we got to hear that epic score roaring it made for some amazing amazing scenes. The soundtrack was also great and I especially loved the use of \"Goodbye policeman\" by Fiona Fung.I liked the choppy editing during some moments but, sadly, more often than not it made scenes very hard to follow and understand what is actually happening. This was a huge problem during all the action scenes.The cinematography was pretty great and made everything much easier to understand.

There are also quite a few great uses of reflections just to have some nice longer takes in the midst of all the fitful action.I just have a few more criticisms I'd like to mention. The flashbacks were very annoying, I don't need to see what happened earlier in the film, I don't like when a filmmaker does this as it feels like they don't think you are smart enough to remember what happened one hour ago, almost as if their movie is too smart for you. I also think near the beginning there is too much poorly presented exposition that got tedious after 10 minutes or so. Finally I'll mention the ending fatigue, I feel the story should have wrapped up just a couple minutes earlier as there was a bit of a drag before the conclusion.My dog may not have liked infernal affairs but I sure did, it's a tense fast paced film that inspired a very popular oscar winning director. You should definitely check this out if you like Scorsese or thrilling mysteries.",

Following a more of a straight forward storyline than the departed, this movie kept you compelled for a full hour and a quarter. It also kept you thinking. This was the best foreign movie that i have seen this year, and I think that Martin Scorcese should give more credit to the Chinese Crew. This was certainly a movie worth seeing and i recommend you putting it on netflix straight away. An easy 9 out of 10.Talking about Martin Scorcese, Robert Deniro of Goodfella's, Scorcese's movie, is making what seems to look like it will be a great movie called The Good Shepherd. it is about the \"real\" story of the beginninign of the Cia and I definitely cannot wait to see that.Other recommended movies are: 1. Casino Royale 2. The Departed 3. The Illusionist 4. Borat 5. Miami vice 6. babel All of these movies are great- the best one is probably Babel, the worst Borat. I have to say that i was a tad disappointed with Borat, you just get sick of that character, thats why i enjoy watching the Ali G show more.Ethan",

            "content": "A decent police procedural from Hong Kong that not only spawned two sequels and an American remake but whose look and style has inspired many police films ever since (watch NEW POLICE STORY for an example of how this film's distinct visuals have proved so influential). I really hate to say it, but I actually think the Scorsese-directed remake, THE DEPARTED, is superior to this \u2013 it's got a better ensemble cast, more grandiose set-pieces and a bigger, epic feel to it. Infernal Affairs is lower budgeted but still offers remarkable acting and an intricate original plot line.Andy Lau and Tony Leung are both fine actors whose popularity is a mark of their success in China. They're both able to get their teeth into meaty roles here, playing undercover operatives on different sides of the law, and even though they share few scenes together they have a shared kind of intensity. It's hard to pick who's best: Leung, edgy and reluctant, or Lau, icy and efficient, and I think they deserve equal plaudits. Veteran support comes from Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang, the latter finding a new lease of life in a career previously noted for comedy \u2013 he plays it dead straight here.The star of the show is the storyline, which is inventive and well paced, a cat-and-mouse thriller like no other. Every drop of tension is wrung from what stands as a fairly simple premise, each moment pumped for maximum suspense. This is the kind of mature, creative film-making that Hong Kong indulges in on occasion, and when they do few others can come close.",

The recent spurt of interest is largely due to the release of the Martin Scorcese all-star remake. I haven't seen the remake yet, but the original is a great yarn.At the start of the movie, the police force throws out its brightest cadet in years and secretly assigns him to infiltrate the Triads. At the same time, the Triad leader Sam gets some junior members to enter the police force. Forward ten years later and both moles are quite high up in their hierarchies and both organizations know and are trying to find the mole in their organization.The plot has plenty of twists and turns and at least two amazing set-pieces. Tony Leung stands out as the undercover cop in a large ensemble cast. I loved the movie but would not object to a remake in a language I can understand if the strengths of the original are retained and some of that Scorcese magic is also present.",

            "content": "It was only after Martin Scorsese won his long awaited Oscar for Best Director for his fantastic film The Departed that I found out it was an American remake based on this Cantonese original, so I had to see how much of the material was the same. Basically Chen Wing Yan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) is the young police officer who is sent undercover to be a mole in the Hong Kong mafia, i.e. the Triads, run by boss Hon Sam (Eric Tsang), and Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau) is the young mafia member who is sent undercover to be a mole in the police force. This war between the Triad and the police has been going on for years, and Yan and Ming have been doing what they have doing since they were young, ranking highly in their placements. Obviously both sides realise there is a mole in amongst them, but they have no idea who they are, and becomes a race against time to expose each other, but in the end it does not go the way you would probably expect. Also starring Anthony Wong Chau-Sang as SP Wong Chi Shing, Kelly Chen as Dr. Lee Sum Yee, Sammi Cheng as Mary, Edison Chen as Young Lau Kin Ming, Shawn Yue as Young Chan Wing Yan, Chapman To as Tsui Wai-Keung and Elva Hsiao as May. Throughout the film you can tell who the characters are that Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play in the remake, and you can recognise many of the same scenarios and events recreated, I feel the American version is much better, but this original is still a rather watchable crime thriller drama.

The worst punishment there is where never-ending suffering is inflicted to the condemned who will live forever in Hell.In this movie Ming and Yan are suffering this constant daily hell of hiding unwillingly behind disguise since they started going undercovered at the opposite ends of the law nine years ago.  The greatest revelation from this movie is that it shows us the level of talent Hong Kong film industry possesses.  I had not regained hope in Hong Kong films until I recently watched this movie.In the final segment of the director's commentary on the DVD version, the director says that, aside from all the beautiful cinematography, sophisticated plots, superb acting from the cast, he wants the audience to be thinking about this movie after they exit the theatre.  And I am still thinking of this movie today.  What would I do if I were Ming?  How would I have righted all the wrong I have committed to save myself from eternal damnation?  Could I have done what Yan did for nine years, living in constant fear and reminding yourself you are trying catch the same guys you live your life with?  Is Ming really is good person under the impossible circumstances trying to climb out of this moral deficit?  Or is he just a bad guy who has relapses of good conscience?Wu jian dao is one of those movies I can watch over and over again just to re-live the excitement and analyze its complexities and I think the world-wide audience shouldn't be missing out on this great masterpiece from Hong Kong.10 out of 10",

            "content": "It began with cave dwelling Neanderthals, philosophers, musicians, scholars, militant tacticians and then back again to the cave dwelling Neanderthals of Hollywood. The art of copying dates back centuries. The creme of IMDb's reviewers have stated that they are happy this film has finally found its way into the hands of a master (to be done properly) or that if you're 'brave enough' to try one Hong Kong film this is it. It's these viewpoints and opinions that make one want to give up, but thankfully there is a contingent of foreign film lovers that will not go into the night quietly.Infernal Affairs, is a cunningly devised title, being a cross between the more obvious Internal Affairs, and Dante's Inferno, the connotations of justice, reward and punishment are rife throughout the film.Infernal is hugely engaging and absorbs the viewer from its opening sequences. Cleverly devised it tells the tale of two opposing moles, one in the Hong Kong Police Department, and one in the midst of the Triads, however when a sting mission is unsuccessful due to a mole tip off, questions are raised, while loyalty and trust are put to one side as both organisations try to find their opposing mole, first. Infernal doesn't do much which is overtly different from many action thrillers that you will have seen in the past, no gimmicks are required into keeping you hooked, and to be blunt it is not the action sequences that will have you on the edges of your seats. The trump card of Infernal is its ability to keep you in suspense, the ability to keep you guessing as to who will be found out first. It is completely immersive as you yourself often find yourself in the shoes of either mole, wondering what you would do, how you act and whether you want them to get found out or not.The acting in Infernal is spot on and completely befitting to the style of story. Tony Leung and Andy Lau are as intense as you will ever see, while Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang are just faultless as their respective bosses.This film is not just damned entertaining, it's stylish, engaging and more importantly original. A question for all those that defend The Departed and have seen Infernal Affairs, and claim the films to be equal, if Infernal Affairs does not deserve and Oscar, why did The Departed, and what is that different within these films bar the name(s) of the Director(s)? The real question is do Oscars really carry any gravitas outside the world of non-frequent movie viewers as a means of pointing out which films to rent out or purchase? Chances are the answer is a no. But to talk about The Departed is a slight on the talents of all those involved with the creation of Infernal. It is a blistering action thriller and indisputably the best since Heat, and the best Hong Kong movie since John Woo and Chow Yun Fat teamed up. These elements combine and ignite on the screen. Simply a must for any fan of the genre. Simply a must for any fan of film.",

This film boasts impeccable performances from Little Tony and a strong technical team which pushes the story forward.The villain played by Hong Kong veteran, Eric Tsang, also is the main reason why this film succeeds wonderfully. The acting by Andy is a bit confusing at times (don't kill me Andy fans, ahaha).

The story is \"The Departed\" almost all across the board, however cuts out a bit of the ridiculousness from constant character transitioning and is more focused when setting up the back story of the protagonists. Mainly for these two reasons I believe this is superior to Scorsese's homage. It packs more of a serious punch while the US adaption feels comical in certain scenes which doesn't supplement the life or death scenarios. Moving on this is a great movie to introduce Westerners to modern Hong Kong Cinema, as is tied very closely with the style of Hollywood. It is absent of some past HK staples such as silly comedy, bizarre violence, or overly-dramatic romance. Luckily the movie keeps a solid pacing and concentrates on the time sensitive material at hand. Excellent screen writing and cinematography.

ANDY LAU does not have the gravitas of a CHOW YUN-FAT but I cannot fault his expert performance.  ERIC TSANG who plays the Triad boss SAM is in a class of his own; yet watching his performance I could not forget his ability as a comedian.  Unlike the early WOO film INFERNAL AFFAIRS is stream-lined with everything contributing to the end.  In other words the initial meeting between LEUNG and LAU is an intriguing introduction as it suggests the two men would likely share more than their interest in high end audio equipment.A considerable bonus is the presence of ANTHONY WONG who never fails to amaze me with his versatility.  He has real stature as LEUNG's control, the only person who knows his true identity.The story telling in INFERNAL AFFAIRS is impressive, providing suspense and characterization, all the while keeping the action moving at a breakneck pace.I saw the film initially on a regular DVD; this weekend I watched INFERNAL AFFAIRS once again - in Cantonese and DTS 5.1.  I was amazed at the difference these audiovisual upgrades made to my viewing and appreciation of the film.  The work of the two directors of photography ANDREW LAU and LAI YU FAI is truly dazzling - one wonders at the contribution of Mr CHRISTOPHER DOYLE;  CHAN KWONG WING'S score adds mightily to the spectacle.  But credit must ultimately go to co-producer/director ANDREW LAU (together with co-scripter/director ALAN MAK) who gives us a truly cinematic experience plus an intriguing script to motivate his stellar cast.(And it is a half hour faster than HARD BOILED!)",

Which, in my opinion, will go down as an all time classic scene.The script is sharp and not without lighter moments, and there is no scene which is boring, even though the more sceptical among us might question the relevance of some of the background stories. Of course the cinematography is beautiful combining style with an exposure of the grit of the Hong Kong underworld. Also worth mentioning is the inspired music; ranging from tension building opera, pounding techno and the ambient notes of the rooftop scenes.In some ways it can be seen as similar to John Woo's classic heroic bloodshed film 'Hard Boiled'in that there is the idea of the undercover policeman in the Triads (and Tony Leung does play this character in both). But they are very different films. There are a few references to Hard Boiled throughout (which I won't say). Overall it is one of those 'If you only see one foreign film this year...' films, but truly deserving of this title. I cannot recommend it enough, and (honestly) gets better every time you watch it, and I've hardly mentioned the characters!",

There is investigation and quite a bit of mobster talk but it's fast paced and for the most part gets to the point. I remember watching this for the first time in theaters and was blown away at how cool and clever the execution was. The plot revolves around a ballsy undercover gangster that is basically a mole within the triad gang. And a cunning and meticulous triad gang member that is a mole in the intelligence on the other side. And how they are trying to figure out each sides plans and sniff each other out before time runs out. It's actually a clever premise and executed quite well. I really enjoyed the cat and mouse premise in this, with each side trying to track down the mole on the other side while trying to out-think one another. It's not a action packed Hong Kong thriller but it's a thriller with a lot of clever elements. This is a engaging film from start to finish and it's a film that I want to watch again later down the line. It's basically a cult classic from China and for good reasons that I can highly recommend.9.3/10",

            "content": "For years I was told by a mate \"You watch foreign films (I think he actually said \"anything\"), you need to check out Infernal Affairs\". Then of course not long after the American remake was announced, which I went and watched and enjoyed as The Departed - much to the distress of said friend.Anyway I was actually looking for A Better Tomorrow in the Asian film section of the video shop (nowhere to be found as usual), so when I came across this I thought \"why not\"? The verdict, speaking frankly, is that if you've seen either The Departed or Infernal Affairs you don't really need to see the other. They are so similar in plot that I knew exactly what was coming up most of the time, and both are quite good films.I can only compare it to a musician releasing an album of original work, and another equally talented taking the album and faithfully remaking it just with their instruments and voice, there was no real point but most consumers would likely embrace the first version they heard. Put briefly The Departed is very far removed from the shot for shot \"Psycho\" remake.But this isn't a The Departed review.Infernal Affairs is set in Hong Kong, and opens with an induction of sorts. A group of police cadets are briefly introduced and then almost immediately we cut to about 10 years later, when one of the more promising cadets Yan has been expelled from the force and works in the Chinese underground crime world. (We know it is 10 years later because he has grown a mustache!) The best remaining cadet has enjoyed a solid and decorated career and has advanced to the rank of Inspector, his name is Lau.Now here's the hook, and without this there really isn't a film. The criminal guy (Yan) is actually a good guy who is working undercover for the Police and answers to only one member of the force, the expulsion was just to cover his exit and justify him turning to crime. And Inspector Lau is actually a crooked cop who filters information to a local gangland Boss called Sam, who happens to be Yan's employer of sorts.So there we have it, dueling \"rats\", one of them a good-bad guy, and the other a bad-good guy. It is an intriguing concept and the filmmakers utilise it well so that frequently we feel that they will finally meet or one will catch the other, but it is never kept that simple.The crisis point is when an international drug deal goes bad as both stoolies try to inform their respective links and understandably things get very confusing for both the police and the criminals, both who feel they should have the inside scoop but are continually being second guessed by the enemy. It becomes evident to both \"Bosses\" that there is a mole working for them, and as they each know that they already have a man on the inside, they sic their respective rat to find their counterpart.Confused yet? It is actually paced well so that you can track the action pretty well.But it goes further, Inspector Lau is actually called in to work for the Internal Affairs department, in essence to look for himself, all the while as he is trying to use his contacts to track down Yan for gangland boss Sam.In an attempt to catch Yan in a rendezvous with the Police Chief, things go wrong and the Chief is killed. As he was the only link between Yan and the Police Yan is now in the unenviable position of extricating himself from a situation that no-one knows he is in but himself, as all the while the nets close in.Does he do it? Well you'll have to shill your $2 for the weekly, I will say it is worth the ride. There are strong visuals, the director has a pretty striking style and of course given the explanation above there are ingenious plot twists throughout.I was actually surprised as to how complete this film was - not that I am prejudiced against foreign films - far from it, but The Departed was frequently described as being a success due to Scorcese's vision, not because it was a remake of an equally intricate work.As far as the differences between this and The Departed, there are subtle differences but more because The Departed was a 150+ minute beast and Infernal Affairs is a lean mean 90 odd. The Departed took what I would argue were minor subplots in the HK original and expanded them so that they became more a part of the remake, but from memory none of them added greatly to the finished film. There were some more memorable characters in The Departed, aside from the gang boss Sam no-one stands out from Yan as a solid character, but that could be as much about me having to read their dialogue on the screen as a foreign viewer and not really \"getting\" any difference or power in their performance.This was followed by a couple of sequels that I am yet to see, but I may look up in coming months. I would be interested in seeing how they could incorporate the final scenes into any follow up.Final Rating \u2013 7.5 / 10. If you love The Departed, this is so similar that it is unlikely to sway you, but if have seen neither and like foreign films this is a solid one with an intricate but worthwhile plot. Patience and attention will be rewarded.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

            "content": "I'll be honest. I saw this film after seeing Scorsese's American remake, and so my viewing was consciously more of a Venn diagram between the two versions than seeing it as its own beast. Scorsese's Infernal Affairs towers over this film, but not without a few preferences from Hong Kong's side of the concept.The head of the special investigations unit for whom the undercover cop, played with a highlight performance by Tony Leung Chiu Wai, works, played in Scorsese's The Departed by Martin Sheen, is portrayed so much better in this version. Despite how much better The Departed is than its predecessor, there was a stiffness to Martin Sheen's performance and in some of his scenes, especially his final one, which in this version is given a much looser, less comfortable, and frankly better stylized effect.The scene in which two henchmen are joking about how to spot undercover cops is handled so much better in this version. In The Departed, there's an inexplicability about the scene, because it doesn't seem funny and it doesn't seem to have a purpose. In Infernal Affairs, the scene grows organically out of the dialogue.Early in Infernal Affairs, the crime boss played by Eric Tsang and his entire gang is in an interrogation room with the entire special police unit on the other side, both sides facing off, both the cop undercover in the gang and the rat undercover with the police glancing about having no idea who each other really are. This is a head-on, point-blank scorcher of a scene. I don't know if this would be allowed in a police station in America, but if that isn't an obstacle, I wish with the natural energy of this scene that it could have been one of the elements mirrored in Scorsese's version, especially because the characters in his film have thicker, broader, contrasting personalities.Infernal Affairs is a decent thriller, yet it lacks the density and might of Scorsese's version. For instance, the female character in The Departed is a very human, poignantly pegged police psychologist played sensitively by Vera Farmiga. In Infernal Affairs, each male character, at least each one with a Roman numeral in the alphanumerical outline, has their own respective laxly probed \"girl\" character, the most hollow of which has the least amount of screen time and is for some reason featured on the cover scantily clad with a hand cannon as big as her head, the likes or ensuing effects of which she is not seen anywhere near in her very spare time on screen.Infernal Affairs features flashbacks during its unraveling of plot twists. These flashbacks consist of replays of scene fragments that we've already seen, as if we didn't pick up on them before. It's one thing when we're looking back to get a look at something we already saw from the other end of the telescope, but here we're only being refreshed, which isn't needed. If a movie shows you something, then it's trusting you to absorb it. To replay it for the same reason you showed it in the first place is an insult to the audience's intelligence.The Departed digs deep into the culture of its Irish-American environment, implying few degrees of separation between distant characters' upbringings, the aging neighborhoods, and details of that nature. I suppose Infernal Affairs didn't need to do this, but then again neither did The Departed. The verdict is that The Departed is a much more memorable film not simply because of the towering production values of a Scorsese film but because it's so much richer. Infernal Affairs is just another thriller to me. (Doesn't that title bother you? Infernal Affairs. It's silly, really. Its sum worth is an overt pun.)",

Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang all give excellent performances with Tony Leung's tortured undercover cop character completely owning the film. Andy Lau's role is not played out to its full potential, but Sammi Cheng's extended cameo as Ming's girlfriend brings depth and reason to his turn as the triad mole who wants to be good. Anthony Wong is calm, and Eric Tsang is charismatic as the two men controlling the two moles. These two supporting characters are pivotal as their actions explain the two main characters prime motivations for wanting to be good/bad. I've heard that the US remake has dropped these two characters from 'The Departed' which is a shame. However, one hopes that with Scorsese at the helm the film can only get better (even though 'Gangs of New York' was horrible).This movie is a must watch for people who've followed triad movies in Hong Kong, and is at least worth a rental.

But when both find out about others' presence in the opposite teams, they race against time to uncover the identity before the other one does.The direction is good, the script is a brilliant work of originality, the actors have sincerely performed their given roles, the twists & tension is nicely escalated and there isn't much wrong with any of its aspects either. Yet, on an overall scale, Infernal Affairs left me not impressed by it more so because I was able to figure out the twists n everything, not to rule out the fact that it lacked the very X-factor which propelled its remake to a level of greatness.

            "content": "INFERNAL AFFAIRS (2004) ** Andy Lau, Tony Leung Chiu Wai.(Dir: Wei Keung Lau) The intriguing concept in the cops and robbers vein of a mole infesting one gang or another is always a nice attempt in breathing life into a quite-frankly creaky vehicle that is often tweaked to death with no real originality.In the latest Hong Kong genre buster the stakes are raised when there is a mole in the police investigating the gangland that ALSO has a mole (i.e. a cop has infiltrated a mob gang and vice versa).Lau Kin Ming (Lau) is a gang member who has managed for years to pass himself as an officer rising through the ranks to the point of being assigned to Internal Affairs in order to nab a suspected mole within the division (in other words him!) To make matters worse the mole that is in his gang, a real undercover cop Chan Wing Yan (Leung Chiu Wai) has been nearly a decade posing as a rough and tumble minion who also knows there is a secret agent amongst his staff back at HQ and can only rely upon his mentor SP Wong (Anthony Wong Cho-Sang) who is managing to keep the operation one step ahead with a hairbreadth's width from unraveling.Despite a clever concept the film quite frankly lags and drags until the final reel where things finally kick into gear with a few too many twists frankly yet I can see where the filmmakers were attempting to do a la 'The Usual Suspects' and 'LA Confidential' (two superior noir flicks). The wonky second stories involving a sexy psychiatrist and Lau's writer girlfriend seem tacked on and inconsequential to the proceedings at hand.Under whelming and not unlike Chinese food the viewer is still hungry for action an hour after.

The picture is swift, stylish and exciting. Its focus is mainly on the dual lives of its dual protagonists, conveying their torn allegiances through genuine connections on both sides of the law. The narrative is delightfully distanced in terms of morality; who is 'good' and who is 'bad' is tough to say. It never asks you to root for either side of the equation, which gives it a wonderfully ambiguous and enigmatic effect. It's a great thriller that keeps you guessing throughout. Its set-pieces are superb, too. 7/10",

            "content": "This is the film on which Martin Scorsese based his 2006 Oscar winning film, The Departed. Set in Hong Kong, it's the story of two cops, one good and one bad and both on the wrong side of the fence, but I guess if you're familiar with The Departed then you'll already know that. The similarities between the two films are very striking, much closer than I expected, but more of my thoughts later. Here's a brief summary first (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please try to discover who the mole is while I write the next paragraph).Lau Kin Ming and Chen Wing Yan were at the police academy academy at the same time. While Yan was expelled, Lau graduated and rose up through the ranks. The thing is, Yan was expelled for a reason, for the next ten years he was to work as an undercover cop in the Triads (criminal gangs in Hong Kong). Only two people knew about Yan, one of them has died and the other is Lau's boss, SP Wong Chi Shing. Now working for the criminal boss, Hon Sam, Yan is becoming tired of his undercover life and longs to be free of his duties. Wong promises him that after they get Hon Sam he will be allowed to return to the fold. Unfortunately, as they are closing in, it becomes clear that Hon Sam has a man inside the police force; someone high up. There are now two insiders, a cop undercover in the Triad and a Triad spy amongst the cops. It's now a race against time to discover the identity of the other guy before he identifies you\u0085 Gripping stuff! I'll leave it there, you'll appreciate if you've seen the film, that it's very difficult to summarise this one without giving anything away.This is a really well made film with some great stunts, thrilling music and a tremendous plot. Hong Kong cinema has come on a long way and it shows, the production is really well done and there are some great performances. All of the leading cast did very well, in particular; Andy Lau as Inspector Lau Kin Ming and Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Chen Wing Yan, both are excellent in this. Anthony Wong Chau-Sang was very good as SP Wong Chi Shing, as was Eric Tsang as Hon Sam. Honourable mentions also go to Kelly Chen as Dr. Lee Sum Yee and Sammi Cheng as Mary.I find it hard not to draw comparisons with Scorsese's 'The Departed', since this is the source material. I found it surprising that the two films are very close in the plot devices they use. If anything, I slightly prefer this version, it has something extra that I can't define. Maybe it's because it's subtitled and you are forced to pay more attention, but I like this one slightly better. Of course, I think it goes without saying, this one comes very very highly Recommended! MY SCORE: 9.5/10",

The story of a crime lord using cops as 'moles' has been explored hundreds of times, and the film is really little more than variations of a theme. Why so many critics have been duped into thinking this an original \"and never explored idea\" continues to confound this viewer.However, anyone deserving additional praise is Andy Lau, as the criminal mole serving within the police force. Lau has been showcased in many Hong Kong actioners as of late, but here, his reserve -- the visible mental debates about whether or not he's truly serving the right side -- give this picture its spine. While many great Hong Kong faces can be recognized in the cast, Lau proves -- once and for all -- that he's a formidable presence in this formula cop picture.",

There is no point in watching them out of sequence, and if you watch Part One, you'll be chomping at the bit to see Parts Two and Three, so you may as well have them nearby. I watched One with no real expectation, and ended up putting Two and Three on back-to-back. The story is compelling, but it is the ensemble acting that holds your attention; amongst a stellar cast, Eric Tsang steals it for me, a compact package of menace and charm reminiscent of Bob Hoskins in 'The Long Good Friday.' It takes a phenomenal performance to scene-steal from Tony Leung, but Tsang manages it. The comparisons to the mediocre 'Heat' are unfair; the comparisons to 'The Godfather' are nearer the mark, though this is not as overblown. Other reviews give you the story outline; my tuppenceworth is that this is as compelling a film as I have ever seen, the emotions are real, and you will rarely empathise with two protagonists as fully as you do in Infernal Affairs. I stopped short of full marks because of one missed beat - the romance sub-plots. I didn't think Ming and his wife really seemed an item, and Kelly Chen is wasted in a somewhat two- dimensional role to give Yan a romance interest. I was interested to see another reviewer rate Yan's encounter with an old flame as a highlight scene - for me, it is a sub-plot that goes nowhere, a transparent attempt to ratchet up the sympathy for Yan. That particular storyline reappears in Infernal Affairs III and still fails to get off the ground. Still, who cares about Ming and Yan's relationship with women? It is the intertwining of their respective fates that drives this trilogy forward. The film did not get as much attention as it deserved in Japan, but perhaps the arrival of the Scorcese remake will spark a revival.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's film The Departed was a remake of this Hong Kong thriller, and while Scorsese embellished the story in many areas, Infernal Affairs stands on its own. The story of an undercover cop inside a Triad gang trying to uncover the gang's mole in the police, and the mole trying to figure out the undercover, is played more so in this Hong Kong original as a morality play rather than as this complex piece of work where no one is really moral. Tony Leung's undercover officer Yan is a good guy, through and through, where as the mole, played by Andy Lau, is the one who is constantly battling between the dark and light, having to decide to be the good guy to only falter in the end. The presence of the gang leader is less important in this version, as a matter of fact, this particular version is more about the police and Andy Lau's Inspector Lau and his struggles between being good or bad. So what can I say, this movie is shorter than The Departed, just as gripping, and is also a touch more entertaining cause it is so much more fast paced.I give Infernal Affairs a 10 out of 10!",

I was really sad when his character died in the movie in the end but overall, the movie was no doubt one of the best shows I had seen in year 2002.I think that this is a better movie about police and triad moles than the 1990 Hollywood movie Internal Affairs starring Richard Gere and Andy Garcia. There were some similarities but overall, the HK movie was a better one.Infernal Affairs II was a good effort by the HK film makers too. If you are confused about this movie, which at times you would be wondering what was the reason behind each mole's reason in becoming a mole, you should watch IA2(prequel) first, followed up by the IA and then the IA3 ( a sequel which has just been released in HK, Singapore and Asia ).",

            "content": "It's no wonder that Infernal Affairs (2002) was eventually picked up for an American remake, being the kind of film that Hollywood used to churn out by the truckload. In this respect, I'm talking about sharp, entertaining and energetic cinema; something that presents an intelligent story and interesting characters, but in a way that actually advances somewhat on the basic limitations of the cinematic medium. It's also a film that owes something of a larger debt to American cinema, placing the emphasis on character and the mechanics of the plot, but at the same time managing to revitalises it, even when it's pandering to the most obvious clich\u00e9s. Yes, you could argue that the set-up is simple - some might even say pass\u00e9 - but the cinematic language and the way in which the conventions of cinematography, editing, music and design are used to propel the story even further is staggering; drawing us in with an evocative style, lingering atmosphere and a break-neck pace that picks us up and carries us along on this dark and dangerous trawl through the notions of loyalty, identity and deceit.Those who are close-minded enough to think that all films made outside of the US are ponderous, slow-moving meditations on personal issues are wrong, and films like this prove it. Without question, Infernal Affairs is not only one of the best crime thrillers of the last ten years, but is also a fascinating character study; looking at the specifics of loyalty and duality, and also the issues of honour and duty. The characters are smart, believable and brilliantly performed; while the central theme of the hero pretending to be the villain and vice versa offering an original slant to the undercover sub-genre of crime cinema without losing the aspects that make it work. The entire film is just astounding, filled with character, action and moments of real drama, while that ending is fraught with all kinds of tension, conflict and crippling emotions. Infernal Affairs is easily one of the best crime thriller since The Usual Suspects (1995), and the only film to rival Oldboy (2003) as the greatest crime thriller of this decade.",

I believe that was the most important thing for me because I could not predict or expect anything in this movie and I was in tense in the whole duration of it. In addition to this I have to say that I also liked the swifts that this movie had and kept me also in tense. About the direction which made by Wai-Keung Lau and Alan Mak I want to say that it was really good and also the cast interpretations. Especially it has to be mentioned the interpretation of Andy Lau who played as Inspector Lau Kin Ming and he was simply magnificent but also equally good was the interpretation of Tony Chiu Wai Leung who played as Chen Wing Yan.Finally I have to say that \"Infernal Affairs\" is a really good movie because it combines very well mystery with crime and thriller and this combination makes it so special.

The premise is so simple and so effective that it's amazing that they haven't been making movies like this for years. Or maybe they have. But definitely none have been as well done as this.The story involves a brilliant mirror image in the crime and law enforcement world - the police force assigns a promising new recruit to enter the crime world and live there for years as a mole, meanwhile a crime boss has assigned a young gangster to join the police academy and become a legitimate cop, living inside the force for years as a mole.I watched Infernal Affairs at the same time as I was reading a thick biography of Chairman Mao and while living in China, so I've been reading a lot about undercover moles and their seemingly endless use throughout modern Chinese history, and this movie gives a brilliant on screen example. The development of the plot and story are by far the most interesting thing about the movie. Lau is the mobster living as a police officer, and Chan is the police recruit living undercover as a criminal. Lau is flourishing as a policeman, while Chan is growing increasingly desperate as a criminal, since as the years pass he finds that he is more and more simply becoming the role he is playing, and he grows increasingly desperate to get out. Unfortunately, the force has invested years in him as a criminal, so they refuse to let him out.Before long, a mole is suspected in the force, and sure enough, Lau, the mole himself, is assigned to find it. This puts him in a curious position. He can either continue to fail to find the mole, or he can frame one of his colleagues. Soon both characters are aware of each other, but not each other's identity, and there is a lengthy use of cell-phones to create a complex web of tension, as each is on the verge of discovering the identity of the other, or get discovered himself. A more thorough and effective recipe for genuine tension is difficult to come by!Then there is the issue of each man playing a different identity for so long. There is a deeper emotional and moral complexity to this film than most crime films, American, Chinese or otherwise. It's a brilliant composition of dichotomies and contradictions, mirror images and switches personalities, and makes for a hell of a ride.",

It holds up and remains compelling in all the ways I remembered, and might have even been a little better than before. It's incredibly fast-paced, and I remember feeling a little overwhelmed the first time around. It's still breakneck on a second watch, but certainly easier to get your head around, especially when it comes to the lightening fast prologue, which is almost an assault on the senses because of how quick it all is. It does stay important to the plot though, which I appreciated more this time around.The whole idea of having two undercover people - one a cop who's undercover in a gang, and the other a gang member who's undercover in the police department - both trying to figure out who's who is just so clever, and makes for plenty of tense sequences. I feel like the film's at its best when multiple people are all being suspicious of everyone around them - the more characters who are still alive and feeling overwhelmed by their situation and who to trust, the better.Even then, I do think it builds to a strong finish, even if there are a few spots in the last act that don't quite have the same momentum as the first two acts. There are also a few spots where the music and the use of slow motion feel a little melodramatic, but it's not a huge issue.I enjoy the American remake, The Departed, too, for some similar reasons, but also for some different reasons. I think both are deserving of attention and acclaim, even if part of me thinks I might like The Departed a little less than I used to, compared to when I was younger (I'm sorry, Marty).But as for Infernal Affairs, it's pretty great. Strong performances from the cast, amazingly stylish visuals, (mostly) good pacing, and such an engaging premise keep this compelling for just about all of its runtime, and makes the odd flaw here or there easy to overlook.",

            "content": "This movie is just too shallow. It very much has its fans, but I think this is a good example of many audience's preference for plot over any other element of narrative. For me, plot is the least important element used in building a story, behind character, theme, and style. For many others, plot is all that really matters, moving people from one story beat to another until the resolution. I find that kind of storytelling thinly enjoyable at best, hoping for anything with any real meat on it to chew on emotionally or intellectually. Infernal Affairs isn't only plot, but it is largely just plot. So, the twists and turns were amusing the first time I saw this movie fifteen years ago, but without more character work to consider on subsequent viewings, the whole package becomes more rote and less thrilling.Hon Sam is a crime boss in Hong Kong who takes some of his most trustworthy youngest gang members and has them enlist in the Hong Kong police force. Most particular is Lau Kin-ming who ends up the most promising of the rising bunch. On the other end is Chan Wing-yan, a young police recruit given an undercover mission to infiltrate gangs by Superintendent Wong, kicked out of the program as a ruse and sent into the lion's den. Ten years skip by, and Chan is watching an electronics store when Lau comes in looking for a sound system. This is their only direct interaction until the ending, and it's a nice moment as the two moles share a love for sound equipment and music together. It also comes back later.After this, the movie simply propels forward at a fast clip. Sam is meeting some Thai contacts to buy drugs, and the cops, led by Wong, already have the place under surveillance. Lau is in charge of the electronic surveillance and passes word along to Sam about police radio frequencies that Sam listens to on an earpiece. Chan is there with Sam, passing along details to Wong through morse code as he taps on a window. Sam and the Thai drug dealers get away, but it becomes obvious to both sides that there's a mole somewhere in each organization.Chan fears for his life and meets with Wong after Lau has been tasked with finding the mole in the police department, knowing that Wong will meet with the mole in Sam's organization, and Lau has Wong followed. This scene ends up perfectly encapsulating my problems with the movie as a whole. Chan, Wong, and Lau are the barest minimums of characters, so Lau's decisions feel perfunctory, Lau's fear feels thin, and Wong's death falls flat. The fact that the movie then goes into a sappy flashback sequence into Wong's handful of scenes from earlier in the film feels funny rather than sad. It's all quite well plotted, but the thinness of the characters makes the actual emotional impact of the event miss the mark. It's thin.With his main contact in the police force dead, Chan is lost until Lau picks up Wong's phone and calls him. Lau convinces Chan to work with him to take down Sam in a parking garage. Why Lau does this is murky at best, but I guess it has something to do with Lau's girlfriend being a writer, basing a new book on him, and telling him that she doesn't know if the protagonist is a good guy or a bad guy. That sort of stuff doesn't really add depth to characters. It's the sort of thing you add to a scene to highlight character work that's already come before it, and it's usually kind of awkwardly added in because the filmmakers think that audience didn't catch the entire point of a character's journey. Here, it's pretty much the meat of his turn.The movie's denouement ends up falling flat as well for a lot of the same reasons as Wong's death. The characters are so thin with so little attention to the actual emotional journeys they're on that when things turn good or bad, there's little investment. The plot is intricate and works without holes, which is good, but without any characters with any depth, the whole affair becomes tedious over time because we're just waiting for the next mechanical cog to turn without feeling like real people are driving these decisions.The film was also the first of a trilogy with more story to come in later films (which I've never seen), and that becomes frustrating in parts. Chan runs into a random woman on the street that he hasn't seen in seven years with her daughter who is six years old, but she says that the girl is five, the movie implying that the girl is Chan's daughter. What does any of this mean? Well, tune in for the sequel to find out, I guess. That doesn't help this movie, though. Lau's girlfriend is also a nothing of a character, suddenly getting all flustered at Lau's double life that she doesn't know about specifically but can assumedly sense the reality, but because she's barely a character and her scenes with Lau are so short, we have to trust that any of this makes sense. Her big emotional moment ends up falling flat, like most of this movie's emotional moments.I sort of understand this movie's appeals. The plot is well built and executed. However, nothing else about this movie works very well. It looks fine but unspectacular. The acting is fine but based on characters that are exceedingly thin. It's an amusing little movie that doesn't carry the emotional weight that it thinks it does.",

            "review_title": "A Fresh Intellectual Approach to the Cop Thriller Genre with Some Strong Emotional Drama",
            "content": "Infernal Affairs is situated halfway between a drama and a thriller. This famous Hongkong movie tells the story of two moles who are risking their lives and putting others' lives at risk to protect their secret agendas and identities to see their instructions and goals through.This movie works particularly well because it has a great script focusing on realism rather than exaggerated action sequences. Those who are looking for an action film might be severely disappointed but anyone looking for a plot with surprising twists and turns will get more than expected as this approach was groundbreaking for Hongkong cinema twenty years ago.The interesting characters who have both profound strengths and weaknesses are played by two of Hongkong's greatest actors of all time. Andy Lau plays a cop with an excellent reputation who is actually a mole for an important local drug dealer. His inner demons emerge progressively throughout the film, leaving an exhausted character who can't keep up with his daily acting and lies and simply wants to be a good and honest man. Tony Leung plays his counterpart, an undercover cop who has been infiltrating the triads in order to bring the organization down. However, he has become tired of living a lie and putting his life at risk for ten years and counting as he simply wants to have a simple desk job and perhaps even start a family. Aside from these excellent lead actors, this movie also comes around with amazing actresses and actors in supporting roles. Eric Tseng for instance convinces as drug dealer who is clumsy and sympathetic at first contact but pitiless and radical when put under pressure. Sammi Cheng convinces as suspicious author who puts her personal experiences into her most recent novel. Kelly Chen delivers the goods as resilient psychologist who wants to help her patient at any cost and ends up falling for him.The excellent story and wonderful acting performances culminate in a memorable climax that unchains a dramatic series of events. The final thirty minutes are filled with psychological tension and will keep viewers on the edges of their seats. The movie's conclusion will leave a lasting impression long after the credits will have stopped rolling.Infernal Affairs might not be without some flaws to be perfectly honest. Even though the movie's more intellectual approach is much appreciated, this film could have benefited from some more dynamic action scenes as one approach doesn't necessarily have to rule out the other. Some questions also fail to be answered throughout the film and especially the ending might leave room for interpretation. The latter flaw has eventually lead to two more movies in what ended up becoming a franchise, with the second film being as great as this original movie and the third flick being a tiresome disappointment by my standards.At the end of the day, Infernal Affairs deserves its international acclaim and convinces as intelligent thriller with strong emotional drama. The plot is clever, the characters are interesting and the acting performances are flawless by the entire cast. Just be aware that this movie invites its audience to put the different pieces of the puzzle together without providing all the answers and that Hongkong's typical action sequences are taking a backseat in this film.",

            "review_title": "Solid and fast-paced, but missing a lot of the characterizations that made The Departed excellent",
            "content": "I refused to watch Infernal Affairs before The Departed on the strict principle of not wanting to have anything ruined. It worked for the most part, and I ended up absolutely loving every minute of Scorsese's (finally!) Oscar-winning film. But there was still a big part of me that wanted to watch Affairs still, just for completist sake. And while it is a great movie, I cannot help but think that Scorsese's was stronger.Following much of the storyline of its American remake, Infernal Affairs opens with a brief bit with the reputed gangster Hon Sam (Eric Tsang) telling his newest young recruits that they will be his eyes and ears inside the police department. Flash forward a bit to cadet training school, where a young man named Yan is chosen to be an undercover cop inside the Triads, while Lau, one of Sam's recruits, stays behind and perfects his skills as a future officer. The film then jumps far ahead into the future, where Yan (Tony Leung) is now one of Sam's most trusted men, and Lau (Andy Lau) is now one of the department's most respected officers.From here, anyone who knows anything about The Departed can guess the cat-and-mouse hunting game that begins between Yan and Lau to see who can expose who first.While the storyline is very much the same (only with a whole lot less characters than The Departed has), the general feel and pace is much different. The film moves quickly, and is edited to the tune of a Michael Bay-style actioner. While the film does not have a whole lot of action taking place, but the intensity of the few moments that do have it make it feel like one. The film jumps quickly between moments, and those trying to remember when they happened in Scorsese's film will be a bit surprised by how early on a lot of it happens, and how barely any of it is dwindled on. I liked this to a point, as the film never overstayed itself to the point where it became bogged down with exposition like Scorsese's did more than a handful of times. But it also made for a whole lot less character moments, and even less backstory on any character in the film.The feel of the movie is a whole lot darker too. There is next to no shady comedic undertones like Scorsese had, and every shocking moment becomes even more shocking here. Hell, even the ending has an extra hint of darkness added to it. In a way, it enables this film to stand as its own experience, and feel more unique since it was not remade exactly in Scorsese's film.What I also noticed was that a few of the surprises or pieces that the audience had to put together in The Departed, were all blatantly spelled out for the audience here (even down to the subtitles pointing out that Lau was working for Sam, and Yan was working for the cops). Like I said, it ruins a few of the little things that made The Departed so riveting, but it also allows for the film to not suffer through the same minor plot holes that the remake did. This film also does away with the almost unnecessary addition of the love triangle with the psychiatrist. It was the single greatest weakness in The Departed, and here, both characters have their own female love interest. It helps solve that problem, but sadly, takes away any real character development for either of them.But this is a problem for all of the characters in Infernal Affairs. None of them really feel as developed or as three-dimensional as they do in The Departed. Yeah, the same struggles are taking place, and much of the same issues are taking place, but they do not feel anywhere near as thought-out as they do in the remake. Whether this is due to the break-neck pace or not, I am unsure, but a lot more could have been done to suggest what was really going on for some of these characters.While I liked Leung and Lau in their roles, I feel the exact same way I did after watching The Departed. Leung does a great job as the slowly deteriorating Yan, and brings a lot of messy emotions to the screen. At once, you can see just how much the undercover role is taking out of him, and just how badly he wants out. Lau however, gives the much greater performance. He is cold, menacing and uneasy all at once. He has a very solid, unwavering presence about him, and even at the worst of times, never shows the same fear that grips Matt Damon's counterpart in the remake. While I did like Damon better the first time I saw The Departed, subsequent watchings have diminished the impact his character made the first time. I can only hope that Lau's brilliantly reserved performance will stay just as strong when I watch the film again.Supporting turns from Tsung and Anthony Wong as SP Wong, the only man who knows Yan's true identity, are fairly well done. Despite being very important characters in the grand scheme of things, both have very little time to truly prove themselves on screen. Tsung does a better job here, but these two are probably who could have done with a lot more exposition. They also lack same edginess that complemented Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen in the remake, but they are well done nonetheless.On the whole, Infernal Affairs is a well-done film that was done even better in The Departed. It is a worthy watch for Lau's magnificent performance, and to see how the remake could have corrected itself. It is a solid piece of film-making that could have done with a few improvements, but is a worthy watch for anyone who loved Scorsese's film.7/10.",

The issues she raises in him could certainly have been explored more.However, the incidental meeting between Chan and his ex is the sort of thing that happens from time to time, and often sends you into reminiscence.

But this film scores for dept and emotional turmoil that the maker showed so beautifully. Unlike The Departed this film didn't had so much abusive language, violence or any intimating scenes. Instead this film rather had a more spiritual treatment.One scene that I want to mention is where SP Wong thrown from terrace and followed by confrontation with police.And then in the next scene Tony's friend who was gangster dies by the bullet of police.

            "content": "Andy Lau and Tony Leung are two giants in Asian cinema and they play opposites in this cop thriller which pits two moles against each other in a complex hierarchy of modern Hong Kong. They are extremely prolific actors because they are capable, which is disappointing because the direction doesn't always allow for them to emote and fully display the gravity of their situation. When Superintendent Wong's lifeless body hurtles down onto the streets, the score instantly turns sentimental and we are treated to black and white flashbacks of their previous scenes, of that connection to Chan's old life instantly severed. But we must be emotionally manipulated into feeling this. When Lau's girlfriend discusses her novel's main character's morality, the score again turns from the tense percussion of the earlier scenes to this soft sentimental piano piece. Her description of this character who is supposedly a good person but who does bad things is so painfully unsubtle that it takes away from this great script. There's an early scene that allows Lau and Leung to display their talent, one that is not in Scorsese's Departed. A simple occurrence of a man buying a stereo allows us to roughly gauge what sort of person Chan is, before revealing he in fact works for the mob. And that stereo of course returns with significantly more important implications. Many of the segments of the script were directly lifted for Departed, and that is an indication of their importance, and their effectiveness. The thematic narrative is just as effective in dreary and gritty Hong Kong as it is in the Irish Catholic underbelly of Boston. There's the drug deal that is monitored from both sides, the respective moles relaying information that is delicately balanced and edited. It's a tense scene which the score better services, a heavy percussion backing over this plucked riff that seems strangely Egyptian, but it works. The tragic climax is also pretty much the same; with the unveiling of the secondary rat in the police department and this execution from Lau to tie up all lose ends and maintain his cover. I am intrigued by one of Scorsese's additions in making the mob boss a corrupt informant himself. Eric Tsang plays the triad leader in Infernal Affairs, and is unfortunately miscast (as he is a primarily comedic actor), too short and too jovial to really be menacing, although the breaking of the cast was a great moment which also served as a red herring of sorts. When Lau executes his former boss here, it's the culmination of his continued undercover life and realising that perhaps this act will lead to a promotion and a more comfortable life henceforth. When Damon does so in Departed, it's because he discovers that the man he is working for is in turn crooked, and his entire life's work and philosophy collapses onto itself. Both work just as well, as do their respective fates, although Nicholson proves to be the difference. We feel saddened by the tragic end of Chan, and the various ways in which his identity breaks down bit by bit. There is a flashback again as he discovers that Lau is the mole, but this one is integral and provides us with even more tension. Infernal Affair's script is a great one, and an original one, even if it's direction and visualisation is not entirely subtle. I am reminded of some better scenes in the film which utilise secondary characters (that are not Lau's placeholder girlfriend) to reinforce those themes of identity, morality and agency (as well as those Buddhist sentiments of rejecting destiny and fate introduced in the beginning). Are we really who we are if we cease to act in that way? Chan runs into an ex girlfriend while going for a massage, an inexplicable encounter, but her face shows only hints of recognition. She comforts her young daughter and talks of her marriage, things that are infinitely out of reach for Chan. Later, he is the sole person who witnesses the other mole's death, Keung, in a dramatic scene where the actor's face is visibly melting with condensation and he speaks on edge. It might be clich\u00e9 to have someone utter such a confession before they die, but it's emotionally moving, because of the effective performance of that monologue, the yearning for a normal life that is mirrored in Chan's expression. In that penultimate meeting in the office, we agonise over the simple press of a button that erases a man's entire life. We know that Chan's life is over, a fact that he never is confronted with. Perhaps it is better that way.These moments are frustrating because they point to what could have been a great film if not for those over-dramatic death scenes, blatantly unsubtle exposition and unnecessary black and white flashbacks that connect the dots for the viewer as if they were a child. At that policeman's funeral, a teary Sum-Yee whispers to no one but the audience that she will dream of Chan just as he dreamt of her in those therapy sessions where they fell in love. Is this really necessary? But in saying that, we feel the same way for this fallen policeman.",

            "content": "though time has not been kind to it. Seeing as it was only released in 2002 the pace and style of the film feels dated. The film starts with an opening sequence that is never explained or referred to again. The audience is then thrown straight into a scene with many of the key characters, you don't learn their names or their beliefs only that Sam, (Eric Tsang) is the leader of the Hong Kong mob and he's basically a basted.After a brief speech a montage is set in motion, I found it very hard to figure out each character and what was going on. The movie flashes back to this sequence several times so I think it is important to make it simple to understand. It takes a good 15 minuets to get a basic grasp on what's going on. The first 20 minuets of the film is very fast paced. You are forced to lean a lot of back-story and character BIOS in short amount of time.As the film progresses you figure out who you are routing for though as the story goes the line between good and evil is blurred and you are given the message \"if a man does bad things for a good cause, is he a bad man or a good man?\" I found Eric Tsang's acting to be poor and almost annoying in his attempt to appear evil. he came across more as being a bit of a clown than a mob leader.The overall tone of the movie was dark and thought provoking but due to the movie being subtitled it is hard to follow the intricate details. The relation ship between Chen Wing-Yan (the cop undercover in the mob) and Superintendent Wong Chi-Shing to be believable and resembled a good friendship that is key for the story to affect the audience.I found this movie to have a good thought out plot and message that can be at times hard to follow. The character building was hard to follow due to it being a foreign film. Many of the actors were believable in their roles.

Maybe it's because I love Martin Scorsese. Maybe it's because my brain doesn't do well with the conventions of narrative structure in Asian cinema. Whatever the reason, I thought this a greatly inferior film.The central premise is very strong; Andy Lau is brilliant and creates a deeper, more conflicted and sympathetic character than Matt Damon; Eric Tsang creates a bizarre, but riveting, version of barely restrained insanity and violence; Hong Kong looks great.However, the story is so rushed, so full of blink-and-you-miss-it plot turns, that it becomes extremely confusing. Scorsese had the ability of controlling and shaping the complexity that Mak and Lau lack. I had to skip-back over several scenes, and even then I'm not entirely sure I would have been able to follow the plot without referring back to Scorsese's version. Confusion leads, in this case, to a lack of engagement and ultimately boredom. Not only is the story rushed through, but characters are sketched out in the most shallow terms.'The Departed' was one of my favorite films of the year and one that I could, and will, watch repeatedly over the years to come.

Edison Chen plays a young mafia member who is infiltrating the police force by joining the academy. Years later, their older counterparts (played by Tony Leung and Andy Lau respectively) race against time to expose the mole within their midst and destroy him. What is unique about this film (other than exposing corruption within our law enforcement) is that both men become so absorbed in their roles that they forget who they are. It becomes painful for them to continue the charade even when their bosses give accolades for their work. In the end, each longs to switch back and be in the other's place.This film isn't just a thriller and a race to see who will win. Ultimately, despite the end results, no one is a winner here. The film deals with the importance of honesty and identity. Ideally, if a person is honest with themselves and others around them, they can at least be at peace with who they are regardless of their place in life. Policeman or gangster; neither is a perfect life when none of it is true.I enjoyed the parallels between both men living different lives with both feeling lonely and trapped. The wife writing the story about a man with multiple personalities mimics the secret life of her hardworking \"cop\" husband.I think this is a topnotch story, however, it suffers from so many technicalities. One case in point, is the music. During one of the most dramatic scenes, they show an integral person die and then cue ridiculous, soap opera-type Chinese music. And I laughed. I do not think that was their intention, but that is what happened.The title itself doesn't make much sense. \"Infernal\" means damnable and \"Damnable Affairs\" is a mediocre title at best. It should have been aptly titled \"Internal Affairs\". \"Internal\" meaning it was dealing with law enforcement and gang activity by penetrating their defenses internally while the film subtly examines the internal effects of changing a person's external attributes such as name, career, family, appearance, etc., but I digress\u0085The love story between the gangster and the psychiatrist feels underdeveloped. She is on screen for all of 5 seconds and I cannot figure out why either loves the other without any disclosure of their personalities, likes, or dislikes. How did they connect on any level? This makes her action/reaction at the ending a bit corny and nonsensical.The sound (Dolby Digital 5.1) and film quality are good, but there is a huge problem with the subtitles. The film only offers Cantonese and Mandarin as the languages with no English dubs. The English subtitles flash quickly across the screen, so not only do I have to use my speed reading abilities to catch every word, I have to use my magical mental powers to also catch every action on screen and determine who is who in a film where the actors all look alike, swap places, and age many years. This gave me a migraine and I had to rewind several times since I missed a lot of the dialogue. This is a real shame. I think this took away from the viewing experience and the wonderful story that unfolded at lightening speed toward the end. I felt cheated. They need to re-release this film dubbed in English with better subtitles. Even the DVD cover (Miramax Version) makes no sense as it features a woman pointing a gun that isn't even in the film (!). If all of the flaws mentioned above were fixed, I could have easily have given this a Perfect 10. But alas, all is not well and it did not earn a 10.Favorite Quote: Wife in response to her story about a man with multiply personalities, \"I can't finish my story. Even though he is a good guy, he has done bad things. How do you think it should end?\" Husband replies, \"That is a good question\u0085\"DVD Extras: Disc 2 features (only in Chinese of course) the Story, Behind the Scenes, a Music Video, a Making of Featurette, Trailers, More Attractions, Cast Credits & Bios, Photo Gallery, and 1 hidden Easter Egg of Bloopers. Media Asia version is missing the Alternate Ending featured on the Miramax Home Entertainment version.Bottom Line: A very original and complicated story presented in a frustrating format.Rating: 8/10Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com",

            "content": "The opening act sets you up for the rest of the movie. Overdramatic but expected- some scenes weren't inherently comedic but were so serious it invited a laugh. Kinda adds to the narrative Asians are raised tough and held to high standards, like the flies in the desk scene at the beginning. Sorta reminded me of Hollywood gangster movies like the departed, which I've come to learn was based on internal affairs and also loosely on a real life Boston gang.In terms of the production quality like sound and visual effects, it's the same as many others from the time in china, so expect bullets that actually go pew when they fly. There isn't as much action as you'd expect with a premise like this but the suspense, tension and mystery make up for it. Story very well written, the twists and turns in the plot. I love that no one has the upper hand, the gangsters and the cops are equals. The endings might be similar but I think Infernal affairs' one feels more natural. One of the biggest differences that I'd say separates the too is in the departed, I feel like the viewer knows all the cards and just waiting to see how they fall and which of the characters in the movie to figure them out first, while in infernal it's slightly more of a mystery. Also, the love interests felt like a really unnecessary detail to the story in infernal affairs and weren't explained so felt like fustian additions, I think Scorsese did a better job at integrating them into the story. It's almost sad that his only major accolade was for a film that wasn't the original.I watched them in the wrong order so it feels very reminiscent of the departed even though this is the original, and you can see why Scorsese would remake this. I wouldn't recommend watching them subsequently, as even though I watched the departed months ago it's still fresh in memory, so watching one almost ruins the plot for the other. Hoping you aren't one of those who stay away from foreign films or subtitles because this is definitely worth a watch. Film wise the departed is arguably better, but this being the original elevates it for me.",

I lost the excitement in the midway. Nothing edge-of-the- seat about it! As there is little to be revealed, the climax is also quite obvious. However, the movie has an extended climax (if you agree) which is a little more effective. Buddha's message sits well with the intended message the director wishes to convey.

            "review_title": "Identity Theft",
            "content": "Infernal Affairs is the story of two undercover agents that infiltrate two opposing organizations and pretend to be people they're not. Inspector Lau infiltrates the police force posing as an officer of the law, but really is a spy working for a crime lord. Yan infiltrates the crime lord's gang posing as a crony, but really is a spy working for the police force. Given these premises, the film significantly comments on the nature of identity. In particular, the identities of both agents become convoluted as they dive deeper and deeper into their counterfeit worlds. The costume design really helps blur the line between their counterfeit identities. Whether cop or criminal, they both wear business suits along with everyone else. This suggests the idea that you can't tell who's who in an environment where everyone dresses the same. It also compliments one of the predominant themes of the film: the more you pretend the more you become. With this theme I'll now explore how it lives through the character transformation of Inspector Lau.Lau is a very peculiar character. Although he works undercover for a corrupt organization, he is far more rounded than a stereotypical crook. I never actually considered him to be a bad guy, just someone who was confused about how to be good. Unlike the people he works for, the viewer gets a glimpse into his personal life away from his corrupt job. The result: we identify and relate to his situation and are more sympathetic. His life apart from business consists of him moving into a new apartment with his girlfriend; he seems to treat her fairly well. His girlfriend plays a crucial part in the story in revealing who Lau really is. She is an author writing a story about a man with multiple personalities and who wakes up one day and forgets which personality he is. She struggles to figure out whether this character is good or bad, and so asks Lau if he would write the ending. This powerful plot point speaks on multiple levels\u0097one being that her story is a reflection of Lau's double life, another on how Lau takes fate into his own hands and becomes the author of his life, rather than a victim of circumstance.Lau struggles to keep control of his identity because somewhere inside him he yearns to be good. In fact, he yearns to be like his role model\u0097Yan. As the plot progresses, Lau finds himself responsible for the death of police boss, SP Wong. This is one of the first character beats in the story that suggests that Lau does not like the identity he has created for himself. He has pretended to be good this whole time but feels internally that he has deceived not just the police force, but himself. How does he respond? He takes fate into his own hands and kills his own crime boss, Sam. The decision to kill Sam is an act of redemption that implies that Lau is not who he used to be, and wants to \"turn over a new leaf.\" To connect his transformation to the theme of the story, consider how Lau really does become what he had pretended to be. By pretending to be good\u0097by Lau pretending to be a loyal cop\u0097he eventually became good\u0097he took down the crime organization. I think this is an incredibly powerful concept to not only understand, but to apply into one's life. It's as Aristotle once said, \"Be in reality as you wish to seem.\" By pretending to be what one isn't, a person slowly evolves into what he or she now no longer has to pretend to be\u0097they simply are! I think in one respect what makes a person good is his or her ability to mimic a righteous ideal; one that promotes merciful yet just behavior. I don't think Lau was always striving to achieve this principle of living, but he definitely shows the biggest turn around by divorcing himself from the corruption he used to swim in.",

            "content": "Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the Hong Kong action crime thriller Infernal Affairs (2002) and watching this movie after over 15 years, I still love it. The story is simple, there is a mole in the police department and there is an undercover cop who infiltrates the crime underworld. Their missions are the same, find intel and pass it onto their superiors that will affect both sides of the law. Soon both of these men's pathway cross and now must change their mission and that is to find out who is the mole and who is the undercover cop.The film begins with a Buddhist saying around Continuous Hell being the worst of the eight hells, which echoes throughout the movie of how men with common interests, even unknowingly, are to meet one day which may diverge their paths and whatever outcome is to befall each man, they will inevitably come together in the red circle. This movie is less than 2 hours and the momentum never stops, each scene is a gripping affair thanks to filmmaker, the writing and the acting.The movie may not offer enough in terms of spectacle but it's the impressive storytelling that eventually compensates for it in the end. This was remade within Hollywood, by one of the greats, Martin Scorsese's The Department, which in itself is a great movie. However, you cannot make comparisons with both of these films as this original is more resonant in an emotional and operatic sense. The narrative is simpler and easier to follow whereas The Departed had the character drama outweighing the overall plot, just a different aesthetic.The film doesn't have many massive shoot outs or gory action scenes but what it has is a consistent sense of tension that is enjoyable right up to the end. The direction is stylish and the music score is awesome, especially the song where both the main leads meet. The visual style of the film is beautiful where you see the ying-yang undertones contrasting each other and the rooftop scenes by using the glare and the reflections from the skyscraper windows - genius.The acting is awesome, you can tell this isn't your typical crime thriller, pretty much you have the two main men (as adults) meet face to face at the very beginning and end of the picture, when the mole Ming played by Andy Lau, buys some stereo speakers from the undercover cop Yan, played by Tony Leung, at a so-called stereo front business - and then there is the thrilling rooftop finale. The Mandarin song \"Forgotten Time\" is a reminder of Yan and Ming's initial meeting in that stereo store, which reappears later on in the story. Both actors do really well in trying to identify who they really are and trying to ensure they stay on course with their mission. This can be demonstrated when Ming's fianc\u00e9e who is a writer, is working on a novel where the leading character suffers from multiple-personality disorder, obviously she is covertly basing him on Ming, never guessing just how much of the truth she has intuited. This playful rendition of what is actually transpiring illustrates how each man has this identity dilemma which is a cop who worries that he is becoming a gangster and a gangster who dreams of being a real cop and a good man.Going back to that stereo scene, where it suggests that these two men are not only two halves of a single system but a symmetrical union where they sit and listen and appreciate to music that is playing which can be summed up \"in a word, transparent.\" The sense of balance between these characters infects them with an air of benevolence, despite the merciless cat and mouse game in which they are about to engage.The supporting cast are great, including Anthony Wong who plays Superintendent Wong and Eric Tsang who plays as the triad boss Sam, have a chilling confrontation in the police interrogation room, where both characters parallel each other's motives. However, the performances of Leung and Lau really anchor the film as both actors do well to convey the tortured psyches of each character with silent glances and facial expressions.Now there were parts of the film that I didn't like, for example I wanted more of Del Piero, the females in this movie felt one dimensional and this subplot of Yan's ex girlfriend who came out of nowhere and not telling Yan he actually has a daughter...why??? This serves no purpose but adding more sympathy of the character towards the end. Honestly shouldn't of being in the movie.Overall, you have this cat-and-mouse theme where both sides of the law are trying to outsmart the enemy and the paranoia of not knowing who the enemy is - within and without, gives you a compelling suspenseful drama - great movie 8.5/10.",

            "content": "Infernal Affairs is a film that has its roots in Hong Kong's historical and political background, and once this is understood, it adds many depths to the film. This play on double identity, and going undercover is related to how the people of Hong Kong struggle to find an identity as 'Hong Konger', as past colonial powers and the oppressive presence of China have large influences in hindering the formulation of their own identity.The acting is pretty great in this. Andy Lau has established himself as a very famous actor and singer. His acting is pretty good, but I kind of feel that his face gives off a pretty innocent and childlike aura. Tony Leung does a great job, and the film centralizes on him a little bit more I feel. We identify with him as he struggles to gain his identity back and the use of close ups of his facial expressions really convey his character's emotions. Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang also do a good job with their respective parts.The cinematography and editing are also pretty impressive. I really liked how they juxtaposed the younger versions of the two protagonists with their older selves at the end, that was cool. The many rooftop scenes are interesting as well, with fantastic shooting of the reflections in the skyscrapers.I also found the story to be very engaging. Of course undercover cops aren't anything new, but they aren't so common, plus there are two undercover characters and that makes the action twice as engaging. Also, since the film is heavily rooted in the country's background, that gives a local feel to it while still opening its doors to the international public. (It has been remade into a Hollywood film called, The Departed). Even though I have not watched the Hollywood remake, just by watching the trailer I know it will give off a totally different feel. I personally think the original will be better since then tension in this film is spot-on, while Hollywood just makes everything (mostly) into a swearing, bloody battle.My only critique is that the film jumps around sometimes from different timelines or in different spaces and that can be confusing. The story drifted a bit at times too, and there are instances in which events that occurred were questionable.Overall, an engaging film with great acting, cinematography and editing.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "content": "\"Infernal Affairs\" is the latest box office smash to make it\u00a1\u00afs way stateside. Unlike most films that Americans associate with Asian Cinema this is a film that emphasizes plot and acting over action. That\u00a1\u00afs not to say it\u00a1\u00afs a dull art house entry that will fly over most American\u00a1\u00afs heads. It\u00a1\u00afs biggest strength is it\u00a1\u00afs densely packed simplicity. A Hollywood version of this film would probably try to insert more plot twists which would detract from the acting, and intensity of the scenes that are already there. This is a film about morality and the consequences of ignoring it too long. It star\u00a1\u00afs two of Hong Kong\u00a1\u00afs biggest stars Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. Who despite their superstar status\u00a1\u00afs continue to make films that require more from them than pompous posturing. They are real actors and always a pleasure to watch.A film relying on suspense would probably be sufficient for most viewers, but \"Infernal Affair\u00a1\u00afs\" decides to take it\u00a1\u00afs chances and move further. It taps into the morality and ethical turmoil it\u00a1\u00afs characters face. They\u00a1\u00afve been doing their job\u00a1\u00afs so long that the lines aren\u00a1\u00aft so clear anymore. They\u00a1\u00afve both done things that they know go past ethical codes they once held. This is a intriguing conceit and when the film starts to play this card. It\u00a1\u00afs hard to figure out who\u00a1\u00afs the good guy and who\u00afis the bad guy. Obviously, the cop has more integrity, but the triad member also has his own demons to face.None of this would evoke sympathy from the audience. If it weren\u00a1\u00aft for the subtly powerful performances by both leads. Tony Leung Chiu Wai, plays the cop who\u00a1\u00afs holding his scrupulous ideals by the last thread. He is so buried under all the pressure and his inability to make contact with the outside world. His only connection to the world is his chief played by the wonderful Anthony Wong. His portrayal is flawless because it\u00a1\u00afs so hard to decipher his changing nuances. On the other side of the spectrum we have Andy Lau playing the triad who\u00a1\u00afs having to constantly manipulate his coworkers and bosses while at the same time presenting himself as an ethical cop. He\u00a1\u00afs also reached a point where his lies have become truths to him. Everything he knows himself for and his family and his friends know him for is a lie. His life is full of deceitful honesty. He has a beautiful girlfriend, a nice apartment, and plenty of admiring coworkers. But he\u00a1\u00afs the only one who knows about his illicit secret. He can\u00a1\u00aft tell anyone, because it would shatter everything he and they have come to understand. His conscience has reached a place of false illusions and he\u00a1\u00afs too scared to look past them. Andy Lau takes command of all these emotions and paints a tragic portrait of a ostensibly unlikable character.Despite the film\u00a1\u00afs number of positive qualities it does have a few minor mistakes. None more than the female leads who are severely underdeveloped. This doesn\u00a1\u00aft hurt the film, but it stands out like a sore thumb against the rich characterization of the two integral characters. However, forgoing that small gripe this film is fantastic. It\u00a1\u00afs one of the best and most sincere character driven films I\u00a1\u00afve had the joy of watching in a long time. I give it my highest recommendation and suggest you watch it before it is remade. (Brad Pitt has bought the remake rights) It was also recently purchased by Miramax for distribution in the states. So it might be hard to find since MiramAXE has a bad habit of purchasing films and not releasing them months and years at a time. Last, I checked though it was still purchasable at most import outlets as a special edition region free DVD. So, do yourself a favor and purchase one of the best films to emerge out of Hong Kong in years.",

Eight years on, does it still stand up as one of the finest achievements in contemporary Asian cinema?Infernal Affairs has certainly left a legacy, not just in the obvious cribbing of its visual and tonal stylings in Hong Kong/Asian cinema. As noted above, it formed the basis of Martin Scorsese's The Departed, which went on to worldwide success, as well as awards glory - in its wake came some pleasingly sophisticated crime dramas and thrillers, most notably and recently in the directorial work of Ben Affleck, whose Gone Baby Gone and The Town owe a clear debt to Scorsese's film and, by extension, to Scorsese's source, Infernal Affairs. To return to the very beginning of this retrospective, it was said upon its release that the original Infernal Affairs was a 'box office miracle' in Hong Kong - a little bit of that miracle was sprinkled over Hollywood, and it was the movie-going public that benefited. Superlatives are exhausted. See this film if you haven't already. JN",

This is a very smart crime/thriller that does not depend on gunplay to make it exciting.  As far as Triad films are concerned, it brings nothing new to the table.  However, the film was so tightly scripted and directed that I found myself glued to the screen the entire time I was watching it.  I must admit, I'm not exactly the sharpest person around, so I missed a few subtle things that were happening, and I had to backtrack, so to speak, in order to catch everything that was happening in particular scenes.  I have watched this movie twice now and I absolutely enjoyed it.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is bored of the usual Triad, big brother wanna-be gunplay flicks of old.",

            "content": "This is a really complicated story for me to understand, and it is because of the relationship between each characters in this movie is so subtle and complicated. The whole story shows us the people looking good may be a bad guy, and we have the right to choose the way to live, but we don't have the right to regret. You need to be responsible for what you did, and this is why Infernal Affairs is my favorite movie. Chen would be a good policeman siting in the office, but he was chose to be an undercover as a bully. Liu used to be a bully, but he was chose to be an undercover as a policeman. A \"bully\" helped policeman to destroy triad all day, and a \"policeman\" helped bad people escape from the punishment. Finally the \"bully\" was dead, and the \"policeman\" got promoted. This was the hell they lived. The best part for this movie was its lighting effect. When you watched this movie, you can easily notice that it was from Hong Kong. It used very typical Hong Kong movie lighting style to perform the whole story. For example, the dark light was through the whole movie. Every place was black, brown and gray. Why the director chose to use dark light? It was because of the story, a story of hell. The undercover was the secret, and just as the word \"undercover\" told us. They couldn't be exposed to the sun. The dark relationship was main idea of the movie, and this was why the director chose dark light. The second technique that the director used was the background music. I had to say that the music in Infernal Affairs was the most moving sound I had ever listed. For example, when Sir. Huang fell off the music called the lost time came out. Just as the name of the song, the time had lost. Cheng had been an undercover for 10 years, and Sir. Huang was the only one who knew Chen's really identity. Now everything had gone. Their secret, relationship between Cheng and Sir Huang and the justice, everything under the cover lost. The music echoed in Cheng's mind, and he knew that he became a complete real bully without Sir. Huang. He lost himself. This was also what the film wanted to tell us. We may get lost in the life we choose, but the important thing is that to find the way to get back. Look at the name of the film, Infernal Affairs. Life is a kind of hell, there is a lot ways to spend your lives. You have your rightness to choose where you want to go, but you need to pay for what you do during this trip. Everyone may get lost in their trips. If you find the way to get back, it is too late. However if you don't, the only place you can stay is the hell.",

In the beginning two lead characters appear by different actors and soon change to Andy Lau and Tony Leung, but after that the plot is simple and strong.Andy Lau's acting is most impressive. The expression on his face gives this movie a tension and color. The process Lau's internal struggle grows through coping with Yan could be described much deeper if the lines are more carefully elaborated. There were two points I could not understand well: 1) What is the role of Yan's former girlfriend? Who knew her in the police when Yan was honored as a police hero? Was she recorded as his wife? 2) In the beginning Sam brings his freshmen to a temple where he gives them instruction. Is it only Lau who was ordered to infiltrate to the police? B says he was sent by Sam almost the same time. Didn't Lau know it?",

The plot is easy to understand so for all you action junkies, you still get your daily dose, but what is good about this film is that it is the same material that influenced the making of The Departed. So it is a great piece of Asian drama/action.There is some great acting from the part of the cast, action set-pieces are also well done and of course the pace is well set. Do not push this aside simply because you have seen The Departed, this is what started it all. Both the future IA 2 and 3 as well as The Departed.",

There were three main problems i had with this film, firstly the concept was good but the implementation was flawed, secondly a lot of the supporting characters did not seem to make a positive contribution to the film, and last, the ending was just plain awful (\"a nice neat happy ending\" TM). For some reason this film reminded me more of a cheesy Indian film than the usual Hongkong style flicks. It just oozed cheese all the way throughout mixed with some mild drama and instantly forgettable sequences. not sure why it got such a high rating here, maybe people feel that just because there are a lot of good hongkong films, then they all must be good, or maybe they are just being fanboys and ignoring the boredom induced coma you have to pull yourself out off when you realise the film is over. i definitely would not recommend people buying/renting it but if you see it on cable its passable.",

However, I think the quality of a thriller depends on its story, and I found the one here, despite of the promising initial idea, not especially exciting. Even the rare action scenes and shoot-outs (that have always been a strength in Hong Kong cinema) were a let-down. I have to say that this film feels hardly like a genuine Hong Kong movie, if you think back to the Golden Age of Hong Kong films in the eighties and nineties, but more like a Hollywood \"High Concept\" film: \"We have a great idea to get the attention of the audience, but no great script, so let's cover it up with production value and people will still queue up to give us their money\". As this film's success proves, the formula works. \"Wu jian dao\" is by no means a bad movie, it keeps you entertained very well; but due to its mediocre story this ambitious thriller-drama became neither an outstanding thriller nor an outstanding drama.",

It's fast paced, intense and well played. I found the slightly noir filming very effective. The use of music is sparse but appropriate.Not the usual violence galore we see in a lot of Asian films, Infernal Affairs is a relevant and intelligent story about the fate of persons who set out from the same starting point but follow different paths in life and end up on opposing teams in a complex web of lies and deceit. You constantly feel an escalating sense of foreboding as the characters' real identities and sympathies are uncovered.What a refreshing relief from the sentimental drivel Hollywood churns out (not trying to neglect some of the work of giants like Liman, Coen, Scott, Verhoven, Spielberg, Coppola, De Palma, Burton, Mann ... ;-). Unlike most Hollywood productions, Infernal Affairs doesn't rely on irrelevant eye candy and endless good-vs-bad-end-of-level-fights to be interesting. Just a good setting, a well crafted storyline and believable acting.I strongly urge you not to let this kick ass cop flick get away. Out of 10, this is a solid 8.",

Kudos also goes to Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang as the mentors of the two leads. It has elements of violence in this film but nowhere near the levels of the old \"Heroic Bloodshed\" movies of the late 80's and 90's as it is a character driven movie, the action is through the tension and suspense.

It is a good movie no question about it, but to think its \"great\", \"the greatest\", etc. you got to be a real fan of Andy Lau. He delivers an \"OK\" performance although its actually Tony Leung trying to keep the movie together. The best thing about the movie is the ending - well balanced, well paced and - for a few minutes - quite convincing. Nonetheless, few problems remain. First, the story is not that original, its a new variation on the classic \"mole\" plot already present in many other HK movies. You can't stop comparing and, well, some of them were better IMO. Second - and more serious, it demonstrates a popular contempt toward viewers IQ (well, OK, that contempt may be sometimes justified but still...). I don't mean standard \"fairytellness\" that has certain charm. There are simply several moments and threads that are just ridiculous, with the very main one (minor SPOILER ->) does HK police really has only about 10 officers, so when they know there is a mole within this small group, they still have to assign to one of the suspects the task of finding the mole's identity? People, that is soooo crazy... There are quite a few other flaws - like both moles could have been easily discovered few times etc. Still the movie is very enjoyable, real fun to watch, acting is decent, music is very good, cinematography good - sometimes excellent, so altogether a solid B grade - 8 points.",

That's what you would be expecting in Infernal Affairs or in Chinese - Wu jian dao which boasts a star-studded cast, that includes Sammi Cheng, Kelly Chan, Edison Chan, Eric Tsang, Shawn Yu and Anthony Wong Chau Sang. However the two whom I mentioned earlier are of course Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai who are the main story line builders of this movie.The movie is about Yan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) who is a police undercover in the Triads while Ming (Andy Lau) is in the reversal of a triad undercover in the police department. Leading parallel but opposite lives, both feel the tremendous pressure as well as stressfully trapped in their false and increasing dangerous surroundings. Both have been walking on the thin fatal line until on one fateful evening they finally meet each other. On the other hand, both the police and the Triads have knowledge that there's an undercover amongst them and the chase is on as they compete who would 'dig' out their `mole' first.If you felt a similarity sort of characters' plot in this movie then you would have to recall an early 90s release called `Don't Fool Me' which incidentally also starred both Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai (as well as Anthony Wong too). In `Don't' both also switched and reversed their character roles too. However don't get me wrong, as both movies have totally no connections. Somehow or rather I just feel peculiar as why the two actors can't have a totally fresh movie story line to perform whenever they are cast together. Anyway, Infernal Affairs provided an opportunity for a happy reunion of the 2 heartthrob actors cum old-time buddies for their fans and viewers to catch a glimpse of how much they have \"matured\" since the video days of \"The Duke of Mount Deer\".The realistic of the movie aside, overall the story of the movie is quite unusual as well as unexpected too. Well these days, movie buffs just can't expect for total perfection so what else to ask for when you have such a heavyweight load of casts in a single movie for this coming Season's Greetings.",

I can't discredit this movie for being an intelligent police story but don't expect an old school Chow Yun Fat action movie like I did. I recommend watching this movie as long as you take it for what it is. like a john Woo movie, but don't expect so well made like \"Face Off\". I found this movie to have a good thought out plot and message that can be at times hard to follow. Many of the actors were believable in their roles, I thin \"The Departed\" is a remake of this movie.",

            "content": "Granted this movie is one of the better one that comes out of Hong Kong, but it is still falls short of the hype that surround it.  It is a decent watchable movie if you don?t care for character developments or plots. The energy of the movie comes from its editing, great cinema photography coupled with sound effect.  For example, the pointing of the gun at Andy Lau at the rooftop was intercut with three different shots accompany by some strong sound effect.  Another good example is where the police were trying to catch the crime boss in the beginning of the movie,  the excitement of that scene was helped tremendously by the tight editing.  No doubt enormous craft has been put into the movie, which excels in visual style.However, like majority of Hong Kong movies, the dialogue of this movie is flat and merely serves to advance the plot.   The confrontation in the conference room after the death of the inspector is too contrived, and worse still, too conventional.  There is not a single good line that stand out to illustrate the emotion and inner thought of the participants in that room at that sorrowful moment.The women roles in the movies are meaningless and one dimensional.  I could not believe Kelly Chan as a shrink for one second, and what is the purpose of bringing in Tony Leung?s ex-girl friend ?  Sammy Cheng?s role as a novelist is merely a plot so that she can utter something profound like deciding to be a good guy or a bad guy.  It seems the writer feels there is a need to remind the audience that Andy Lau is facing a dilemma in the movie.The holes in the plot are too numerous to mention here.  Case in point, during the hostage scene at the end of the movie,  how come not a single cop is ever seen ?Spoiler Warning !!  Why would Andy Lau kill the crime boss ?  It is totally out of character.   It seems to me the screen writer do not want to take the risk of putting a famous actor to play a villain.  I also find the ending where the writer informs us that Tony Leung is reinstated as a policeman posthumously laughable.  The movie makers feel compel to resolve everything toward the end and enforce a happy ending.",

It was harder to follow along that the Departed. But I was told that if I watch the three movies following Infernal Affairs, everything would become clearer. I guess I have to watch the next three sequels and see if they clear up everything. That's also less action that I expected. I do recommend this if you watched the Departed already.

It can be seen and enjoyed on different levels, depending on your cultural or intellectual dispositions.This movie is as the same time a witty cop/villain movie, a human character study and a philosophical (even religious) tale.The movie never judges any of the characters. Nor does it ever impose anything on you. the back-story is subtly told and can be easily missed if you don't understand or guess the allusions, though the yin-yang characters are pretty obvious. But even this is toned down by the shabby looks and violent behavior of the \"good guy\" vs the neat looking, polite and efficient \"bad guy\".I'm afraid my European background made me miss some points, but i love this film so much that i watched it many times (something i rarely do). The icing on the cake is that even when you know the whole plot, you still appreciate watching it again, and even can discover things you have overlooked on previous viewings...One word about the actors... Tony Leung, Andy Lau, Anthony Wong, Eric Tsang, Edison Chen, Shawn Yue, Sammi Cheng, Kelly Chen, Chapman To, Lam Katung, Elva Hsiao (not to mention Francis Ng, Leon Lai, Carina Lau, Daoming Chen in IA II & III) What a cast !!All of them know how to play (well, maybe not Edison Chen...) and they play well.A special mention to Tony Leung and Anthony Wong. There is no doubt the movie wouldn't be that strong with any other at their place, and the crucial middle movie scene wouldn't have that emotional impact on the viewer.Those two guys carry the whole movie on their shoulders, they're not playing cops, they're human beings, with their contradictory emotions, their mistakes, their somewhat unfulfilled lives unraveling before us. Andy Lau, though great throughout the movie, cannot compete with them. But i have to admit that the third episode it fully his.So just see it, but see it with eyes and mind open.",

            "content": "With the recent popularity of the martial arts movie, Infernal affairs is a refreshing slice of police drama that deserves more attention. Gangster films of old, the better tommorrow's or the young and dangerous series seem to be distant memory and the eastern cinema that prolifrates our market in the west is the kung fu flick layden with bile enducing special effects or the recent spate of eerie horror's waiting in the wings for their predestined hollywood remake. (which will ultimately tarnish their otherwise impecable repetations) but now Hollywood is turning it's sights on to the respected output of the east, it's crime thrillers. Infernal affairs is not an untouchable work of genius, it has holes like any narrative. but it is a superb example of what the East can produce with a modecome of self restraint. No special effects, no slow-mo gunplay, in fact most of the violence is played out of scene, but still within earshot. these people live in the information era, they have lifes and lies, deception is the game. this is just solid drama played out by solid performances. Anthony Wong is understated and cool,(at times you still want to see him explode as in Beast cops or bunman,) Tony Leung is his usual mean and moody self and but it is Andy lau's performance that really shines. A powerhouse performance underneath such a cool exterior, you'll be lucky to see him flinch, yet he protrays such intensity, constantly he plays his cards close to his chest, caught up and confused losing himself in the facade he has created. Truly excellent. so we hear of a remake in the offering, brad pitt's name attached. may be okay, then again. well if they destroy this like they did to john Woo, tsui hark, Chow yun Fat, that horrorible ring remake, jackie chan, jet li and countless others there may be an undercover agent infiltrating hollywood, out to whack a few head honcho's.",

The tight,focused story and a fantastic background score make for an exhilarating movie-watching experience and the tension on the screen is almost palpable.

To me personally, this movie surpasses 'The Departed', its American remake, in that there is a much stronger emotional connection with the two lead characters played superbly by Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai here unlike 'Departed', whose execution, while felt clinical was nevertheless cold and detached. While Lau's character is the obvious bad guy, I still could not help but root for him too. And this speaks volumes about the level of humanness that Lau brings to the role of such a flawed character. Overall, this ranks among the very best HK films and indeed, among the greatest crime-thrillers ever made.",

Tony Leung always delivers his characters with such depth and charisma. He's delivers a completely believable, yet not wallowing in self pity performance that's just becoming so typically a Tony Leung character.Anthony Wong, is well, his usual. He's always the cool, in control dude in the movie. He doesn't overdo his lines, and performs with such restraint and control that's really admirable.Andy Lau turned in a commendable performance too, but he should stick to acting and stop his infernal singing.I can't wait to see the prequel, Infernal Affairs 2, and the sequel - Infernal Affairs 3 (though I can't imagine what there is left for a sequel).",

The genre has been played out desperately, but the way Leung and Lau show their characters' torment and struggles with morality, it makes it easy to forget. I recommend this film to anyone.

One is HK Cantonese, the other in Mandarin.From reading the comments, most people have seen the HK version.  I have seen both.  And, in my opinion, I like the ending in the Mandarin version better.",

Friend brought a dvd from London and as i do like Asian movies i thought why not? after first few minutes i didn't regret, honestly i could say i drown into the movie. well, honestly i expected some kind kung-fu flying movie (which i love anyway) and to my surprise i got the very best and intelligent movie with smart screenplay, very fine plot, great actors, unexpected end. no wonder the movie got eight awards in Hong Kong Movie Festival. so if you want to see good police drama you will probably love that one. enjoy!",

Sometimes IMDB250 is somebody's Bible,I also think a lot of it.So I hope you can be worthy of the name. At last,the original edition is trilogy,just like the Load of the Ring and so on.If you are a really movie lover,you should see the original to compare.We can't bury a treasure,can we? I don't come here to suppose Chinese movie,but I suppose the great movie! a sincere movie fans",

            "content": "Two things bothered me in an otherwise excellent movie:1. Getting different actors to represent the same person in their teens and a dozen years later. People simply don't change that much nor do the choice of actors reinforce that similarity2. For all the high tech wizardry shown by the police force as well as the precautions taken for radio and phone silence, why didn't anyone just check the handphone logs of every key player to connect the dots. All the characters were using their handphones almost indiscriminately.Great to see HK reinventing itself with such fine filmmaking.",

            "content": "This Hong Kong film is very lucky. I don't know how he got its cult status. It's one of the mysteries of humanity for me.Oh yeah, it have good ideas, a good story. But the production is highly amateurish. The editing, omfg, it seems like that the idiot responsible to that wasn't worried to make a fast, to gave unity that this film needs. He was most interested in break the 5 cuts per second. Result: it's almost impossible to see any character development. It's almost impossible to watch the movie.I don't know how I could finish it. The screenplay is very weak, really. During the first half hour you only gets that those two are undercover guys, because the happenings are so poor that seems that it never happened. It's nothing developed. It's just the screenplay \"say\" something that the nasty editor cut to another sub-story, and leave that first one without the strength that it needs.The directors have unbelievable moments like some inconvenient slow motions, and ridiculous flashbacks. And the soundtrack, jeez. It has good moments, yeah, like in the opening titles but... during the picture, the music is just like on Cartoon Network series The Powerpuff Girls. When it's not those two options, it's a sad theme for a sad moment, a romantic theme for a (ridiculous) romantic moment, etc etc.The film has a good story, good characters (Tony Leung seems to work very hard). But all of this for a fast-100 minute production. No problem in that. The problem is the amateurish of the production, that makes me thought if I wasn't mistaken watching the teaser.",

            "content": "This movie came out 9 years ago, and stunned the Hong Kong cinema with its great cinematography, overwhelmingly great performances, ashtonishing soundtrack, and just a CLEVER and intelligent story to tell.9 years ago I watched the movie, and now today, 9 years later I watched the movie again, and the movie surprised me again with new inventive clues, twists, and even more dept in the characters.From start to end, every scene is as breathtaking - compare the use, the expertise with colors and the colourpalet with Zhang Yimou's Hero, or Wong Kar Wai's repertoire - every scenery is truly an artwork - look at the long shots, look at the styling.So why do I love this movie - to start with the intensity of the actors. Tony Leung, as always has the quality to render every possible emotion with credibility and intensity. Andy Lau speaks his eyes, and strong and sharp gestures. The scene is the audio shop is a true classic as we see our protagonist and antagonist (however.. this is the discutable part - who is the true good guy and bad guy;) meeting in an ambiance with no offence - SHARING on the surface their passion for music (and as we shall discover, they even share more roles then they could imagine). I would say that this scene is as classical as the openingsscene of Inglourious Bastards where we would meet the superb Christoph Walz creating this suspense you want to bite your nails off.How to determine whether you are watching a great movie is to 'watch' the pace of the movie - as I can say; the pace of the movie is fast - the story unfolds smoothly and gives you an indept insight into human nature.Are there any minor points- there are: the roles of Kelly Chen of Sammi Cheng are slightly redundant, as they - particularly Kelly not so effective - play the love interests of the main characters. Where as I do appreciate Sammi as a singer, she doesn't seem to be able to deliver versatile performances.The soundtrack is literally sublime as it manages to transcribe the aimed emotions. Recall scene in the audio store, as Inspector Wong hit the car and when Tony is shot in the head.I definitely would rate this movie a 10, as you can list this movie along with Wong Kar Wais Chung King Express - Zhang Yi Mou's Hero - as it is both an important piece of art, insight into human psychology, the ever intriguing balance and quest of evil and bad, and reference to Hong Kong culture.",

            "content": "Infernal Affairs is not simply an action movie. In fact, there are few bullets and fights, but more tension than ever. It tells the story of cops and triads, that both of them has its own secret agent in its rivals. The tension was built when the police and the triad society both realised there were someone who spoiled their own secret plans. The performance was excellent. Anyway, it is the script that have brought the movie to a higher level. Firstly, the exciting movie did not only entertain us, but messages were delievered. When the movie was shown in Hong Kong in Dec 2002, it has started a wide discussion of the movie. From the medias to religionous leaders, all the HK people are talking about the movie. In fact, the movie's gross box office was more than 700 million US dollars, more than that of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets(about 500M) and Hero(about 350M), being the most popular in 2002. A US movie production company has bought the rights to shot a US's Infernal Affairs. It is really a great movie. As the only way to prove it is to watch it, I hope Infernal Affairs can be shown somewhere else soon to prove its quality!",
