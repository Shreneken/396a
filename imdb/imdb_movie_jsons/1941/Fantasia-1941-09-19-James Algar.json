            "content": "There cannot be one verdict on \"Fantasia\".  There must be eight: one for each of the seven segments, and an eighth for the film as a whole - for, varied though the seven segments are, they undeniably belong together. And, alas, space does not permit me to lay out all eight verdicts.  I shall have to confine myself to details representative of the whole.  At any rate, I shall try.We learn the modus operandi of \"Fantasia\", the linking theme, in the second segment - an abridged version of Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker\" suite. (Missing are the overture and the march.)  Tchaikovsky's ballet involves anthropomorphising inanimate things, plus the odd tiny animal.  So does Disney's \"Nutcracker\".  But Disney has thrown out the particular details. The Chinese Dance is danced by mushrooms (who look, but are not, Chinese); the Arabian Dance by \"Arabian\" goldfish; the Russian dance by \"Russian\" thistles and orchids.  Sometimes it goes further: \"Waltz of the Flowers\" shows two entire changes of seasons, with leaves, fairies, seed pods, seeds, snowflakes - everything but flowers.  But in ignoring the letter of the instructions Disney is perfectly true to the spirit.  Indeed he is more true to the spirit than the original ballet - for, let's face it: stage ballet is a degenerate and over-formalised art, which makes some of the world's most exciting music dull as wallpaper.  Disney's amazing images express Tchaikovsky's sense of motion more than earthbound dancers ever could. This, one feels, is the kind of thing ballet music was TRULY designed for. The same goes to a lesser extent for the other two pieces of ballet music on the program.This basic device - ignoring explicit instructions, but remaining true to the spirit - is carried through into every segment.  (Some segments are better than others, but none can be called a failure.)  Dukas's \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" has been turned into a Mickey Mouse cartoon - but it's the best Mickey Mouse cartoon ever made; and we realise that the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice is really the archetype that all of the best Mickey Mouse cartoons had been  reaching towards, all along.  The Pastoral Symphony adheres to Beethoven's program but moves everything from the woods of Central Europe to a dreamland from classical mythology.  (The second movement - the section with the courting centaurs - is a failure.  For once the spirit as well as the letter of Beethoven is ignored.  Unfortunately some critics cannot see beyond this movement to the superb interpretations that flank it on either side.)I doubt that so much genuine creative work has gone into a film, before or since - even if you don't count the contributions made by the composers. What's my favourite film?  I really don't know.  But if you tell me that I must sit in a large dark cinema for two hours; and ask me what I would like to occupy my eyes and ears over those two hours, I would answer, without hesitation, Fantasia.",

            "content": "In 1940, Walt Disney released \"Fantasia\", the third feature of his studio and maybe his most ambitious project, with a beautiful combination of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski and animation. The result is a movie that has been worshiped by every generation. Yesterday I saw \"Fantasia\" again, now on the Special 60th Anniversary Edition DVD, restored and remastered with audio in THX inclusive with intermission. The program, for those that have eventually never seen or want to recall, is composed by the following: (1) Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.(2) Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.(3) The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas.(4) Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky.(5) Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack.(6) The Pastoral Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven.(7) Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli.(8) Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky.(9) Ave Maria by Franz Schubert.My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Fantasia\"",

            "review_title": "Unusual & Very Creative",
            "content": "This unusual and very creative classic of animation combines a very interesting idea with quite a bit of imagination, plus visual effects that still hold up quite well. All but a couple of the sequences are quite enjoyable, and some especially so. Even the segments that don't work as well are usually at least interesting, since you can at least appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.You don't really have to be all that familiar with the specific pieces of music for it to be worthwhile, since in several cases they chose to match the music with material that is rather different in nature from any original context that it may have had. And in any case, the animated sequences are intended to provide the context, in terms of the movie.No doubt, everyone will have his or her own favorite segments, based on the music itself and on the choice of accompanying visual material. The \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" sequence, with Mickey Mouse, is certainly one of the most memorable. The adaptation of \"The Rite of Spring\" is quite imaginative in using an entirely different setting for the music. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" has striking and sometimes bizarre visuals.Many of the classic Disney features still hold up well as family entertainment, but \"Fantasia\" is unique for its combination of imaginative concept and visual creativity. Not every minute of it works, but that's the price of being willing to experiment. It's an enjoyable and satisfying feature that well deserves to be remembered.",

            "content": "This is one of the truly rare, one of a kind movie going experiences, kind of in the same league as watching 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  I like to watch this film repeatedly;  often times I'll just close my eyes and daydream, letting my own imagination go in place of whats on the screen.  My favorite part is the opening sequence, with its dramatic music and free flowing imagery foreshadowing the state of the world in 1940.  The end of Ave Maria is the perfect bookend to this masterpiece; death has withdrawn and peace has finally arrived.  It would, but not for another five years and millions of lives.  I can never watch this movie without seeing it in this context; for me its a work of art, both a part and ahead of its time.",

            "content": "Fantasia is so educational, and I was gob smacked by how well the animation mixed with the classical music. Can I also say that Leopold Stokowski is one of the best conductor of the 20th century, right on a parallel with Herbert Von Karajan? I was listening to Sibelius's 5th symphony a few years back, and he conducted it the year before he died, and he was in his 90s. Not only that, but that was the best version of that symphony I had ever heard. Back to Fantasia then. Each piece was expertly introduced by Deems Taylor, and unlike its sequel didn't take too long.(Even the soundtrack vignette was interesting) In the sequel, almost half of the film felt like too much introduction and not enough music. Fantasia rectified that problem brilliantly: 1. Bach's Toccata- Brilliant silhouettes of the orchestra, and then masterful abstract images. The orchestra played the piece to a phenomenal standard, and I hate to say this, but I actually prefer the piece orchestrated. It was originally written for organ, you see. The best thing about Stokowski is that you see him conducting without a baton, which is exceedingly clever.2. Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker- I recommend you see the ballet, because it is a knockout. This is coming from a classical music lover. The animation was superb in this vignette. The most impressive thing though was the fact that the finishes immediately went into the next scene, without it being hackneyed. The waltz, or Dance of the Snow Fairies, was the highlight of this vignette, reminding me so strongly of Christmas.3. Dukas's Scorceror's Apprentice- The most famous vignette, is the only vignette to feature in the sequel. YenSid(Disney backwards) has a magic hat, which he leaves lying around, and Mickey Mouse picks it up, and encounters various problems. the animation is very good here, and while I'm not a huge fan of the piece, I still found it enjoyable.4. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring- This is the only reason why the movie isn't a 10. This vignette is far too long It's longer than the Beethoven. It is an interesting subject, dinosaurs, but the ballet wasn't simplified enough. This was boring, and was better left out. It was only here to give some historical context. However, there was beautiful animation and some lovely instrumental solos. Stravinsky hated what the film did to his work, but anyway I don't like Stravinsky much. I had no problem with the animation or the way it was performed, it was just too long. 5. Beethoven's pastoral Symphony- This is a fantastic piece of music. I am a huge fan of Beethoven, and I have all his 9 symphonies on my IPod. My favourites are this, the Choral and the Eroica. I loved the fact that they chose a Greek mythological setting, because it looked gorgeous. My dad who is a conductor wasn't keen on the centaurs, but I loved the winged horses, Bacchus and Zeus (who competes with Chernabog as the most frightening character of the movie). This vignette was so relaxing to watch; think it as like reciting a poem.6. Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours-This was the funniest vignette of the film, and one of the many gems of Disney. It was a bit unrealistic of course, but it was fun. At first, I was worried that the most famous scene from the opera La Giaconda, would be ruined by the animation. But it wasn't. It was perfect. Even the elephants and hippos, considering their size, danced so elegantly, I was shocked. This vignette is a must-see if you want some comedy.7. Mussorgsky's Night on Bare Mountain- Now this was my personal favourite, as when I first watched it when I was 10, and I was terrified of Chernabog. The music is also very hard to play, as the mood is very hard to capture, but this is undoubtedly the finest recording of this music. Chernabog was genuinely frightening, and a masterful creation. And the animation, while dark, matched the music, which is enough to give you nightmares, flawlessly. It was very like a Witch's Sabbath, which was what the composer originally intended. Do you know, that for his underrated fantasy movie Legend, Ridley Scott based Tim Curry's Darkness on Chernabog? Children may find it a bit too frightening, and adults may find it inappropriate, as there is a tiny glimpse of nudity. But it was still an effective vignette, and one of my favourite Disney moments actually. 8. Schubert's Ave Maria- This is a beautiful song, and Stokowski did it justice. The harmonies and animation were perfectly captured. how could you say this was boring? The animation couldn't have been happy looking, it would have completely ruined the mood of the song. It was beautifully sung by Juillietta Novis, who was so quiet that you had to turn the volume up, but that was the intention. The thing that impressed me most, was the complete contrast of this from the Mussorgsky, so the key of Ave Maria was so well chosen. (It is sung in many different keys.) In conclusion, the most underrated of the earlier Disney efforts, is well worth watching and a true animated classic! Also I was offended by the review that said that it was the worst movie ever made, and that the people who love this movie need new taste, that is plain insulting to anyone who grew up with this film. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "review_title": "The Mousetro's greatest achievement. Fantasia WILL amaze ya. (Possible SPOILERS.)",
            "content": "Fantasia is the most amazing animated movie I have ever seen. It may not have the humor of Finding Nemo, nor the simple message of Dumbo. It's so different from anything else the House of Mouse ever created. But it may well be the best. It's a collection of short subjects with little or no plot, but what makes the compilation unique is that it's all matched to classical music, beautifully conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and bridged by live-action footage of the silhouettes of an orchestra, narrated by Deems Taylor. Besides these sequences, there isn't a word of dialog.Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: This is nothing but an abstract piece of animation. You see the strings of the cello, the violin, and lots of stripes and shapes that leave trails of color in their wake. Magnificently matched to the music. There's not really that much to explain, just images.The Nutcracker Suite: An ode to nature based on Tchaikowsky's six dances. Each dance is performed by the most unlikely dancers. Fairies, goldfish, thistles and many more perform the dances, but best of all is Art Babbit's Chinese Dance sequence, with mushrooms. The highlight of the sequence is Hob Low, a little mushroom who seems to lag behind the rest of the impeccable act. Brilliantly animated by Babbit, one of the best sequences in the movie. The Sorcerer's Apprentice: An old story starring Mickey Mouse and the intimidating wizard Yen Sid (guess what that spells backwards!), matched to Dukas' symphony. This is without a doubt MM's greatest performance. The animation, especially Ugo O'Dorsi's brilliant effects, is impeccable. Funny and dramatic at the same time, everyone who's ever heard of Mickey Mouse should see The Sorcerer's Apprentice.The Rite of Spring: Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre was originally meant to signify prehistory, but Disney has taken it much further than a series of old tribal dances. The Rite of Spring starts out at the dawn of the planet, zooming in on our tormented home, spewing lava and rocks. Powerful scenes of the elements that ran amok, without utilizing computers at all (well, they hadn't been invented yet). Then, we skip to the beginnings of life, from the life and death struggle of big bacterium vs. little bacterium. Skip to the dinosaurs, and the constant tyranny of the tyrannosaurus. Many powerful dramatic scenes, beautifully set to the music, until desertification, starvation, a tidal wave and an earthquake wipes out the dinosaurs. Marvelous. One of the best shorts in animation history.The Pastoral Symphony: Ludwig Van Beethoven's masterpiece, instead of portraying the countryside, takes place in a mythological setting. From Pegasus' family, and the adventures of the little black Baby Pegasus. Next movement revolves around the attempts of a bunch of butt-naked baby cupids trying to bring together single centaurs and centaurettes. Next, the exploits of the amorous and extremely drunk Bacchus and Jacchus, who join in the centaurs' wine-making. But all is interrupted by Zeus, who chucks lightning bolts at the lot till he's bored. Next movement, and order is restored, the sun sets, and Diana fires a comet into the sky. Wonderfully animated, and perfectly matched to great music.The Dance of the Hours: Ostriches, elephants, hippos and alligators dance to Ponchielli's ballet, in a nobleman's castle, revolving around the leader of the gators, Ben Ali Gator's crush on Hyacinth Hippo. Beautifully animated, wonderful comic relief amidst a storm of serious art. It would've been just as successful as a short cartoon. Hilarious!A Night On Bald Mountain and Ave Maria: One word: Chernabog. You have to see it to believe it. IS Bald Mountain REALLY a mountain? No, it's the crouching figure of Chernabog, a demon who calls all manner of grotesque, undead, and demonic things to himself, and tortures them in a hellish manner, disposing of them at will. Absolutely terrifying cacodemonic animation coupled with Moussorgsky's dramatic, intimidating score. But as dawn approaches, torch-bearing pilgrims, and Schubert's Ave Maria in the background, subdue Chernabog and the demons, and they return to the Underworld as a masterpiece ends. Vladimir Tytla is the only man who could possible have pulled off this dramatic, spell bindingly horrific sequence. The best piece of animation ever. Fantasia is something special. Music, comedy, and unadulterated evil. That's a strange mixture. But two hours of these elements come together to make what may be the best movie ever. Fantasia will amaze ya.10/10",

            "review_title": "The first, the best, the unrivaled",
            "content": "Fantasia was to be the crowning achievement of Walt Disney Studios, their magnum opus, a work of art that finally convinced the people that animated films could be more than \"mere\" children's entertainment. Unfortunately, it was too much too soon. People went in expecting children's entertainment - after all, that's what Disney was known for - and instead were treated to high art. Nothing wrong with that, but you need to expect it first. And thus, Fantasia flopped financially, and what was meant to be a continuing series of films, remained just one until the turn of the century.But oh what a film it is. Music by the best classical composers ever lived, performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, hosted by Deems Taylor, featuring some the finest animated segments Disney had ever done. It's a stone cold classic, was from the very first moment, and it's a shame it didn't do so well. Luckily it has gone down in history as one of Disney's finest and will be watched and appreciated for centuries to come.As for the individual segments, they're not of equal quality, though they are all very good in their own ways.The opening segment, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, is not one of my personal favourites, but it works as a good opening intro to the idea behind Fantasia and is pretty to look at in its own way. It hasn't aged as well as some of the other segments, but it does its job more than adequately.Nutcracker Suite, on the other hand, is fantastic. Beautiful images, perfectly accompanied by one of the most recognizable pieces of music there is. After seeing this segment once, it's hard not to see fairies and seasons dancing around whenever you hear the piece.And then there's The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Everyone knows this one and has most probably seen it, even if they haven't seen the whole film. It's the segment with the most story and is one of the strongest Mickey Mouse shorts ever made. Grandeur, funny and even a bit threatening, it's probably the film's strongest moment.Rite of Spring is another one with a story, this time about the history of our small blue orb floating in the space. It's intriguing to watch, but once again the animation shows a bit of its age and it's perhaps even a little bit too ambitious for its running length. Not the strongest segment, but once again very good nonetheless.The Pastoral Symphony and Dance of the Hours, the next two segment, are to me very similar and while they're both fine, I cannot admit to liking them all that much. They're mostly just general gallivanting and while that's fine and fits the music, it can become a bit boring. The Pastoral Symphony is also the segments that has aged the least gracefully with some really rough character designs.Luckily we have Night on Bald Mountain and Awe Maria to close the film. And they are awe-inspiring. The devil on his lone mountain top is one of the scariest images Disney has ever produced and the rest of the segment is equally haunting, eerie and threatening. Which is why the following tranquility and quietness of Awe Maria works so well and allows you to drift over the finish line with a smile on your face and peace in your heart.Fantasia is not a perfect film, but it's still one of the finest pieces of art I've ever seen and a perfect introduction to animated films meant for adults. As a child I found it slightly boring. As an adult I'm in awe.",

            "content": "After \"Snow White\", who could ever underestimate animation? The new art form was definitely there to stay, embarking with bold confidence in the VIP wagon of Hollywood and promising to throne over the box-office for the decades to come. To think that it all started with a mouse!And Walt Disney movies all pay tribute to that aspect of his success, that the simplest things can lead to the most extraordinary achievements, all it takes is to believe in\u0085 or to wish upon a star. \"Fantasia\" is also an allegory of Disney's miraculous triumphs, an extraordinary achievement that also started with a mouse, THE mouse actually.After years of declining popularity, it was time for Mickey to make a glorious come-back in a 'Silly Symphonies' cartoon, one of Oscar-caliber fitting his legacy. It was \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" adapted from Goethe's story of the same name. Today, the vision of Mickey enchanting the broom, making it fetch the water with Paul Lukas' playful tune and the dream sequence over the cliff, where he controls stars, comets, waves and the whole universe, are some of the most iconic moments of Disney's canon and American film-making history. And unconscious or not, there was something self-referential in that short.Indeed, Disney was like Mickey during the dream, he could make anything possible with that magical hat called a 'vision', and like Mickey realizing the mayhem caused by the hundreds of brooms flooding the whole place, he saw the budget leak the short could have caused and things going easily out of control if he didn't decide to enlarge the scope and ambitions of the project. Instead of a short masterpiece, how about one big masterpiece made of little ones? So he made \"Fantasia\", an animated anthology, made of eight unforgettable segments set up to classical music pieces, each one having as much to say about music as they have about life.From the enchanting 'Dance of the Plum Fairy' with Tchaikovsky's 'Nutcracker' and the adorable 'China dance' with the mushrooms, to the horrifying Mussgorsky's 'Night on a Bald Mountain' and penetrating Schubert's 'Ave Maria', from the poetic to the droll, the antique to the modern, Disney took the world to a journey of such an unprecedented narrative it couldn't match the usual seventy minute-format. The two-hour run-time, long even by today's standards, says something about his urge to reach the mature age of animation. \"Snow White\" and \"Pinocchio\" were landmarks but the general perception of animation as an entertainment for children was a barrier to cross. \"Fantasia\" did it, showing with frames whatever classical music communicated with notes.It is perhaps the greatest tribute to the power of music ever made in animation, an odyssey in the universal and timeless meaning of the word that can be easily compared to Stanley Kubrick's \"2001\". And watching the silhouette of the conductor Leopold Stokowski during the \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" by Johann Sebastian Bach has the same impact than the 'Zarathustra' opening, an ominous moment of religious intensity, and with a point: music doesn't set the tone, doesn't get us in the mood, it IS the mood, the tone, the focal point. The purpose of the opening sequence, as explained by the Master of Ceremonies Deems Taylor (who lets us see the Philadelphia orchestra play the instruments) was to acknowledge music's self-sufficient value and not take it for granted. And the film starts with abstract moving forms in gold and blue moving in harmony with the music.We \"visualize\" the sound if that was ever possible. But who said anything was impossible with Disney? In the intermission; Taylor even introduces music as a character! And rightfully so because music also happens to be the storyteller, or a narrator helping us to appreciate our cultural heritage. With Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\", we follow the reign and then the extinction of dinosaurs, what a long way since Gertie in 1914! T-Rex penetrated children's imagination, three generations before Spielberg. Beethoven \"Pastoral Symphony\" is a recollection of little Greek vignettes with fauns, angels and oddly sensual centaurettes. And Ponchielli's catchy \"Dance of the Hour\"s with the hippos, alligators and ostriches is the perfect little interlude before the nightmarish climax and its quiet and peaceful ending, whose religious undertones might make up for the use of evolutionist elements.Without being controversial \"Fantasia\" did break a few grounds of censorship, venturing into themes hardly explored by movies such as details of female anatomy or depictions of Satan. Maybe Disney was too ahead of his time and some critics judged the film a bit too pretentious, too uneven, which can be argued since some parts are definitely standout masterpieces while the \"Dance of the Hours\" is of 'Silly Symphonies' level, but the point is that Disney, like I said before, was the sorcerer's apprentice whose delusions of grandeur were reflected by Mickey's dream, he wanted to push the edge of the envelope and experiment the newest framing and stereophonic sounds. Maybe what the film says is that any director must be a sorcerer's apprentice.And there is something in the criticism faced by \"Fantasia\" that reminds of \"2001\" with people praising Mickey's part like they acknowledge Hal 9000 was the best thing about the film, as if they were afraid to admit they were bored a little. But how many movies owed their ticket to posterity because of some 'boring' parts? Geniuses doesn't just have visions of art, they challenges the viewers' own visions.During the poignant handshake between the two silhouettes of Stokowski and Mickey, like a torch-passing moment between the past and the future, don't get it wrong, there's a third man out there, it's Disney, he's the voice and the Maestro, the one who conducted our eyes, our ears and our hearts to the infinite limits of imagination... and beyond. His secret: we all saw him as the Sorcerer, but he saw himself as the eternal apprentice.",

The idea of \"Fantasia\" is to take great pieces of music and draw animated sequences that match them.  In doing so, it reverses the purpose of a movie's score; the movie serves and matches the music, not the other way around.  This set up also means that there is no typical formula plot that is present in the vast majority of movies.  In the first piece, the animation is vague and abstract, but in later ones it is of definite actions, objects, and stories.  The two most famous(and my favorite) parts are probably \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"Rite of Spring\".  \"Fantasia\" is not only the best animated film ever made, but one of the greatest films period.",

            "content": "I first remember hearing about this movie when I was very little, and ever since I first watched it on VHS, it has always been one of the many examples of my favorite movies of all time. This is so unique, because unlike a typical Disney movie, in this movie we do not hear any dialog from the characters, and all of the music is instrumental (except for \"Ave Maria\" at the end). The film is divided into eight sequences, each of them being introduced by a guy named Deems Taylor, who was a very well-known music critique.The eight segments are as follows:1.) \"Tocatta & Fugue in D-minor\" composed by Johanne Sebastian Bach. This segment consists of shots of the Philadelphia Orchestra and their conductor Leopold Stokowski with a lot of cool shadow and color effects during the first three minutes, then we see a lot of shapes and random objects that Taylor would suggest to us might pop into our brains when listening to the music.2.) \"The Nutcracker Suite\" composed by Tchaikovsky. In this part of the movie, we listen to excerpts of the famous ballet suite, and we see various fairies, flowers, fish and other nature-related creatures.3.) Everyone's favorite \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" starring Sorcerer Mickey and Yen Sid (the sorcerer whose name is \"Disney\" spelled backwards). This is also the only segment to be seen again in this film's sequel, \"Fantasia/2000\" 60 years later, and in it the apprentice brings to life a magical broomstick to try to fill a cauldron with water, and the spell goes wrong so the apprentice gets reprimanded. This is then followed by Mickey greeting conductor Stokowski.4.) \"Rite of Spring\" composed by Igor Stravinsky. This segment takes place billions and billions of years ago with the coming of the dinosaurs, where we see the creation of Earth in the beginning of time, and are later introduced to all of the different dinosaurs including the tyrannosaurus rex, which become extinct in the end of the segment.5.) \"Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack\". At this point in the film, Deems Taylor introduces this string thingamajigger called the \"Soundtrack\" that he asks to make a lot of sounds resembling various instrument sounds.6.) \"Pastoral Symphony No. 6\" composed by Beethoven. This segment is about a day in the countryside, and in it we see a lot of Greek mythology creatures like unicorns, satyrs, centaurs and centaurettes, cupids, Bacchus, Zeus, Iris, Apollo and Diana.7.) \"Dance of the Hours\". This is where we see dancing ostriches, alligators, elephants and hippos. Each part of the piece suggests different hours of the day, and it all ends with a triumphant finale where the dancing hippo takes center stage.8.) A combination of two pieces that are utterly different in mood and tone. They are \"Night on Bald Mountain\" in which a bat villain named Chernabog has Satan's evil spirits dance furiously until the coming of the sacred dawn, and then Franz Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" which is the one and only part of the whole film in which we hear lyrics sung, and then the movie ends.I simply must say that not only is this film one of my all time favorite animated masterpieces, but it is also an example of a big highlight of the 1940's in cinematic history, all because of the ways it is so unique and special. In addition to this masterpiece, I also think \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Gone with the Wind\", \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Casablanca\" are main icons of cinematic successes. I definitely think this should have been the first animated movie to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award instead of \"Beauty and the Beast\".",

            "content": "Why is this film so incredible? If for no other reason, consider it is the year 1940!! Things like: Special effects, synthesized sound which interacted with animated motion, and color enhanced collage authentications, are things that just sort of roll off the end of our tongues today, but, back then, these techniques were very new to us!! Walt Disney is avant garde in so many uses of cartoon perfection!! In 1931, he came out with the first color cartoon. In 1937, the film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was a landmark in animated entertainment...\"Fantasia\" is absolutely one the best films ever made!! The color, the music, and the correlation between reality and illusionary depictions, culminated a brilliant montage of spectacular amusement for the movie audience!! My favorite segments were: Nutcracker Suite / The Russian Dance, Pastoral Symphony / Beethoven, and last but not least, Sorcerer's Apprentice / With Mickey Mouse. My mother said that I laughed hysterically for three hours in the movie theater at that scene with the multiplying brooms in the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment!! This film is synonymous with Christmas, as synonymous with Christmas as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" The movie \"Fantasia\" is considered one of the greatest films ever made, I wholeheartedly agree, in my book, it ranks 12th best movie ever!! \"Fantasia\" is usually in AFI's list of top 100 films ever made!! Imagery and the succinct use of color graphics are second nature with technical film artists today, back then, however, it was a revolutionary concept which dazzled the moviegoer!!! Walt Disney films are not just \"cartoons\" they are computerized digital artistry which evoke a rare art form of paramount escapism on the silver screen!! The \"Fantasia 2000\" movie was excellent too, but merely a rendition of the classic, while the segments were different, there just was not as much originality to them!! As a result, it lost a little panache in the process!! As a Chicagoan, I should like the \"Fantasia 2000\" more in one area: The music was performed by the Chicago Symphony!! In the original, the music was done by the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra!! \"Fantasia\" is a rare treat that every movie aficionado should witness.. I definitely recommend seeing this movie, preferably around Christmas!!",

I never got beyond The Sorceror's Apprentice before, so I made myself get through the whole film yesterday. Still, I needed to take advantage of that intermission, because I just got too antsy. Hard to say why, but it just didn't hold an interest for me. As conductor Leopold Stokowski mentioned, one could as easily close one's eyes and imagine a set of images to go with the music just as well. I think I would actually have preferred that.The thing is, I realize that this was an important film for both the history of cinema and for Walt Disney. Considering the era, it was nothing short of a phenomenal accomplishment. For 1940, the dinosaur sequence was visually way ahead of it's time; today, it just doesn't hold up. And that's not meant to take anything away from the many artists who would have contributed to this project. Sometimes the magic works and sometimes it don't - for me, this was one time that it didn't.",

It still was impressive.Spoilers among what follows.Fantasia was released with a \"multichannel\" technique called \"Fantasound,\" where one was the orchestral track, and the other was a control track that switched activation between speaker groups.The \"Rite of Spring\" episode was very colorful, but in its dinosaur sequence, even when it was made, the \"dinosaurs\" were mixed together anachronistically. Not that I don't like the visuals, but it's a bit like watching a World War I film with aerial battles with various ragwings, and suddenly a P-51 shows up.Beethoven's Pastorale was probably the prettiest segment, with everything very classical. The centaurettes looked like Malibu Beach girls (well, at least from the waist up) and the males like football jocks. Zeus was very playful, and the thunderstorm sequence was, to me, the highpoint of the episode.The \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" was okay, but it was the only sequence to have a recognizable cartoon character in it. I think it would have been better with another, anonymous, character as the Apprentice.\"Night On Bald Mountain\" was very impressive. However, I learned that the Tchernobog image was rotoscoped, and the person who did the original images was none other than Bela Lugosi. The use of color was especially effective. IMHO, that was the segment that should have been retained for Fantasia 2000.I've seen this dozens of times, and plan to see it many times more.",

Each segment has its own orchestral piece or suite, composed from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Contemporary Periods, including pieces from composers such as Bach, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Stravinsky and Mussorgsky. The music is rich and dynamic and the animation sequences are bright, colorful and scenic. At times, you could see the silhouettes of Stokowski and the orchestra, letting viewers see the people behind the musical magic.My favorite sequences are the Nutcracker Suite and the Night on Bald Mountain. You could see dancing flowers and mushrooms and falling leaves and snowflakes during the Nutcracker sequence, looking very carefree and innocent. And, you could see a demon and spirits performing in some sort of sabbath in the Bald Mountain sequence - very powerful and eerie.One of Mickey Mouse's most familiar public trademarks has him in a robe wearing a sorcerer's hat (with stars and moon images on it). This first came from the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence, where this trademark was introduced.If you are looking for a Disney fairytale with a story to follow, you would not find it in this movie.

Sometimes they can be enjoyed for their plots, characters, settings or other aspects of the mise-en- scene; but they can also be appreciated subliminally, appealing to our imagination, whether conscious or unconscious. FANTASIA is one of the best - if not THE best - example of this process at work. The film's visual beauty is stunning - a testament to the labors of the thousands of animators who worked on the project. The variety of visual styles is equally breathtaking, from the story of evolution recounted to the accompaniment of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring,\" to the comic ballet performed by ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants and alligators (Ponchielii's \"Dance of the Hours\"), and the devilish revel abruptly interrupted by the coming of a new day (Mussorgsky's \"Night on a Bare Mountain\" and Schubert's \"Ave Maria\"). Yet Disney was no high-flown idealist; he wanted his work to be accessible to mass audiences. Hence these elemental sequences are juxtaposed alongside simpler stories, such as \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" in which Mickey Mouse learns the error of his ways. The action doesn't take itself too seriously: while Dennis Taylor's narrative introductions are both concise and informative, he is shot against the background of members of the Philadelphia Orchestra taking a break from their labors. While they have an important task - to ensure the music carries the narrative - they also need respite. FANTASIA is the kind of work that befits repeated viewings in order to encompass is range of visual as well as technical wizardry. Every viewer will interpret the sequences differently, which is precisely the point in any work like this.",

This film is basically Walt Disney giving free reign to his animators to take some of the world's most famous classic music and put animation to it. This includes the work of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Mussorgsky and Ponchielli among many others.It's funny but if you want to start a fight in a Disney crowd you've usually just got to mention this title and you're going to get a wide range of responses. Some people think this film is a masterpiece while others find it to be a complete bore with very little redeeming qualities. Some people love the film but think it's not for children. I personally hated this movie the first time I saw it as a kid but I revisited it for the first time in probably twenty-five years and I was shocked to see how much I enjoyed it. In fact, on a technical level the film is among the greatest animation I've ever seen but there's no doubt that there's one major and critical flaw, which is its running time.As far as the animation goes, my God is it something beautiful to look at. I say this because the colors in this movie just leap off the screen unlike anything I've seen before. Right from the very start you just can't help but be drawn into the movie thanks to the visuals and they really shine in stuff like Rite of Spring, Night on Bare Mountain and Beethoven's Symphony. There are so many different stories and styles here that you can get stuff that is extremely dark and moody while at the same time the next film might be bright neons. I really can't express how terrific the visuals are here and it's hard to believe this was made in 1940.The music is of course beautiful in its own right and The Philadelphia Orchestra and Leopold Stokowski did all of them justice. I'd say the only thing that really hampers this movie is the fact that it clocks in at 125-minutes. I would argue that when the intermission comes it might be best to walk away from the film for more than the 15 minutes just so it doesn't become too much. After all, you're basically seeing a bunch of shorts put together through music so I don't think it would hurt the film. Still, FANTASIA is a masterpiece of visuals.",

Moving pictures edited sequentially to create a cohesive story, it was an art form that remained questionable as to whether or not people would leave their houses. Walt Disney himself decided to push the boundaries by making Fantasia. Typically music accompany film however the \"House of Mouse\" decided to reverse it by crafting film to accompany music. Six short animations providing imagery for the orchestral pieces of music that power these pictures. Safe to say this was incredibly experiment. There's no dialogue (aside from Deems Taylor introducing each segment), just a symphony or classic pieces conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The concept immediately had me hooked for the first few segments. One consisting of a montage of famous pieces from Tchaikovsky's 'The Nutcracker', Mickey Mouse returning in arguably the most memorable segment of the program titled 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and from there we have multiple tonal changes with each segment. It's certainly something I've not seen before, and for that I have to give it credit. It truly does deserve the critical acclaim that is has garnered throughout the years. However, I found Fantasia to have a slight novelty factor that made the \"film\" repetitive. After the intermission, you start to realise that you have another three segments to go through which nothing new will be introduced. I became numb to the revolutionary concept. The animated shorts are pleasant to watch that both entranced and enthralled me, yet I just felt like something was missing. It wasn't a \"film\" more so just an experiment to prove that the idea works. It's clear it does, so the next step would be to create a fully fledged story that involves classical music where there is emotional investment and a sense of wonderment. Experimentalism at its finest that evokes whimsical magic boasted by a euphoric selection of classical pieces and beautifully hand drawn animation.",

Walt Disney then built Fantasia around The Sorcerer's Apprentice, repurposing the short as part of a greater anthology of musical animated pieces. Numerous musical pieces were considered and rejected before incorporation of the final seven, and even completed material like Claire de Lune while complete was discarded (though repurposed for later productions), while like fellow 1940 release Pinocchio Fantasia was not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed at the time and has become a benchmark for Disney animation.The film selects an eclectic array of music with the likes of Bach, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky to name a few all interpreted by animators to synchronize with images that range from surreal interpretations to more defined narratives. The shorts cover everything from fantastical to factual, from abstract to concrete, and from silly to serious. Virtually every emotion is played with in Fantasia 2 hour running time with the cold indifference of the Rite of Spring, the darkness and foreboding of Night on Bald Mountain, the hope and optimism of Ave Maria, and the silliness and enthusiasm of Dance of the Hours.

Putting images to classical music is a great way to get those of us(yup, guilty as charged) who just wouldn't sit down to listen to something like that under normal circumstances to experience it. Cartoons have aged remarkably well(not just this, in general)... what needs to, and/or is meant to, look imposing still does(I won't blow what they are, for anyone who hasn't seen this... and those who have may very well know exactly what I'm referring to), and the whole thing still works, almost 70 years after it was originally released. Little sound is added... the visuals are scored almost entirely with the performances of the orchestral classics, the way the animation brings the well-known composed pieces to life. Drawing styles vary, and some segments are naturalistic, others almost psychedelic. Colors are vivid, and sometimes underplayed. Segments are briefly introduced by a speaker. There is story progression in at least some of the bits. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't object to two hours of animated visuals to go with some of the greatest score ever composed. 8/10",

FANTASIA is also a showcase for special effects (there are some stunning images in the film), color (the Technicolor is just exquisite, considering this was so early in the days of color film), and sound recording (this was the first film produced in what is known today as stereophonic sound). Although the film failed when it was first released in 1940, FANTASIA is rightfully acclaimed as a classic. I don't think this can be called a movie- it is an experience. One of my theater professors from college once told me of when he was taken to see a reissue by his father when he was young. My professor remembered seeing his father crying, then leaning down to him and whispering: \"This is what we can do with imagination.\" I can't think of a better testament to the sheer beauty of this film than that story. Once you see it, you will never forget it. HIGHLY recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "2017 is a year of technical marvel. Looking at movies of today, we see massive, stunning works of animation. We can now achieve computer generated images that look nearly indistinguishable from reality, and at the forefront of movie making today is Disney. Through Marvel, Disney creates multiple action packed superhero blockbusters a year. Star Wars, after it's 2015 revival, has new movies being released annually. Pixar, after creating several successful franchises, is now resting on its laurels, creating sequels like Finding Dory, Toy Story 4, Cars 3 and Incredibles 2. Even Disney's in house animation team is finding success, bringing back the Disney princess formula with movies like Frozen and Moana. However, amidst all this success, we have lost the truly human touch. Fantasia perfectly captures all that was lost in today's Disney movies. The movie has a very personal and human feel to every aspect of it. The orchestra, a very tangible presence in the movie, feels alive. They laugh, play their own little tunes during the intermission, but most importantly, they make mistakes. The animation is the same way, It's very rough at times and sometimes lacking, with some animations being reused, however every shot is filled with passion. You can tell that people worked on this, people with ambition, though they were not perfect. In modern movies, this beautiful animation that looks so real lacks the touch of individualism that Fantasia has in spades. The scene of the Sorcerer's apprentice dancing around the broom is burned into our collective memory for a reason. In all its flaws, its rough edges, it feels real to us. We can see all the raw effort and energy that the animator's put into each of Mickey's footsteps and that resonates with us. Fantasia speaks to the viewer not because it's perfect, but because it's flawed.",

            "content": "'Fantasia' was created around a beautiful idea. The music inspires the emotions. The emotions inspire the images. And the images go with the music to create a beautiful piece of filmmaking. It not only showed the potential and beauty that could be achieved not just through animation, but through filmmaking as an art form. Each short carries with it a distinct style in animation, with a different director working on each segment. Through this we witness great variations in the style of each short. The likes of 'The Pastoral Symphony' tells the simple story of different mythological creatures going to a party. Then some such as 'The Rite of Spring' segment created a narrative stretching millenia telling the story of the birth of earth to the death of the dinosaurs, earths first dominant species. It captures everything from the majesty of the birth of life to the rage of the T-Rex hunting their prey to create a wide spanning realistic story about the beliefs of the creation of life. Others such as 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' carry no narrative whatsoever. Instead they use only colours and patterns to match the rhythms and emotions of the music. With so many different styles each short is original, creating fantasies unlike anything we'd ever dreamt before. Even the tones of the different pieces differ greatly. Pieces such as 'Dance of the Hours' pack in the laughs with chaotic dancing Hippos and Elephants carrying as majestically as a ballerina. Whilst other sketches such as 'Rite of Spring' focuses on the beauty of the world, with different characters dancing through the seasons of the year. The film embraces many different worlds of magic and beauty, probably the most famous of which being 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. It showed the kinds of feats that could be achieved through animation, with the likes of a whirlpool and tidal waves being created in vivid and beautiful detail. It's an old story of an apprentice who dreams of power but is unable to control it, put to animation beautifully. But to me Fantasia's strongest feat is its finale, 'Night on Bald Mountain'. Whilst originally removed from some releases due to its controversy in scaring children, the short is one of the most powerful representations of pure evil put to screen. As the devil rises himself and an army of the dead to gain pleasure in watching them suffer. As it goes on we see the chaos reign as the flames engulf all the souls there. Whilst this chaos goes on the devil just sits there maliciously grinning as the suffering goes on. We then get 'Ave Maria' and the daylight scaring the daemon in to retreating back into the mountain. It reminds us of the constant conflict between good and evil, with good winning in the end but evil always being there. Lurking in the darkness and waiting for the next night. It's surprising that one of cinemas most child friendly film makers like Walt Disney helped create such a hellish vision on screen. But just like anything else he has helped make it is a defining film that has inspired film making for many years.And when it comes down to it that's exactly what Fantasia is. Walt Disney bringing animators ambitions and unique styles to the screen. He ensured that we were given a cinematic experience unlike any we'd seen before, bringing many creative worlds to life through the power of the orchestra. It's originality and ambition makes it a cinematic landmark that stands as well today as any other classic Disney and a real testament to the beauty of the golden age of Disney.",

I finally saw it. All the way through. Awake, albeit damaged.Unsuccessfully, I've fallen asleep in THREE attempts to watch Fantasia. All three times, I've made it to either Mickey's story or just into the Dino scene following.Let me set the record straight: This has more potency than 6 sleeping pills. I'm fully aware Disney simply loved his subliminal messages\u0085but this one was the easiest to catch: sleep, sleep, SLEEP!I gotta be honest here: this movie appeared to me as an amateurish attempt and was definitely boring as sh*t. I'll give it kudos for being the visualization of Winamp of its time and I'm sure it was \"amazing\" during its long release schedule between 1940-1, but it was far too early (Disney Feature Length Movie Number Three) for Walt to be experimental with this adult cartoon. And here goes\u0085He went from somewhat adult with Snow White, to the rightfully kiddie Pinocchio and now MOSTLY adult Fantasia. This even featured animated nudity and sexuality!Oh, and I like the fact that my car runs smoothly, or my home A/C or heater works fine. I don't need to actually see them in motion, like what they tried here \u2013 an orchestra coming to life.When I was a kid and was slowly, but surely being exposed to the \"Disney (so-called) Masterpieces\" all I was interested in were the Mickey and dino scenes. I was duped into believing the rest of the movie had the same interest for a kid. I was wrong. Oh, and speaking of the word \"Masterpiece\"\u0085I'm beginning to realize, and only after re-watching (or for the first time all the way through) the first three Disney cartoons, that they throw around the word \"masterpiece\" very loosely.On a positive note, the Mickey scene was masterful \u2013 making sure not a word of dialogue explained his plight, rise and fall. But that's the only segment that held my attention. The rest of it was a chore to get through and no movie should ever be that way. It didn't help that most, if not all the characters yawned a lot and/or were asleep at a certain point. Oh, how I wanted to join them in such graceful slumber!I am thankful I finally did make it from beginning to end \u2013 albeit, I did pop some caffeine pills\u0085NO JOKE.

Classical music was interpreted by Disney animators, resulting in surreal fantasy and playful escapism. Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra provided the music for eight segments by the composers Tchaikovsky, Moussorgsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Ponchielli, Bach, Dukas, and Schubert. Not all the sequences were created equally, but a few are simply glorious, such as \"Night on Bald Mountain,\" \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" and \"The Nutcracker Suite.\" The animation ranges from subtly delicate to fiercely bold. The screen bursts with color and action as creatures transmute and convention is thrust aside.

            "content": "Our screening of the original uncut 1940 Roadshow, 35mm Disney Studio Archive Print, (yes, it came from the \"vault\"), of Fantasia was introduced by Disney historian and author John Culhane. He relayed a story about when he spoke with Walt in 1951 and mentioned how great he thought this mix of sound and images was. Walt responded by saying, \"but it hasn't made any money yet\". And that was ten years after its release. He did say that Disney still held strong to his convictions that it was what he needed to make at that time. In 1940, he believed that showing a visceral experience like Fantasia was just what the medium called for; it was the natural evolution of animation in his mind. You have to respect that, no matter how much money he lost after its four-year creation process, employing thousands of animators, it was all about the craft. When you look at the state of the genre today, with about ten films a year from multiple studios, many of them drivel, it is definitely a treat to go back seventy years and see what actual hands drew for the world to see. Frame by frame, note by note, you really can't deny the brilliance of this film, even if you probably will fall asleep at least once each viewing.I remember the first time I had seen Fantasia, I was young and it was one of the few Disney films I had yet to experience. I hated it. It was the most boring thing I'd ever seen. Even when Mickey Mouse finally showed face, with that wizard hat I had seen in so many pictures, I could care less. Truthfully, I might not even have finished it, (when intermission came halfway through, I told my friend that I couldn't even remember what else there was, all my memories had played in Act 1). But I kept thinking about the film each year later. As I grew older and started pursuing a career in the arts, it nagged at me that I didn't appreciate the feat. Then Fantasia 2000 came out and I began to see what I missed in the original so many years before. So, when it was announced that Fantasia was coming to Buffalo's premier theatre Shea's, it was an invite that was tough to pass up.Admittedly, I almost nodded off a few times during the two-hour duration. But that is not meant to detract from the wonder this film instills, not at all. From the narration amongst the Philadelphia Orchestra by Deems Taylor, in partial silhouette, complete with a prologue to each song, (whether they be the kind of music that tells a definite story, the kind that has no specific plot, or that which exists simply for its own sake), to the image of conductor Leopold Stokowski standing alone on his platform, to the animation on screen, working from the music, telling its story, you will be transported to a different world. It is not for everyone\u2014especially little children this day and age with no attention spans, (many parents left with their offspring early on)\u2014but if you're willing to let it wash over you, and enjoy the works of Bach, Tchaikovsky, etc., you won't be disappointed. It's a concert film above all else; you're just watching animation rather than the musicians and their instruments.And you cannot deny the artistry of it all, oftentimes hearkening to future films Disney would be making. You can see the precursors to Tinkerbell in the naked fairies flying around as well as the donkey used that same year in Pinocchio. The abstract illustrations are intriguing, but my favorites are definitely the ones steeped in some biomorphic form. I absolutely love the \"Nutcracker Suite\" vignette, find the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to be wonderful, and really get blown away by some of the finale, the combo of \"Night On Bald Mountain\" and \"Ave Maria\". In that final sequence you get to see some amazing artwork in the devilish, winged creature as well as the architectural forms during the \"light\" moments at the end. At times you see frames with immense amounts of gradation and depth, moments where the stark flat colors usually seen, meld into still frames gorgeously painted as though works of art, not something to be seen for a fraction of a second. I'm not sure exactly what causes this, but those freeze-frames are my favorite part of the film.So, is Fantasia a great film? I don't really know how to answer that question. I can appreciate it for what it set out to do, and deem it a complete success in that regard, but would I rather watch it then the likes of Disney classics like Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, or Robin Hood? No. That said, though, I would recommend it to anyone out there with an open mind and ability to see past the commonplace and mainstream. Some may say you can only truly enjoy your experience if you are on drugs, that the creators themselves were at the time, but that is a disservice. Fantasia is a world that needs to envelop you and become your sole visual focal point for two hours. If you are willing to put in the time, Disney's epic will not lead you astray.",

Disney's effort to combine classical music with animation has been an entryway into serious art for generations, and remains a prime illustration of the communicative powers of both music and animation.The most illuminating short in this respect is the opening \"Toccata and Fugue\", which depicts a mind wandering while listening to music. Footage of the Philadelphia Orchestra slowly dissolves into fragments of motion and colour, forming a sort of sensory representation of Bach's narrative. Rarely has music been expressed so graphically.This idea of visual evolution is followed through upon in \"The Rite of Spring\", which traces the origins of life on Earth through Russian ballet. Stravinsky's pounding pagan rhythms are offset by an Apollonian \"Pastoral Symphony\", followed in turn by hippos in ballet skirts performing the \"Dance of the Hours\". A more vitalising variety in expression is hardly imaginable. The concluding combination of \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" alone is a masterclass in pacing and contrast.Disney's animators were clearly working at peak inspiration throughout, no doubt finding a soulmate in showman conductor Leopold Stokowski. With \"Fantasia\" they stretched our conception of what animation can be. Its boldness and profundity haven't diminished a bit.",

If you've never heard of this one, it's basically \"The Twilight Zone\" on acid set to classical music.It's also the movie that I really wish I could make. I think the timing's right, but other people might not. The reason is not even worth explaining.An amazing thing about Disney is they have changed a lot since then, and they're not the same anymore. \"Fantasia\" is a damn good movie, and they'll never do anything as good as this again. They ain't even the same Disney that I grew up with and I was born in the early '90s. These days Hollywood just loves to know how much milk they're gonna get out of the cows each and every year. It's so sad to say that most of the time the motion picture is just another way to make money instead of an art form.Art and business shouldn't be two different things. Children should never be patronized or used as a monetary target.\"Fantasia\" is one movie that I wouldn't mind seeing in a theater, especially one that has a huge screen. The timing was anything but right when Walt completed it. I don't think the American moviegoer was mature enough to understand it. That's probably why it almost made Walt bankrupt.What I would have done is I would have shown it in IMAX with its big surround sound system. I would have done it as a mixed-media art film: hand-drawn backgrounds, digital artwork, hand-drawn animation, different kinds of special effects, stop-motion animation on live sets, etc. I'm one of those people that doesn't accept the status quo when it comes to movies.

A few things though: every segment in this movie is stunning from both a visual and sound perspective, I think that goes without saying. So, here we go:1. 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' is not a story-driven sequence, since it's just colours, but I love the music so much it brings it up a lot, and makes it great to watch. 9/102. 'The Nutcracker Suite' is charming and whimsical, and that's more than enough. 9/103. 'The Sorcerers Apprentice' is the first proper story-driven segment, and it's excellent. It's very entertaining and extremely enjoyable, truly feeling like the most true Disney segment. 10/104. 'Rite of Spring' is very exciting and fun, with some truly marvelous scenes, particularly the fight scene. It does have a weird focus on materialism, which brings it down just a bit, but it's not anything serious. 9/105. The Intermission is simple and endearing, and the music personification getting confident is super adorable. 9/106. 'The Pastoral Symphony' is magical and pretty enjoyable, with a lot of solid down to earth action from the different creatures, and while it does definietly feel like the most culturally outdated segment in terms of its stereotyping, it's still somewhat enjoyable. 6/107. 'Dance of the Hours' is also very entertaining and interesting. I really like the crocodiles, they're pretty fun, as well as the sleeping hippo being moved around. Charming stuff. 9/108. 'Night on Bald Mountain' & 'Ave Maria' is the best segment. It's very cool and tonally different from the rest of the segments, and while I do like the dark and fiery demon gathering better than the serene morning, both parts are fenomenal. 10/10So, the ranking goes: 8, 3, 4, 5, 7, 2, 1, 6. We've got two 10's, five 9's and a 6, making the total average just below 9. Seeing as there isn't a single sequence in Fantasia that isn't bad, I think it deserves an 9. Good stuff.",

I remember also it was one of the only times my family and I decided to walk out due to feeling increasing boredom &/or restlessness. I can't remember entirely why it happened, but maybe too many half-hour cartoon shows and other elements had my family and I yawning or not taking what was going on in the film with much enthusiasm. Plus, I was definitely not a fan of classical music. As times have changed, however, I come across Fantasia for the second time and it feels so new, looks so remarkable, and sounds incredible to the point of this being one of those classical-music mandatory experiences. Over time composers like Stravinsky, Beethoven, Shubert and Bach are now my favorites and the selections given for the segments in the film fit wonderfully. And after having gone through many years of animation and seeing its transformations from hand-drawn into computer (which can be great and sometimes can be just crap, just as in the hand-drawn style), some scenes and moments, either in part or in whole, stand as staggering individual works where storytelling is key even as dialog is nil.The Sorcerer's Apprentice was one I saw multiple times by itself on TV and in the 2000 sequel film, and is still pretty sweet and kind of timeless in its own respect. And even as the segment with the ballerina hippos is not entirely successful, there are some movements that do work to no avail. But the masterpieces of the film are, for me, the Stravinsky segment with the creation of Earth and the dinosaur evolution/destruction, which on its own would work well as a short but strung together with the rest of the segments is like the best piece of the puzzle. Unlike what is usually considered the norm in Disney animation, this is dark, bombastic, and unsettling in how it depicts the million-years gone circle of life, and it's probably the most mature piece of animation ever to come out of the studio. The segment that goes hand-in-hand with this one is also equally subversive with the Night on Bald Mountain segment. These are contrasted then with the lighter, fluffier, and genuinely cute segments with the Nutcracker suite and Unicorns and such.So, coming from my past experiences with the film, I'm conflicted as to whether I can recommend the film as much to kids as to adults; those into the simpler told and non-abstracted animation meant for the younger crowd (and those not too fond of the centuries gone composers in a very contemporary age) or those who don't even watch Disney but love art films. It's an experience to see to believe, and whether you can sit through it or not is neither triumph or shame. As it's unlike any other work- even the 2000 sequel is a little different and not as completely successful- its meant to be a one-of-a-kind experience, for better or worse depending on the viewer.",

For one thing it was filmed in real three-stripe Technicolor and we are aware from the first frame of how rich color used to be, burnished oils as opposed to modern wishy-washy water-color and if ever a movie cried out for three- stripe Technicolor it is Fantasia. If only as a painless introduction to 'classical' music the film deserves our applause and yet it is entirely possible that viewers previously unexposed to classical music will not feel compelled to seek it out in non-visual forms, content merely to enjoy the constantly inventive melding of sound and picture. Just as there are eight notes in a scale so there are eight segments and whether deliberate or unintentional it makes for a pleasing symmetry. Everyone will have a favorite segment but in this case the whole is greater than the parts.",

It's priceless, but is probably one of the more controversial elements in this uneven mixture of Disney shorts with the emphasis on music.Personally, I'm fonder of Disney doing SNOW WHITE, BAMBI or PINOCCHIO, and found certain segments a turn-off (\"The Rite of Spring\" episode seemed awfully barren and dull), and others a complete delight. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" with Mickey Mouse trying his magic with disastrous results is one of the best.Another very impressive segment is \"A Night On Bald Mountain\" which has every scary element giving it the height of interest, followed soothingly by the closing \"Ave Maria\" sequence.Bold in color and conception, this is an uneven blend of Disney's artistic work from his army of animators. He certainly was an artist who wanted to \"stretch\" and this was his exercise in uniquely imaginative images and sounds. My favorite moments came during \"The Nutcracker Suite\" with mushrooms in the shape of Chinese men doing their intricate thing and the spidery webs glowing like gold as tiny fairies sprinted across them. That was Disney magic at its best.Whether or not this is a totally successful experiment, is up to each individual viewer.",

Although a \"classic\" film, many children who are shown the film are really bored except for the cute stuff (like the Sorcerer's Apprentice and the dancing mushrooms). And, many adults will, perhaps, like the music but find it more fun just to turn on a CD of classical tunes (I fall in that category). This is because many of the segments just seem to fall flat (particularly the dinosaur portion). I would have much preferred the efforts to have been spent on producing a movie like \"Bambi\" or \"Pinocchio\" (which came out around the same time).I know people who like it, so I am not saying they are WRONG. Instead, I am pointing out that this movie will NOT appeal to everyone--certainly not me or my family--though we might like a segment here or there.As for me, I'd much rather watch a fun Disney film!UPDATE: Since reviewing \"Fantasia\", I have seen a similar sort of Disney film \"Make Mine Music\"--which lacks almost everything good about \"Fantasia\". The art is noticeably cheaper looking and the music was often much more forgettable. The net effect was to make me appreciate \"Fantasia\" a bit more. Perhaps I was too harsh towards this 1940 film and I'll amend my score to 7--though it STILL is pretty to look at and listen to but also often quite dull (especially for kids).",

All the fairy-tale imagination disappeared from kid's channels, and beautiful animations are replaced with modern ugly-simplified and mostly stupid characters. It is up to us, 20th-century generations, to show today's kids all the magic of old Disney and preserve it from fading into oblivion. \"Fantasia\" is Disney's approach to classical music and, I must admit, it's not one of my favorites. I always loved the animation part, but the music was quite boring for me as a kid. Still, its quality and worth are undisputable. If nothing else, this is the best way to try and bring Bach, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Beethoven, Mussorgsky, closer to kids and let them decide for themselves. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" by Paul Dukas was and still is my favorite part of this legendary musical.

            "content": "This film should need no introduction. There will be mild spoilers ahead, though I can't imagine there are too many people likely to be reading this who haven't seen Fantasia:The conceit here is a pairing of classical music with animated segments done with the music in mind. It was developed when it became clear that production costs on \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", initially intended as a Silly Symphony, became so great that they could never be recouped by a short subject. So Walt Disney came up with the idea of a \"concert film\", or different animated segments featuring varied pieces of classical music.Music critic Deems Taylor was selected to be the on-screen host introducing the segments and Leopold Stowkowski conducted the orchestra, after having conducted the scoring of the short which started it all.There were eight segments, with the last two being a thematic pairing of A Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Schubert. These are basically one animated piece with two separate musical accompaniments. The others are individual and self-contained works. The segments are, in order:Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach, which is simply very abstract animation in time to the music.Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky, which is various mushrooms, flowers and other fanciful objects dancing to various segments from the ballet.The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas, with Mickey as the titular character getting into trouble when he takes his master's magical talisman (his hat) only to unleash something he didn't expect and can't control. The most well-known individual segment and the third best, after the last two.Rite of Spring by Stravinsky, which inspired no less than the formation of the planet, the beginnings of life on through to the extinction of the dinosaurs.The Pastoral by Beethoven, where male and female centaurs frolic, flirt and court in an idyllic setting. This segment has occasioned controversy and censorship since the film's first release.Dance of the Hours by Amilcari Ponchielli, which whimsically features four separate ballets corresponding to Morning (ostriches), Afternoon (hippos) Evening (elephants) and Night (alligators). The four converge in the end piece, with comical results.The final pairing is also probably the most majestic and moving section of the film. In A Night on Bald Mountain, Chernobog, a devil, orchestrates a dance by spirits, demons and assorted things on and around Bald Mountain. Just when things reach a feverish and climactic pitch, a bell tolls and dark night gives way to the dawn, forcing all to flee, including Cherobog. Ave Maria rises as light banishes dark and monks march into a ruined cathedral. The contrasts are magnificent.This is, in my opinion, Walt Disney's masterpiece. I've seen Fantasia on the big screen in one of its re-releases, had this film on VHS, I have it on DVD and on Blu-Ray. It looks good on VHS, very good on DVD and extraordinary on Blu-Ray. Most highly recommended, particularly on Blu-Ray, if you have a player!",

This wasn't so much suppose to be a movie onto itself but a new medium or type of entertainment. That aspect of the film I absolutely love; at its core the concept of classical music + animation is just wonderful. The development of music videos as a medium owe a lot to this film. I have always been a bit sad that commercially this concept has never done well enough to sustain Disney's vision.Watching the film today is something of a mixed bag. A lot of the film is utterly wonderful and compelling-Rite of Spring, Nutcracker Suite are as perfect as animation has gotten, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor is still hypnotic-but some of it is a bit dated. The Dance of the Hours has loss its comedic edge because of the culture moving on from the ballot for example. But that is fairly minor.This is a wonderful artform and I wish more would be done with it.",

            "content": "The 3rd animated Disney classic is a unique movie experience. It is a rare and completely different movie than what people are used to.\"Fantasia\" actually consists in 8 segments, being each one totally different. Aside the introductions by Deems Taylor before the segments, there are no dialogs. Art is above everything else, combining animation with classical music. The music is performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski.Most everyone seems to love \"Fantasia\" nowadays. It has many fans, including me. It is considered a classic now. But when it came out in 1940 it was a commercial failure.\"Fantasia\" is a masterpiece, a pure work of art and magical. Artwork is excellent and special effects either, proving that even back then they already worried about attention to detail.About the 8 pieces, let me give a small opinion about each one of them:1. Toccata and Fugue in D MinorI don't mind how difficult it is to understand what is this about. It's a festival of art and magic. Simply beautiful, very creative, imaginative and original.2. The Nutcracker SuiteAnother brilliant segment. It takes on a famous ballet piece of music to show us flowers, fairies, dancing mushrooms and seasons of the year. Very good.3. The Sorcerer's ApprenticePerhaps the most popular piece from \"Fantasia\", it is another one of my favorites. Pretty good but also hilarious because Mickey Mouse attempts to use some of his master's magical powers before learning how to control them. Things go out of control, as expected. My favorite part is Mickey's dream: he dreams that he is controlling the mighty seas and starry skies - truly a marvelous and magical sequence.4. The Rite of SpringInteresting, but not one of my favorites. This one starts very well, by showing what science considers to be the formation of our planet and life. It shows images and special effects that look amazingly real, such as the infinitive space, volcanoes in action and boiling lava and earthquakes. It also shows us the time when dinosaurs ruled the world and humans didn't exist yet.5. The Pastoral SymphonyExcellent! I absolutely love this one. This is a sweet story inspired on Greek mythology. It has lots of cute and adorable creatures such as flying horses, unicorns, cupids and angels, as well as original creatures like centaurs and gods. The music is beautiful and the artwork is wonderful. The flying horses and unicorns look the same but with different fur color (that is so cute), while cupids and angels look the same except with different hair color (very cute).6. Dance of the HoursAnother one of the best segments from \"Fantasia\". It takes place in the garden of a palace in Italy. What we see here is the most amusing ballet ever with ostriches, hippos, elephants and crocodiles dancing ballet. I guess all these animals are here for comical effect, especially the hippos (I love hippos).7. Night on Bald MountainThe only piece I really don't like from \"Fantasia\". This features strong stuff and is extremely dark, uncomfortable to watch and disturbing, as well as very creepy. Chernabog is a horrifying character.8. Ave MariaThis sequence is a great ending for \"Fantasia\" and is included in \"Night on Bald Mountain\". Although slow, it has the same general greatness from \"Fantasia\". The short itself is religious but artistic.This should definitely be on Top 250.",

            "content": "There are films in which classical music really ads something to the mood of the film. Symphony 7 of Beethoven in \"The kings speech\" (2010, Tom Hooper) comes to my mind. Stanley Kubrick was a director who regularly had a lucky hand in selecting classical music. For example \"The blue Danube\" of Johann Strauss in \"2001: A space odyssey\" (1968) and various componists in \"Barry Lyndon\" (1975).It is however rare that classical music is the main attraction of a movie, and this is the case in \"Fantasia\", a mixture of animation and a classical concert. With \"Fantasia\" Walt Disney took a risk. The combination of animation (popular culture) and classical music (higher culture) is not a frequent one and the danger was that lovers of one of those would drop out with respect to the other. To mitigate this risk Walt Disney selected rather well known pieces of classical music. With respect to animations however he was less cautious. The animations ranging from Mickey Mouse to abstract.In my opinion Walt Disney found the right balance between popular and cultural. My favourite is the last episode where the music of Moussorgsky's bald mountain goes over in Schuberts Ave Maria when dawn breaks.Given the emphasis on classical music the quality of the sound had to be good. In its original release \"Fantasia\" was not playing in every cinema of the country, but was an itinerant show. Only by the re-release in honor of its 50th anniversary \"Fantasia\" was distributed nationwide.",

It lost a fortune on initial release, as Disney tried to insist that the theaters be fitted with \"Fantasound\" stereo (in 1940!) Like another reviewer, I like some \"segments\" better than the others. \"The Sugarplum Fairies\", \"Oriental\" Mushrooms, exotic goldfish, and \"Russian Thistles\" are dazzling. My least liked is \"Rite of Spring\" with \"clumsy\" dinosaurs. \"Meet the Soundtrack\" is probably just there to settle the audience back in after the intermission. The black centaur \"beautician\" segment is not cut from my version. (A \"white\" centaur gets her hooves manicured and polished.) Deems Taylor is OK as narrator, but gives \"spoilers\" on almost all the segments. Most famous is \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" with Mickey Mouse. \"Pastoral\" and \"Dance of the hours\" are both outstanding, funny, and imaginative. The hippo and alligator ballet. I am sure that \"Ave Maria\" was added in case \"Bald Mountain\" offended anyone with it's animated fiery \"busty\" female demons (usually cut for broadcast) and \"a monstrous Satan\". My version has the 1940's orchestration and is not wide-screened. I have the original VHS which has been played under 15 times, as I have to be \"in the mood\" to enjoy it all.

So I never imagined I'd be watching Fantasia. But a friend recommended me an animated musical called Allegro Non Troppo, which is a bit of a parody of Fantasia, and suggested I watch the Disney movie first to appreciate it better.So I watched it, and I wasn't ready for it. Fantasia may just be one of the finest musicals and animated movies ever made. It's certainly the best thing I've ever seen from Disney. The premise is to create animation that matches classical compositions by Beethoven, Ponchielli, Stravinsky, etc. And it's a beautiful mix of visuals and music.Nearly all animated sequences are great, but some stand out, like the \"Night on Bald Mountain\", when the devil summons out demons and the spirits of the dead; \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\", which even someone who hasn't seen this movie knows since it's the famous cartoon of Mickey Mouse as a magician animating a broom to do his bidding; \"The Nutcracker Suite\", which shows a dazzling dance of nature and fairies; and \"Pastoral Symphony\", set in a beautiful mythological Greek setting.Even by today's Pixar standards, the animation is breathtaking, and I do believe some of the colors achieved in this movie can't even be reproduced by the hard-working makers of Wall-E and The Incredibles. Some of the color sequences are so good they stand up to Kubrick's psychedelic light show in 2001: A Space Odissey.This movie was awarded two Oscars for its contribution to the art of cinema. I don't think it'd have been too much to give it an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. At least it deserved an Oscar for best screenplay, even if no words are heard in this musical. But I imagine creating animated sequences that match existing musical pieces was no easy task.All in all, Fantasia is a great movie. Save for a slow beginning and a few dull segments, it's always entertaining and magical. And now remains to see if Allegro Non Troppo can live up to it.",

Then I saw it in my early 20s in film school and I finally understood what all the talk was about. I then revisited the film about 15 years ago and that is when I really started to appreciate the magnitude of this film's existence. After watching Fantasia (1940), again, recently, I still come to the same conclusion. Do you really think something containing this amount of work could be done today? Sure it could, but proportionately, no. The amount of work needed to draw, design and animate this beautifully produced piece of art in 1940, would be the equivalent today of spending one billion dollars and the film would probably be a 12 hour long movie. Today's CGI is nice and almost flawless, but you can clearly see the talent, personality and determination, needed to get this film produced, emanating from the screen. Fantasia (1940), utilizes hand drawn artwork, camera lens filter techniques and brilliant, classical music recordings, that brings everything together in the film, including the spirit of the filmmakers themselves. That is something you could never see in computer generated animation.There are seven different sections to the film. They have breaks in-between the various chapters of the film. They are moments of introduction for each piece. They range from the bright mood of the Nutcracker Suite to the darkness of Night on Bald Mountain. It features the story about the beginning of Earth's history in the Rite of Spring, which also covers the extinction of the dinosaurs. There also is a now-famous chapter featuring Disney's favorite mouse, in the Sorcerer's Apprentice. In some instances, the introductions before each section may feel a little long-winded, but you almost need the break, in order to catch your breath. You need to catch your breath, because the images seen, are mind-blowing, artful representations, coupled with a kaleidoscope of colors and beautifully, fluent, hand-drawn animation. Sound film was slightly over a decade old by 1940. The music and the audio is fantastic in this film. It is awe-inspiring seeing these images move, with synchronized audio/music, highlighting the brilliant displays of animation on the screen. It is important to remember this is just a dozen years after sound film technology was born. Remembering that, makes the experience of Fantasia (1940), even more mesmerizing.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

She sat on my lap and loved every minute of it, even 'Night on Bald Mountain'. I must admit I hadn't watched it for years and forgot about this section, but she wasn't scared by it. This is surprising when you consider the spider in 'Mother Goose Melodies' frightened her!In my opinion Fantasia is the ultimate Silly Symphony. It's obvious all the groundwork for the film came from them, which is why it's so good - the artists had ten years to hone and perfect their skills while Walt Disney had the vision to realise it. I wonder if he had thought of it a decade earlier and waited until the right moment to create it...? It's a real shame he never lived to see its success because he deserved to.It's hard to find the right words to surmise this film; I suppose I could break each section down and give my opinion as others have done, but as a whole - well, it's got good bits and bad bits; happy and sad bits, it's scary and funny and gloomy and sunny.

I liked some of the adaptations like 'Pinocchio' and 'Bambi', but 'Fantasia' seems to have been made as an endeavor for something new. Its one thing to use animation to get the characters around a cute story but it takes a giant leap of faith to create something this bold. Cynics don't like because it doesn't have a plot. My defense is that sometimes I like watching a movie without a blueprint.What stays with most people are the cute sections. Most everyone remembers Mickey Mouse in 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'The Dance of the Hours'. But I watch this film for it's darker more serious sections. My favorite is the last one, 'A Night on Bald Mountain' in which Chernobog, a satanic creature letting loose evil spirits upon the night. I also liked 'Rite of Spring' a chilling epic about dinosaurs stalking the earth.I also remember tiny moments, little throw-away details. I loved the introduction of the soundtrack, a shy little line that is introduced and then moves bashfully in from the side of the screen.I saw 'Fantasia' before and after it's restoration. The pre-restoration print was almost unbearable. Many of the scenes were faded and the soundtrack had scratches and pops. I nearly walked out but I was ultimately glad I stayed because I could later make a comparison. The restoration is clean and crisp, the colors are striking and the soundtrack is flawless. What I also appreciated is that the restoration chose not to stretch the film to widescreen. Careful preparation went into every single aspect of 'Fantasia' and the whole movie was constructed to fit a certain aspect ratio. Stretching it means that you lose a percentage of the top and bottom of the screen.'Fantasia' was chosen by The American Film Institute as the second best animated film of all time (second only to 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'). I think that this decision was made because 'Snow White' came first. I think 'Fantasia' is a far superior film in every way. 'Snow White' was a drop in the bucket to what animated features to could. 'Fantasia' was a tidal wave.",

            "content": "This is a movie that was made in the wrong time. When Fantasia came out, people didn't understand it. It was seen as being too high brow as it was cartoons set to classical music. This was something that the normal everyday citizen just didn't get. Walt's original idea was to have new scenes added to it every few years so it was always evolving while keeping some favorites intact. But since it flopped, Disney did what they always do. They put it into the vault only to be shipped out again decades later.Then came the 60's and suddenly the hippies loved it. The dreamy imagery, the surreal scenes, hippos dancing ballet. It all came together as something to see whether you were baked or not.The movie itself is a series of unconnected scenes of animation set to classical music. It starts with Beethoven's \"Tocata and Fugue\" and the animation here is very... experimental. It's not relying on any kind of linear plot but merely images that bring to mind what the music is suggesting.Next comes the Nutcracker Suite and we have scenes of flowers dancing to a Russian song, some mushrooms dancing to a Chinese song, fish, flowers and even fairies in the spring, summer, fall and finally winter.After that comes the one the everybody is familiar with where Mickey Mouse performs the Sorcerer's Apprentice and creates an army of mindless brooms to do his work much to his chagrin when they flood the room with water.This is followed by the Rite of Spring and as a child was my favorite because it features dinosaurs.Next is the Pastoral Symphony set in Greek times with all the fantastical beasts like Pegasi, centaurs, fawns and of course the gods themselves. This is so colorful and happy.The next is the Dance of the Hours with dancing ostriches, elephants, hippos and alligators. It starts slowly and then builds to a hilarious crescendo.And finally there's the sacred and the profane. There's Night on Bald Mountain representing Chernobog for the profane, and then Ave Maria to finish it off for the sacred.This is truly animation for the sake of animation. It shows what can be done and how music can truly elevate something that is so simple. They tried again with Fantasia 2000 but it just didn't work. Parts were good, it had some stand out pieces but for the most part they felt soulless. If you need to watch one, watch Fantasia 2000 first and then watch this one. You won't be disappointed that way.",

Some of it works, some it bores. It could have made a perfect 85 minute movie if the crap was cut out.The first segment is enough to put you off completely. We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player. This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques. I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking 'What the hell is this?' The three good segments in the movie are the story of the Dinosaurs to the music of The Rite of Spring, the over publicised Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Nutcracker Suite and A Night on Bald Mountain. All effect a wonderful atmosphere that is so lacking in modern animation.Segments featuring dancing Alligators romancing fat hippos (The Pastoral Symphony) or the 'meet the soundtrack' interstitial are yawnfests with pretty much nothing happening at all, I'm sorry to say.The animation is always top-notch however and very vivid as Disney cartoons usually are. But ultimately, Fantasia is a mixed bag that not a lot of people will like or appreciate. Still worth checking out though.",

I was happy to see they were both really into the concept, and happily watched the whole movie (but split up over two nights, separated, appropriately, by intermission). Sebastian was at first upset that there wasn't any dialogue, but then later noted that \"music helps tell the story.\" I was really impressed with the Nutcracker Suite animation, which prefigured lots of later animation such as in Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, as well as the Classical figures in the Pastoral Symphony, especially the non-canonical lady centaurs, the bufoonish Bacchus, and the strikingly playful (or malevolent) Zeus in the storm cloud.",

            "content": "1st segment: ties with the final segment as FANTASIA's worst. There is some pretty good music in this bit, but it's represented by meaningless pictures and movements. Still and all, don't fast forward through it, will you, there are some interesting moments. **2nd segment: uneven. Many exhilarating moments when images and music explode on the screen, several really magical spots with incredibly good animation, like the dancing of the mushrooms and flowers, but the last few minutes of it are uninteresting and drag quite a bit. Far from FANTASIA's worst, though. ***3rd segment: the best known --and arguably best-- segment of the film. It's the famous segment with Mickey Mouse as a sorcerer's apprentice. Magical animation, excitement, great music, and a classic bit where he's dreaming of shooting around stars and rising waves with his powers. Only complaint: it could've been longer (it's probably the film's shortest sequence). ****4th segment: stunning representation of Earth in its very prime, this is the one that has haunted by mental projection of our planet in its first millennia. Fantastic music and wonderfully drawn dinosaurs too. Great detail in the volcanoes, lava, and environment. Ties with Mickey Mouse's segment as the best this film has to offer. ****5th segment: generally considered one of FANTASIA's least compelling sequences; it deserves better. Set in mythological environments, this lengthy chapter has unicorns, centaurs, Zeus launching thunder bolts, rainbows, and lots more. Some really good moments, but lots of boring ones as well. Music is nothing exceptional, but the segment is surely worth seeing. ***6th segment: another uneven segment, I would put this one in more or less the same league as the previous one. The music is certainly a lot better though. This one has hippos, birds, and crocodiles dancing and elephants breezing away in the wind (don't ask). This could also be the weirdest segment of all, though the animation is stunning. **1/27th segment: almost the best saved for last. At least as good segments 3 and 4. Frightening representation of evil, the devil, terrorising a town beneath a mountain at night. The animation is absolutely stunning, as is some of the music, this segment will definitely give children (or even adults) a good jolt of fear. ****8th segment: vague shadows and lights singing \"Ave Maria\" after the devil goes to sleep again. Boring and uninteresting; thankfully, this is also FANTASIA's shortest (and, sigh, final) segment. *1/2Overall rating: **+***+****+****+***+**1/2+****+*1/2= 24 stars.24 stars divided by 8 segments: 3 stars out of 4.

            "content": "\"Fantasia\" is an animated movie from 1940, produced by Walt Disney and directed by multiple directors. It is the third Disney animated feature having been made, the first two was \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937) and \"Pinocchio\" (1940).Basic plot: In this film, eight segments are set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, while music critic and composer Deems Taylor makes an introduction to each of the segments.Just to point out some of the segments: In \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", Mickey Mouse attempts to try out some of sorcerer Yen Sid's magic tricks. \"Rite of Spring\" deals with the evolution of life on Earth, from volcano eruptions to dinosaurs. In \"Dance of the Hours\", animals like hippos and alligators perform a comic ballet in four sections. In \"Night on Bald Mountain\", a devil summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain, so they can dance and fly through the air...Not only has \"Fantasia\" been a great part of my childhood, but I'll confirm this to be a great favorite within the world of Disney animated movies. Here, the classical music and the animated segments fit perfectly with each other. The animation is just wonderful for something made in 1940. And besides from Deems Taylor introducing the segments, this film proves the fact not all movies need to always have dialogue in order to make a good story. It is also amazing on how \"Fantasia\" still holds the record for being the longest Disney animated movie, with the running time of at least two hours.Favorite segment: In my opinion, \"Rite of Spring\" wins.Most funny segment: Here, \"Dance of the Hours\" takes the cake.Most scary segment: \"Night on Bald Mountain\", clearly.This is how I grew up with \"Fantasia\": My family used to have this film on a British VHS originally released 1991. Together with several other animated features like Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Toei's \"Panda no Daibouken\", I could watch \"Fantasia\" many times without getting bored. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" was the only segment I couldn't manage to sit through. And I thought \"Rite of Spring\" was kinda creepy as well, thinking about how the Earth (which looked like a giant fireball) came closer and closer to the screen. The rest was no problem, as I watched it with pure pleasure. Prior to my big sister getting the same film on DVD several years ago, my family decided to get rid of the VHS.In my opinion, when it comes to musical animated features, as well as Disney movies, then nothing beats \"Fantasia\". This film can be watched by everybody, both children and adults. If you still haven't watched this film, then I highly recommend you to watch this one at least once. My overall rating: A well deserved 10/10.",

            "content": "The 1940 animated classic masterpiece Fantasia was a groundbreaking revolutionary film and has since not been duplicated in this reviewers opinion. In the years since the genre has been littered with many animated features that are musicals, Fantasia was the first last and only animated feature that featured no words and only music. The score that sets the backdrop of the stories in Fantasia is European classical music. The score was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, and was conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The film depicts several different stories as told through music and video. Mickey Mouse Donald Duck, and Daisy Duck are the only famous animated character in the movie, Leopold Stokowski, and Deems Taylor are the only people to appear in the film and they play themselves. Within Fantasia there are several stories, the first of which is \"The sorcerer's apprentice\" this short features Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice, the story was an adaptation from Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's poem of the same name. In the Disney version the sorcerers name is \"Yen Sid\" (which is Disney spelled in reverse) is angry at Mickey when he saves him. The next short is \"The Rite of Spring\" is a story about evolution. It starts off in space in the Milky Way and zooms in to Earth, which has just been formed. We then zoom into a pool of water where we see the first cells form, and then become eye witness to mitosis followed by the first animals crawling form the sea onto land. Then we are taken to the time of the dinosaurs, we witness a battle between among a tyrannosaurus, and a stegosaurus with the tyrannosaurus eventually winning the battle. The end of the score brings about the extinction of the dinosaurs. The third segment in Fantasia is the \"Dance of Hours\". This segment features animals dancing the ballet, including a hippo in a tutu. The animals dance around gracefully at first but as the music reaches its climax the ballet starts coming apart at the seams. The alligators are chasing the hippo, and the hippo is running from the unwanted advances. On the final drum beat the entire place collapses in on its self. The final segments are tied together; the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" the demon Chernabog is seen summoning form the grave enslaved souls. Chernabog is seen with other demons and ghosts skeletons and others preparing for an invasion of a kind. Then with the sounding of the Angelus bell Chernabog along with the rest of the daemons are sent back into hiding. As the music Ave Maria is played we follow a line of robed figures through a forest to a cathedral.This film was spectacular for its time, and is still a classic to this day. Nothing like Fantasia had ever been done, the mixing of some of the world's most fantastic classical musical master pieces with such imaginative and amazing animation from some of the times most talented animators makes for a visual and aural delight and one of the best animated movies of all time. The many themes both challenge the audience and delight them. From the whimsical dancing animals to the greater ideals of both evolution, and what some interpret as Armageddon the film makers bring the stories to life in their own unique way. Boggs, J.

            "content": "Audiences of the 1940's may have found Walt Disney's visual interpretation of some of the world's greatest classical music enthralling, but I found the whole experience rather underwhelming. The soundtrack was, as I expected, fantastic; however, several of the animated sequences are dreadfully dull, whilst some of the more 'experimental' imagery seem tame by today's standards.A rather dry narrator introduces the film and reveals the intentions of its creators: to represent the music through visual artistry. The orchestra assembles and the conductor, Leopold Stokowski, takes his place. Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor begins, accompanied by garish multicoloured silhouettes of the musicians. Resisting the urge to switch off at this mind numbingly awful start, I soldiered on.Next up for the Disney treatment is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker Suite, in which all manner of animals and plants are anthropomorphised and dance to the music. The animation here is pretty good, but the sequence seems to last forever.Mickey Mouse takes centre stage in the third segment, playing The Sorcerer's Apprentice (with music composed by Paul Dukas). This is certainly an iconic piece of cinema, but I never was a fan of the helium-voiced rodent and once again found my mind wandering, despite the great instrumentals and the chaotic kinetic power of the visuals.Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring accompanies the story of life on Earth, from the forming of the planet to the death of the dinosaurs. Impressive animation and rousing dramatic music make this my favourite part of the movie.In complete contrast, Ludwid Van Beethoven's The Pastoral Symphony and Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours are teamed up with some of the dullest animated moments in Disney history. In the first, sickly sweet cherubs, centaurs, unicorns and flying horses frolic in an idyllic country setting whilst boring the pants off the audience. And the latter features unlikely animals (hippos, ostriches, crocodiles) performing ballet routines. It's yawn inducing and not in the slightest bit funny.Fortunately, the film ends with a wonderfully dark interpretation of Modeste Moussorgsky's Night On Bold Mountain (demons, ghosts and spirits party 'til dawn) and a beautifully tranquil finale accompanied by Franz Schubert's Ave Maria.This is certainly bold movie making from The House of Mouse, but it is not entirely successful. Definitely not a 'routine' film for kids (although some may enjoy it), Fantasia is worth watching, but it didn't work its way into my heart like so many of Walt's other masterpieces.",

I find it quite hard to believe that this particular form of entertainment is not as widespread as I think it should be, but at least we can say that it was very popular during and for it's time. I was well fascinated by this sensational production as a very young child and I would do almost anything to have it be as well known today as it was many years ago. I especially enjoy the more abstract moments throughout the film mostly considering the introduction of the presentation, with the in-depth look at the imagination of what we may visualize when we hear not just classical music, but just about any well crafted song out there. The rest of the tracks apply the same basic principal, but mostly containing stories of interest. The Rite of Spring (the birth of living species) and The Pastoral Symphony (Mt. Olympus) are two of my top favorite tracks in this unforgettable production. Fantasia 2000 was a good sequel, but the original shall stay the best for me. The subjects of beauty and mythological fantasy need to be reminded again in this generation. A fun and childhood-classic Disney film overall.",

            "content": "Watching \"Fantasia\", one gets the feeling of how groundbreaking it must have been when it first came out. The idea of matching music with images may be commonplace to us nowadays, but this is still a unique experience. As it is, I don't know how much I can say about the movie that other people probably haven't already said, so I'm going to talk about various aspects.There was a Looney Tunes cartoon loosely spoofing \"Fantasia\" called \"A Corny Concerto\", in which an unkempt Elmer Fudd - with uncontrollable clothes - presented skits featuring the famous characters; one featured Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig (that must have been the only time that they co-starred) and the other featured Daffy Duck.During the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" sequence while Mickey Mouse was controlling the stars, I got the feeling that if I could do that, I would make the stars spell out messages. In fact, I would probably make them spell out dirty messages over religious fundamentalist gatherings (I would maybe write something about Elke Sommer; she fuels some of my raunchy thoughts). Speaking of religious fundamentalists, it's pathetic that they removed a scene from this movie that would have showed the evolution of mankind, lest they offend religious fundamentalists. I would have shown the evolution of mankind with the INTENT of irking religious fundamentalists. But getting back to \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", \"The Simpsons\" once portrayed a spoof of it in which Scratchy chops up Itchy, who keeps multiplying, so Scratchy chops him into dust, which he inhales...and the particles chop him up from the inside! Next, the Greek sequence. I noticed that some of the female centaurs were partly naked. How did that pass the censors?! And for a Disney movie, at that?! I now realize that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" featured a few characters from this movie, namely the brooms, ostrich and hippo. In fact, the song played to accompany the dancing hippos has the same tune as \"Camp Granada\" (although I figure that this one came first). What would Walt Disney have thought had he known that this tune would one day get used for satire? And then, there's the whole end sequence. I see that the evil demon is Chernobog, the Slavonic god of evil. To be certain, the name Chernobog means \"black god\" (when the name got created how ever many hundred years ago, they probably didn't figure that the name might sound racist). \"Night on Bald Mountain\" leading into \"Ave Maria\" reminds me a little bit of the end of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", where the fetus oversees what may be a new stage of humanity.To crown everything, they filmed the movie in Pathe Studios in Culver City, now the home of Sony Studios. To be specific, that's where they film \"Jeopardy!\". Whodathunkit?! OK, so I admit that I've written a totally incoherent review. I just write any idea that comes to me. But my point is that I totally recommend \"Fantasia\".PS: Deems Taylor mispronounced Modest Mussorgsky's last name. It's pronounced MOO-sorg-sky, not moo-SORG-sky.",

For someone who is familiar with the pieces, it's insulting how some notes are distorted, probably on purpose, to match the animation pace. It should have been the other way around, but alas, it was not. Two points removed for that.",

It was only the 3rd feature film Disney made, but it strayed away from the formula, telling stories in new ways, recording sound with experimental technology, focusing on art as well as entertainment. Walt Disney even planned Fantasia as a living artwork, evolving with new sections as the years passed. Its the only animated film I can name until the 70s that is \"mature\" (Not to insult the rest of Disney's filmography).And despite its 75th anniversary right around the corner, Fantasia has aged like fine wine. Its unique, magical, with a universal style. Each segment offers a new setting, the beautiful animation set to the greatest in classical music, each piece matching the tone perfectly. Some vignettes show us personifications of nature float through life's course. Others have cartoon animals and their mishaps. There's variety, consistently fresh without a single weak link or out-of-place short.If you're looking for plot or character, Fantasia isn't for you. Outside of the intermissions, its practically silent. The stories are quite simple. If its not your taste, or if you're in the wrong mindset, you might become weary. Its 2 hours long, slow, and style-over-subsistence set to a pretty calm genre of music. But its still a wonderful movie, and I wouldn't call it boring. Its something every fan of animation should see once in their life. And if you've never seen the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" segment...you need to watch Fantasia ASAP. ;)",

The layout of this film is very unique, being that it is divided into 8 parts. This was interesting because it kept the film entertaining. This film also had no dialogue from the characters, but rather had music from the instruments. This made the film the success it was because it made us focus on the music, and vibrant colors of the films. This film also did a good job combining the music with the visuals going on.

            "review_title": "Fantasiastic!",
            "content": "I've always been a fan of classical music- its such a universal form of music. This movie is one of my earliest memories, and I believe it is due mainly to the enduring tunes that are ingrained alongside each image. Since it is composed of individual sketches, I'll review each one separately.Toccata and Fugue- It is a marvelous way to start out the program- first showing the instruments as if we are watching a regular concert and gradually drifting off to the heights of animated imagination. The abstract imagery beautifully compliments the bold and whimsical music.The Nutcracker Suite- Probably the most famous ballet of all time and the music leaves no reason to wonder why. Each little vignette is a treasure, from the cute Asian mushrooms to the exuberant Russian flowers to the seductive Arabian goldfish. The falling snowflakes in the stirring Waltz of the Flowers are the icing on the very decadent finale. The rich colors in this sequence hold the visuals up to par with the spectacular music.The Sorcerer's Apprentice- Somehow I never liked this one as much- perhaps I didn't care for the intrusion of an obvious cartoon character in my special fantasy film. The harshness of Mickey Mouse killing the broomstick and the world turning deathly pale also gave me a terror from which I never really recovered. I do realize that Fantasia was built entirely around this segment to boost the flagging appeal of Disney's original hero and I can appreciate this segment as such, for it truly worked. The redesign that went into this short has carried the mouse into the hearts of every generation since.The Rite of Spring- This has got to be my least favorite of all the pieces. The music is very harsh and savage- which is what the composer intended- it's just not the style I like to listen to. That does not help matters as there is also an exceedingly long section of darkness, planets and a very uninhabited earth. The grand scope of this is ingenious, panning through galaxies to our planet, but it takes a long time and coupled with a few minutes of molten lava, it tends to get monotonous and boring. Since the music is not particularly inspiring, there is nothing for a good while that holds my interest and I usually end up skipping to the dinosaurs. Once it actually gets to living creatures, things pick up. The Tyrannosaurus scene is quite entertaining, if not very true to facts. I love the blaring \"DUN DUN DUN\"s! as the Rex triumphs over his prey. The story and music match perfectly.The Pastoral Symphony- Definitely my favorite section. I am a huge fan of Beethoven and mythology- could it get better? The music is divinely beautiful and the animation is loaded with colorful, glittering eye-goodies. My mouth actually waters when I watch this because things look enticing enough to eat. Elegant Pegasus and mischievous cupids prance around a rainbow countryside as centaurs pair off in a sort of blind-date-beauty-pageant. The main gods of Greek and Roman Mythology make an appearance here, from the drunken Bacchus to the angelic Diana. It's mostly a lot of fairytale fluff, but for someone who likes to spot the nuances of mythological lore, or just enjoys a bit of beautiful animation, it's a more than enjoyable waste of time.Dance of the Hours- Admittedly, I can't watch it now without trying to sing the hello mudda song, but this is a really funny bit in its own right. Taking such awkward animals as the gangly ostrich or the lumbering hippo and turning them into ballet dancers is a stroke of comedic genius. The seductive crocodile is my favorite character- what an odd charmer! The music somehow lends itself to hilarity, making this one of the most mixed up ballets I've ever seen! Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria- Deliciously dark and radiantly pure, the juxtaposition of these two pieces could not have been more perfect. The burning passions of the night run rampant across the screen and speakers as Chernabog summons the powers of hell to his mountaintop. At the height of his theme, a single sound and glimmer of light shatters the chaos. The moment is quite beautiful as the lone voice in the terror, so low it is barely heard, breaks the spell and dispels the darkness of evil. Slowly, the voice grows and is accompanied by many lights and voices until it breaks out into the full theme of Ave Maria and we come from the cave into a brilliant, hopeful dawn. Quite an inspiring ending to any film.The movie is also filled with an introduction to each segment as well as a short on \"the soundtrack.\" Each piece was made with a care that you will be hard-pressed to match in this era. Fantasia 2000 showed a desire to learn from such times. I hope the spark continues to grow.",

The abstract segments are the best by quite a long margin (aka \"Toccata And Fugue In D Minor\" and \"The Nutcracker Suite\"), but \"The Rite Of Spring\" - which is quite brutal for Disney's standards, let alone for 1940 - and the most psychological segment of all, the brooding \"Night On Bold Mountain/ Ave Maria\", are pure visual and aural delight. 70 years later, this still stands as a bold experiment and one of the best films of all time. Ironically, the much celebrated \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is the lesser segment here. It's just a bit too linear when compared to the rest of them. Of the last two segments, \"The Pastoral Symphony\" is a good compromise between a linear storyline and an impressionistic \"narration\" of the music piece, while \"Dance Of The Hours\" is probably closer to the traditional Disney spirit.",

It's a series of animated short stories set to classical music.

In my opinion, taking him out altogether would only improve the film but others may disagree.Of the stories, the best are Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria, The Pastoral Symphony, Rite of Spring, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and Dance of the Hours. The other segments are all slight but enjoyable. There isn't a bad segment in this, unless we count the forgettable intermission.This is not for all tastes, obviously. It's longer than need be and perhaps a bit boring for younger children. Still, there's no harm in trying to make them watch it. Maybe they'll love it. Even if they don't, I'm sure most adults with taste will. It's a beautiful work of art, regardless of the minor nitpicks I talked about earlier.

If someone told me it was made a few years ago, I would easily believe it.The film is a series of classical music pieces lasting approximately 2 hours in length (at least on Disney+) The music blends so beautifully with the animation as if they are one. Often people will say music evokes the senses and images and in Fantasia this is certainly the case. From Centaurs to Dinosaurs, to Micky mouse trying his hand and wizardry. I'm normally not a fan of musicals but the combination between the two art forms was so well done. I feel in love with the film. It's hard to review because its something you just need to sit down and experience, as a friend said to me before watching it for the first time. My only tiny gripes would be that there is a warning at the start of the movie (Disney+) stating some of the depictions may be offensive. I could tell where this comes from in the movie. Maybe people be offended. I don't know. I just think sometimes we just have to understand the year this film was made in. We should apologise on behalf of people who are long gone. If someone slighted me. I wouldn't expect and apology from anyone apart from the person. Secondly the movie might be a little too long, 2 hours is a long time for an animation with almost zero speech.. So probably a movie to watch in two sittings. (In the movie itself the orchestra take a break). Regardless of these small criticisms probably one of the best animations in history. Definitely best musical animation. 9/10.",

Bach's \"Toccata And Fugue in D minor\"perhaps one of the most famous peices of music ever written, this tune gets a complete overhaul for Fantasia. Arranged by Leopold Stokowski himself, this segment lets me see the piece in a whole new light, and the imaged the artists conjoured up were brilliant: big shafts of light and big exploasions of color during the closing Toccata, and a beautiful variety of images throughout the fugue.2. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker suite\"opening with the \"suger plum fairy\", we get exactly that: suger plum fairies making everything brighter and more shiny, and ending with the \"waltz of the flowers\" where it is exactly the opposite. Winter is brought in by the fairies who then skate on a frozen lake.3. Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\"The most famous Fantasia segment, while not my personal favorate, is still pretty entertaining and unforgettable. a regular Disney character weilding an ax? how often do you see that?4. Igor Stravinsky's \"rite of spring\"the most boring fantasia segment ever. I always fast forward past it when I watch it. it's not really fantasy anyway, just an educational presentation about life on earth.5. Ludwig Van Beetoven's \"pastoral symphony\"Beautiful Animation, clever use of Greek Mythology, and colorful. the second movement with the cupids courting the centaurs is just.....weird. the music there seems slowed and sped up repetitiously just to fit the story (Fantasia 2000 did this in practically every segment.)6. Amilcare Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\"the next famous Fantasia segmant after the sorcerer's apprentice,is one of my favorates. Hilarious, beautifly animated,(I just love how they did the sunset and night sequences)classic Disney.7. Modest Mussorgsky's \"Night on Bald Mountain\"powerful stuff here. tale about a hellish demonfest that goes on all night: ghosts rising from the graves, the gargoyal casting beings into the fire, just amazing.8. Franz Schubert's \"Ave Maria\"the piece begins at the end of \"Night on Bald Mountain\" as church bells drive the gargoyal back into hybernation. We then see a long line of people with candles proceeding through the forest at dawn. Julietta Novis' magnificant solo is heard as they emerge from the forest into an open valley as the sun rises from behind the mountains.Overall, I like this movie better than Fantasia 2000 because so much more effort was put into this one. Every segment was hand drawn, all the music was more complete and the segmants were fun to watch. The last segment was definatly my favorate, because it expresses the constant battle between good and evil, and good's ultimate victory. Julietta Novis' solo makes the Fantasia version of \"Ave Maria\" the best one I've ever heard.",

A labor of love for the man behind Mickey Mouse, the movie is split into eight different segments with a noted piece of Western classical music (conducted by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra) serving as the backdrop for the story in each one.Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor opens the film with abstract, expressionistic images that coincide with the music. There is no real story here; it's probably the most dream-like segment of the entire film.Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite is given a new look in the movie; eschewing its traditional story for a ballet of nature as set to the tones of the Chinese Dance, Waltz of the Flowers, and Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy among others.The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas is by far the most recognizable and popular segment of the entire film. A showcase Mickey Mouse who plays the titular character that uses magic to bring a broomstick to life carry out his chores, with disastrous results.Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is visualized as the gradual transformation of Earth from an uninhabitable world of roiling seas and volcanoes to the age of the dinosaurs. An impressive showcase for special animated effects as well as the realistic appearance of the dinosaurs.The Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven's 6th) is set against the backdrop of Mount Olympus and Ancient Greek mythology is utilized to tell the story. Centaurs, unicorns, Pegasus, Zeus, and other gods and creatures appear in the most fanciful and elegant segment of the film.Coming from Amilcare Ponchielli's opera \"La Gioconda\", The Dance of the Hours is a ballet that progresses from day to night with ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators performing the act. The result is one of the best segments of the film.The finale is the combination of Modeste Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria into one major segment showcasing the clash between good and evil. The talents of animator Vladimir (Bill) Tytla and famed illustrator Kay Nielsen take center stage.Fantasia was, and still is, unlike any film ever made when it was first released, for the film was the first to utilize a stereophonic soundtrack to replicate to concert hall experience in theaters.

As a matter of fact, 1940 saw the birth of Bugs Bunny.

Look at \"Sleeping Beauty.\" However, if you keep in mind the era in which \"Fantasia\" was made, and the state-of-the-art at the time, you can appreciate Disney's work even more.Films like \"Fantasia\" were stepping stones for Disney that led to greatness like \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", and others.Look at the innovation that Disney used. For example, in 1940, he had the soundtrack RECORDED IN STEREO! Practically every theater in the United States was unequipped to present it sufficiently.I bought my video of \"Fantasia\" in 1991. But, for the true Disney fan, the DVD is a MUST!I give an absolute, 100% recommendation to it. George",

I still say that is a great Disney film. But it's not one of my favorites. Nothing that I could really watch over and over again. It eventually gets a little boring.

            "content": "Of course it's a real accomplishment to let the images fit so well to the classic music but it just isn't the most exciting movie to watch. I prefer the 1999 version \"Fantasia/2000\" of Disney because that version features different animations styles for basically each segment. This movie is just more or less of the same the whole time, no matter how good looking it is all and how well the music sounds.Of course it's not an horrible movie though, not at all. It was a very special and original project for its time to mix animated sequences with classical music, from some well known composers, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The movie for its time also used some unique stereo techniques to really bring out the best when it comes down to its music. All of the animations from the Disney studios are great looking and the movie features some unique moments but most importantly it fits the music very well, A real accomplishment and it must have been a real pain for the animators to work on this movie, to get the timing constantly right.The movie features 7 different segments, to 7 different classical compositions from composers such as Tchaikovsky, Bach and Beethoven. Of course some of the segments are better and more enjoyable than others but overall it's balanced out very well, although some segments drag on for too long.This is also a complaint. This movie was obviously also made to introduce the youth of its time to classical music but using animations. After all; it's a Disney! I however just can't imaging a 10 or 12 year old enjoying this movie, not even in 1940. It's just too slow for that in parts and the images are not always compelling nor entertaining enough for them, to keep them interested throughout, also because not every segment really follows a clear main story. Personally I as a kid really couldn't watch this movie, or the 1999 because it was way too boring. Perhaps this also still would had been a better movie if it only had been a bit shorter. 2 hours just seems a bit too much.A real accomplishment but I wish it had been done a bit more entertaining, with different styles and a bit more pace. Something the 1999 version did much better.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "1940 saw a new form of entertainment created by Walt Disney, called Fantasia. Renowned musical compositions were played to a group of Disney's best artists, who were instructed to draw their responses to the emotion, expression and narrative that they heard in the music. The result was, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the most iconic moments in film \u2013 these artists redefined creativity and breathed a new lease of life into popular (and perhaps overplayed) scores, forcing us to reconsider what it means to be artistic. A review of six parts would be appropriate in order to celebrate each of the six short films for their own success, however I also feel it is important to consider the effect of the film as a whole.Fantasia grounds itself upon a strong justification for its cause, ensuring throughout that the viewer (whether musically educated or not) understands the purpose of the exercise. The narrator disclaims from the word go that the animations are not absolute stories that will match with the composer's introductions, but instead, are developments from them. Here is where Disney promotes the refreshing method of creativity, which I previously mentioned: the suggestion that interpretation is limitless in possibility, and that each opinion should be celebrated and explored.I feel that Disney's choice of music exemplifies this philosophy to the most obvious and dramatic level. By using scores that are so famous and concrete in their accompanying stories, such as \"The Nutcracker Suite\", he shows how even the most popular music may have a different story to tell. The orchestra are silhouetted to represent the idea that music has become anonymous, and Disney gives a face to the compositions once again: literally re-animating the classics. We are taken on a journey to rediscover the beauty of compositions that we perhaps take for granted. The colourful animations take a flowing, almost hypnotising form within stories that draw upon hidden beats and instruments within textures of the score that make us rethink what we know about the music: we learn to listen rather than to hear. Disney celebrates the intricacies of composition as they were meant to be celebrated, and the creations of the artists approach each movement in every short with appropriate beauty and delicacy. (I would talk about my favourite short here \u2013 Beethoven's \"Pastoral\" \u2013 but once I start I will not be able to stop)!For me, Fantasia represents a redefinition of film in its time as well as a redefinition of what it means to be imaginative across all of the arts. An exercise that had never been tried before, and hasn't since by anybody except Disney, that proves the infinite limits of storytelling. The choices of iconic composition laced together with heart-warming and intelligent animation makes classical music accessible to all ages, and truly shows what it means to be creative: encouraging us to continue rethinking the past and to have our own opinions.",

            "content": "The development of the animated motion picture is one of such swiftness as to only be rivaled by Aviation's rapid evolution from the Wright Brohers, 1903 through 2 World Wars. The Animated Feature evolved from the Cartoon Short Subject. It was a period of about 30 years or so from the most primitive works like 1906's HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS(1937). The animation as an art & science really made the strides, and when it was added to all of the technical achievements in film, like color, sound, etc.,we wound up with a seemingly different thing altogether.The overwhelming success of SNOW WHITE, was achieved in spite of a lot of folks in the Hollywood Establishment and The Press saying it wouldn't work and would not be a favourite at the Box Office. Insteasd of his critics getting to say, \"I told you so!\", it was old Walt who got to do his best Nelson (from THE SIMPSONS) impersonation by giving a loud and clear,\"Ha Ha!\" It has been that Mr. Disney had no musical training*, yet possessed a great sense what was \"good\", and what would be the best type or particular pre-existing songs to use in his animated cartoon shorts. Not to rely on his own layman's 'horse sense' kind of judgment, Walt sought counsel in film collaborators, the Host of Many of the Classical Music Radio Broadcasts of Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Deems Taylor. His other chief consultant in these musical matters was, no doubt, was one Mr. Leopold Stokowski who is the on and screen Conductor of his own Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and, if I may be so bold, was quite a 'Ham' in front of the movie camera.Now the Walt Disney Studio had probably the best equipped, trained and talented group of Artists, Animators and Script Writers in the World. It was a veritable 'Animation Army' and no other company, except maybe Max & Dave Fleischer's, could even compare.So, there would be no problem with doing the stories. Once the number of segments and their lengths were determined, Walt had the horses to deliver the visuals. The animation or moving of the drawn image had already hit its peak several years earlier and the artists & animators would have benefit of such processes as Disney's Exclusive Multi-Plane camera.After the selection of the Classical Pieces to be used and adapted to each of the segments, and story lines developed and assigned to various Disney Animation Teams, it would seem that the job was just about done. Well, it just wasn't true. This greatest of Disney's projects was just getting started.The fundamental problem of 'The Concert Feature' (its working title)was one that really did not plague earlier animated films, at least not to this extent. FANTASIA was being billed as \"a completely new form of entertainment!\" It was beginning to live up to that claim.In making this Classical Music and Animated Film feature film, the Disney staff was working with two absolutes. On the one hand the fine application of the stop action photography. The other was the magnificent combination of the fine sounds of the Symphony Orchestra, which combine to give a single, beautiful feast to our auditory nerves, our hearing. This was clearly an exercise in bringing the two widely disparate sensual stimuli.So combining he two should present no new problem. After all the world has had sound movies or \"Talkies\" for some time now. There seemed to be no trouble in synchronizing the voice with the lip movement. Any problems in that area had surely been worked out long ago. Talking Pictures were nothing new, and this FANTASIA was surely no different. After all, we had already seen SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS and PINOCCHIO (1940) and they proved to be highly successful and handy at the old Box Office, to boot!But their is no great amount of 'spoken' word by the animated characters. Other than our M.C., Mr. Taylor and a brief sojourn by Mickey Mouse into the \"Real World\", there is none. The synchronization would be that of proper mood and correct movement to be coordinated with the rising and falling of the melodious sound track.Okay, let us concede that it wasn't easy, but the Disney crew did it! They brought about the on screen marriage of the sound and the imagery. But there's one problem left.The object of FANTASIA, as was so explicitly stated by Deems Taylor at the very beginning, was to present the audience with images and stories that were conjured up by the Disney Artists. The story segments would be, in many cases, far different from those of the Composers' original intents. Well, we concede that they succeeded.But there remains one major problem. In the process of making this 'Concert Feature', the production staff was essentially blending opposites in the Symphonic Score with the Bright and Beautiful Moving Images. They succeeded in combining Fire and Water, representing the two elements.But what about the other element, one that these various musicians and scribblers had no control over. And this element is at least as strong as the Images and Music. It is the Power of Imagination, not that of the Creative Team, but that of the Movie Audience. That would be the only obstacle they could not control. And it begs the question, why would anyone want to 'interpret' these musical segments when it will be done by the imagination, anyone's imagination.Please,don't think I disapprove of FANTASIA. To the contrary, I love it (and I've never needed to \"turn on\" to view it.) If nothing else, our Uncle Walt brought truly beautiful, \"Long Hair\" music to the mass audience of movie-goers. Thanks Walt! * Numbered among them were Messers. Walt Disney,Charles Chaplin Jackie Gleason and Your's Truly.",

We all praise Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Cinderella, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, but for 2D animated films, Disney is most creative with Fantasia. It's wonderfully brilliant because if you think about it, it's one of the first AMVs to ever be made. It sets classical music to animation and manages to make wonderfully brilliant imagery. But its more than that, the music has three forms in Fantasia 1.) Music that tells a definite story, 2.) Music that paints definite pictures, and 3.) music that exists simply for its own sake. Fantasia is composed of eight orchestral pieces which I will list below. 1.) Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach 2.) Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 3.) The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas4.) Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky 5.) The Pastoral Symphony by Ludwig Van Beethoven 6.) Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli 7.) Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky 8.) Ave Maria by Franz Schubert One can love Fantasia purely because of the brilliant music but it's the beautiful imagery that really makes Fantasia stand out. So much of the life experience can be seen in these orchestrations because of how fantastically wonderful and yet mysterious it seems. Walt Disney really created something that was breath-taking in that he made something that added beauty to the life experience. Disney is known for being great at adapting stories: taking a story that we already know and adding a new take on it. The illusion is that Disney is creating new stories, which just isn't the case most of the time. However, with that said, Fantasia is something that is completely original because they're adding visuals to musical compositions. You can't adapt that, it has to be created and Disney really goes above and beyond with it. Fantasia is beauty incarnate, there is no better way to describe it. Watching Fantasia is a truly indescribable experience. It's wonder, it's joy, it's sadness, it's mystery, it's fear, but most of all it's magic, and it remains my favorite Disney piece. Fantasia truly is magnificent and will be remembered for all time.",

I even love the newer Disney movies like Tangled(which is my all time favourite movie btw) and of course Frozen. So my cousin bought me this on DVD for the Xmas as I have never seen Fantasia in my life.According to Disney this is the ONLY Disney movie to have a long running time of 119 minutes. 10 mins in and I was bored of it. Basically its set with orchestra music and we see segments of cartoons. One was about fairies and the music from the nutcracker was been played by some Leopold dude. Then we get to see other bizarre creatures lurking upon us once the film progresses. But if I had to pick one I enjoyed its the Sorcerers one with Mickey Mouse and his broom. I dunno why but that one was good. As for the rest don't even bother. If you are looking for a sing along with talking charcthers then you are in for a shock as this film isn't really a movie AT ALL in fact its more like some concert that Disney wanted to add in his Disney canon next to Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs and Pinochio. Want my advice go watch Tangled or any of the other Disney movies instead. Fantasia is just a boring bland mediocre rip off that I thought would have charcthers talking and singing.

This is followed by Ponchielli's \"The Dance of the Hours\" in which animals represent different parts of the day. The final segment is split in two. The first part is with the music of Moussorgsky's \"A Night on Bald Mountain\" in which the devil makes his dark creatures dance. This is probably the darkest thing I have ever seen in an animated film done by Disney (not counting the Nazi-cartoons they have made). The second part starts with church bells interrupting the devil and after this the morning comes and we hear the world-famous \"Ave Maria\" from Schubert. It is all beautiful, music and animations.If you don't like classical music just watch the wonderful images on screen. \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\" is my favorite segment, may be because it is the only one with a storyline that involves only one real character. All segments are worth watching, so 'Fantasia' is definitely worth watching. Just find anything to enjoy, there must be something.",

Then you gotta pay for the privilege\" mentality that Disney has developed over the years it truly highlighted here. The movie itself is vastly overrated, patience pushing overly-long and aimed almost purely at classical music lovers, and I can only wonder how many children (and adults) this bored to tears over the many decades. Between each unrelated segment the conductor waffles on describing the very simple story you're about to see (thanks for that) and the segments themselves are a mixed bag. The Mickey part is good, along with the dinosaurs and devil parts, but many of the others are just too dull, overly simplistic or hardly anything brilliant, and they go on for far too long. Overall it is very well made and certain parts are still impressive, but the length is overindulgent by a least half an hour and it becomes a chore to sit through, and I doubt many kids, if at all, could make it through until the bitter end without wanting to do something else.",

Directed by Samuel Armstrong and a manifold of other directors, this film shows beautiful flying images with the beautiful philharmonic to listen to throughout the entire film. The cast of characters are animated and throughout each composition. I personally loved this film and i was more then happy to watch it again and again. I wasn't the only one who loved it as this film made over 76,400,000 dollars in the box office.This film garnered a 96% on rotten tomatoes and to quote Bo C 'At the risk of being utterly obvious and just a bit stodgy, perhaps, let us begin by noting that motion-picture history was made at the Broadway Theatre last night with the spectacular world premi\u00e8re of Walt Disney's long-awaited \"Fantasia.\"\"(Crowther). This film was widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of the new age of Hollywood but not only that but animation as well. The animated shorts in the film were aesthetically pleasing and I could see tiny glimpse into the animation they used int the future in their Disney films. I see glimpses of Hercules and many other films that were to come. Overall this film should be revered as one of the best films Walt Disney ever put together. Roger ebert was once quoted in saying that \"Throughout Fantasia, Disney pushes the edges of the envelope\" and they really did, they made something that was not seen in any point in that time. They made something that truly changed the way films were made back then. It also changed how animation and sound were used as this was part of the period where sound was fully introduced into films and cinema. This was one of the first animated films to be fully introduced with sound and it is also one of Walt Disney's masterpieces. This is one that will go down in the annals of time as one of the best made animated films of the golden era of Hollywood.",

The real high light comes with director Ben Sharpenstein's lively treatment of Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". Mickey Mouse stars as the magician's underling who runs amok with his master's wand, with rather damp results.Other classical pieces don't get such a wonderful treatment. In fact with the exception of Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\", which receives a reasonable review, all the other segments lack interest, creativity and style. A real shame considering the positives in this unique Disney picture. While the early pieces show great promise and have much entertainment value, the other slower, more dreary segments weigh the whole show down, making it long winded and tiresome. Still, for innovation alone, it's worth your time.Other classics featured are Beethoven's \"Pastoral Symphony No. 6\", Amilcare Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\", Modeste Moussorgsky's \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and the traditional \"Ave Maria\" sung by Julietta Novis.Friday, March 1, 1996 - Video",

Amuse? Terrify? How about all these things in the same movie???\"Fantasia\" is one prime example of a movie that benefits from repetition. Its charms, its imaginative brilliance, its gentle humor, its artistic genius are drawn out the more it is viewed.The \"Toccata and Fugue\" is an abstract dream. I love the way it subtly moves from visual literalness (colored strings and horns) to inventive fantasy.The \"Nutcracker\" is both beautiful and whimsical. I can't hear the Chinese Dance without seeing that cocksure mushroom trying desperately to catch up on the dance steps of his brethren.Beethoven's \"Pastorale\" has many highlights, including the Pegasus who learns to fly. I wish, wish, wish, though, that Disney's PC patrol hadn't clipped any of the centaurs (I'm against racial bias, but c'mon--how innocent can you get?).\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is a terrific centerpiece. I love watching Mickey wet his finger--in the middle of a maelstrom--to try to turn the page. The way the artists play with light and color make this segment truly nightmarish.\"The Rite of Spring\" is amazing, especially when you consider that the artists of 1940 had to use their imagination regarding *exactly* what dinosaurs looked like (paleontology at the time being what it was).\"Dance of the Hours\" is a wonderful parody of ballet that brims with laugh-out-loud moments: Ben Ali Gator riding the hippo like a merry-go-round and, later, being flattened by her tonnage.\"Night on Bald Mountain\" is terrifyingly weird. The dancing harpies and ghouls are truly disturbing, and the sight of Chernobog at his most wrathful is enough to make anyone squish down in his or her theater seat just a little.\"Ave Maria\" is simply gorgeous, a fitting end.I can't help but be amazed at this film upon every viewing. It was years ahead of its time (a testament to the geniuses behind it), which explains the paltry box-office receipts. The MTV moguls should, on bended knee, thank Walt Disney and Leopold Stokowski nightly. Without their genius at marrying visuals to music, the era of vee-jays may never have come at all.",

Instead we are treated to eight pieces of classical music which are played over animated images that the creators thought best interpreted the music. These include a variety of styles of music; in some cases the animation tells a story; in others it is a succession of images, such as flowers and animals dancing, or appearing to dance and others are more abstract. Each piece is introduced to the viewers with a brief description of the music and its interpretation.It must be stated that the animation is absolutely stunning with incredible detail and motion; it is hard to believe it was hand drawn decades before CGI was invented. The most memorably section is 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' by Paul Dukas; where we see Mickey Mouse enchanting a broomstick to do his chores with disastrous results; this section also has the most obvious story and is the only one to feature an established Disney character. Other sections are equally enchanting; I particularly liked the interpretation of the 'Nutcracker Suite' by Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring'. On the downside it is a little long; younger viewers may prefer watching individual sections rather than sitting down for two hours. Even older viewers may find their minds wandering at times... although hopefully not to much as most of what is on display is utterly enchanting. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of traditional animation as it looks stunning; it may not be as appealing to Disney fans though as it lacks the narrative of their other works.",

            "content": "Ever since I was child, no film has managed to stick around so much in my life and at the same time still spectacularly mesmerize me as an adult as Disney's 1940 masterpiece Fantasia. In the realm of animation, Disney was pioneering with a wide collection of animated films and shorts but nothing to this scale had ever been attempted especially during the time(beginning of the 1940's) when it was made. Fantasia is by far one of the most inventive and awe-inspiring cinematic experiences I have ever been able to see in my life! As a young child I couldn't really appreciate the film so highly beyond it having some neat animation sequences, but as an adult there's so much more I have noticed and grown to be even more fond of.As I said a moment ago, Fantasia is a very inventive piece of work where you have such an eloquent blend of music and animation that come together to create a massive spectacle that you're unlikely to forget. The blending of these elements make each animated sequence full of meaning, emotion, splendor, and awe. Music is such a powerful tool when used to convey meaning within any visual entertainment, which in 1940 a film like this one was rather new for audiences to see. In a way, this film acts as a big experiment bringing filmed orchestral performances played to visualize the story in the music. As a child I was so fascinated by several of the animated sequences, but particularly I was most taken away by 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and 'The Rite of Spring' segments. Both of those segments blew me away with their animation and presentation. I never got tired of seeing these two segments, constantly watching them on repeat almost to the point where you could blindfold me and I would be able to describe to you exactly what is happening on screen. While at times, these animated segments delighted and wondered me but at the same time some would terrify me, specifically 'Night on Bald Mountain'. Getting an emotional reaction from a film like Fantasia is quite interesting not just because you wouldn't expect that from such an old film, but that acknowledgement of credit goes to stellar musical composition+visuals. Even though some moments did scare me, yet that wouldn't be enough to keep me from coming back.From the time I was maybe five or six to now being in my twenties, I will find myself coming back to Fantasia from time to time no matter what the occasion is. It's a timeless piece of entertainment that anyone of any age can go watch at any time in their life. Disney's Fantasia stands out as a big achievement for animation as well as cinematic experiences in such an early days of film entertainment.\nOverall Star Rating: 8.7-8.8/10",

            "content": "Fantasia is Disney's 3rd animated film initially released in 1940, which features animated interpretations of classical music works with a format similar to a concert and is viewed by many as one of Walt Disney's best works, which I completely understand.The movie is beautiful from start to finish, with some beautiful music in the background and beautiful and breathtaking animation which perfectly fits the music playing in the background.The combination of classical music and traditional animation is absolutely clever and the animated interpretations of these pieces are a perfect fit for the background music that was playing.I thought that many of these scenes included in each sequence were also really imaginative and showed that the creators and animators were thinking outside the box and experimenting with animation techniques when animating the interpretations of the classical music pieces that were featured in this film.The animation is absolutely gorgeous from the start to the end of the program, the colors are vivid and lively and the tone is perfect for each sequence and the music playing in the background.The background music playing was able to bring so much emotion to the picture, I found myself feeling sad at times when the music had a more solemn tone and quite excited when the music was more joyful.Although there is no dialogue in the animated sequences, some sequences are nonetheless able to tell us a story thanks to the combination of the music playing and the animation.Although this film is evidently different from other Disney features, this film follows a format similar to a concert rather than telling one whole story. It is arguably of Walt Disney's best works and a pinnacle in the animation genre along with other Disney features released at the time (Snow White, Pinocchio & Bambi).It is a fantastic piece of work featuring beautiful classical music along with gorgeous animation and can bring out and make me feel many emotions during the film, and in some segments was able to tell a story.",

Several musical segments present a variety of themes, notably The Sorcerer's Apprentice with Mickey Mouse involved in something he does not fully understand. Themes of creation present fairies aimlessly spreading fairy dust. This is to symbolize life and beauty. Then a triumphant sequence where dinosaurs engage in battle before being wiped out by the ongoing reality of time. The film's one drawback is its target audience as the sexuality presented should be discussed before children view it. Another area of discernment regards the heavy handed dark adult themes throughout that children may not comprehend. Asides from The Sorcerer's Apprentice other segments are called Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, Nutcracker Suite, The Rite of Spring, The Pastoral Symphony, Dance of the Hours, and Night on Bald Mountain. Stunning animation with life breathed into every image through its music. It is unforgettable art that should provoke a response within the society we live. Score: 9 / 10",

I generally take to the last two segments - \"DAnce of the Hours\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\" - (I mean, c'mon, it's hippos in tutus!).It's an uneven movie, but Walt Disney's head (and heart?) was in the right place.6/10",

This is why: I do love the original Fantasia, but I find that the animated segments resemble each other too much. Only Night on Bald Mountain (and Ave Maria, which is attached to Night on Bald Mountain) is completely unattached from the style of the rest of the animation from the film. Everything, from the abstract Toccata and Fugue segment, the Nutcracker Suite, The Rites of Spring, even The Sorcerer's Apprentice tend to look as if they were animated by Disney artists. This is why, I assume: Disney was the greatest producer of feature-length animation. The styles of other animated films, such as Warner Brothers and UA (e.g., Popeye), were rough and obviously made for sort subjects. Disney probably did not think that his animators needed to look at other artwork in order to inspire their drawings. Therefore, everything begins to look the same, except for the final two pieces, which are completely different. This film's sequel, Fantasia 2000, obviously searches around more to find different inspirations. You cannot tell that the Rhapsody in Blue segment, inspired by the caricatures of Al Hirschfeld, was created by the same person who did The Carnival of Animals, a work on watercolor that looks inspired by Matisse or other similar artists. The Symphony #5 piece does not in any way resemble any other piece. This can be said about every segment in Fantasia 2000. Different art styles, different colors, different media were used in every segment. I gave them both a 9/10, but I do think Fantasia 2000 provides more variety.",

The soundtrack to this is awesome and I recognize some of the tunes, it is presented in such a unique way I cannot begin to emphasize that. The way the conductor of the band will speak to the camera, audience and cleverly it will cut to the next scene, a psychedelic field of mushrooms dancing to a timeless masterpiece. I counted 7 different scenes or different music videos. All were unique in their own way and kept me interested. I now know why this is claimed as Walt Disney's Masterpiece!

            "content": "Double bill time, FANTASIA is an experimental and groundbreaking high-brow entertainment from Disney, seamlessly harmonises two disparate art forms: animation shorts with iconic classical pieces, most of them flout the family-friendly narratives, thus instantly elevate the demography from its common wheelhouse, and creates an unorthodox experience, a combination of cinema and concert, but obviously not such an attraction for kids. The original 1940 version is an ambitious brainchild of Walt Disney honed by sterling expertise from the virtuoso conductor Leopold Stokowski (shot in silhouette behind with lofty glamour and a baton in hand). But it was a fiasco in its original theatre release, widely considered too avant-garde for family audience then, only later revival from re-runs rescues its reputation and gives justice to the talents involved, each piece differs in its visual technique, in retrospective, they are rudimentary 2D prototypes, but in the core, it is their unbridled imagination that stuns us,The seven programs (in total eight pieces whereas Mussorgsky's NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and Schubert's AVE MARIA are fused into one), visually run the full gamut from the abstract patterns (Bach's TOCCATA AND FUGUE IN D MINOR); follows by a seasonal alteration with ballet dances based on Tchaikovsky's NUTCRACKER SUITE; then a mesmerising lesson learnt by Mickey Mouse in Paul Dukas' THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE; next one is the awe-inspiring chronicle from Earth's beginnings to the extinction of dinosaurs (Stravinsky's RITE OF SPRING), which includes a battle sequence of a T-Rex slaughtering a stegosaur, quite candid with brutality in the animal world, which is my personal pick in the miscellany; after the intermission, in Beethoven's THE PASTORAL SYMPHONY, we are ushering to explore the mythological world of centaurs, fauns, cupids and Gods like Bacchus and Zeus himself; next in line is an upbeat ballet (Ponchielli's DANCE OF THE HOURS), four groups of animals, ostriches, hippos, elephants and alligators represent four different time of a day, eventually gyrate together in ludicrous jolliness; the final chapter is the said NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and AVE MARIA combination, the darkest, scariest one, with Chernabog summoning evil spirits from graves to a night of revelry, only retreated by the church bell in the dusk when a congregation of monks march towards a ruined cathedral, wraps up a two-hour optic and aural feast in solemn peace and tranquility.A belated sequel comes almost 60 years later, which self-betrays the concerns of its commercial prospect from the executive level, the 1999 version runs in a succinct 75 minutes (against the original's 120 running length), comprised of eight segments (seven new pieces plus the original THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE), where each is presented by well- known celebrities, unfortunately it bombed in the box-office too, so clearly the running length is not the crux, what one might find lacking is the innovation, since Disney has reached its creative height in the 1990s after BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991), ALADDIN (1992), THE LION KING (1994), etc., the updated FANTASIA is enchanting for sure, my favourite is George Gershwin's RHAPSODE IN BLUE, where a caricature of different characters in NYC in the 1930s is given simplistic beauty and ingenuity, but paralleled with the 1940 version, the leap-of -progress of six decades is not so perceivable, as THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE can comfortably hide its age with the new additions, the traditional way of technique prevails, as excellent as each episode is, exuding their different vibrancy in coherence with the orchestration, it simply cannot overshadow its aged predecessor's glory, although both Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are heading a piece in this picture, and narratives are strong in this version (at least 4 out 8 depicts a story with suspense).Will there ever be a third venture into this unique format? I do hope so, it has its unrivalled advantage to instil an early education of classic music for children, despite the innate shortcoming as a compilation, it can allow more visionary experiments based on the ocean of music notes, both in storyline and its methodology. So, 15 years has passed, hope we don't have to wait for another 45 years for a sequel, also to those who have the knowledge, are these two pictures breaking the record of the longest time between an original and its successor? 59 years seems difficult to beat.",

It's not really for classical music lovers, who are bound to be offended by the way the works are treated, and it's certainly not for people who can't stand classical music. Generally speaking, It's too low for the highbrows and too high for the lowbrows. So who is \"Fantasia\" for, really? Aside from one obvious, 1960s-inspired answer - recreational drug users - I would say it's for animation buffs willing to overlook the pretentious silliness of some scenes and admire instead the striking images of the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence or the abstract designs accompanying Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" or the humor of \"Dance of the Hours\" with its dancing hippopotamuses and alligators, or the segment that started the whole project, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\"(\"Fantasia\" was spoofed in the Warner Bros. cartoon \"A Corny Concerto,\" hosted by a bespectacled Elmer Fudd.

            "content": "Fantasia is a bit of an odd movie. Instead of doing the typical fairy tale coming to life on the screen that Disney was known for, Fantasia is a collection of multiple shorts set to classical pieces of music. None of these shorts are connected in any way (asides from them being made by Disney) so you're essentially getting eight stories for the price of one. I personally have mixed feelings on the film, and I don't think I'm the only one. It's Disney's most experimental film to date and to some it's just not their thing. To put it bluntly, for anyone going in expecting something akin to Pinocchio or Snow White, don't. This is nothing like any other Disney film out there (except for maybe its 2000 sequel). The music and animation are amazing, but that's a given when you're talking about a Disney film. The shorts and their content vary greatly, but my personal favorite is Night on Bald Mountain just because of how not Disney it feels. It's basically a horror musical, and it's great. The design for Chernabog (basically Satan) is simple, yet effective in being nightmare fuel for children. I honestly have no idea how his inclusion got the green light seeing how family friendly the rest of the shorts are in comparison. But I personally think the collection is better for it, because the other shorts, while visually interesting, just don't do it for me. The Sorcerer's Apprentice acted as an attempt to make Mickey Mouse more popular again, and I'd say it's probably my second favorite of the shorts. The story here is simple: Mickey starts messing around with his boss' magical artifacts and it eventually gets out of control. I will say this one has more \"wow\" factor than Night on Bald Mountain with what the animators decided to do visually, but again, it's also not extremely interesting to me. While I don't think Fantasia is for me, I will acknowledge how it was expertly crafted and a bold departure from what people were used to seeing from Disney at the time. I also think the songs meshed really well with the animations, so I'll give it props for that as well. If you're looking for something a little weird and wildly different from other animated movies out there, or you're just into classical music that's accompanied by interesting visuals, Fantasia is probably your best bet.",

Those two cartoon segments should have been part of a separate movie altogether, blowing away all the contemporary \"Horror\" Manga comic stuff coming out of Japan. I never seen a cartoon before show the sides of \"Good\" and \"Evil\" in such contrasting manner, with a strong depth of spirituality. \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" is a great Mickey Mouse feature that should have been made into a separate movie. That's segment's strong messages of \"consequences\" of one's actions is outstanding. The rest? The other segments are not worth talking about, because Warners Brothers Bugs Bunny and Co. did that stuff 20 times better and with a sense of humor.

The animation is nice of course, but there's not really a whole lot to work with when all you have is some vague shapes moving around.The Nutcracker Suite: There's definitely a lot more to work with animation-wise once you actually throw settings, creatures, and objects into the mix, but I still found this one pretty dull compared to most of them. Maybe I'm just tired of hearing \"The Nutcracker\", as it's easily one of the most famous and overused pieces of classical music.The Sorcerer's Apprentice: It's an okay Mickey Mouse short. The water looked really nice in certain shots, particularly in the dream sequence and the whirlpool, but other than that it was probably the most average short on the fronts of both storytelling and animation.Rite of Spring: Easily the strongest of the shorts from a storytelling standpoint, and has some of the best animation as well. I wouldn't call myself a fan of classical music, but this was also probably my favourite composition out of the bunch. Picture \"The Land Before Time\", only even more brutal and with no dialogue.The Pastoral Symphony: This short is colorful, cutesy, and for the most part completely inoffensive, though I think it does go on for a bit too long. Of course, it's impossible to talk about Fantasia without mentioning the controversy surrounding the racial caricature that appears in this short. Normally I can accept this sort of thing as a product of its time, but whatever your personal feelings are, it's made a MILLION times more offensive by Disney essentially trying to hide the scene from existence and acting like it was never part of the equation. Seriously,  Disney for doing that.Dance of the Hours: Not really a whole lot to say about this one; it's just a bunch of animals dancing ballet, with some decent physical comedy. I will say that this probably has the dullest colour palette out of the bunch, and kind of stands out in a bad way for that reason (that really sounds a lot harsher than what I actually feel, but I can't think of a better way to word it, so whatever).Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Marie: Definitely has the best animation out of the bunch, though I think it's somewhat weaker than \"Rite of Spring\" in terms of storytelling. Seriously though, the animation... even if everything about the rest of the movie sucked, it would still be worth watching just for the animation in this short.Ranked Worst to Best-\nToccata and Fugue in D Minor\nThe Nutcracker Suite\nDance of the Hours\nThe Sorcerer's Apprentice\nThe Pastoral Symphony\nNight on Bald Mountain/Ave Marie\nRite of Spring",

When this movie premiered, classical music was still the top for most people, even taking into account the popularity of great orchestra jazz. If it had been done today, probably, musical choice would be very different. People today don't have the required patience to listen to a long piece of music that wasn't meant to be danced by jumping, with a glass in one hand and pointing one finger at Our Lord in Heaven. Today's kids have been consuming radio trash since birth, so it's not surprising that this movie is quite forgotten. I didn't watch the movie in childhood but I saw it as an adult, and I strongly recommended it to some friends who had small children. Even though they might someday not like this kind of music, it seems proved how beneficial it is to small children.In fact, this is one of the most positive aspects of this film or its successor, \"Fantasia 2000\": children get good visual and sound stimuli. And the film is truly beautiful: the quality of the animation is very good and they're well integrated into the rhythm of the music. The succession of the songs interspersed with narrated explanation copies a bit of what we can find in a live concert, and the orchestra direction of Leopold Stokowski, one of the great orchestra conductors of twentieth century, is irreproachable. The big problem with this movie is obvious: since it's virtually a concert, it goes straight to the dustbin if you dislike this type of music.",

However, for a very well known Walt Disney original movie, I went in with high expectations. Not only were those expectations met, but they were greatly exceeded. I had always been fond of the idea of translating sound and music into art, and Walt Disney mastered it. The animation was nostalgic to watch, as it had become a lost art in the current world of CGI, and it was relieving. The scenes were creative and represented the music to each and every instrument. It was exciting and relaxing, the music flowed, and the animation flowed with it. The music burst, and the animation burst as well. Both the music and the animation had the magic touch of Walt Disney and it was phenomenal to see again.",

As somebody who isn't a fan of classical music, but greatly appreciates it, I didn't have very high hopes of enjoying it. However, the team of artists, including the one and only Walt Disney, made something no short of a masterpiece. The visuals they have created to accompany these famous pieces are beautifully made and fit perfectly. Together, both art forms bring each other alive and provide an enjoyable viewing experience. As a result of watching this film, I have developed a greater appreciation for classical musicians and artists/animators alike. Definitely a movie to show my future kids someday!",

'Night on a Bare/Bald Mountain' with its devilish and sinister undertones blends beautifully into 'Ava Maria', all white lights and angels. It is an unforgettable moment.Fantasia is a milestone in animation and one which deserves to be remembered with great affection.

This film is so advanced for being made in 1940. It was amazing how they did it all. The music in this film is also well known by many and was a really big part to the movie. The Philadelphia Orchestra was in charge of the music. There was very little dialogue and that's why the music was huge because it basically took over for the little dialogue.

The people behind this movie made various animations that they felt went along with several classical musical pieces. The best segment out of all of them is the very last one with the devil. It was incredibly atmospheric and well done. The Sorcerer's Apprentice bit was good for a laugh, and the abstract pieces at the beginning did a fine job at letting the animator's creativity flow. There isn't anything bad about the film to be honest. It just isn't something you can watch a whole lot. It is an undeniably important film and I think people should still watch it.

Maybe that's why I was so partial to it when I would hear that the first fantasia was so much better than the one I already knew. It turns out those people had a point. Nothing feels forced as the conductor and the musicians around him actually stop to breathe in between the pieces they're playing. In addition, many of the musical bits with their animation; (which I have inevitably come across on the Internet) are really so much more impact-full in context. More time and attention seems to be given to each piece, which leads to numbers that can slowly fade in or out at the musics' pace-unhurried. There are a lot of moments throughout that will make someone familiar with the 40's and some of its ideas laugh for sure. I also feel as if the orchestra is more connected to what they are playing; rather than being swept aside by the animation. Though, the animation is stunning. When you consider that computers and just technology surrounding film, (let alone that in everyday life,) was nowhere near it is today; it's hard not to appreciate the time and skill that it really took to create an animation: let alone a Disney Animation. So glad I watched this! Though I still recommend seeing the later 200's version as well, because there are a few breathtaking numbers to be seen within; just know that the atmosphere of the two films do differ some.",

At the beginning and in between segments, Deems Taylor comes on screen, in front of the Philadelphia Orchestra to elaborate on details about the music and the story/scenes before they play. These parts are really insightful and regardless that this movie is otherwise entirely animated and known for it, I think they are important. It makes the world inside the movie so much more accessible. The animations range from abstract scenes with no meaning, to fictional stories, to historical accounts. They even have an intermission. I felt pretty classy just watching that part, watching the banter between the musicians. it made me wish I could get up quickly to buy a bag of popcorn.

And I mean \"awkward\" quite literally as no one seems to tell the narrator that the camera is rolling, and often times they fail to cut the awkward pauses where he just stares at the camera immediately after a song ends.If you aren't expecting a concert and you are expecting a movie, you will be sorely disappointed.",

            "content": "How do you judge this?It is an art form, that is all too obvious.  Perhaps this is the closest thing to such a genre that Disney will ever undertake.  If I have one complaint about the artwork, it's the clashing or repetition of styles. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\" look the same whereas \"Symphony No. 6\" and \"Dance of the Hours\" carry a different visual theme.  Nonetheless, this is probably Disney's most lavish visual work until The Rescuers Down Under and, subsequently, The Lion King.  This is in a league all to its lonesome.Before MTV came around this was probably the best thing to represent the musical (this isn't to say MTV does a good job, far from it) because it isn't concerned about characters, acting, singing, or pacing.  Just artists and musicians.My personal favorites have to go to \"Rite of Spring\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\".  In \"Rite\", the animators aren't trying to create some bulky hippo in a tutu or dancing fawns.  It is concerned with realism and fluidity, not exaggeration.  In that respect, it succeeds.  \"Night\" remains the best marriage of music and visuals in the entire film because it is not afraid to go the distance.  I haven't a clue what Disney's religious affiliation is, but this this is probably the closest he gets to debating \"good and evil\" in the harshest terms possible in all his work.Overall, beautifully made, this should be a must for music and art appreciators, Disney fans, and those looking for something different.  4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "I will review this movie and all the segments.1. Toccata and Fugue in D minor. This is a great way to introduce the audience to Fantasia, with abstract art. However it is one of my lesser favorite segments, since some of the visuals could have been done better. However this is just nitpicking. Not much to say about this segment, other than it's a great way to introduce the audience to Fantasia. 8/10.2. The Nutcracker Suite. This one i will have to say is my favorite segment from this entire movie. I find myself stoning to this segment everytime i watch it. And the visuals are just amazing. I mean, you just feel like your in the forest or in a garden throughout this entire segment. Probably my favorite scene is when Autumn comes and these fairies turn the green leaves orange or brown. Not much more to say other than, just perfect. 10/10.3. The Sorcerer's Apprentice. This one i love like everyone else, and i think it's a classic. However, i still think it is overrated. That is because this is most people's or at least alot of people's favorite segment, the reason is probably that it's the most famous segment. And i disagree with that, since there are many superior segments in this movie. But i still think it's creative, fun and well drawn. 9/10.4. The Rite of Spring. This i will have to say is my second favorite segment in Fantasia. Although science not art wrote the story of this segment, they create something artistic out of something scientific, and i love that. This segment is very need and original. This is what Disney's Dinosaur or Walking with Dinosaurs should have been. Sadly though this is some people's least favorite segment, since some people feel it's too long. Come on the Pastoral Symphony was just as long, and no one is complaining about that. And Dinosaur experts also complain about Jurassic Period Dinosaurs and Cretaceous Period Dinosaurs living together, and the fact that it wasn't a meteor but climate change that caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs. Now i'm not a Dinosuar expert, but from what i can gather from my research, this was pretty scientifically accurate for it's time. It wasn't generally accepted in the 1940s that a meteor caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs, and there were many theories as to why they became extinct. And as for the Jurassic and Cretaceous Dinosaurs living together, most Dinosaurs were at the time thought to have lived at the same time. Even Stravinsky didn't like this segment for some reason. Either way, this segment is a classic. I especially love the scene where the Prehistoric Bacteria are acting like cute Disney animals. That is just genius and adds alot of personality to the segment. And who can forget the famous fight scene between the Tyrannosaurus and the Stegosaurus. An absolute classic. 10/10.5. The Pastoral Symphony. This is another great segment. I love the idea of it, and the artstyle is great. Although it may be a little too cute for some people, the scene with Zeus makes up for that. Not much more to say about it. 9/10.6. The Dance of the Hours. This i will have to say is my least favorite segment of this entire movie. It's not bad, and it does fit the movie. And it is fitting to have a more comedic segment. However i for some reason didn't find it all that funny. However there were scenes that made me chuckle, and it is well drawn. 7/10.7. The Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria. This is my third favorite segment in this movie. I love the design of Chernobog and the depiction of hell. And the Ave Maria is just one of the most beautiful moment made by Disney. A great way to end the movie. Not much more to say about this segment that people haven't said before. 10/10.Other than a few of the segments not being that good, this movie does have a few other flaws. I really didn't think the movie needed the scenes with the host. I know Fantasia was suppose to become a film series, and this movie was meant to just be an introduction to that, and they were probably going to leave the host out for the other movies. But i still thought the host was boring to sit through. But this is just nitpicking.This movie is a true classic and one of my favorite Disney movies. 10/10",

From Mickey Mouse as the mischievous and rather comical \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to the scary and strong imagery of demons in \"Night on Bald Mountain\", it is all spectacular. This movie maybe over sixty years old, but I have to say that this is among the masterworks of animation not only of Walt Disney, but of everything else.I have to admit though that the \"Rites of Spring\", the life and destruction of the dinosaurs is rather dull and almost never-ending (since the piece is over 20 minutes long). Otherwise, I still enjoy it. If I can't see the movie, I'll listen to it on my soundtrack copy. 10/10",

            "content": "This is an animated film with pieces of classical music along with animated stories. Most of the stories with classical music are absolutely beautiful and completely magical, which is why I like this film. Some other people will find all the stories boring, but they are simply classics and masterpieces in Disney. Here is a list of all the story pieces with their music accompanies:Johaan Sebastastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: Fantasia begins with this portrayal of what may pass through your mind when you hear music. When the music first plays, you see the large orchestra away at their instruments. As it goes onto cartoon, you see many different shapes, colours and movements. Whether this would pass through your mind or not when you listen to music, this story, to begin, is very beautiful and well animated. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker ,Part 1: This is the first part of the Nutracker, each one very short and showing a little story, all the parts are related. This part shows fairies in the night decorating flowers. Nice animation and music, but that is pretty much it. 6 and a half/10. Part 2: This part shows toadstalls dancing and is probably the most noticeable of the Nutcracker parts. The music here is pleasant and the toadstalls are entertaining, resembling Chinese people. 7/10 Part 3: Possibly the most mediocre of the Nutcracker parts, here flowers in water dance and there is one white flower that dances about the most. There is nothing really special about this story at all. It is not even that beautiful. Frankly I am not sure why the Disney company bothered. 5/10. Part 4: Other people will certainly think otherwise, but this is almost definitely my favourite Fantasia story. It shows fish in a river and has very beautiful animation and the situation under the water feels very interesting and surreal. The music is also very good here, but it does not seem to be very popular compared to some other parts of the Nutcracker. Well worth it for me. 10/10 Part 5: Also noticeable and very jolly, is this part of the Nutcracker. It shows flowers dancing, resembling Russian people. The animation is very interesting and so is the music. It is possibly a bit too short. 7/10 Part 6: A rather well-known part of Nutcracker in Fantasia, this one features fairies creating autumn, then spring. The animation and music are very beautiful here and the colours are well-portrayed for the seasons shown. 8/10Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice: The most famous of all the Fantasia pieces, this one starrs the ever famous Mickey Mouse wtih his sorcerer's hat - trying to do magic - but not managing very well. I personally do not find this as good as it could be, but Mickey Mouse has a bright personality and this makes the story bearable. 7/10Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring: This has been transformed into a portrayal of the ancient world - the forming of the earth, the first creatures on earth and dinosaurs. Personally this is my third favourite of all the stories. The animation, the music and the modern (of that time) portrayal of ancient earth. 9/10.Meet the Soundtrack: This is a sweet little introduction of the person whom we all know well - the Soundtrack! As we meet him, portrayed as a line, he performs different pieces of instruments and forms into many different shapes and colours. The meeting is very pleasant, nice and relaxing - not really a story. 9/10Ludwig van Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony: This story shows many different creatures (none of them entirely human) in a mythical world, resembling Greek Mythology. The music, colours and plot are very interesting, bright and mythical. This piece has a very \"Disney childish\" feeling to it, unlike any of the other stories. Well worth watching. 8/10Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours: Also showing a slight \"Disney Childish\" style, is this story - featuring dancing ostriches, hippopotami, elephants and crocodiles doing ballet. The plot is not very structured, but it does not spoil this piece. This story is very light and silly. 7/10Modest Mussorgy's Night on Bald Mountain: This is my personal least favourite story in Fantasia as, because of the devil, it is very disturbing. The piece of music chosen helps with this scariness of the story, but it is really the animation that makes this story so terrifying. Funnily enough, this is one of the most well-known stories of Fantasia, among with, of course, The Sorcerer's Apprentice. I personally think that the music is very good. 3/10Franz Schubert's Ave Maria: This story is my second favourite Fantasia story. It comes right after Night on Bald Mountain and shows, in fabulous animated detail, who look like nuns going into church through a forest. The music and forest make this slow but incredible piece worthwhile. The opera is incredibly beautiful and so is the last five minutes of the story, which is very emotional.I recommend this to anyone who respects classical music and enjoys Disney. Enjoy \"Fantasia\"! :-)",

But I had never seen the actual film until now.It pains me that I didn't like it very much. I was hoping it would blow me away. I'm a music fan (also classical to some extent) and I really like the concept of creating animation to match the music. But then again I'm not very big fan of Disney style animation (those silly-looking animal characters). The best parts for me were the Rite of Spring with dinosaurs and especially the closing part with the devil mountain and Ave Maria. If the whole movie was as good as that final part I could give the movie a bit higher rating.In a way Fantasia is fantastic if you think it was made in 1940. Back then it must have been the most amazing thing you have ever seen. Looking at the screen it could as well be from the 70s or something. So you could say it was ahead of its time. But for me personally I thought it is a bit boring honestly and I'm not going to buy it for my own collection. But if there was a chance I might want to see it on the big screen.",

            "content": "I watched \"Fantasia\" a couple of weeks ago, and it's been on my mind a bit since. This isn't a film with a flowing narrative; it consists of a series of animations set to popular classical music. There are segments which have a little story to tell, but none flow into each other. It seems like the animators were just told to animate what they feel (if I recall, that is exactly what the host, played by Deems Taylor, says), and that is what this film seems like to me \u2013 the animator's emotions and experiences whilst listening to timeless music. Some of the segments left little to no impact on me. That is not to say that the animation in such segments wasn't stunning, as it is throughout. All were beautiful and the music is fantastic. Instead of focusing on all of the segments, I'm going to focus on those I remember most, the ones I enjoyed the most. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" based on the piece of the same name by Paul Dukas, shows Mickey Mouse (voiced by Uncle Walt himself) as the apprentice of a powerful sorcerer. The sorcerer has Mickey do chores like mop the floor and so on, while Mickey idolises his mentor to the highest degree. However, one evening when the sorcerer goes to bed, Mickey doesn't feel like filling the well with water, so he dons his mentor's hat and brings a broomstick to life, making him do all the work. However, this leads to hundreds of brooms flooding the place, and Mickey having to figure out how to stop them. The animation is beautiful, as is most done by Disney, and the timing is magnificent. It's just a fun little cartoon. It's easy to see why sorcerer Mickey is one of Disney's biggest trademarks, heck I even have a pair of the furry years ant hat from Disneyland! My favourite segments would have to be \"Rite of Spring\" and \"Dance of the Hours.\" The former is just so poignant and breathtaking, and the music just seems to match the tone the segment is trying to set. The animation, especially on the lava and water and during the t-rex attack, is just phenomenal. I have no idea how they paced this thing, but by God they did it will. It's also heartbreaking! These poor animals just drop dead! I liked these creatures; they had so much character even though they spoke nary a word! It ends on such an ambiguous note, with such subtlety and intrigue. It's just lovely. \"Dance on the Hours\" is a rather baffling affair, but my God it looks beautiful. The lighting, the colours, the designs on the animals. How did they make a hippo so graceful? I have no idea, but then again that seems to be the magic of Disney. They can make the impossible possible. The little romance between the hippo and alligator is just adorable; sometimes things can be said without uttering a word. People are going to smite me for this, but I didn't see what was so special about \"The Night on Bald Mountain.\" It's beautiful and thought provoking, the music was nice ... and that's it. The only thing massive about the last segment to me was Chernabog himself; I mean, he is the devil. The devil is one scary guy. Other than that, after all I'd heard about Bald Mountain, it just seemed underwhelming. In my opinion, \"Rite of Spring\" would've been a better finale. It's much more evocative to me.Overall, \"Fantasia\" is pretty damn good. I don't find it as amazing as other Disney fans do, but it is gorgeous to look at, and groundbreaking to boot. There is this sort of charm about it, this air of grandeur. It is worth checking out.8/10.",

Also, it totally dispenses with plot and lets the imagination of the images run wild with style.  Excellent mixture of images and music puts it above the average Disney cartoon as one of the best. Presents some extraordinary technicolors effects with fantastic results. The best episodes in Fantasia(1940) are \"THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE\" & \"NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN\".  \"NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN\" segment is possibly the scariest Cartoon that Disney put on film.

            "content": "Walt Disney's visionary masterpiece is as enduring today as when it was first released in 1940.  Though one might assume that this is a film for children, it really knows no age, and it is just as enjoyable for adults. The combination of beautiful classical music led by renowned conductor Leopold Stokowski, and amazing animations from the Disney team is a banquet for the senses.What is so amazing about this film is how far ahead of its time it was. Disney had already pioneered the concept of bringing classical music to children with `Silly Symphonies' which were animated shorts set to familiar classical pieces.  He had developed the Multiplane camera, which allowed animations to appear as if they had depth.  He had assembled an enormous team of animators and redefined the industry.  Everything was in place for a chance meeting with Leopold Stokowski that flowered into a collaboration of obsessive geniuses that would become Fantasia.Fantasia really consists of a series of enchanting animated shorts, each adapted to a particular piece of classical music.  There are free form abstract interpretations like the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (Johann Sebastian Bach), a Mickey Mouse version of the Sorcerer's Apprentice (Paul Dukas), and interpretive pieces such as the Pastoral Symphony (Ludwig van Beethoven) and the Nutracker Suite (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky).  The selection of the music and the animators' perfect synchronization of the visual images produces a magical and seamless product that makes it seem that the music is written for the images rather than the other way around.Another groundbreaking concept was the sound.  Disney invented a system of multiple tracks that he called Fantasound, that placed microphones throughout the orchestra and recorded each track separately.  The theaters were then fitted with numerous speakers all around the room that made the sound feel as if it was coming from everywhere.  With this, Disney created surround-sound fifty years before its time.  To understand what an achievement this was, one would need to understand that simple two speaker stereo hadn't yet been invented.  The DVD was re-mastered from Disney's original Fantasound soundtrack making the surround-sound spectacular.\nThe animations were nothing short of miraculous.  There was neither digital technology nor computer graphics in 1940.  Each frame of the film had to be individually drawn by an animator.  One frame took an animator about three hours to complete and there were 24 frames per second.  That meant that each second of the film required three full days of labor to produce.  The work necessary to produce the smoothly flowing images we see is mind-boggling.The DVD contains a fascinating featurette on the making of the film, including some priceless footage of Disney interviews.  He poured his soul into the project and he was crushed that Fantasia was a financial failure when it was released.  He endured the negative criticism of its artistic value with great anguish.  Little did he know that it would be re-released countless times and eventually become a pop cultural institution. \nThis is a joyful assembly of imagination, invention and dedication, which has left the entire world richer.  It is the consummate animated experience. My rating is 10/10.  It is one of the few DVD's that I own.  Buy it today and marvel at its timeless magic.",

            "content": "\"Fantasia\" is a very uneven piece of entertainment. It contains some amazing and heart-warming sequences (take the one with the fairies as an example) and some boring and heart-worming parts (cf. the one with centaurs). The range of my emotions can be described from \"Superb! Enthralling! Amazing!\" (cf. \"Tagline\") to \"Is it supposed to be ... what? Who is responsible for this stupid \"ani-mess\"?\".Music goes from enjoyable (Tchaikovskiy) to something unintelligible (don't know who is the composer but I simply cannot catch a beautiful melody - what is it for, then?). In my humble opinion, they should have picked out only the most memorable classic music scores. A plain gal or boy could help them to carry out this task without scientifically metaphysical (or should I say \"metaschizically\"?) approach. Some super intelligent professor was in charge of that task instead, I guess.As to the \"cast\", the famous characters are ruining \"Fantasia\". Instead of receiving a universal status it becomes \"one of Mickey's adventures\" on screen. Did the animators run out of the ideas? Where is Donald Duck then? And Goofy? And Mermaid? If I want to see Mickey Mouse, I watch his adventures (there are loads of those shorties) but what the hell is this mouse doing here? What do I consider to be brilliant? Well, the first abstract animated piece that is developed from the musicians' silhouettes. The piece with the goldfish. The piece with the dancing flowers.5 out of 10. A very good and innovative try but half of the running time it is, alas, awkward and I would not show the whole feature to children - only, maybe, 45 enjoyable minutes out of this mess.",

If anyone was planning to become an animator and needed advice, I would recommend this film. The design team keeps the themes diverse enough and the music synonymous with its animated counterparts extremely well. It really goes to show that time, money and effort is all it takes to create a masterpiece. No wonder it was remastered in the year 2000!",

My list included `Walt Disney'.Look: I am not joking. I was brought up as a kid on such fare as Bambi, Snow White and her cute dwarfs, Lady and The Tramp, Peter Pan and Wendy, and so on. But I grew up and tastes changed, and classical music moved into my life \u0096 and so did `Fantasia'.Long before computers and digital electronics and all those special effects, so apparent in more recent times, back in the 40s and 50s Disney was already producing wonderful works. But `Fantasia' crowns them all. It is a triumph of imagination put to music which excels anything else I have ever seen in cartoon animation. Wonderful choice of music, and the great Leopold Stokowski, with what was in those times a new way of looking at classical music, conducting the Philadelphia, was indeed an excellent idea. Today, well into my 50s, I can put this video on as often as I wish: no way could it ever bore me. Absolutely a must present for teenagers, or even younger, who have any interest in real music and whose intellect clambers out of the foaming pool of idiocy in most brainless modern animated cartoons.\nWalt Disney's `Fantasia' is one of the most brilliant things ever to have been made for the screen.",

            "content": "WOW! I've seen this movie lots and lots of times and I STILL am breathless by its powerful spell! \"Fantasia\" is definitely Walt Disney's greatest masterpiece, cartoon-films just don't come better - not even these days, I don't think because these days animated films are just getting worse leaving us with less good films than we deserve to see and it's totally unacceptable. But this kind of feature just never fails to amaze me every time I see it, it has absolutely EVERYTHING you would want to see in a fantastic film, e.g Walt Disney has chosen a very good selection of classical music pieces, the animation is just stunning with rich colours, the sound powerfully attracts your attention being so loud and bold and clear (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor the beginning piece) and at the very end of that segment you see Leopold Stokowski, \"Fantasia\"'s conductor, conducting the Philadepia Orchestra with so much power and emotion and he is stood on his platform doing this while a dramatic sunset shining with glorious rays of light just attracts the eye and. Toccata and Fugue has been visualized in abstraction and the abstract images that Walt Disney has created, from what I've seen, aren't quite as attractive and as unusual as Oskar Fishinger's interpretations but you can kind of accept it. The upcoming pieces tell a proper story and, except for \"A Night on Bald Mountain\" (because it's so frightening), I think they are great stories and ANOTHER reason I think \"Fantasia\" is such a special, incredible film is that it magically gets people to just wake up, get out of things like Eminem and Pink and The Black-Eyed Peas and the ever cocky Robbie Williams and just appreciate the beauty and the emotion of classical music whether it's contemporary and recent or extremely old. My father gave myself, Natalie (my sister) and William (my half-brother) \u00a3100 each to spend during the summer. I intended to spend it on \"The Fantasia Anthology\" which is a 3-DVD box set on \"Fantasia\", \"Fantasia 2000\" and \"The Fantasia Legacy\" (a special bonus disc). The old box-set I had for this powerful film was called \"The Fantasia DVD Collection\" which was so poor and incredibly dull compared to the \"Anthology\" which cost exactly \u00a3100. But \"The Fantasia Anthology\" only plays in Region 1 and that's not where we are in England, sorry to say! However Richard, my step-dad, did manage to track down one from China that plays in any region. Sadly, as much as I adored it and preferred it by a long way to the old one which was rubbish, it was poor and now we've got to wait for a replacement! However, after finding out that there were LOTS of delays between here and China, I wanted my \u00a3100 back again and this time we've managed to track down one from our very own homeland - ENGLAND! It does still play only on Region 1 but we did buy an all-region DVD player for my room and, so I believe, chucked out the plain Region 2 player. We believe it'll arrive here by mid-next-week at the very latest! I CAN HARDLY WAIT! I urge you! If you want to literally feel invigourating power from a 3-Disc DVD Box set then you've got to save up your money whether it's pounds, dollars, francs (in the case of France) and get it... FAST! It will be so exciting to see the original film uncut and the scenes probably not a soul from this generation has seen. There are so appealing and amazing, however, I suffered great disappointment when I discovered that the soft, sticky voice of Deems Taylor was dubbed by the irritating voice of Corey Burton. I just don't get it! Why would Disney productions want to get rid of the real thing, the original voice? They kept the original soundtrack! So why bin the original narrative-descriptions? For crying out LOUD! Are they totally mad? How VERY silly?! Walt Disney said so himself that he intended for all his films to be as original as possible and I think it's absolutely shameful for this modern generation of film-makers to just go against his wishes! Deems Taylor's voice is like butterscotch angel-delight and Corey Burton's voice is like a box of kitchen-knives. When I heard THAT voice and not the original one I thought, \"oh, NO! Nearly 2 hours of that horrid voice and what's more we don't have the opportunity to hear the original narrator talk to us himself in the deleted scenes!\" Corey Burton really, really drives me up the wall and makes me sad to have to overdub that lovely, original voice! When I hear him speak, with him thinking he is better than EVER at the fun job of narrating \"Fantasia\", I can tell he's just so full of himself, and, yeah OK, narrating a film as stunning as this must be a lot of fun but this role is Deems Taylor's and NOT Corey Burton's! I hear him talk I kind of say \"oh just shut your mouth and go away, you impostor, we want Deems Taylor back (the real one)!\"",

I never get over its wonder, its beauty, and its presentation. Even if Fantasia 2000 is just as good, this one holds a special place.This was when Disney had it made. This was when Disney made quality films that would not reach this kind of quality until the 90's. I didn't even re-watch this film to give this review, because I know it by heart and it is just stunning all on its own. Growing up on Disney films in general doesn't hinder my love for this film as well as many others.As a child, and an adult, I adore the Rite of Spring scene, the Pastoral Symphony, as well as the Night on Bald Mountain with the devil on the mountain. I don't remember being afraid of any of it, and I loved its color, form, and transition. I never get over it. I was--am--an animal lover and those scenes made my life as a little girl obsessed with horses, dragons, dinosaurs, fantastical creatures, and everything art. Fantasia is a fire to the imagination and a major inspiration for me as an artist.One thing though that has bothered me for a while was The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Even as a kid, I never liked it as much as I had everything else. I was never into Mickey Mouse as a character anyway (I preferred Donald and Goofy); I liked the old cartoons, but nowadays Mickey has been sugar coated beyond recognition, and he seems more like a children's cash cow more than a beloved character. He used to be so very charming, like he was in this short, but even now I can't really enjoy it as much as the other ones. It felt kind of out of place for me, simply because we have this lovely bounty of beautifully drawn Pegasus horses and devils and realistic-looking dinosaurs that are anatomically incorrect juxtaposed to modern science; and yet, even though it is their company's namesake, they add Mickey Mouse to an otherwise serious yet lighthearted picture? It is in the Disney style, sure, but I wouldn't be missing it. That sounds harsh, but it's just my personal taste. On its own, though, I like it. It's a nice story and I love the work that the company went into it. I understand why so many people loved it as a short.10 out of 10 is rarely a given, but this is something that holds an importance to me and for film in general. It was a masterpiece of its time, and it continues to be. I loved Fantasia 2000 for bringing what Fantasia did before, and all the love and attention was put into both pieces. A well-deserved rating, at least for me.",

You have The Sorcerer's Apprentice (possibly Mickey Mouse's finest hour), but then you have the truly nightmarish Night On Bald Mountain.

Fantasia takes that idea to an extreme, and what came from it was an unconventional, and beautiful film. The film is made up different animated segments, interluded with live action bits of the orchestra. Each segment tells a different story, but in a very unique way. The only dialogue is when the conductor directly addresses the audience, so the stories are told solely through music and animation. All of the movements in the animation line up perfectly to the music, and instead of taking a lot of time establishing characters, Fantasia delivers just the raw emotions. The only issue I have with Fantasia is that the segments are very different emotionally, so watching it all at once as a feature, while interesting, might not be as effective as just watching one segment at a time.",

            "content": "After 60 years it does not need to be said that this is a great classic film, and it is one that certainly repays viewing periodically. I still find this to be true even though I personally am not a lover of animation, and the quality of the animation in this film is both a little dated and somewhat uneven. I have noted that the IMDB already has some 60 viewer comments about this film on line, and until today have not felt justified in adding to these. However I recently reviewed the very few films which I believe have made a major contribution to the development of cinematography as we know it today, and this has led me to decide to send you one brief additional review, making a point which perhaps has not been adequately covered by the comments you already have on line.The modern cinema is far too dependent upon the use of electronic mood music, usually of very poor quality, to help a viewer follow a story. Fantasia stands almost alone as a very popular film which showed that a good cinema with a high quality sound reproduction system has immense potential for use as a concert hall in many smaller communities where this is an unavailable luxury. It is a great pity that more film studios do not appreciate this and generate a series of films where the story is ancillary to the sound track and where really high quality music is offered to the audience as the prime attraction.",

I wish there were more movies like this one, making stories to go along with orchestral pieces. All of the animation was beautifully drawn out and tied into the songs perfectly. Towards the middle, to me personally, I tend to get a bit drawn away when it comes to the dinosaur part. Everything before that is what I feel like is the best part of the film. The transitions from the live orchestra into the animated scenes are an interesting touch, with the short description of the animated scene that we are about to watch with the name of the piece we are going to be listening to. I will always recommend this movie to anyone who has not yet seen it because it is one that everyone should watch at least once.",

The scene with Mickey is also very good and very well interpreted.The other pieces aren't bad either but not of the high level of those mentioned above.Still,each piece is very well put together with the music although the music is often manipulated to serve the animation.The best scenes are also pretty scary and therefore not very well suited for the usual Disney viewer,small children.The devil and the T-Rex are very scary underlined by the frenzy of the musical pieces. And there is nudity(!)in this picture,the scene with the horsewomen and the scene with the devil has got nudity.Disney took a huge risk with making this movie but he succeeded very well and made one of his best efforts with this animated concert.

I mean, I understand what they were trying to do, but some of the segments just dragged on and on! However, I did love the \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" segment. It was the segment I was looking forward to. However, it's the third segment out of eight. I did enjoy \"Dance of the Hours\" and \"Night on Bald Mountain\", but the other segments bored me.

Fantasia.\nWith a catchy soundtrack composed of classical music led by Leopold Stokowski, beautiful animations and an orchestrated narrative structure, something totally different for an animated film.

Yes, controlled. In fact, it is actually the music the protagonist of the movie. All the characters and the stories are meant to follow the rhythm of the music, and not vice versa. There is no need of dialogues because the music provides a full understanding of what it is going on in the movie. For example, Tchaikovsky's music is associated to the changing of the seasons while Musorgskij' Night on Bald Mountain and Shubert's Ave Maria symbolize the presence of \"good\" and \"evil\". I believe that this movie created a new way to delivery storytelling, where there is no need of chronological stories or dialogues to understand it, but it only requires lot of imagination. Another thing I really liked is the accurate use of color palette. For example, for the changing of the seasons, they would use soft colors to describe fall and blueish and cold colors to refer to winter. Again, Fantasia is more than just an animated movie, but it is merely a piece of art.",

            "content": "I thought Fantasia was just another Disney movie, but after watching the film my opinion changed; in a positive way. I was impressed with the creativity and the quality of the element combinations between the orchestra music and the animations. Also, there was a smooth transition feeling between the various segments of the movie; making each segment more enjoyable. The colors in this magical musical animation were amazing. All the scenes were pretty much full of colors and made me feel as I was a child again. The colors were bright and dark at times, but they were brought to live with the music allowing the audience to relax and enjoy the visual elements. The lighting plays an important part of the film. In parts of the film, like in the Sorcerer's Apprentice, the lights and shadow gave a more realistic look at the animation. For example, Mickey Mouse salutes Mr. Taylor (the narrator) at the end of the segment, providing a unique interaction between real and fictional characters. Lastly, during the orchestra intermissions, the audience can appreciate the human and musical instrument's shadows as they are living to take a break; this effect lets the audience feel as you are sitting down in a theater, watching the orchestra perform live. Fantasia is educational and provided a lot of elements for the audience to use their imagination. A good example is the prehistoric segment as it educates about different dinosaurs and their food sources; and how the world changed to a new era. Also, there are other segments in which people can relate to their belief and dreams. Overall the movie is great to explore imagination and enjoy classical music with art, but I would recommend not watching it if you are tired or you could relax too much and fall asleep. To fully enjoy the movie, make sure you are rested and transport to a colorful world.I must add that Fantasia is not for all audiences unless you enjoy classical music and animations; and if you are watching the film with children, please be prepared to explain some scenes as the general audience standards for rating movies and TV shows have changed. Thus, parents should watch the film before their kids to be ready to answer questions such as the naked angels, dark and mean Gods, Mickey Mouse using an ax to chop up a broom, fighting horses acting like ducks, and so on. This is a beautiful movie, but as times have changed and what was acceptable before, it is not anymore.",

            "content": "After \"Snow White\" and \"Pinocchio\", what would Walt Disney do next? Would he take another famous fairy tale and turn it into an animated musical? Or would he try to do something else? Something crazy? Innovative? Extraordinary? Well, simply said, he did something else. And not something ordinary, nor rudimentary.Disney, along with his faithful collaborators, created \"Fantasia\". What is \"Fantasia\"? For objective writers, it's a set of animated cartoons mixed with famous classical music pieces. For me, it's the most wonderful animated feature created by Walt Disney.The main reason why \"Fantasia\" is a unique animated picture is because animation becomes an entity itself, something that never happened with any animated feature, before or since. The best example is the first piece: \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. In this part, music is mixed with simple images which represent nothing. You can see musical notes flying over a uniform font and dancing over and over. This kind of animated trick could be seen as easy and unextraordinary today, but remember that this was done in 1940, with archaic methods. The result of this part is the most intricate of all the sketches, while it may not appeal to everybody. In fact, it's the only moment where you can follow the music. Anywhere else, it's the animated scenes that catch you first.The second cartoon is \"Nutcracker Suite\". Here, it's still a ballet, but it's done by mushrooms, fairies, leaves etc. I loved it. The mix of natural elements with animation is simply well done and the music is enthralling.Then comes the most famous part of them all: \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\". The main reason why it became the most popular piece of \"Fantasia\" is Mickey Mouse's presence, who stars as the young apprentice , who decide to test the wizard's hat powers in order to allege his tasks. Eventually, it turns into a catastrophe, but things go back in order with the wizard's intervention. That's maybe the easiest part to follow, because it's the only one which has a narrative. The catchiest parts are surely Mickey's dream with the shooting stars, the waves and the clouds.\"The Rite of Spring\" is next and it features the Earth's evolution, from its creation till the dinosaurs' extinction. Inbetween, there's a spectacular volcanic eruption extravaganza and dinosaur battles. These scenes were controversial to me, because the level of fright during the battles was high and I don't think it should appeal to young children. But for more mature audience, it's a great show.Beethoven's 6th Symphony was one of my favorites, as it features mythological creatures, such as centaurs and Cupids, but also a funny Dionysos.The last ones (\"Dance of the Hours\", \"Night on Bald Mountain\" and \"Ave Maria\") were great as well, but I didn't find them as entertaining as the others.Overall, the musical feelings of the classical pieces and the animated scenes are matched together like magnets on a refrigerator and they perfectly fit together. They create a sense of wonder and magic, that makes the viewer dreaming and smiling for a long period of time. The failure of subsequent \"Fantasia 2000\" shows at what point \"Fantasia\" has a unique impact on today's culture and that nothing will ever be as well crafted and executed as Disney's masterpiece.I repeat it, it's the best animated feature of all time and it will certainly remain 'till the end of times.",

            "content": "Fantasia is not a cartoon made for children. This is an animated film made for adults. After watching this film, I have come upon the realization that most children would get bored and stop watching. Yes Fantasia has its dry parts, otherwise it is the best animated film I have seen.The use of music from such masters as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Tonchielli form the basis for the seven animated shorts that make up this film. Other than short breaks in between segments used to describe the next episode and a brief intermission used to explain sound, the film is basically all animation. Walt Disney had the right idea to go for perfection when making this film and the animators he hired sure did a splendid job.My favourite short was the fourth of the film. Called \"The Right of Spring,\" it shows the formation of our planet all the way until the end of the dinosaurs. Starting off with a visually enthralling volcano sequence, we eventually see life change from one-celled organisms to crustaceans to fish to reptiles and then to dinosaurs. The whole dinosaur sequence was the best in the film with the close resemblance of the animated type to the real thing. The atmosphere and movements that surrounded the creatures was perfect, all flowing naturally until their death which is quite interestingly explained without words.The short titled \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" showcased Mickey Mouse and was quite entertaining, although rather short. Beethoven's 6th, \"The Pastoral\" was also done extremely well using the symphony piece in a mythological setting complete with centaurs, musical cherubs and half-man, half-horse characters and of course the typically fat leader who is having a jolly good time. Finally the seventh sequence using Moussorgska's \"Night On Bald Mountain\" showcased the transformation of all that is evil into \"Ave Maria\" and all things that make up heaven. The beast used in this short is rather frightening and would probably give many children nightmares for many nights to come. The short itself plays well to end the film, although could have ended on a greater high.I like the fact that some Disney films do not follow the formula that they use in all of their films today and in the past few decades. Perhaps Disney could try and create another film like Fantasia (I've heard of something called \"Fantasia 2000\" , but have no clue as to what it is all about) although most people would probably stay away from it just like most people stayed away from Fantasia in 1940. I fully recommend this film to any film lover.8/10 stars.",

It's well-known that many saw it as a disappointment when \"Fantasia\" first came out and this was a thorn in Disney's side for the rest of his life. Too bad that he didn't hold out for at least three more years when a new generation discovered it and saw it as the classic that it always has been. \"The Nutcracker Suite\", \"Dance of the Hours\" and \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" are the major highlights of the film and I think that each generation will appreciate now since it has stood the test of time and is regarded as a major high point in motion picture history and I quite agree.",

            "content": "In 1940, animation was still in infancy. Before -Fantasia- the usual view of animation was that it could be anything other than high art. It could be effective for entertainments for children, suitable at best for use in fairy-tale stories. To be sure, -Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs- got some respect, but could animation be art for its own sake? Could it have appeal without forcing one to revert to childhood?In a time of great movies, -Fantasia- had severe competition, and it created difficulties in presentation, most notably for the sound system necessary for showing this feature to its fullest effect. Today that is no problem; the home stereo and DVD or VHS player and home theater system serve adequately. In the early 1940s the expense of a sound system for the music alone was a BIG problem.-Fantasia- succeeds as art for its own sake. The \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" sequence sets one up for the contrast between realism, representation, and abstraction. The music may be hackneyed, but the visuals begin with something predictable (silhouettes of musicians, as) in the Toccata, only to lead to visual variations largely exploiting partial views of stringed instruments, their bows, and the fingerpads of flutes against odd landscapes.Music from Tchaikovsky's -Nutcracker- is used in a ballet, but one very different from the ballet that we see around Christmas. The dancers are fairies that force the changes of season and creatures of nature. The fairies bring spring plants to life. The dancing mushrooms are fluff, but the goldfish give a subdued, yet seductive dance. Thistles that we might despise in nature form a chorus line that daffodils join -- very impressively. Then the change of seasons from summer to fall is shown as fairies turn the colors of leaves  (leaves turn in bunches as they do in nature where I live) and then bring the frosty chill of winter, complete with dancing snowflakes.\"Mickey Mouse\" appears as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in a cautionary tale about using great powers before one fully understands their consequences. Little need be said but that the animation gives a power to the story that no other visual treatment could give to the music.We then get a treatment in a somewhat-educational, yet still-entertaining, depiction of the creation of Earth through the downfall of the dinosaurs. \"Science\", namely Darwinian evolution, sets the stage for a surprisingly-modern view of the dinosaurs as lively (if often violent) creatures capable of emotion -- almost sixty years before the animated -Walking With Dinosaurs- treatment.Beethoven's Sixth, or \"Pastoral\" Symphony is the setting for a depiction of the fantastic creatures of Greco-Roman myth: unicorns, pegasuses, centaurs, satyrs, and gods in a mostly-delightful romp, aside from a fearsome thunderstorm from the Big Boss, Zeus.Disney gives a witty treatment of the trite ballet \"Dance of the Hours\" from Ponchielli's opera -La Gioconda-, with ostriches, hippos, crocodiles, and elephants dancing in a nobleman's palace. At the end, Disney sets two pieces of music symbolizing an apocalyptic struggle between Evil (Mussorgsky's -Night on Bald Mountain-) and good (Schubert's reverential -Ave Maria-) that, although almost polar opposites in mood feed seamlessly as daybreak consigns nocturnal creatures to the netherworld where they belong.This feature should be seen in entirity because some of the images of one scene have parallels in another scene. This is the deliberate choice of one of the cultural giants of the twentieth century. For example, the dancing fish in -The Nutcracker- is recalled as an elephant blows a bubble in -The Dance of the Hours-.-Fantasia- had few imitators for decades. It was too good to imitate. Disney had ideas of replacing some of the scenes in re-releases, but that all came to naught. Animation of this sort would prove costly; moreover, World War II would create a need for propagandistic and educational materials at the expense of 'ars gratia artis'. Disney's postwar successes in more populistic animation probably kept him from making any sequels.Animation came of age in -Fantasia-  and proved its usefulness not only in childish cartoons, but also in art and education. Disney took one great step along a path from which even he was compelled to retreat. It's not for a lack of music. Much music begs for such treatment.",

            "content": "Although not favored at the time of its release, Fantasia has found a place among the best animated features, and deservedly so. It's uneven in places, but it's a towering achievement in animation, especially considering the time in which it was made, and that it was all done completely by hand. It is simply incredible.Be aware, however, that the soundtrack for the DVD release is not quite the same as it was for the 50th anniversary release in 1990, and the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the next year. The 50th anniversary soundtrack was a faithful and painstaking reproduction of Fantasound using original documents from the Disney archives for the cues, and those who saw it in 1990 at a surround-sound theater will recall the music swirling and jumping around the room at times, making it almost as mind-boggling as what appeared on screen. This is what was encoded on the VHS and laserdisc releases that followed the 50th anniversary release, and those with equipment capable of decoding Dolby 2.0 (\"Pro-Logic\") will hear it with either of those video releases. It was lauded in 1990 as the first time that Fantasound had been heard since 1940, and it is something to behold.The DVD release, however, has an entirely different mix of the musical elements in both Dolby 2.0 and Dolby 5.0. The sound is cleaner than on the 1990 release, but it concentrates everything up front and carries only concert-hall reverb in the rear channels. I've kept my laserdisc copy, and that's the one I watch for the best effect. (The IMDb \"trivia\" page for this film has been updated to note this change.)Speaking of the interstitials: While I admire Disney's efforts to recreate the original roadshow presentation on the DVD, I think they could have found a better voice match for Deems Taylor. I mean no disrespect to Corey Burton, but while he did an excellent job syncing to the film, his voice has a completely different timbre than Taylor's, and I can't help thinking that someone else could have come closer.BTW, the reason they dubbed Deems Taylor's voice for the DVD is that the interstitials for the original \"roadshow\" presentation were trimmed for subsequent releases, including the 50th anniversary release. They found the missing film elements of Taylor's monologues, but their audio elements were lost, and rather than try to dub just those small bits, they re-dubbed the monologues in their entirety. I think it was a wise idea, but again, I think they could have found a better voice match.",

            "content": "Fantasia is not the kind of movie that has a coherent plot or features a battle of good versus evil. It's an experience movie. It's a movie that reacts to classical music and changes it's tone to fit it. The film is basically The Philadelphia Orchestra performing various classical pieces(The Rite of Spring, The Pastoral Symphony etc.). But the pieces are set to animation from the Walt Disney Company. The animation is some of the best Disney has ever done. There are some pieces like Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor and The Nutcracker Suite that are just random events happening one after the other. While others like The Rite of Spring or Dance of the Hours have a sort of plot. There never is a main character or real plot in any of the stories. Except one.Possibly the most famous bit of the film is The Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. He takes his master's hat and starts enchanting the brooms to do his work for him. This... doesn't end well. This is the only original music composed for the film and it is by far one of the best appearances of Mickey Mouse.But by far my favorite scene is the end. Night on Bald Mountain depicts a demon on top of a mountain summoning the dead and damned to dance and party around him atop his mountain. He casts a few into the pit, transforms them into beasts and demons and does it only for laughs. But he is eventually driven back into slumber by the church bells and the film closes on a procession of priests through a forest. All mixed with Ave Maria. This ending is one of the strongest endings to a film I've ever seen, animated or otherwise. Fantasia isn't just a film, it's an art. The visuals are magnificent, the score is beautiful and it is really one of the best animated films to ever be conceived. If you haven't seen this amazing movie I definitely recommend it. While you may not come out of it with the same feelings I have, it is a must see for any fan of Disney or animation.",

            "content": "Walt Disney's FANTASIA has always occupied a precarious niche in the Disney canon of animated masterpieces. For a masterpiece it truly is , a one-of-a -kind, oddball array of eight short features that depict in cartoon form a \"story\" to illustrate a popular work of classical music. Ever since its initial release in1940, music critics have generally scoffed at the film, deploring the act of illustrating a composer's work. Public reaction to the picture has varied widely, from wild applause to total apathy. Lacking a cohesive \"beginning to end\" storyline , the film seems to be geared more toward adults than children. The sequences are strung together by a very dry commentary narrated by DeemsTaylor. These introductory notes set up a brief explanation of what is to come, coupled with an anecdote about each specific composer. Although each segment is fascinating (and beautifully drawn), there are four standouts : the \"Nutcracker Suite\" is a sheer delight, featuring fairies dropping dewdrops on cobwebs and in a later section, mushrooms dancing as Chinese men ; Mickey Mouse as Dukas's \"the Sorcerer's Apprentice wherein the famous little guy gets in over his head using magical powers ; the uproarious \"Dance of the Hours\" in which a company of crocodiles,elephants and hippopotamus divinely bounce, leap and pirouette in front, around and behind Grecian columns ; and finally Schubert's \"Ave Maria, depicted as a calming aftermath to the frightening \"Night on Bald Mountain\" by Mussorgsky. FANTASIA is not a perfect film. It's very structure makes it difficult for some people to sit through all the way. It has its longueurs. But it also has some of the most inspired and gorgeous animation you'll ever see, and thanks to Mickey Mouse and Meastro Leopold Stowkowski, along with Disney's brilliant craftsmen, FANTASIA remains an indispensable work of motion picture art.",

It is not, as logic would suggest, a good movie for kids.   Fantasia is to animation what 2001 is to sci-fi movies-- the classic genre favorite that ends up boring uninitiated viewers.  There's a reason why the only images from this film that ended up permeating popular culture are Mickey's Sorcerer's Apprentice and the Night on Bald Mountain sequence at the end; those are the only two segments that entertain everyone who sees them (except the younger audience members, who'll be terrified by the satanic finale).  It's probably just because I'm a child of the short attention span '90s, but I ended up enjoying Fantasia 2000 a lot more than the original.  The new film's segments all have plots of some kind (even the triangle butterfly story at the beginning, which claims to be an abstract sequence but really isn't) and they seem to accommodate the musical selections more closely.  I still love Fantasia, and I hope Disney gives us good DVD's of both Fantasia films (think about it-- that idiotic straight-to-video Lion King sequel is on DVD but not Fantasia, or even the first Lion King movie).  Fantasia is a great film, but Disney deserves respect for giving us a great update in the form of Fantasia 2000, though I've heard the original is a better experience for those who experiment with certain illegal substances...",

Those might apply to some of the experimental work nowadays.But would you expect that one of the first avant-garde works would come from Disney?? The thought is surprising, but it's true! \"Fantasia\" is vastly different from anything made before its time, and it's still vastly different from anything made after its time. Disney would never make a film so daringly inventive nowadays.This film is a gem. From its mesmerizing cinematography during Bach's \"Tocatta & Fugue\" to the comical storyline in \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to the idyllic animation in Beethoven's \"Pastoral Symphony\" and all the way to the finale with \"Night on Bald Mountain\", this movie charms the viewer. This may be early animation, but the way it's put together allows it to compete in quality with even the most dazzling effects that modern computer animation can accomplish.However, although it bears the name of Disney, \"Fantasia\" is not for kids. I tried to watch this movie at least 4 times as a youngster, but I wasn't able to get all the way through it until recently, at the age of 17. This movie requires a level of patience that most kids (and some adults even) don't possess.

A dismal failure in its initial release, \"Fantasia\" was close to being forgotten by the world, and even Walt Disney himself had distanced himself from his once beloved creation.  Subsequent re-releases, however, have exposed new and more receptive audiences to this brilliant film.\"Fantasia\" takes many well-known pieces of classical music and presents them in new and dynamic ways.  While some work better than others, none of them falls below a very high standard of quality.  By today's standards, the animation could be considered crude and the images simplistic, but all of the CGI flash in the world couldn't replace the impact some of these images maintain.Several high points dot the film.  The \"Nutcracker Suite\" is cast as a ballet of nature, with bouncing mushrooms in the \"Chinese Dance\" and tiny faeries spreading dew across the awakening world in \"The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy.\"  \"The Dance Of The Hours\" takes a familiar, and perhaps staid, ballet piece and turns it on its ear, casting such unlikely prima ballerinas as ostriches, hippos, elephants, and a pack of menacing alligators.The crowning achievement of the film, however, is not the over-played \"Sorceror's Apprentice,\" as many claim.  Although the music is expressive and the animation well-done, it's commonality has taken some of the dynamic that the piece once had.  No, the most striking moments come from the pairing of Mussorgsky's menacing \"Night On Bald Mountain\" and Schubert's celestial \"Ave Maria.\"\"Night On Bald Mountain\" marks an undeniably mature moment in the Disney universe.  In this piece, Tchernabog, an ancient god of evil (although he is associated with the Christian Devil in the film) summons his followers to Bald Mountain, where all manor of demons, wicked spirits, and imps cavort in his unholy presence.  But as powerful as he may be, even the mighty god trembles before the power of the dawn, and with the church bells, his revelry is finished and the world sanctifies itself to the \"Ave Maria\", one of the most beautifully pure pieces ever composed (at least in this reviewer's opinion).As with all other Disney films, \"Fantasia\" is subject to the whims and fancies of the Disney marketing department, who infamously take titles out of production for years on end in an effort to build up consumer demand. Should \"Fantasia\" ever come to a theatre near you, do not hesitate to see it.  Should you be lucky enough to find a copy to purchase, do so.  A hallmark of animation such as this deserves to be enjoyed by as many people as possible.  10 out of 10.",

And what could be better or more suitable as great art than the combination of high classical music with high animation? The film ultimately disappoints because of its pretension. The animation, while imaginative, is not as great as the previous two films. The live action interlude with the famous conductor is an artifice that does not hold up, and shows why further films of this nature were not produced. Especially irksome, is the statements that the conductor makes that the animation successfully does this or the animation perfectly does something. Animation should show you what it does, it shouldn't have to be explained to you during the film itself. I honestly hated this and was bored by it. But what is something positive that can be taken from this film? The first is that the Disney animators were masters of horrifying animation. The section with the devil and the devils playing must have been inspirational to the heavy metal artists of the 1980s.

Rite of Spring: The only good part was the one dinosaur beating up the other dinosaur. Beethoven's 6th: Best one in my opinion. Socceror's apprentice: A classic. Night on bald mountain: I love that demon. (Wow. That was weird.) Ave Maria: pretty. Hard to hear. I thought there would be singing in that one. As you can see I rated this movie a '5.'

I think the opening scene was pretty intense for a Disney movie, along with the ending song with the devilish creature. My favorite scene was the one with the hippos and elephants.

Being a musician myself (piano and flute, VERY amateur), I love how Disney took some of the most well-known classical music and made beautiful and often amusing pictures to go with it.  I personally don't like the \"Rite of Spring\" segment, but that's fine-it's allowed one bad segment, and the \"Nutcracker\" and \"Pastoral Symphony\" more than compensate.  I also love how the narrator gives background on the music and the animation but isn't a well-known actor.  (Perceptive readers can probably guess that this was my biggest gripe with Fantasia 2000.)  It really gives the impression that you're in a concert hall and these are just the pictures that run through your head while hearing the music.  All music does that to me, and congrats to Disney for taking that little phenomenon and making a movie out of it. This movie is personally responsible for the invention of surround sound and, if you think about it, it was the first music video.  Disney was never afraid to take a chance, and this proved once more that he didn't need to worry at all.",

Nothing takes away the beauty of the work.It's not just any feature film, there are no dialogues, but a set of clips with classic songs of great fame.The Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski gave a true invisible show just \"giving life\" to flowers doing large complex ballets, fauns playing the flute, fish in the midst of evolution, ostriches with slippers and all kinds of other things that would seem to be without any connection.

The animation was amazing for its time, and still holds up beautifully today.  This film was just so visually inventive and flexible, from the abstract yet completely appropriate imagery of the Bach piece in the beginning, to the epic grandeur of the creation of life on earth for Stravinsky's \"Rite of Spring\", to the dark and hellish feel of \"Night on Bald Mountain\".  Even throw in the giddy silliness of the dancing hippos, and the famous \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\", featuring Mickey Mouse at his best. \nAnd not to forget the music, either, which features some of the greatest pieces from composers such as Bach, Beethoven, and Tchaikofsky, my personal favorite of which was Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.  And of course, the people behind the music- conductor Leopold Stokowski and the Philadephia orchestra- sounded completely on the mark and accomplished in their trade. \nAnd both of these aspects perfectly mesh in the 120 minutes of this film. This time, the music does not simply aid what happens onscreen, but the animation and music are accompaniments for each other.  Normally, music supplies the emotion, and visuals convey story.  Here, it's a little bit of both- the music clearly weaves part of the story itself, and the animation adds to the feeling of what's going on.  Never before have music and visuals so perfectly intertwined like in this movie.",

Younger generations will appreciate the sounds and characters leaping across the screen while adults may appreciate the musical aspects of the story line. The main focus of this movie is just the music and dancing, the story line is rather irrelevant while you watch this film. The use of the song \"Ave Maria\" has great importance. It shows light and dark clashing together in a great battle. The ending comes calmly and settles everything back into place. You could think all day of reasons behind this selection.

With little to no words spoken in almost all of the individual stories, it's essentially a silent film. In silent films, music was important to portray different emotions and feelings to the viewers that the actors simply couldn't: Fantasia is no different.

It doesn't matter how many times I see that move, it still takes by breath away. And for those with a classical music background, it has an even greater impact. Classical music was been called old and boring. But Disney gave it new life, and a way for the younger audiences to appreciate it.

The film, debuting a year after the start of the war, but a year prior to the US involvement, still proved to be a very effective film in my opinion. As the war was a worldwide affair, it was very prevalent and the US citizens were probably fearing with baited breath that they would too soon be brought into it's crossfire. I believe that movies like Fantasia aided in brining much needed relief, and acted as a powerful distraction without being too \"in your face\" that it was a distraction. It's cinematography as a whole is captivating and the on-screen world full of magic and good triumphing over evil, was exactly what people needed to see at the time. People craved a reality that was similar, so despite the cartoonish and magically mesmerizing atmosphere, the values are still the same.

This is a definite childhood classic, a film that has stood the test of time.",

I can still sit and watch, it, they've made new ones, but the first is such beautiful classic that you want to watch them all, not just the newest one.

What is also great about this film is how well the music plays into each scene. You can see the amount of creativity that the animators had when they were making the film. The only thing that was disappointing about the film was knowing that there wouldn't be a sequel that would come out. Disney didn't make enough money that they had put into the film so they thought that it wasn't worth taking the risk by making another one. There have been updated version from what I know but they don't hold that certain charm that is in the original. If you have the time go check it out.",

The film, as most everyone now knows grew out of Walt's desire to cast Mickey Mouse in a cartoon short based on Paul Dukas' \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", but was expanded to a full-feature presentation, when costs of the short were three times that of a traditional Mickey Mouse cartoon.  The film is, for lack of a better work, spectacular. Never before, or even since, had the animators at Disney executed such a lavish treatment on the field of animation.  From the abstract drawings set to J.S. Bach's \"Toccata & Fugue in D Minor\" to the thrilling dinosaur duel in Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\"; from the ballet dancing hippo's in Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\" to the good vs. evil finale of Mussorgsky's \"Night On Bald Mountain\" paired with Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" this film is crammed full of memorable images.  Sadly, however Walt Disney never lived to see his most personal film become the classic that it is regarded today.  Critical and audience indifference in the '40's, '50's, and most of the '60's kept the film \"an expensive experiment that failed\". Today however there are few who don't look at \"Fantasia\" as a classic and it is still one of the most often cited films that provided many with the dream of becoming involved in the world of animation.",

The only part that little kids would really like is the part with Mickey Mouse as the Soucerer's apprentice. Though i am really not getting the whole broomsticks with arms thing.

Dance of the hrs., Nutcracker Suite, etc. In the movie there are 3 different kinds of animation. One is abstract, one has more deffinate pictures, one tells a story.So what makes Fantasia good.

I had been exposed to classical music from infancy, so I could appreciate what was being done, with guidance from my music-loving parents. In adulthood as a professional musician my fascination and respect for this pioneering work continued to grow. The crowning glory in my personal experience came a few years ago when I decided to treat my mother to an evening at the movies. She was past 90 and in failing health, and I chose this one because it is a series of short features which can stand on their own, and it would be easy to stop if it was getting to be too much for her. As it turned out she sat entranced for the whole two hours, and at the end she started crying and thanked me profusely for giving her a chance to see and hear it while she was still alive to do so. At a time when she knew she would not live much longer it was heartwarming to see her respond as passionately as did the hippies and college students who finally made it a commercial success starting in the 1960s. Now that she is no longer with us, watching it and remembering that night bring tears to my eyes in tender moments in \"Nutcracker\", \"Pastoral Symphony\" and \"Ave Maria\".To me the musical and visual diversity from one episode to the next are marvelous and the technical detail blows my mind. Many details have been discussed at length in these pages, so I will limit myself to mentioning one that particularly sticks in my memory. It is an audio-visual gag that is a whimsical juxtaposition of the dainty and the grotesque. In \"Dance of the Hours\" a dainty pizzicato (plucked) note from a violin is sounded as an elephant plops hard onto the ground when the bubble on which it had been floating burst. That is always good for a chuckle.I can watch the movie repeatedly and keep on discovering artistic touches I had not noticed before. In my opinion Walt Disney and his talented crew of artists did themselves proud on this one.",

But let's stop a minute to think about when this film came out: it was 1940. Fast food didn't exist, color movies were not universal, and toy marketing tie-ins weren't necessary to support crappy movie plots. Walt Disney, God rest his soul, went and made his 2nd feature film... a long-form full-length music video! 41 years before MTV began broadcasting!But enough with contextual social history. The animation in Fantasia is now 60 years old. It's not perfect; frankly it looks grainy and old compared to Fantasia 2000. However, the imperfections in the film's animation give evidence to its artistry: the animators of this film were human beings not Macs or Sparcstations. Now, I'm a big Lucas fan and I'm all for CGI work and digitally inserted characters... but my heart bows in awe to the color texturing and attention to detail that jumps off the screen at you when you see this film!And now, for the other star of Fantasia after its animation staff: its MUSIC. Whoever chose the music, chose very very very well.I was never a big fan of Tchaikovsky... but the Arabian Dance sequence alone, converted me to liking his music. The sequencing of Mussorgsky and Schubert is truly a yin-yang tour de force of musical history and more than makes up for the singular disappointment I have with almost all things Stravinsky [see my review of Fantasia 2000 for the exception!]. Beethoven, Dukas, Ponchielli... all masters. And then there was one, the master of masters [I freely admit to my bias here]: good ol' JS Bach himself. All united under the banner of mouse-ears. Hats off to Disney!To sum up: the animation is old, but give it a break, it's a classic! The music is without parallel. It's a damn-near-perfect film.Final thought -- a respectful suggestion to Disney Corp: EMBRACE THE DIGITAL AGE. RELEASE FANTASIA ON DVD! HIRE I.L.M AND SKYWALKER SOUND TO CLEAN IT UP FOR DIGITAL TRANSFER, THEN RELEASE IT A.S.A.P.!",

            "content": "Fantasia is a must-have. Every family should own a copy of this movie; however, the second half is not nearly as good as the first half. I don't exactly know if the reason why I think the first half is better is because I grew up watching the first half and stopping there to do something else for whatever reason.The Sorcerer's Apprentice segment is arguably the most classic scene in Disney history. Every family must know where the image of Mickey with a sorcerer's hat came from. The beginning Toccata and Fugue segment, although only with orchestra musicians, shapes, and colors, is a good beginning segment. The Nutcracker segment is also somewhat classic.The second half is not nearly as important as the first. The short segment where the narrator is talking to the Soundtrack (vertical line that makes shapes for every musical sound) is very fun to watch. The ballet segment with ostriches, hippos, elephants, and alligators is very good for kids. Other than those latter two, Fantasia could have done without the second half. The Rite of Spring segment with volcanoes and dinosaurs, is enjoyable to me personally, because I like dinosaur movies, but it may be a little too tense for some young kids. The same with the big black devil in the last segment. There is some partial nudity in Beethoven's mythological segment and the last segment, though some may say it's not too offensive. And in my opinion, the second half of the last segment, with nuns walking with candles slowly in the soft music, is just plain boring. There's no music in the closing credits, which makes my personal hobby of watching credits less fun.As for comparing it to Fantasia 2000, I actually like 2000 better, because every segment is good to watch. For more on comparing the two, look for my Fantasia 2000 comment.My recommendation: Own this movie. Whenever you watch it, you can watch the whole thing if you want, but more often, you can watch the first half, and stop after The Sorcerer's Apprentice. If the kids like dinosaurs and don't mind the scary parts, then they can watch the Rite of Spring segment. And if you go that long, then stay for the short Soundtrack segment.7/10",

Watching the dinosaurs live there every day lives, and then get killed by a giant dust bowl that wiped out all the dinosaurs was fun and sad.

And I must say that it's the prettiest, ugliest, darkest, most innocent, boring, fascinating piece Disney's ever produced.  I do remember that when I used to watch it my mother would fast-forward over that devil sequence, and I never fancied the dinosaur thing either (partly because I'm a creationist, partly because it was a little too scary for my tender sensibilities at that age). Those two sequences continue to be my least favourite, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice (although very well done) I don't like much either.  Maybe because I can never get that jolly music out of my head afterwards?  The Nutcracker segment, though, is gorgeous- lovingly coloured and with those rather beautiful spiderwebs, and my favourite bit when the fairies dance on the ice and leave patterns.  And who can forget those dancing mushrooms?The segment I like best, though, is the Greek mythology sequence.  From the flying horses to the cupids and centaurs (and don't forget Bacchus), and the beautiful, pastel-coloured landscape, it's a place you want to be.  I loved the way the female centaurs beautified themselves with the help of doves and cupids, and I loved watching the baby Pegasuses slide down the rainbow into the water.  It's a treat to watch and I always feel afterwards that this was the way things were meant to be.  Disney would never get away with naked centaurettes today, but still...And the hippo/ostrich/alligator/elephant sequence was rather nice as well.

The idea of bringing a whole new meaning to sound both technologically (First movie in Surround Sound) and artistically was a brilliant venture. To say this Feature is not visually appealing is straight up a crime; it still holds up today with such elegant designs and vivid tones. Fantasia knows its audience. The movie really feels as if you are watching a full orchestra play in front of you and the MC treats the audience as such. There's no crude humor or blatant need to keep the viewer interested other than admiring the very fabric of what music is and how it can look, sound, and feel. Every visual is captivating and strikes well with the music. Whether it be abstract, themed, or a narrative, Fantasia takes the artistic views from so many perceptions that it's just as pleasurable to watch as it is to listen to.It's a very lengthy movie, especially for the time, and if you are not the kind of person who is very interested in music or animation, then this movie will most likely have you asleep by the Rite of Spring. I will admit, that one sometimes gets a yawn or two out of me in the beginning, but it only emphasizes how much the animation compliments the tone. When the music is soft then the animation is tame, but when the music is accented or loud, then the animation is alive and powerful. The tones can go from happy and carefree such as The Pastoral Symphony or Dance of the Hours, to vague and mysterious like The Nutcracker or Toccata and Fugue in D minor, or brash and powerful like The Rite of Spring or Night on Bald Mountain. It has a little bit for everyone.Music lover or not, this movie has a way of grabbing the attention of an audience of any age and can even spark the interest in music for anyone. It's a great film and will definitely be one to remember.",

The only person who speaks in this other than Mickey voiced by Walt Disney (Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmatians) is the narrator Deems Taylor.Fantasia is a series of vignettes told completely by music and animation. The animation was actually made to go along with the music which was already written. This was a big risk in 1940 and the only person clever enough to accomplish it was Walt Disney. He and a few others came up with the idea of an animated film all told through music. If it weren't for him, I don't think we'd have probably the purest animated film.Leopold Stokowski (The Great Beauty, Fantasia/2000, DOA: Dead or Alive) was the conductor who put this all together and he does a great job of making us feel the music and add so much emotion that the animation even brings it to a further level.Fantasia is a fun film for the whole family and is in my opinion the purest animated movie since there is no words, only animation (and a bit of real life...) but you should still check this one out.",

I fell in love with it all over again. When I first saw it in 1990 at its theatrical re-release, I was only 8 years old. Ten years later, in 2000, I had taken up the violin and I was about to graduate from high school. Watching this film with a new appreciation for classical music that I didn't have in 1990, this film inspired me to stick with the violin and pursue a music major. Another thing that changed when I watched it again in 2000, was my view on the final segment, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria. Today it is my favorite segment of Fantasia. Fantasia's presentation of \"Ave Maria\" is one of the most spiritually uplifting endings in the history of cinema. The music in this segment is just gorgeous. It showed me that music can have an impact and that it is just as important as any other form of entertainment.\nOf coarse, it wouldn't be fair not to list some of the other highlights of this film. Highlights include J.S. Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\" which shows off the orchestra and then dissolves into an abstract dream with flashes of light and flying bows and quaking landscapes, Beethoven's \"Pastoral symphony\" which is a pretty accurate perception of Greek Mythology, except for the centaurettes. Those are purely Disney's idea. Then we have \"The Dance of the Hours\" Fantasia's funniest and second-most famous (next to the `Sorcerer's Apprentice') this segment features dancing hippos, elephants, ostriches and alligators throughout the coarse of a day from morning to the afternoon, then into the evening and night. This is shown through some very beautiful animation. Sense I was only 8 when I saw this the first time, I was mainly focusing on the cartoon part of it, and the quality of animation made me think it was a new release, and not a 50 year old classic.Forget Fantasia 2000.

It actually scared me the first time I saw it when I was about 6. Nowadays, Disney doesn't use such frightening images as Satan on top of a mountain. Then of course there are ghosts, vampires, witches, and such.Bottom line: \"Fantasia\" is a work of fine art, but won't really entertain most people today.

I think my least favorite segment is the segment that is the most Disney - the sorcerer's apprentice, with Micky. I could leave it out of the film and still be fine with it. As a kid we would always stop the movie before the quite scary and eerie Night on Bald Mountain segment. It was too much for us as kids, but now I can fully appreciate it.

Such a sad, dying art of hand drawing an animated feature... to think that hands drew and colored every instant of that movie is just amazing. And the artistry shows.",

As he tries to take control of it, he causes more trouble and fun for the viewing audience.We also get a fascinating look into the Prehistoric Age billions of years ago when Dinosaurs roamed the earth. You're kids will find this part exciting because Disney presents many Dinosaurs such as a Brontosaurus, Pterodactyls and even a Tyrannosaurus Rex. All the movements of the dinosaurs are wonderfully animated by Disney. The artists really capture their presence.Disney would use their beauty animating Dinosaurs `In The Land Before Time' movie series.\nAnother great scene is where the conductor introduces In the soundtrack of the picture and produces to indulge in the many instruments and their sounds such as a harp, trumpet, violin and many other instruments.I would explain more of the scenes but that would take away from the anticipation of those people who haven't watched this film in years.There is a new version of Fantasia called `Fantasia 2000'Which includes new scenes and a computer restored version of the film.Whichever version you watch, it will be a viewing pleasure you won't forget.A must buy for Adults and Kids.This movie brought back great memories of when I was a kid, and now looking back at this movie, I can appreciate what Walt Disney did in creating this timeless movie.",

I will say that Fantasia is my favourite Disney film and one of my all-time favourite movies in general.The concept of Fantasia was very unique for the time and still kind of is: combining classical music with animation to tell narrative or non-narrative stories. No dialog is needed. The only dialog you get is from the host, Deems Taylor, who introduces the segments and gives us some details on what each segment will be about. You also get some very brief dialog from Mickey Mouse and the conductor, Leopold Stokowski.The music was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and they did absolutely fantastic. The music and animation are matched up flawlessly. The animation is also fantastic. No complaints about either of those things whatsoever.Another thing that really stands out about this film is that it doesn't really feel like a kiddy picture. It mostly seems more intended for adults even though it's totally fine for kids to watch. It just doesn't have anything that would immediately draw kids to it, other than maybe the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment with Mickey Mouse.I really can't put into words what else makes this film one of the best animated movies ever made. You really just have to see it for yourself. I think it's a flawless picture that should be seen by fans of Disney films or just animation in general.",

Deems Taylor claims to be an authority on scientific theories of how the world was created but if you really look in to his credentials you start to realize this man has absolutely no education built behind theoretical science. The depiction of Sorcerers was also very offensive to me, for some reason they chose to create a world in which the sorcerers \"Hats\" hold all the magic. To me the sorcerer had a lot more qualities of a Wizard than that of a sorcerer. I also didn't appreciate how they put cartoon mice in a bad light saying that they are lazy, broom homicidal and have no work ethic. I think we can all agree cartoon mice are hard working just like any cartoon mammal and would never kill a broom in there life. If we keep pigeon holing cartoon rodents we will never have a good fictional equilibrium. oh and Don't even get me started on the overuse of animal yawns there were, almost if the animals were tired, Cartoons have no metabolism or need for oxygen so why would they yawn?!

And yet, that's what makes it so amazing.Fantasia is not a single story spread across 2 hours, instead, it's several short stories told through a combination of music and Disney animation. Well, most of them are. Some of them just abandon story and focus on just animation. But others (particularly the world famous Night on Bald Mountain sequence) do have a clear story to them.Honestly, it's my absolute favorite Disney film. The animation is still stop notch despite being made in the 40's, the music is incredible, and the Disney magic we know is more than present here. It's just taken on a new light.Granted, I can understand if people don't like it because it is basically a bunch of music videos, but believe me, if you have even the slightest interest, check it out.

            "content": "I am a person who consider Art, or rich Art, being able to elevate our minds and from which we are able to draw huge amount of information. Fantasia is not only a unique film, its also the only film which with musical pieces illustrates evolution at work and prehistoric scenes pretty scary and violent with the last groups of dinosaurs parading towards doom. Development and Extermination. Also, here you have sceneries of the Hellenian mythological world portraying the mating ritual and the Bacchus celebration, \"sex, drugs and party!\", and the battle between the light and the shadow world - the world of death and decay and that of light and peace. We get the living Nature in its transgressions through the different seasons, comical portraits of animals and veggies impersonating humans, and a moral tale of a young who forgot that he is not the tutor yet, etc. The basic thread of the movie is the music of course! To begin the film with J S Bach's Toccata and Fuge in d minor, is not only supercool, but is the perfect upwarming piece. As the music itself is pretty impossible to create a simple visual story with characters from, the visuals we see are closer to abstract and expressionism in form, with natural elements to illustrate Bach's famous cosmic flow of his fugues! Walt Disney was so serious with this project, that a psychological consult with experience of peyote, was hired to give guide lines to the different segments, not to mention all the ideas which came from the big crowd of artists that was working with the pictures and the translation of the music into pictures. Just like other Disney films of the period, like Three Caballeros 1946 and certain scenes in Dumbo and others, could easily be placed side by side with Yellow Submarine and experimental underground shorts in the late 60's, in a period when LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis was the inspiration, for both young hippies and soul searching intellectuals. Disney was really psychedelic! The imagination at work in this film is so rich, that one can view it over and over again, to find details as well as new interpretations to the different segments. When viewing this multi artwork from beginning to end, through the music to the visuals and its themes, it seems to encompass the human and natural world on Earth,in a trancendental way, so it seems to be the perfect movie to send with a probe out into outer space, hoping to encounter an alien species, who might be able to watch it! They would not only consider it a colorful gem, but would find the film be a treasure for understanding Humans from the planet Earth. Of course, I am exaggerating, but still, if NASA could pack a satellite with chosen music, which I know they had, why not a movie? Anyways, this is a way for me to say, that Fantasia, as the film looks, could not have been made today, as the most powerful film companies would not bet a huge some of money on a project like this. Also, a feature film, all drawn and painted by hand, gives a decidedly more impressive look than one that is made in a computer. The fact is, that around 1939 - 1940, in the midst of Second World War, some of the most popular, hailed by critics and audience alike, greatest films were made. If the time consuming, painstaking efforts behind Pinoccio, Wizard of Oz, The Thief of Bagdad and Fantasia all are made to be true fantasy films, they seem to tell us that during war time it better works to make \"timeless\" films. In other words, films which not occupy themselves with the ever changing societies of Humanity and the issues of the times in which they were made. Instead, and this is what make them work as true art, they seem to speak to us, in matter of symbols, archetypes and themes which have been with us through the history of time. It could be seen as a work of a great shaman, who wants to remind us about the most important and utterly most sublimely beautiful things we have on this Earth.

Most of the movies are about musical numbers performed by live-action pedophile actors with live-action children superimposed with anthropomorphic plants and animals scurrying about a cartoon forest and everyone in that scene is singing about something stupid. How are these movies supposed to represent American family values!? The only reason why Fantasia is better than every other Disney movie is because there is absolutely no singing (not counting the Ave Maria segment, I did not notice there was singing in it until just a few years ago and I could not tell it was in English until literally just at the time of this writing) and only a few seconds of legitimate dialog. Instead, animated segments timed to classical music are projected to give a surreal audio/visual experience (like a drug trip). This saves the trouble of having to go through with a bunch of idiot animals running around singing about how great manual labor is.I feel that this movie is revolutionary because its segments are the first music videos. Without this movie I could never justify why Pink Floyd: The Wall is a real work of art and not just an overlong music video.The direction that this movie takes is genius. Instead of overly happy dogs bursting into inappropriate dancing, the audience enjoys the sight of a T-Rex mauling the crap out of a triceratops, Mickey Mouse chopping a walking broom to pieces with a battle-ax, Zeus throwing a bunch of lightning bolts at some naked horse chicks and scaring them s***less, and Chernobog, the giant demon of Bald Mountain, kicking ass and taking names.This movie is much too good to pass up. There has never been a movie with so much appeal to watch again and again and the animated sequences even sync up with Metallica (try Master of Puppets with the Sorcerer's Apprentice) just like how Dark Side of The Moon syncs with Wizard of Oz. No matter who you might be, this movie will simply blow your mind, words cannot describe how monumental of a film this piece really is.",

One school believed that the animated action was the main point of an animated film and that the music should fit the animation. Sadly, this is how almost all animation is done today. The other school believed that the music should be the main focus and that the animation should enhance the music by providing an artistic visual representation. This is the school that \"Fantasia\" represents.I love this film and have watched it (or at least listened to it) countless times. The musical selections are among the best that classical music has to offer, and the animation and styling of the characters are classical Disney at its best. The scenes depicted vary from the hilarious to the terrifying to the awe-inspiring. Most satisfying are those that take your breath away and hold you in fascination with their beauty and elegance.My only complaint about the film is Disney's choice of Leopold Stokowski as conductor. Stokowski arrogantly took it upon himself to \"improve\" Mussorgsky's \"Night on Bare Mountain,\" and effectively ruined the best parts of the score. Compare Stokowski's version with the original and you'll see what I mean. But with the exception of Stokowski's occasional interference, \"Fantasia\" is the best animated musical film ever produced.",

The dull, flat live action introductions, featuring a stuffy and overly dry Deems Taylor, stop the film cold. I found myself wishing Walt Disney had simply used title cards with a brief summary, which would have made it shorter and sweeter. Having said that, \"Fantasia\" is certainly one of Disney's most stunning, ambitious, and, for its time, daring achievements. The dual closing segment, \"Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria\" is the strongest and darkest one, with \"Rite of Spring,\" and \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" a close second and third, respectively.

            "content": "Blue lights on a backdrop curtain. Shadows of musicians walking to their seats onstage cross the screen. The sounds of the orchestra warming up grow louder...then fall silent. The narrator walks on. And so \"Fantasia\" begins.Having two musicians for parents, I grew up watching this movie. It's hard to remember that this is actually quite an old Disney film--my grandmother remembers its debut. She and I are both of the opinion that \"Fantasia\" is a movie unlike any other, and still far ahead of its time, even generations after its release. I feel that perhaps the greatest asset of this film is introducing classical music to the public in a form that young children and adults alike can enjoy and get involved in.\"Fantasia\" involves eight very famous pieces of music, each one set to a backdrop of differing and engaging animations. Bach's 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' is an excellent opening: it is the oldest piece of music in the film, and the animation consists of abstract visions that coincide with the music beautifully. This is the only purely abstract animation of the entire film, with the exception of the modest Soundtrack character that appears later, which introduces various instruments in the orchestra.The orchestra itself is often seen during the film, the musicians backlit with various colored lights, or their instruments spotlighted. The musicians themselves remain in the dark; even their conductor, the great Stokowski, is never seen in the light. We are forced to sit still and concentrate on the sounds that are made--a skill which many people today have not developed. However, even these people are riveted to the simplicity of the orchestra scenes, and even moreso to the animated sequences.The show continues with Tchaikovsky's famous (or infamous) 'Nutcracker Suite', where each dance is represented by different figures ranging from fancy goldfish to fairies to walking flowers. Then comes perhaps the most well-known part of the film: Dukas' 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. This is the only section of the film where a Disney character (Mickey Mouse) appears, as the title character. He learns the folly in pride when a magical spell goes horribly wrong and floods his master's castle.Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring' is a tale of the origin of life, and the epic battles of dinosaurs. It begins alone in space, with only a few stars and a bassoon's tune for company. It quickly moves to scenes of early earth, and simple ocean-dwelling creatures. Later, the dinosaurs take over, finally dying out when the earth's water supply disappears. While some of the science may be outdated by today's standards, it is still a spectacular piece of work that includes fairly realistic dinosaurs--a step away from Disney's habit of 'cutesy'ing animals.This solemn music is followed by the rambunctious ballet 'Dance of the Hours' by Ponchielli, where ostriches, elephants, and hippos dance, and are courted by excitable alligators. This one scene elicits the most smiles from its viewers out of the whole movie. The whole setting is like that of a real, staged ballet...the only difference being that unexpected animals perform the roles.The last animation of the film is actually a melding of two very different pieces: the nearly demonic 'A Night on Bald Mountain', by Mussourgsky, and the sacred piece by Schubert, 'Ave Maria'. While Chernobog, the demon from Bald Mountain, can be scary to young children, 'Ave Maria' offers relief with its soothing scenes of mountains and forests, and worshipers walking calmly through the early-morning light.\"Fantasia\" remains one of my favorite films, and a testament to the amazing skills of the Disney animators who worked on it over 60 years ago. While modern copies of the movie tend to warp the sound, it is not to the extent that the overall experience is lessened. I DEFINITELY recommend this movie for everyone--especially those who think that classical music is boring and stodgy.",

Producer Walt Disney - together with his legendary artists, the equally legendary Leopold Stokowski, and the music critic Deems Taylor - together, these artists absolutely exploded the idea of a what a film could be, and in the process, forever ended the notion that the medium of animation was a children's medium.The film ignored the conventions of mainstream film, especially in its original release version, and tossed all narrative and dramatic conventions overboard like so much dead weight.It was the first film to feature multi-channel sound. It was the first - and only - film to receive TWO special Academy Awards. It was among the first films added to the National Film Registry, officially declaring the film a National Treasure of the United States of America. And in its marriage of visuals to classical music, FANTASIA was the modern forerunner of films like APOCALYPSE NOW, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and even PLATOON.Walt Disney never lived to see FANTASIA become a true blockbuster. It would take YELLOW SUBMARINE - which followed in FANTASIA's footsteps by creating animated visuals to match the music of the Beatles - to turn on American audiences to the film's controlling idea. And ever since FANTASIA's re-release in the wake of YELLOW SUBMARINE, Disney's film has succeeded in collapsing the American prejudice against the animated medium, and the film's reputation has only grown more and more, almost exponentially, with each passing year, and each subsequent re-release.There are few films that can be described as true icons of American cinema. Porter's THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION. Welles' CITIZEN KANE. Kubrick's 2001. FANTASIA is such a film.It is a profound work of drama, audacity, whimsy, and beauty.It is one of the few true cinema legends.It is one of the greatest works of art of the entire 20th Century.Period.",

            "content": "Challenging? Yes. In 1940, there were areas in the US where Darwinism was regarded as sinful. Many people (especially school teachers) challenging the Adam and Eve story were taking a hell of a risk, yet here we have Disney throwing the Godbook out the window and presenting life on earth as the result of a straight evolutionary series of events; pure survival of the fittest. Add to that small, but 'perfectly formed' fairies, throw in the odd nymph or two and round it off with Night on Bald Mountain, and you've got a very potent mix. Sure it's sugar coated, but it had to be. It's a pity the original release didn't include the Salvidor Dali sequence though...........Purely as a film, I think it's superb. One of the reasons behind it was to showcase the best that was possible, hence you have picture quality that at times was the closest you can get to 3D on a flat screen, coupled to what in effect was full surround sound audio. One question please. The Disney site shows a 60'th anniversary DVD version of the film but goes on to say it's not available to the public, yet 60'th anniversary DVD's are being sold on Ebay and Amazon. Can anyone tell me what gives? Does this DVD have sequences that were on the original film release, but edited out of the VHS Video tape? My email address is combwork@aol.com Many Thanks, Jim.",

The soundtrack was great the idea was great, all for its time. the art work for the movie was perfect. it took a long time to do this one because the art work was all done by hand not by computer. it took almost 4-years to complete and then it had to be done over because it did not come out the way Walt Disney wanted it. So it took four more years to complete and it was a success in the theaters. Do not compare this movie to the ones that are being made today because there is no comparison, the movies today are a lot better.",

In its original form, it was intended to be shown yearly with various different \"pieces\" created for the show. Unfortunately, these did not materialize. However, Fantasia stands as high art in the world of animation. Each short goes with a piece of classical music. From the quiet and thoughtful Nutcracker Suite to the heights of A Night on Bald Mountain and the glorious finale of Ave Maria, Fantasia does not disappoint. If you plan to watch it, treat it as a concert, not as a true film. Enjoy the single greatest work produced by Disney.",

The way the cartoons capture the music is outstanding, and cannot be matched with anything else, even in modern times with the release of Fantasia 2000. If you haven't seen it, then I strongly advise you do because of its ability to make you enjoy the wonder of classical music in a way that our minds see it: except now it puts imagination on screen.",

            "content": "When I was younger I was plagued by classical music, both parents having degrees in the subject. But nothing they could say or do  got me interested in the subject as much as Fantasia did. The animation is incredible-each frame(And there were approximately thirty in each second of film) is lovingly, painstakingly planned, drawn and painted. The recording of the music is, even by today's standards, excellent. The orchestra is well-balanced and all of the instruments that may be heard can be heard, unlike Dad's copy of the Nutcracker Suite, which was recorded in 1997.The ideas for presenting each segment are brilliant;there are all different themes-abstract, cartoon, science, comedy, mythological, religious and nature. I could not imagine what manner of person could look at a plant and think it looks like a person, or create a ballet danced by the four creatures on the planet who are most ill-adapted for dancing. There are certain parts in the film which are not what you would associate with a film viewed by children, because they are the sort of thing that may give some people nightmares, but nobody took much notice about things like that in 1940-at that time they had more pressing matters to worry about. This film is beautiful, funny, frightening, primitive, and brilliant. A mix of beautiful artwork, famous music, and haunting images, I rate this film ten out of ten.",

            "content": "A brilliant film that mashes classical music with the visual artistry of Walt Disney's stable of artists. The dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy is my favorite scene. Mickey getting in trouble, as the Sorcerer's Apprentice, is a true laugh out loud moment when Mickey is endlessly foiled by his attempts to cover up his misuse of magic.Each frame is individually drawn and hand colored by Disney's artists. While today's computer animation is impressive, I find the hands on approach incredible and the results beautiful. As a side note, Disney revisited hand drawn animation in their 2009 film, The Princess and The Frog.I recommend Fantasia for a family night, since it's safe and fun for children. It is also good for a date night, since it will demonstrate your sophistication, especially if you can recognize the various classical movements.",

            "review_title": "The Best Disney Music Video Of All Time",
            "content": "All right, it can get better titles than that. But at least that's one thing we can all agree on about 'Fantasia.' 'Fantasia' was Disney's second or third movie, and thus stems from the time it churned out actual quality, not just cheap genre-spoofs like it does today. At the time, Disney was not just the *best* animation studio, it was the *only* one. Even then, Fantasia is the most ambitious Disney project from that era - rather than just translate old Mother Goose and Grimm works, the limitless imaginations of the Disney animators were going to translate famous pieces of music.So what this boils down to is a head-on of two art forms: the movie and the music. And who wins? The movie, by far. It's far more entertaining to watch Fantasia than to actually go to the symphony.Why? Well, it's simple: 'Fantasia' is a trip to the symphony, but when you go on the trip, you borrow the mind of a true music fan with boundless, colorful imagination. This is way better than anything your head could cook up for these songs.That's not the only reason, either: The songs are performed perfectly, and the announcer/composer is the perfect guide through this strange and fantastical world. And the animation is arguably the best of any movie. Literally, any frame from this movie is worthy of being hung up in an art museum. It is that quality.That's basically what 'Fantasia' is: a two-hour night at the symphony, with illustrations. It has no plot, no recognizable characters, no dialog, none of the conventions of a regular movie, and yet it overcomes all of this. I mean, there is just a handful of movies out there as original as 'Fantasia.' This is really something special.The best segments, in my opinion (everybody has their own favorites), are 'Toccotta and Fugue,' 'The Rite of Spring,' and 'Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria.'",

This work deserves a 10 because of the achievements, the innovation and the quality it represents. The visual special effects are outstanding for the time and all of them are perfectly combine with the music. Let's remark that Fantasia was the FIRST commercial film with multichannel sound and that the idea for \"Fantasound\" came from Walt Disney himself. The resulting film was run in a theatre that was equipped with (depending upon available resources) anywhere between 30 and 80 individual speakers, set up behind the screen and around the perimeter of the theatre's ceiling. Fantasound also featured a wider dynamic range than conventional sound film, allowing for a fuller, stronger sound. So, in my opinion, this masterpiece deserves a 10/10.",
