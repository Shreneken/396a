            "content": "\"The Great Dictator\" (United Artists, 1940), became the long awaited talking debut of silent film comedian, Charlie Chaplin (who also wrote and directed), in a political satire on Adolph Hitler, only the way Chaplin dared to do at the time. He plays a Jewish barber and Hynkel, dictator of Tomania. Some of the humor cannot really be absorbed at first glance, but after repeated viewing, it gets better. My personal classic moment occurs with Chaplin in the barber shop working on a bald-headed customer by giving him a shave while listening to a classical composition on the radio, never missing a beat. Co-starring opposite Chaplin for the second and final time is Paulette Goddard as Hannah. Goddard became the only Chaplin leading lady to ever make a success on her own while the others just drifted to \"B\" movies or faded away. Jack Oakie as Napaloni, the Dictator of Bacteria (a spoof on Mussolini), appears late in the story but shares with Chaplin some of its brilliant comedic moments. Both Chaplin and Oakie earned Academy Award nominations for their performances (Chaplin for Best Actor/Oakie for Best Supporting Actor), but no wins. Henry Daniell as Garbitsch and Reginald Gardiner as Schultz also share the spotlight. Aside from Chaplin's screenplay in poking fun of its then current issues on European invasion by the Nazis, \"The Great Dictator\" expertly blends satire with dramatic overtones. Its closing scene in which Chaplin makes a speech pleading for all people to follow the path of peace, brotherhood and democracy, is not to be missed. Whether this movie is above or beyond the Marx Brothers' \"Duck Soup\" (Paramount, 1933) is anyone's matter of taste. (***)",

            "content": "This ingenious and innovate comedy packs many priceless moments and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber's chair , among them .Production on the movie started in 1937 and shot in 539 days when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace , as was the case when it was released in 1940 ; however , this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to its satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America . The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wives , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished The Great Dictator . The picture was released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities was the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland . This movie was Charles Chaplin's biggest-ever box-office hit , grossing about $5 million at the time.",

            "content": "Back at the dawn of the talkie era, Charlie Chaplin defended his decision not to start making sound films by saying \"The moment the little tramp talks, he's dead\". He was right of course. His comic persona was the creation of an era in cinema when words and voices were irrelevant. The little tramp's appeal lay entirely in how he did things, not in what he was supposed to be saying. And yet it was inevitable that if Chaplin wanted to continue in the business he would have to cave in eventually. Besides Chaplin's agenda was itself changing, and he had now reached a point in his life where he really wanted to speak to the world.Many of the early scenes in The Great Dictator seem to prove Chaplin's fears about sound film. The slapstick has lost its flow, looking forced and awkward. And it appears Chaplin has no real idea how to write or direct dialogue. Sometimes characters make some banal little comment on the action as if simply to fill up the silence. Even worse things happen when Chaplin attempts verbal humour, resorting to feeble puns like the one about the gas keeping him awake all night (not that puns are necessarily bad, just that Chaplin isn't very good at them). Above all, the visual and verbal business is poorly integrated, with a badly-timed stop-start feel. It makes it particularly jarring after a dialogue scene to see this ageing version of the little tramp doing some of his old moves, such as teetering on one foot as he runs into a squad of stormtroopers. These scenes are unlikely to raise more than a titter, and are a sad testament to the fact that this familiar character was past his prime and out of time.But this is a tale of two Charlies. For the first time in decades Chaplin creates a new character for himself in dictator Adenoid Hynkel. And the great thing about Hynkel is that he sidesteps Chaplin's inability with comedy in words but still makes use of comedy in sound. The dictator's cod-Germanic speech is part silly-voice, part linguistic nonsense and it is very, very funny. It actually adds to the humour that no-one else in the picture speaks it, and that Hynkel mostly lapses into it in moments of anger, as if it was some involuntary anxiety-driven affectation. The other great thing about Hynkel is that he is one of Chaplin's great works of satire. The nonsense language is of course a lampooning of Hitler's forceful speechmaking, but the parody continues through everything Hynkel does. Take for example when he has finished posing with the baby, and rather disgustedly wipes his hand clean. He does it with the same stiff-faced disdain that Hitler always displayed in public, but the character's puffed-up austerity is also being punctured by the fact that he's just got his hand covered in wee wee. The little tramp, a creation of and for the silent era, could not make the transition to sound. But Hynkel is a creation of and for the sound era, and he works fantastically.As the picture unfolds, it begins to gain maturity and clarity, not to mention comic brilliance. Jack Oakie's Napoloni makes a perfect partner for Hynkel, and their antics together are like the Marx Brothers at their most riotous. Napoloni is also a work of satire equal to Hynkel, with Oakie working in many of Mussolini's less dignified mannerisms, such as curling his lip and bulging his eyes like he's trying to squeeze out a fart. While Chaplin's direction is at its most overt and showy, he also cleverly and subtly gears his compositions towards ridicule, making the most of those tall set designs to show off the dictator as some little twerp. And finally, the picture acquires the poignancy that made Chaplin's silent features stand out, this time with an extra bite in the seriousness of its message. It is then that you realise Chaplin knew his little tramp was finished, and yet that he needed him here to deliver his point. By subjecting him to sound, Chaplin sacrifices his alter-ego, making a means to speak his mind to the public who had loved him.",

            "content": "The tagline of 'The Great Dictator' is 'the comedy masterpiece', and I couldn't think of a better line to sum this film up. It's a hilarious political satire, but it also delivers a vitally important message. This film was released at the time when Hitler was at the height of his power and the main character, dictator Hynkel, is obviously a reference to him.Charlie Chaplin is simply outstanding in this film in what was his first spoken role. To play two completely different characters, Hynkel and the Jewish barber, so convincingly in the same film is truly remarkable. Chaplin's speech at the end, which is very much HIS speech even though he's playing a character, is a piece of cinema I will never forget. Such a powerful, moving and compelling speech that remains relevant even today.Making a comedy out of such a tragedy is risky business, but Chaplin's anti-fascist message ensured it wasn't taken the wrong way. 'The Great Dictator' is a hilarious but meaningful and powerful film. A brilliant piece of cinema.",

            "content": "Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, is a spoiled child who becomes angry when he cannot gets what he really wants... And what he simply wants is nothing less than the world...In one of the extraordinary scenes of Chaplin art, Hynkel performs a ballet with the 'world' which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp...Chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films... In a scene at the beginning of the movie, which takes place during World War I, the Tomanian messenger crashes the plane and thinks... He is about to die... In a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words... The empty double-talk continue ascending into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of War films...In another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the Jewish ghetto and assumes command of the resistance fomenting rebellion among the old men, he plans to kill the dictator... One of the group must kill the ruthless conqueror of Austerlich... Whoever is chosen will naturally die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in Tomanian history...The sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear...For all its disappointing shortcomings, \"The Great Dictator\" is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither Chaplin nor anymore else could have given it: the irony of history... The necessity to murder Hynkel presages the assassination attempt against Hitler by his generals... The force of the original satire is only surpassed by history's imitation of art...With a splendid sequence like the duck-shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the humbly Jewish barber and vice versa, \"The Great Dictator\" is Chaplin's first talking movie... This time 'Charles' and not 'Charlie,' wanting to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy, the last in which he uses his celebrated 'Tramp Character.'",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, \"The Great Dictator\" was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process.There are two reasons to like \"The Great Dictator.\" One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny.Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, \"Dictator\" presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept \"Phooey\" (a. k. a. \"F\u00fchrer\") of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in.The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have \"perfected\" a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: \"Far from perfect.\")Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: \"What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!\"The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto.The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of \"machine men with machine minds\" as if he was still making \"Modern Times\" and punching the sky at times for lame effect.To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, \"The Great Dictator\" is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.",

On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.",

            "content": "I find this film remarkable. Here you have a man at the peak of his celebrity who has some moral responsibility. How rare! Imagine Michael Jordan risking all (and eventually losing all) in order to do the right thing. This film is a multidimensional risk: he is trying to master the talkie (though his talent is in the visual), he is trying to mix tragedy and comedy (always a hard mix, and nearly impossible when using current events) and he is trying to actually effect his audience, to counter evil in the land.One must remember that when this was started, Hitler was generally admired in the US and essentially no one at all was standing up for the Jews. (In the film: `first we get the Jews, and then the brunettes.')I think he succeeds so far as the talkie, but he doesn't stand at the top of the heap, and several years before, the Marx brothers had made their own, superior, antiwar movie (Duck Soup). He succeeds in mixing comedy and tragedy only by alternating, and extending the length of the film.Concerning his effectiveness in countering evil: his impassioned speech at the end is powerful. But it appears to have had no effect whatsoever. This is the man that McCarthy and friends drove from the US! I think one of his mistakes was portraying the pogrom and invasions as the work of one man, rather than of a whole nation: Germans, not Nazis.",

            "review_title": "The Tramp Finally Speaks",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin certainly put off speaking on cinema long enough. His bread and butter was made with his little tramp character on the silent screen. But when Chaplin finally did speak he spoke some of the most memorable prose ever spoken on the cinema. The eloquence of his appeal for universal brotherhood is maybe more relevant today than even back in 1940 when he decided to satirize Nazi Germany in The Great Dictator.In his memoirs Chaplin said that he would never have made The Great Dictator had he suspected for a moment exactly the extent of what was going on in Nazi Germany. It was bad enough in 1940, but of course Hitler's final solution doctrine about systematic extermination wasn't put in place until the following year. After that Nazi Germany provided damn few laughs.As the film opens Chaplin hearkens back to his World War I classic Shoulder Arms when we see him as a bumbling soldier during World War I. He saves the life of air ace Reginald Gardiner, but in doing so is injured and loses his memory. Some fifteen years later Charlie regains his memory and leaves the hospital and returns to his profession as barber in the Jewish quarter of his native city.No one notices, but the little barber with the funny mustache bears no small resemblance to the dictator of his country of Ptomania, Adenoid Hynkel. And as it turns out Reginald Gardiner who is a storm trooper commandant gets reacquainted with his savior and has a reassessment of his feelings about Jews. Of course in the end that resemblance proves to be Gardiner and Chaplin's salvation and in Chaplin's fantasy world the salvation of humanity.In his Hynkel persona Chaplin was the first on the screen to satirize Hitler, to make him an object of ridicule. Later on when America was finally in World War II in some of our lesser propaganda efforts, Hitler impersonators like Bobby Watson leaned heavily on what Chaplin did in The Great Dictator. Of course his best Hynkel moment is the famous dream scene where the globe becomes a big beach ball type balloon with Chaplin lovingly treating it in the best fetishistic manner. As the barber Chaplin also goes back to his little tramp roots and is seen giving one of his customers a shave to the music of Brahm's Number 5 Dance could have been done in any of his silent classics. Chaplin's final speech was a masterpiece. People like Orson Welles, Paul Muni, and Spencer Tracy are probably the players most noted for giving long addresses well on screen, but for a man whose cinematic career was spent in silence up to that point, Chaplin was nothing short of brilliant. When the Tramp finally spoke, what profound things he had to say.The Great Dictator made a pile of money for United Artists of whom one of the partners was Charlie Chaplin. It received five Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Chaplin, Best Supporting Actor for Jack Oakie, Best Musical Score for Meredith Willson, and Best Original Screenplay for Chaplin. Curiously enough Charlie wasn't nominated for Best Director. Casting Jack Oakie as the spoof dictator Nappoloni based on that other Axis partner Mussolini was a stroke of genius. Oakie played loudmouth blowhards his entire film career and as Nappoloni of Bacteria, Oakie played one of the biggest blowhards in history. Oakie lost to Walter Brennan for The Westerner and Chaplin gave way to Jimmy Stewart in The Philadelphia Story. Chaplin did win the New York Film Critic's Award for Best Actor in 1940.Others worthy of note are Charlie's then estranged wife Paulette Goddard as the barber's love interest. Paulette who was Paulette Levy by birth played a Jew for maybe the only time in her career. Henry Daniell is minister of propaganda Garbitsch and he's his usual cold and cynical, but Charlie should have gotten Martin Kosleck who got a lot of work during World War II with a dead-on impersonation of Joseph Goebbels. For Air Minister Herring who would you get for the weight challenged Herman Goerring, but Billy Gilbert.In a world where a lot of self seeking politicians and terrorists appeal to the worst in man, The Great Dictator is timeless because of its appeal to the better angels of our nature as James Madison phrased it. Never miss this when it is broadcast it will renew your human spirit.",

            "review_title": "\"Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental\"",
            "content": "When a film opens with the above note, referring to Chaplin's dual role, but also a cheeky dig at the fact that Hynkel is a not-at-all disguised parody of Hitler, you know exactly what you're in for. This two-hour long lambasting of the Nazi regime may not be subtle, but by God Chaplin knew how to rip the p***.If rumours are to be believed, Hitler had him placed at the top of his death list after this film's release \u2013 now that's street cred. We first see Adenoid Hynkel addressing the German (Tomanian) nation, giving a speech that involves much arm-saluting, nonsense English that makes use of the phrase \"sour kraut\" and his more embittered rages descending into coughing fits. \"His excellency has just referred to the Jewish people\", informs an announcer after a rage-filled moment that causes microphones to bend and quiver in fear. His first German-language dictates to his minister of war (Herring) involve \"banana\" and \"cheeseuncrackerz\". Look out too for instructions to his Minister of Interiors, Garbitsch.I've never really gotten into Charlie (always credited as Charles) Chaplin, as I find his innocent sentimentality a little hard to get to grips with in today's society. W.C.Fields, and, to an extent, Harold Lloyd and Laurel & Hardy can still entertain, as they have something of the attitude, or edge, that Chaplin lacks. Ironically, it's modern times that mean we now find it hard to fully appreciate Modern Times. However, dialogue and a harsher undercurrent \u2013 including a Jewish barber (Chaplin, again) being hung from a lamppost mean that even today The Great Dictator is relevant.There are some nice silly jokes, such as the barber, confronted by a Stormtrooper, being told: \"and I thought you were an Arian\". \"Well, I'm a veget \u2013 arian\", replies Chaplin, trying to fit in. Many jokes \u2013 such as Hynkel making a long speech and his secretary typing up just a couple of words; then saying just a couple of words only for her to translate it into paragraphs \u2013 were originated here and have been repeated countless times in other places. Some of the most amusing slapstick is when Hynkel meets fellow dictator Mussolini (Napaloni), and tries to impress him by having the greater psychological perspective in all their meetings. In a gag much honoured by Bugs Bunny, the two crank themselves up to ever-greater heights on barber's chairs.Elsewhere, the film also has a grand scale, with ceilings on sets and news reports propelling the narrative \u2013 you know, the sort of thing Citizen Kane was so highly praised for the following year. If there's a fault with this film then it's not so much with the sentimental, whiter-than-white Jewish population, but with Chaplin's interpretation of Hynkel. Although he gets all the best jokes and scenes, he's simply too likable to really convey the threat Chaplin was trying to stop. Nevertheless, this is forgotten as the ending gives us the Jewish barber taking Hynkel's place, and Chaplin making an impassioned, three-minute speech in the name of freedom.Charles Chaplin played two roles in this movie, wrote, directed, produced and, uncredited, composed original music for it. To claim it changed the world is an overstatement. America still had a good opinion of Hitler at the time, and, after it was released... they still had a good opinion of Hitler. It was still some time before they would even enter the second world war, and with the final speech being adopted for Communist pamphlets in England, this only caused Chaplin troubles when it came to the McCarthy witch trials. There's a sense that Chaplin isn't the master in the field of talkies, and that his use of mime was beginning to date. History was overtaking him, but The Great Dictator still stands as one of the most personal, and risk-taking films ever put on celluloid.Postscript, April 2012: I've since watched all of Chaplin's features and every short. So, I was talking rubbish when I said twelve years ago that he didn't have modern appeal. Sorry about that. However, I stand by most of the review, even if \"Chaplin on Hitler's death list\" is a \"fact\" I've only read in Trivial Pursuits. Oh, look out for the documentary that's included on the DVD - \"The Tramp and the Dictator\" - well worth seeing, as well as Chaplin's extensive thoughts on this film and its aftermath in his 1964 autobiography.",

Deutsch Juden...grrr deutsch Juden!\" Another great scene is when he's arguing with the Mussolini character about the Ostralich border, and their argument almost turns into a catfight.Seeing how he pointed the finger at all tyranny, it's easy to see why HUAC used this movie to kick Chaplin out of the country. No matter, Chaplin ended up getting the last laugh; not only did the Oscars eventually give him an honorary Oscar, but the world remembers him as one of the greatest directors in history.",

First of all, the pure physical comedy is phenomenal. The choreographed fight scenes are priceless. Then there is his persona as a variant of the little tramp, this time as a Jewish barber who has had amnesia for twenty years. But the courageous parody portrayal of the disgusting figures of World War II is great. It it weren't so tragic it would be even funnier. Just the names of the figures alone are great. Paulette Godard is really fun and has a strong female voice. It's a terrific film in every aspect.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin is \"The Great Dictator\" in this 1940 comedy-drama also starring Paulette Goddard, Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell and Billy Gilbert. Chaplin has the dual role of a Hitler-like dictator, Adenoid Hynkel (\"Hail, Hynkel\") (all the countries are fictional, and the party logo is one X on top of another) and also a war veteran, a sweet barber who looks like Hynkel. There are some truly hilarious parts of this film as well as some truly dramatic ones. The barber trying to keep from falling out of a plane is just one; the nonsense German Hynkel speaks; the barber shaving one customer in time with the music, playing to Chaplin's silent film strengths; Hynkel's dancing with his world globe, which is really a huge balloon.The serious parts take place in the Jewish ghetto where the Jews are persecuted by Hynkel's men - Jew is written on the store fronts, and the soldiers are violent. In such stark contrast to the comedy, these scenes make a strong impression. The ghetto never knows what to expect - when Hynkel is trying to get a loan from a man named Epstein to attack and take over Osterlich, he has his soldiers lay off the Jews so as not to upset Epstein. Eventually the barber winds up in a concentration camp but escapes and is mistaken for Hynkel.Under Chaplin's direction, none of the film seems to be played for comedy. Hynkel himself is a buffoon, but he means it. The most amazing part of the film for me was the very end, when the Barber gives a speech as Hynkel. It's absolutely brilliant and very timely. The beautiful, radiant Goddard, looking at the sky, hope in her eyes, is not something I'll ever forget.Highly recommended. Made in 1940, the U.S. had not entered the war and Europe's problems were just beginning. Alas, the barber's speech wasn't reality.",

The Great Dictator is just a wonderful satire on the Anti-Semitic Nazi regime- Hitler mayn't have got the joke in this comedy, but I think he got the point.The Great Dictator looks great, with some great dialogue and a chockful of great moments, comedic or not. It is also excellently directed, and features wonderful performances from Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie and especially the comedy genius himself. The Great Dictator has many great moments as I've said, but three scenes stand out especially. One is the barber dancing in time to a Hungarian dance by Brahms. Another is Hynkel's solo ballet with a globe of the world. My favourite though is the final speech, pleading for universal tolerance. Mawkish and outrageous it is, but also very powerful and quite ambitious if you put it in context(I can only imagine the controversy that scene alone caused).Overall, wonderful and powerful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Only Chaplin could deliver such a high level of humor and scathing satire in the same film, which was a beacon of light in a very dark time, and obviously on the right side of history. I love his humanity, courage, and vision in delivering this message at a time when America was wavering about entering WWII. There were lots of highlights:The on-point Hitler impression. Aside from the vocalization, throughout the movie we see Chaplin poking at the dictator's lack of intelligence, deep insecurity, and insane whims. There is also a steady stream of mockery of the Nazi war machine: the exaggerated march, overly vertical salute, inventions like the bullet-proof uniform and compact parachute, and plays on names, e.g. The \"Phooey\" instead of The Fuhrer, Herr Herring as Goring, Minister of War, Herr Garbitsch as Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda, etc.Hitler/Hynkel getting this advice, with the relevance to today's ugly turn in politics: \"I thought your reference to the Jews might have been more violent. We've got to rouse the people's anger. At this time, violence against the Jews might take the public's mind off its stomach.\" And later: \"You might go a little further with the Jews - burn down some of their houses. A spectacular assault on their ghettos, now that might prove diverting.\"The satire in the line \"Brunettes are trouble makers. They're worse than the Jews,\" and as the fascists dream about a blonde world, Herr Garbitsch slipping in that it would have \"a brunette dictator\", which of course was an irony of Hitler's Aryan ideal despite his own looks.The physical comedy, an example of which early on is in dropping a grenade down his sleeve as he tries to throw it, and later his understated reaction to finding out they're flying upside-down and out of gas. Later we see Hitler/Hynkel doing silly things like a ballet leap across the floor, followed by climbing the curtain and imitating Garbo's \"I want to be alone,\" and also knocking that balloon globe around with his behind.The Jewish barber being a veteran of WWI, and then also walking down the street in persona of The Tramp, both of which were reminders of the humanity of the Jewish people.Paulette Goddard's character saying \"Do you believe in God? I do! But, if there wasn't one, would you live any different? I wouldn't.\"The shave to the music of Brahms (where Chuck Jones got the idea for the Bugs Bunny 'Rabbit of Seville' bit ten years later).Commander Schultz: \"Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people. Your policy is worse than a crime. It's a tragic blunder!\"My God, that speech near the end. Absolutely stirring. The beginning of it is:\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.\"",

A slap in the face of tyranny and bloodthirsty rulers all across the globe, but particularly aimed at Nazi Germany. Even thought it has such a serious theme the movie is still filled to the brim with laughs and shenanigans that can only be delivered by Chaplin. It shows you the absurdness of fascism and Nazism by openly lampooning its philosophy and its leaders, but also it has a subtle message of terror showing us what happens when such people get in place of power. It all culminates with one of the most iconic speeches in cinematic history that resounds with people all around the globe to this day. A must watch for any fan of comedy, history and cinema!",

It should be noted that Hitler was an admirer of Chaplin's work, to the point of copying his mustache. I doubt that it continued after this film, but we will never know.The film itself is entertaining and was skillfully used as anti-Nazi propaganda material inside and outside the United States. It's not quite a comedy ... it's more of a satire. Personally, I had no problem with an amusing Hitler or laughing at the Third Reich. The way in which Chaplin caricatured Hitler becomes pertinent in the face of the German monster's attitudes. Sometimes satirizing is a way of saying very serious things without making it seem heavy. Perhaps even heavier and deeper is Chaplin's interpretation as a Jew in this same film. It's not fun, he never makes jokes about the way Jews are treated, on the contrary: it shows the brutality and abuse of authorities and soldiers well.The dialogues are excellent, especially the famous final speech where Chaplin truly makes an overt and evident political appeal. The props, costumes and sets are also very good. In addition to Chaplin, who carries the film on his back, the cast features Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie and Reginald Gardiner, all of whom are very good but unable to steal the protagonist's shine.",

            "content": "I once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months back. I thought every minute of what I was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and I didn't want to spoil the whole thing if I were to watch it from the start, I decided that I would rent it immediately. Well, the video store which I frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had previous to that experience only seen some Chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after I saw the snippet of The Great Dictator, I checked out three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times (City Lights was great, I found the Gold Rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and I found Modern Times to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen (second funniest, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more exactly).Finally, the whole of the Great Dictator. Well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. But these moments don't always mix well. Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. Plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of Chaplin's talent. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie as a whole, but I thought it of little consequence. I would have given it a solid 7/10 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. The final speech that the Jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. Yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech brought me to tears, and I consider it one of the best endings I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10.",

The atrocities of the Holocaust weren't fully known to the world yet, so Chaplin's anti-Hitler diatribe is, in the minds of some, misguided. After the war this mindset would result in the debacle of the blacklist, when Chaplin, among others, were branded \"pre-mature anti-fascists.\" In other words, it wasn't politically acceptable to be against Nazism until war broke out with the U.S. Hard to believe anyone could still see things that way now, but some do.The film industry of the 1930s wanted no part of international politics, no matter how blatant the brutality of a given regime. Profits were at stake. It was little goyisha Charley Chaplin, playing a Jewish barber, who took a public stand.While \"The Great Dictator\" may not among Chaplin's finest films, it may, historically, be his finest hour.",

            "content": "Since enough plot elements have been discussed in previous reviews, suffice it to say that although I enjoyed this legendary Chaplin film, it is by no means a masterpiece. It's slow in getting started and then becomes a series of heavy-handed vignettes about life in the ghetto contrasted with the life of The Great Dictator, giving Chaplin a chance to emote in high style as both the tramp-like Jewish barber and as Adenoid Hynkel. His funniest bits are of course whenever he does a brilliant piece of \"silent\" acting with gestures timed to the background music--notably in the barbershop scene where a nervous customer gets a close shave. Unfortunately, none of the dialogue is as brilliant as his use of pantomime.Indeed, there is a heavy handedness about much of the story's pace and direction. It almost seems as though Chaplin told his actors to play against his comedy by keeping a sober straight face uppermost in mind--watch how Henry Daniell and Reginald Gardiner play their parts with that stiff upper lip approach. An exception is Jack Oakie as Napaloni, doing a brilliant take-off on Mussolini. As a poor Jewish waif, Paulette Goddard shows all the vivaciousness that made her a star in subsequent films throughout the '40s. She adds warmth to all of her scenes with Chaplin.Some of the gags are carried on at too great a length, outlasting their comic value. And criticism can be made of some of the sequences played against fake scenery when obviously a good deal of money was spent on the main sets. The station scene featuring Napaloni's arrival is staged on an obviously fake studio set where the painted scenery stands out like a sore thumb. Jack Oakie got his only Supporting Role Oscar nomination for this one and Chaplin won a Best Actor nomination.Whatever the shortcomings, it does manage to keep afloat with some very amusing sequences. Chaplin deserves credit for even attempting such a satire--especially considering this was near the outbreak of the U.S. entry into war. His scene with the globe shows off his rare comic timing.A final note: the six minute speech at the end seems improbable coming from the timid Jewish barber and strikes a false note because it's so out of character. Obviously, Chaplin intended it to give the film a personal message of hope.",

He portrays two characters - the sweet, innocent Jewish barber - a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed thugs, who routinely rough up its residents, or leave them alone, dependent upon his mood that day or week. The barber is among them, but is befriended by his former commanding officer, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to keep things quiet for a while, until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, most specifically the barber, and the feisty young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise will be - who will be the one among these Jews to put their lives on the line to get rid of Hynkel and his cronies? We needn't guess too hard to know the answer; the barber is a dead ringer for the dictator, and he is outfitted in his image, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military gear. Hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends to the country of Osterlich, where Mr Jaeckel's (Maurice Moscovich) cousin has a farm, and they can live peaceably for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces, thinking him to be the notorious barber. The latter, meanwhile, has been escorted with Schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The ensuing ten minutes is pure Chaplin himself, speaking from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. Albeit Chaplin started production on the film in 1937, it can be forgiven some naivete. He was allegedly unaware of the gravity of this persecution and hatred, and said had he known the full extent, he would never have made the film, because he most likely believed it would have trivialized the situation. He has a marvelous supporting cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always wonderful Billy Gilbert as the bumbling Herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as the dictator Napaloni, his rival for conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with globe, with just a musical accompaniment is sheer, luminous inspiration, and luminous, as well, is Paulette Goddard at the film's end, smiling through her tears. I have seen this film before, but there is always something new in it for me. Last evening, when it finished, I sat there in tears. I defy anyone not to be moved by it.",

There just isn't an intriguing story here (or one that should be spread out as long as it has). I know this film is supposed to be a spoof of Hitler, but it fails at that, because there are just a few comic scenes that could have easily been put in a 20 minute feature (this would have stopped the repeating of several \u0091funny' or should I say tiresome gags as well). I hear you say though: but there STILL is a love story. Well sorry mates, that one is quite a bummer as well, because there are no real emotions there and the viewer is not shown how the barber and Hannah fall in love, you just have to assume it was love at first sight. The ending is NOT at all original and the final words that hit the viewer, just before the lights go out are understandably a bit idealistic (which makes them seem a bit cheesy now). But remember, back in 1940 people all over the world didn't yet know what was happening in Germany and they still though worse things might be prevented. In conclusion, I must say that I admire Chaplin's craftsmanship and his guts to make this film, yet I also feel a bit bewildered why this ranks so high in IMDB's top 250. Maybe it's the intention or the idea behind the film. All I can say is, that watched out of it's original context in the 21st century, this film comes off way worse than other things I've seen by Chaplin. It's just not funny, too unemotional and too long to be good.\nStill a 6 out of 10",

Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel.And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all.The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun.This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah).There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10",

            "content": "Hasn't everyone ever wished for a better world, with no wars, poverty, unhappiness, with no prejudices, no crimes and no tears? I know I have. And so did Charles. He wanted to abolish everything that brought misery and pain into the lives of people and tried and made this world a little better with his presence and the work he had done.\"The great dictator\" is his first completely sound feature film and the greatest satire on World War II and its instigator, Adolf Hitler. It's funny how the lives of two completely different people were twined together so closely: they were born a few days apart in April 1889, both went through poverty and were destined to become famous - only that one of them became famous for bringing so much laughter and joy to the world and the other did the opposite. The great power can be used both ways but only the power of good can create something worthy.Charles plays a dual role of the dictator and a Jewish barber who both look coincidentally identical but wish for radically different things. The barber's character is in a way a swan song to the role of Tramp Chaplin has been playing for the last 25 years; he has overgrown this character - he talks now, he walks differently, he even has bigger problems than the ones he used to have. Now he is ready to say loud and clear what he doesn't want the world to look like and by doing so in his passionate 3-minute monologue at the end of the movie he proclaims his views, beliefs and desires to us and hopes to reach out to us, not everybody but to those willing to hear and change, willing to fight for freedom, willing to follow our dreams, willing to be alive.\"The great dictator\" is an unsurpassed gem of a movie, not because it bravely and brilliantly caricaturized the Nazis when the world was at war but because it showed how even one little man can make a difference. I know I said it so many times already but I love Charles Chaplin and with this movie he reached a new high in his outstanding filmography and made us hear with our own ears that he's got a lot more to say and give to the world.",

Due to this request from my friend I decided I was really going to watch this film. The minute I sat down to view the film I was absolutely blown away. From the credits I was falling of my seat; I just couldn't contain myself. The film is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish Barber, who comes back from fighting in the war. Due to the heroics of the barber, he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle which the jews had. But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested, but only then to escape to the confines of the Jewish surburb, 'The Ghetto'. Due to this escape, the german army began searching which meant that the Barber and Stolz got arrested but again they escaped, only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion. *****THE SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, IT COMPLIES THE MORALS WHICH SOCIETY COULD ONLY DREAM ABOUT. IN THE SPEECH IT CONTRADICTS THE WHOLE MEANING OF THE FILM BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUNESS AND SINCERENITY WHICH IT ENTAILED, AND IT DEFINATELY WORKS, BECAUSE I DID WALK OUT FEELING GUILTY ABOUT HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES, LOOKING AT THE SMALLEST THING SUCH AS BEING IGNORANT TO SOMEONE TO THE BIGGEST, MOST PROMINENT THINGS SUCH AS WAR.",

But even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed as \"Hynkel\", and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating that much I suppose. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. It's not even really the character talking anymore, it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era I suppose. This is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.",

            "content": "With the Nazi rise to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930's, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it. The catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to Chaplin as a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a dead-on parody of Hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from World War I up to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time, only to discover how different the world is under Nazi rule.Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at the time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-nominated supporting role as a Mussolini look-alike (Benzini Napaloni) who gives Chaplin's Hitler character, Adenoid Hynkel, a lot of fits. Henry Daniell is his usual staid self as Garbitsch, chief adviser to Adenoid Hynkel. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting. The film was also nominated for best picture.Chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter, and there were no other major films made regarding Nazi Germany up to that time. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even rebuilding a set and re-shooting a scene to get things right. By the time of the film's release in October of 1940, the war in Europe was well under way with Hitler conquering one country after another, so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began.There isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect; the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and/or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very very funny, but it leads no where in terms of the plot. Likewise, the escape of both the barber and Schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for Hynkel in order to give Chaplin (through the barber character) an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of Aryan superiority than to have a Jewish Barber mistaken for Hynkel? Still, the film contains many high comic moments, such as the rally speech, the new war developments (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), the dancing globe scene, the coin in the pudding scene, and the entire scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. One can also not forget the risks Chaplin took in making his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film, and financing the film himself. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

            "content": "I know many people prefer Charlie Chaplin when he's silent, but I have to rank this as my favorite Chaplin film, sound and all. This is one of those movies chock full of one memorable scene after another: Chaplin's hapless soldier trying to load and fire a giant gun; his goofy dictator cavorting with an inflatable beach ball designed to look like a globe of the world; his gentle barber trying to give a member of the Gestapo a shave. I've heard that Chaplin was put on Hitler's death list as a result of this film; I don't know whether that's true or not, but if he was I'm not surprised. I can't even imagine the guts it took to make a film that so obviously mocked such a scary historical figure. In a time when comedians mock our world leaders left and right, it's easy to forget that there were times (and still places today) when doing so could get you killed.Without Chaplin's impassioned plea that closes the movie, in which he steps out of character and warns his audience directly about the consequences of ignoring the gathering storm of Nazi Germany (and fascism in general), \"The Great Dictator\" would be a marvelous comedy. With that plea, it becomes much more than merely a marvelous comedy; it becomes an important and inspiring historical document, that happens also to be pretty damn funny too.Grade: A+",

Yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent film. So, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear Chaplin speak on film.The movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I enjoyed the film, I was not nearly as impressed by this as Chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. That's because I really felt annoyed by some of Chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played Adenoid Hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the Three Stooges). Plus, playing a funny Hitler is hard for me to take.However, when Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), but for its excellent acting and humanity. The final speech by the barber (impersonating Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to my eyes. Watch the film for this reason alone.",

            "content": "\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible.\"That final five minute speech given by Chaplin shows his true genius as a director, actor, and screenwriter. He was capable of understanding better than anyone the social realities he was part of and made one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films I've seen. Giving his character who had been silent up to that film such an important speech was such a powerful and historical moment in film history. I don't know why I always believed Chaplin was one of those directors that never managed to handle the transition from silent films to talkies very well, because ironically this (his first complete talkie) is my favorite film of his. The way he was able to use his physical comedy with as little dialogue as possible and then add some funny lines was a beautiful touch. He said what he could with his physical performance and then used sound to say what actions couldn't tell wholeheartedly. Chaplin had proved that actions speak louder than words with his Tramp films, but when those words are in tune with actions they can blow you away and that is how I felt with The Great Dictator. In 1940 no one knew about the horrendous crimes the Nazi's were going to commit against the Jews, but Chaplin was warning the world from the beginning how hate and racism could destroy the world. That powerful speech continues to resonate with audiences almost 75 years later and you can add that scene to Chaplin's wonderful legacy in film. There are several other memorable scenes in this two hour film (the longest Chaplin film I've seen, yet probably the one I would be most likely to rewatch), mostly all involving Chaplin's wonderful physical comedy as he makes fun of Hitler. While the entire world seemed to be ignoring Hitler and Mussolini's abuse of power, Chaplin courageously was warning us in the best way he could, through slapstick comedy, about their horrendous racial beliefs and the dehumanization it would lead to. The film opens during the First World War where a soldier (Charles Chaplin) who is later introduced as a Jewish barber, is saving the life of a pilot named Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). They escape on a small plane, but eventually they crash and the barber loses his memory. Several years later he is released from the hospital but everything has changed. They lost the war, and Dictator Adenoid Hynke (also played by Charles Chaplin) is now rebuilding the country of Tomania. The Jews in the ghetto are being discriminated and treated poorly by Hynke's soldiers and the barber has no clue as to what is going on. A friendly neighbor named Hannah helps him, but there is not much they can do against the soldiers. When he gets into trouble with some of them, the commanding officer arrives and it happens to be Schultz who immediately helps the barber and offers him and the people in his ghetto protection. For a while things look good for them, but when Dictator Hynke discovers Schultz is helping the Jews he sends for his arrest and the Jews suffer persecution once again. Hynke plans to rule the world so his first step is invading Osterlich, the place where Hannah and her family were forced to flee. Things aren't looking good for the Barber and his friends, but keeping his head up and joining forces with Schultz, they are ready to make a stand.The Great Dictator was truly a delightful and joyous experience. I don't know why I liked it more than his silent films because I really enjoyed all of them, but there was something about The Great Dictator that just hit all the right notes with me. I fell in love with this film and will definitely recommend it as my favorite Chaplin film. I wasn't considering watching his next two talkies, but after the experience I had with The Great Dictator I'm definitely considering watching them. I loved the way Chaplin clearly stated his beliefs in this film, mocking Hitler and his inhumane ideas with a courageous performance considering no one was doing anything to stop him at that time. But it's not just a brave film, it is really funny as well and I found myself laughing throughout many scenes. His physical comedic talents can still be seen in this talkie; one of his most memorable scenes involves a globe dance sequence. Paulette Goddard, who was also in Chaplin's Modern Times, gives yet another sweet performance, and Jack Oakie will forever be remembered for his role as Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, which was a clear lampoon on Mussolini. This was one perfectly executed satire that happened to come along at the right moment. Unlike in other politically correct films, Chaplin makes it evident that ridiculing Hitler was his main objective. It is a classic and a must see for film lovers everywhere.",

            "content": "April 1889 is significant for two births that occurred within four days of each other. The births were of two men who would leave their marks, for better or worse, upon the 20th Century. On April 16, 1889 Charles Spencer Chaplin was born to poor parents in London, England. On April 20, 1889 Adolf Hitler was born to a minor bureaucrat and his wife in Austria-Hungary. The first truly great cinema clown and star and the most evil dictator of all time born four days apart - it does show the impersonal way fate acts, willy-nilly, in tossing this old globe and it's peoples about.Chaplin and Hitler never met. They never had reason to meet. Hitler, although he liked movies, was not known to be enamored by comedians. In fact few of his intimates suggest he ever laughed that much. Chaplin had little use for the demon from Austria who seized Europe by the throat and nearly destroyed it, and who did destroy millions in his death camps. But by some ironies, such as their similar ages, their paths were bound to cross. The most supreme one was the mustache. Charlie had gotten there before Adolf (publicly, that is) with his toothbrush mustache. It made it look like a showdown for ownership of a trademark was destined between the two men. Only Oliver Hardy would sport a similar one to theirs in the same period, and Hardy's bulk made him hardly look like a Hitler clone. Chaplin had read MEIN KAMPF, and knew the homicidal insanities of his contemporary. He made no mistakes about them - this man was pure evil. It helped Chaplin that he had grown up in the East End of London, heavily populated with Jews, and that his half-brother Syd was Jewish (as was his wife Paulette Goddard). Chaplin was fully aware of what this beast and his minions could do and would do. And yet he did miss the beat on the camps (more below on that).Chaplin's first full talkie picks up with the conclusion of World War I. He is playing two roles, and the first is a Jewish Barber, who is a soldier in the Tomanian Army. The soldier saves the life of an officer, Captain Schultz (Reginald Gardiner, in a good performance), who was trying to deliver an important directive to the Tomanian commanders that could have won the war. But he fails to do it, so Tomania loses. The barber is knocked out and only emerges from his amnesia twenty years later to find Adenoid Hynkel the dictator of Tomania. Hynkel is also Chaplin. His first speech on screen is a wonderful spoof on those hideous eruptions of spite and malice from \"Der Fuhrer\" that newsreels showed in that period. When he clearly says in mock German that Democracy and Free Speech stink (he says \"schtunk\") the propagandist stooge translator uses euphemisms like \"Democracy is fragrant!\" to hide the curt dismissal involved in these comments. When Hynkel goes into a tirade about the Jews, the translator will only say \"His excellency is commenting about the Jews!\". Henry Daniell (as \"Garbitsch\" - a Goebbels type of adviser) is nonchalantly listening on the podium to all this. Later, when riding home with Hynkel, Garbitsch says, \"I thought you didn't like the Jews?\" to a surprised Hynkel.So it goes throughout the film, with point by point demolition of everything hideous about the Nazis. But with fun. The swastika is reduced to a pair of exes (a \"double cross\"). The cult of the leader is spoofed by Hynkel having a schedule which allows him one five or six second pose for a sculptor and a painter (he switches the direction of his head for both). An inventor of a new bullet proof jacket offers a pistol to Hynkel to shoot him with to test it. Hynkel does just that, only to kill the man - which he just shrugs off.It's a film full of delights, even with those horrendous shadows from the monster across the ocean in our minds. Only the handling of the concentration camps is less than desirable. Instead of real torture and horrible murder being shown, the camps are shown as places where the prisoners kick each other by forced marches in close order while goose stepping. Chaplin later said that had he known what horrors were in the camps he would not have made the film.Paulette Goddard is the love interest, a spirited Jew who is shown fighting off two storm trooper thugs in one scene. Daniell is perfectly aloof as always, feeding his bosses's ego in that memorable floating balloon globe scene. Billy Gilbert is a Goering clone, Field Marshall Bismarck Herring, whose bulk is used in some scenes against Hynkel. Gardiner is Hynkel's aide, who eventually turns on him. And best is Jack Oakie, who is perfect as Napoleoni, the rival dictator (and Mussolini clone), who keeps besting Hynkel in oneupmanship (I suspect that Chaplin did not like Mussolini, but in 1939 - 1940 the Fascist leader looked more tolerable to most people, prior to his fully joining the war as Hitler's ally). THE GREAT DICTATOR was a wonderful comment by April 16 about April 20. It remains so to this day.",

There are also parodies of Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goring in Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) and Herring (Billy Gilbert). It also satirizes Benito Mussolini with a character named Benzino Napolani (Jack Oakie). The things I love most about this movie are the situations between Hynkel and the people that work for him. Because to me there is nothing funnier than a powerful guy who is a complete idiot. It's even funnier when you look at the fact that it represents Hitler. Chaplin is replacing a formidable leader, with a pathetic dweeb in the same role. Hynkel steals the show in every scene he's in.

            "content": "People who lived when world war II was going on found ways to make light of it, and one way of doing that was to make a film. When Hitler became chancellor in 1933 and showed his newfound military might to the world, many were scared of him. Others mocked him. Charlie Chaplin, in many ways, can be considered the direct antithesis to Hitler. Both had a huge amount of followers, both were born in April of 1889, and even their mustaches were the same, but the similarities end there. Chaplin was going to distance himself as far away as possible from Hitler by making fun of him in one of the most well known parodies of all time. The movie starts with the first world war, where a soldier played by Chaplin is fighting for the country of Tomania, a satirical take on Germany. After hitching a ride on a plane with a pilot named Schultz, it crashes and they are informed their country has lost the war. 20 years later, Chaplin (who has amnesia) leaves the hospital and returns to being a barber. Meanwhile, the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Chaplin) is now the leader of Tomania. As you're watching this, it occurs to you that Hitler isn't the only nazi parodied by the actors in the movie. Reichsminister Goebbels has become Herr Garbitsch, and Goring, head of the German air force, is now Herring. Schultz later on tries to get a family to kill Hynkel which draws the suspicion of his soldiers, and he is punished by being sent away. Also, a hilarious parody of Mussolini makes an appearance: Benzino Napaloni, who is the dictator of Bacteria. He tries to make a plan with Hynkel about invading Osterlich, but they only quarrel at first. The two men eventually sign a treaty which allows the invasion to commence. Toward the end, the barber played by Chaplin impersonates Hynkel and gives a speech saying people should be nice to each other and not have aggressive attitudes. In all, this is probably one of the most well known satire movies ever, and it is a prime example of how people who lived in the same time as Hitler turned him into a joke in order to make him seem less evil. I must also mention how Chaplin watched clips of Hitler speeches for this movie so he could imitate his speech pattern.",

            "content": "Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is a masterpiece whose only fault is that even Chaplin could not imagine the horrors Adolf Hitler was capable of. It is a very funny film about the darkest horrors of modern history. Chaplin was a comedic genius and 'The Great Dictator' is in my humble opinion, his finest hour. There is no greater creative feat than to take the powerful oppressor and strip him of all his power through art. Chaplin's take on Hitler strips him of all his power. The greater clown was and always will be Adolf Hitler for his reprehensible evil views which Chaplin shows through his humor were incredibly stupid as well.'The Great Dictator' is very much a film of it's time. Chaplin apparently said that he would not have made it had he known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi. Indeed some of the film has a certain creepiness because we know what we know. I still sort of grimace a bit with the subplot involving the banker Epstein and Hynkel's temporary flirtation with the Jews. The timeless aspect of it though is how it skews the theatricality of such tyrants. Hitler was all show and no substance. What Chaplin does is brutally and often hilariously parody the theatrics behind the Nazi regime. Hitler's greatest power is in how he was able to generate emotion through his grandiose speeches. I've seen the Riefenstahl pictures and to be honest they scare me more than any horror film. Chaplin being the genius he was sees humor in them. It's obvious that Chaplin spent a great deal of time studying his subject as Hitler's mannerisms are copied to the tee and he outdoes himself in parodying them. The impersonation shows how silly the real thing was.I don't think it was ever Chaplin's intention to undermine the dangers of fascism. Adenoid Hynkel is a humorous and inept boob but he is a very real danger and Chaplin generates disgust from his audience as well as laughs. It is a credit to his tremendous skills as an actor and storyteller that he can balance these aspects of the character so well. There's a fiery and aggressive violent streak in Hynkel and he is capable of terrible things and yet we see him for what he really is, a bully who hides his awkwardness and insecurities with his violent fascist views. The Little Tramp is as charming and lovable as ever. I know there is debate as to whether or not the Jewish Barber is the final incantation of Chaplin's tramp and as a Chaplin fan I believe that he absolutely is and that 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's 'killing off' the character. The Tramp was always a reflection of the times he lived in and Chaplin did not alter the times to fit comedy. He put his Tramp in situations that showed how ugly the world could be. The Tramp is always a victim of the worst society has to offer it's poor and huddled masses. In 'The Great Dictator' the Tramp has encountered the pinnacle of ugliness man kind is capable of. Chaplin is still as funny as ever but it is shocking to see the Tramp do his slapstick in the streets where 'JEW' is painted on windows or when he plays hot potato with weapons designed to decimate and maim. This could have been a very depressing movie and yet it is heart warming and hopeful because the Tramp always represents faith in the goodness of mankind. Chaplin's speech at the end is a condemnation of fascism to be sure but it is also a eulogy to the tramp and what he stood for. Chaplin absolutely earned the right to such a speech despite it's theatricality because it perfectly sums up the Tramp's entire story. You must have faith in a better tomorrow and most importantly in your self.I think through comedy we have gotten the truest depiction of what Hitler really was. Too many times artists want to portray him as evil incarnate. If Hitler was evil incarnate than the inexcusable Holocaust has an excuse. 'The Great Dictator' and Chaplin's performance bring him out into the open. Hitler was a damn fool",

            "content": "The Great Dictator came out at a time when it was riskiest, as on the brink of war a statement of the inaneness shifted n nuttiness of fascism, just shows how Chaplin had practically nothing to fear as an artist. That he is also able to incorporate a version of his usual tramp character into the mix, as a kind of general symbol (if that) of the ordinary shlub suddenly and madly under the gun, is part of the film's major appeal. Going back and forth between the styles of the film are tricky as well, as Chaplin's humor is similar but varying with the two sides of his characters. His Hynkel, the mad dictator of Tomania, is one of Chaplin's most inspired creations for himself, as he sputters off in a perfected gibberish/slant on the German-hate speech with many of the gags coming off. Some of these, ironically for the silent-film legend, are through the dialog pieces in his speeches and in the sometimes volatile and always nuanced (in the over-the-top way)with his underlings. Other bits just come from the way Chaplin's facial expressions go here to there- though his physical way of comedy isn't as strong as the other character he plays (aside from the appropriately iconic globe-tossing symbolism).In the other story we get a revamped Tramp- this time in the form of a Jewish barber- who in the midst of helping out a girl Hannah gets into some trouble with the overbearing troops from Hynkel's army. He also sees around him the effects from this dictatorship, of the Jews being sent to the gas chamber, but is spared and even acts as a sign of hope thanks to an old friend in Schultz. This all leads to a kind of case of mistaken identity, leading up to a 'big' speech. Big maybe being too broad a word to describe it- it's an outpouring of the highest kind that is able to work in such a satire, where all the points are spoken very clearly and to the point of being almost too simple. But the truth behind it undercuts the rest of the comedy in the film, which marks it as being memorable. And for myself as a viewer I remember both sides well. I still have fresh, admiring images in my head of Chaplin's barber running around being chased by the soldiers in the ghetto, how effortlessly a lot of this starts to seem when the craft turns to a beautiful transparency. There are certain parts of Chaplin's script, the final long talk aside, that ring out nicely.One of the best films of the early 1940's, this is also one of- if not the- classic of Chaplin's sound years, where a time in history that needed such a talent as his came through with a precise account of pathos, wit and silliness that all makes his films unique.",

            "content": "For a lesser actor, the scariest fate is to be typecast. Even so, no actor so allowed himself to be typecast as Charles Chaplin. But this is the inimitable Charlie Chaplin; he did it to himself, and he endured the consequences -- artistic success that no other actor could ever achieve. The great Charlie did well.Charles Chaplin succeeds as nobody else in the famous dual role as the Tramp, essentially the same character as he had been for over 25 years, and as \"Adenoid Hynkel\", also known as \"Der Phooey\" (spoof of Hitler's popular title \"Der Fuhrer\", undeniably a parody of Adolf Hitler, the evil dictator of \"Ptomania\", undoubtedly a spoof of (nazi) Germany (get it -- \"ptomaine\" is a very bad germ) and its dictator.The classic Tramp of the pioneer days of motion pictures is this time a Jewish barber, a victim of the absurd persecution of an innocent people -- and he also looks like the hollow, silly \"Adenoid Hynkel\". As with other movies featuring the Tramp, one laughs with him as he endures the absurd situations of helpless humanity. We laugh at the Great Dictator for the harshness of his voice (Chaplin did not have an attractive voice), his rhetoric, his vanity, and his hypocrisy. The Tramp character is the common man in a nearly-hopeless situation; Adenoid Hynkel is a base man risen to power that he can never use except for the basest and most selfish, cruel purposes. The characters in their unique split roles meet in the most remarkable manner at the end of the movie, and to say more about that juxtaposition of characters is to introduce a spoiler. If you have never seen this movie, then see it at the first opportunity. The superb physical comedy from the silent era survives without deterioration both as the Tramp and as the Great Dictator -- remarkable for his age (51) at the time, and for the fact that Chaplin did not age gracefully even if he lived into his late eighties. As usual Chaplin uses few words, illustrating his true ties to the silent era. For good reason Chaplin was slow to make a full adoption of his own voice in cinema -- but in its harshness it well fits the vile Adenoid Hynkel, a man who like his obvious model wins the predictable adulation of adoring crowds who have surrendered their freedom. We laugh AT Adenoid Hynkel, a man who wistfully tosses a globe about disrespectfully, only to cause it to pop like a balloon; we see a microphone recoil from the harshness of his banal speech as a cowardly audience can't. But the unnamed Jewish tramp (and the other Jews)... we recognize a character that we can't do without -- the person who, however rational, can treat tragedy and despair with humor and innocence.The movie ends with a cornball speech... corny now, but effective then, one in which the Tramp must pose as \"Der Phooey\" and use the misbegotten fame of a bad man -- against all of the evil that \"Der Phooey\" had wreaked upon the world. See it, by all means.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator (1940) **** (out of 4)A poor Jewish barber (Charles Chaplin) returns back to his hometown and quickly realizes that things aren't quite the same. Soldiers are ruling the streets and have a thing against Jews. At the same time, Tomania dictator Hynkel (Chaplin) decides to try and rule more of the world.THE GREAT DICTATOR would turn out to be Chaplin's first all talking picture and that by itself makes this rather historically important. With that said, while the film was a hit when it was released, the writer-director would find himself getting some rather heated attention and as time went on the film grew even more controversial. Chaplin would say he wouldn't have made the picture like he did had he known what actual horrors were going on in the world and there's no doubt that this film didn't exactly help his career.With that said, while it's not quite in the same league as CITY LIGHTS or MODERN TIMES, I do think the picture is a great one and one that deserves a lot more credit than it usually gets. There are a lot of really great moments in this film and of course the one most people remember is the dictator playing with the world as he dance around hitting the ball. That is a classic scene but the opening sequence set during WWI is also a comic masterpiece as we get all sorts of wonderful gags and especially the moments in the plane.Some people feel that a satire of something like Hitler and what was going on in the world was a major no but I do think the film has its heart in the right place. Again, perhaps Chaplin wouldn't have made the film had he known what was going on but it was too late once the movie was complete. As a comedy it works extremely well but I also thought it worked perfectly well as a drama and especially the relationship between the barber and a young woman (Paulette Goddard) that he falls for. Then there's the ending and the speech, which is another classic scene and shows that the film did have something to say even with the satire.The entire cast does a wonderful job and that includes the performances by the likes of Henry Daniell, Reginald Gardiner, Billy Gilbert and Goddard. Speaking of Goddard, she is a pure delight here and really does a terrific job with her role. As far as Chaplin goes, he really does a terrific job and delivers two of the greatest performances of his career. He's simply wonderful as the barber but there's no question that the real magic comes from him playing Hynkel, which of course was meant to be Hitler. The uncanny resemblance between the two is one thing but how Chaplin plays the role is just flawless.THE GREAT DICTATOR is a really strong and effective film and one that deserves more credit.",

            "content": "In his very first 'talkie' film. Charlie Chaplin proves as he did with his silent work to be impressive and inspirational in this now classic comedy/drama parodying the events leading up to and during the Second World War. The film opens with a Jewish soldier fighting on a fictionalised version of the Western Front for the nation of Tomania. After a near-fatal plane crash, the barber loses his memory and spends twenty years recovering in a hospital, during the same time his country and people are undergoing a radical revolution in the name of a new dictator named Adenoid Hynkel. Considered taboo and even downright dangerous at the time, The Great Dictator shows Chaplin to be more than just an outstanding actor and comedian, but a remorseful and courageous human being standing up to the real world troubles at the time and using his voice as a weapon. This is not just apparent in the beautiful and unifying speech that Chaplin delivers in the third act, but in his depiction of dictators and corrupt rulers. The film will have you laughing, cheering and even crying by the soul-touching finale, which challenges the very concept of human nature and the slow demise of mankind. While Chaplin may have come to pass, his legacy has well and truly lived on in what some consider his finest work. The only minor flaws are a lack of a real soundtrack that could have boosted the emotion, especially in the more serious scenes and some recurring gags that loose their comedic value by the end. 9/10",

            "content": "During the first world war, a clumsy Jewish soldier saves the life of career soldier Schultz but in the process loses his memory. Many years later he recovers and returns to his barber shop but the country of Tomania has changed from what he would remember (if he could remember it). The Dictator Adenoid Hynkel has laid claim to the country and is mercilessly persecuting the Jewish people. While Hynkel continues his political persecutions (which will next extend to brunettes), the unassuming barber finds himself in the midst of a form of resistance movement.Although it is considered a classic, I had never actually seen this film. At the end of a week where I had not only seen Little Man but also Norbit, I felt like perhaps my film-watching choices were not the best I could be making and decided to come to this next. I don't normally like to step into context when watching a film because my enjoyment of it (or not) is based on a modern viewing, but with Great Dictator it is important to note that Chaplin did not decide to do this film in the political climate that we now associate with Hitler and the Nazi party. At the time production started even Britain was not at war with Germany. So one does have to appreciate the career risks that Chaplin was taking by mocking an European leader so far from America. Of course time quickly showed his instincts to be correct and the film has lost none of its relevance.Being his first all sound talky, I was impressed by how Chaplin does so well with the comedy from the dialogue as well as the physical side. The film is very funny although it should be noted that those expecting the quick-fire of gags associated with his best silent shorts will be a touch disappointed because it is more of a \"proper\" film with a plot and events rather than just setups for jokes. In regards the plotting, it is not always as effective as it could have been but this is understandable with the nature of the film. This is best seen in the concluding speech, which in regards plotting is not a great ending but in terms of using the film to make an impassioned plea to the world, it is hard to criticise. As an actor Chaplin does surprisingly well as the barber, with a real sense of pain and longing in his turn. As Hynkel, he is funnier but not as smart in the style of comedy. The supporting cast is mostly very good. I was very impressed by Goddard's performance but of course my favourite one was Jack Oakie's wonderful Napaloni.The Great Dictator is undoubtedly a film of significance in regards cinema history but this does not mean that it is not interesting and funny at the same time. The nature of it means that it is neither as strong a story nor as funny as one would hope but as a total package it is hard to fault. There are funnier Chaplin films from earlier in his career but this is one definitely worth seeing.",

            "content": "Something about this picture made it somewhat uncomfortable to watch for me. I'm not sure if Adolph Hitler and Nazi atrocities are the kind of topics that lend well to humorous parody. In what I've read about Chaplin's coming to understand how evil the Nazis really were, it seems he might have second guessed himself as well.With that brief preface, I'll concede that Chaplin achieved a moderate success with this picture, seeing how he took a courageous stand prior to America's entry into World War II. The scene that's most memorable as I now reflect on the story was Adenoid Hynkel's juggling act with the planet hanging in the balance. An appropriate metaphor that went a long way to illustrate Hitler's desire to conquer the entire world. Along with the German language gibberish, Chaplin used clever puns to name his characters, Herr Garbitsch (garbage), General Schmeloffel (smell awful), and Napoloni (takeoff on Napoleon, though the character being parodied was Mussolini). There's also the inventive bit with the upside down plane and the reverse gravity effect that went with it, nice creative touch.Since I'm not a student of Chaplin's work, one of the things that surprised me here was the eclectic collection of actors who appeared in the picture. Contemporary Jack Oakie was entertaining as Napoloni, with enough energy to overpower Chaplin in most of the scenes in which they appeared together. Paulette Goddard transformed radiantly from the poor peasant girl following the barber's makeover. And could it be, aside from his appearances with the Bowery Boys, I don't think I've ever seen Bernard Gorcey in a single other picture, and playing a straight character at that. That was an unexpected treat.Of course, Chaplin's impassioned speech at the end of the story is what makes the two hour viewing time worth waiting for. It suddenly pivots the entire tone of the story on a dime, and was almost jolting to this viewer. Forceful and well reasoned, I found it surprising that elements of his speech aren't well known enough to be quoted present day. \"We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery\". With his closing remarks, Chaplin not only cemented his reputation as a great writer and director, but as a visionary who could move beyond the foibles of greedy men and nations to champion a cause for a world of freedom and democracy.",

He plays both the Jewish barber and the leader of the Germans. There are some very witty moments in this latter role, such as his dance with with an inflated globe, but too much verbal ethnic humor (of the low vaudeville type) is not alleviated by a sufficient amount of slapstick violence.  Also, the plot's fluctuations between the two characters' stories becomes disconcerting and makes the film unfocused.  Goddard makes an unconvincing impoverished Jewess; she is a talented actress but she's wasted here as the object of mostly idealized romanticism.  Chaplin's sincerity goes way past the breaking point of credulity in his final, ludicrously optimistic speech (yes, this one would put even Spencer Tracy to shame!).  This scene, which is played straight and has no humor whatsoever, ends the film on a sour, unconvincing note and does much to unhinge any satire that preceded it.An interesting failure at best.",

A suffering Nation transformed into a War Machine through pomp and circumstance. The Film and its Director held little back as it made an attempt at shedding some light on the absurdities yet to be unveiled.This is a Masterpiece, high Art in its relevance and in hindsight a predetermined cry-out for sanity in what was becoming a completely unhinged and insane World. There are many laughs here as well as intellectual insights and it is all so well produced and perceived that it remains today a testament to Humanity's struggle to stay relatively Human in inhuman situations.There is hardly a false note here and this can be regarded as one of the most poignant views and commentaries on the forces of Evil ever seen through the lens of Motion Picture prognostications and empathetic concerns.

Excellent support from Jack Oakie, Henry Daniell, Reginald Gardiner, and many more. It's a funny movie but not a knee-slapper. The most powerful parts of the film, the parts that I think have made it such a classic, are the more serious parts. The famous speech scene near the end is something everyone should see.

When I look at comedy's today I see good work and overall a good comedy. But it will never be like Charles Chaplin the great dictator. This movie mixers comedy and drama together so perfectly nothing can top it. The globe scene, the train scene and the speech at the end which made me cry because how true it is and how much we need it to make the world a better place. Overall the great dictator is outstanding movie with a great story and a brilliant speech. Quote from Dictator of Tomania: \"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

            "content": "As a die-hard fan of Charles Chaplin, my primary devotions are to his best material, which for me are all the silent films. I believe that he himself had a clear intuition that something would dissipate were he to switch to talking films. This is not to say that he did not produce wonderful \"talkie\" films. He did and The Great Dictator (TGD) is one of his best. Perhaps his greatest film, \"Modern Times\" has a bit of speaking in it and of course his wonderful impromptu song filled with gibberish words. We don't think of this as a \"talking\" film in the same way that TGD is; this was his first all talking film. I still prefer the silent films for several reasons. His true genius lay in suggestions brought about ONLY by facial expression. He had no peer who could evoke what his face could; remember that Keaton was known as 'stone face' and never, ever broke his facial expression, no matter what. Chaplin's silent evocations also relied on incredible physical agility and body humor that is still hilarious today.TGD still uses quite a bit of physical humor and it all works well. TGD is a scathing indictment of fascism in Europe, ending as it does with a phenomenal and hair raising speech, spoken out of character, where Chaplin addresses himself to all of humanity. It is also a sad, shocking and disturbing drama filled with bits of humor that are as dark as Chaplin knew how to express.Consider his physical humor for a moment. In the early part of the film when the plane crashes, Chaplin emerges from complete submersion in a huge pile of wet mud. His entire head is enveloped in mud as he pops his eyes open - I really don't know how he did that without blinding himself. The scene is incredible and although it lasts for a few moments, it shows to what extremes he was willing to go to produce a laugh. Consider the scene in the ghetto where his lady friend, in trying to help him, accidentally bops him quite hard on the head with a frying pan.In his depiction of the Hitler-like leader, Hinckle, there is one scene that must go down as one of the most breathtaking and marvelous in all movie history. It comes when he is alone in his room and plays with a huge inflatable globe of the world, bouncing it up and down, catching it and bouncing it sometimes off his rear end. The symmetry of his movements as lithe as anything a top ballet dancer could have done. The scene lingers in the mind, having deeper meaning than the surface action. Chaplin was blessed with a deep insight into people and this film shows him at his razor sharpest.Another reason this film is so important: in a time when almost all of the world had turned it's back on the racial genocide that Nazi Germany was perpetrating on Europe's Jews, Chaplin knew of it and was convinced that something brave must be said about it. Where almost no one, certainly in Hollywood, thought it important to say that the Jews were getting massacred, Chaplin brought the Jewish focus front and center and miraculously, in a funny sort of way. Even though the rest of the world was to discover after the war that the destruction of Jews was far more sinister and horrific than this film implies, at least Chaplin stood up and shouted about it.This is a brave, moving, brilliant, scathing, insightful, compassionate and raucous movie. Chaplin's portrayal of Hinckle, where he moves in and out of a Germanic accent, shows that a great silent film actor could move quite successfully into the talking movies. His Hitlerian rants were often so similar to Hitler's own that it was amazing to see that Chaplin could be vocal mimic as well. A complex film that holds up very well. A must see for all Chaplin fans.",

            "content": "The film, The Great Dictator is one that permits Chaplin to quote (some might say misquote) Garbo's famous line; \"I want to be alone\" from the film, Grand Hotel (1932), when his character is conceiving his world domination, just prior to dancing with an inflatable globe, symbolic of fallible power, in a vulnerable world at the time. In this way, Chaplin is paying homage to Garbo in an ironic sense. As technological advances permitted 'cinematic sound' which was promoted via Garbo for the advertisement of Anna Christie (1930) with the line: \"Garbo Talks\", so in The Great Dictator, Chaplin talks. But Chaplin utilises the medium of sound for his own political bias. It is widely believed that Chaplin's political bias as being sympathetic to communism. (But as Chaplin admitted himself he was somewhat naive of the unknown as illustrated via his satirising of antisemitism in The Great Dictator). This has been seriously misconceived and confused with Chaplin's real political bias which was his concerns with capitalism in its 'free market' model. The pitfalls, (i.e. its precarious nature) of the free market model of capitalism, lacking in social welfare provisions emerging from 19th Century industrialism culminated in illiberal ideals. Illiberal idealism is the core tenant of fascist ideology as defined by Sicillian born philosopher Giovanni Gentile (May 30, 1875 - April 15, 1944) as a means to legitimate the Italian model of fascism for dictator Benito Mussolini, (July 29, 1883 \u0096 April 28, 1945) . However, Illiberal ideals as Chaplin suggests in The Great Dictator become a destructive force on freedom, as illustrated in both fascism and Communism.It is documented that Hitler watched The Great Dictator, which it is rumoured touched his alleged sense of humour. Maybe Hitler being the megalomaniac he was misunderstood the film as a homage to himself, and an inspiration to his cause.The opening set of the film exhibit Chaplin's genius as he gives a histrionic and gradual build up to an anti-climatic scene of a lapsed bomb. Likewise his genius is further illustrated this time in his comedic dexterity and timing in the aspects of the film which give way to the 'silent' genre. This said, the overall, general genius of Sir Charles Chaplin is the way he made tragedy comedic in his own unique way, which induce the viewer to look at their own conscience as witnessed via the antisemitic scenes in the The Great Dictator.The supporting cast are excellent. This is due to Chaplin's perfectionism as a director. Such perfectionism contributed to Paulette Goddard's great acting ability as illustrated in The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946).In conclusion this film is a sombre caveat of the dangers the instability a free market economy lacking in social welfare provisions has for potential and ultimate consequences of society.",

I had to pinch myself to make sure that yes, a film like The Great Dictator was made in 1940 when World was going through one of the toughest period in the history of humanity contretemps. World War II abolished the lives of many innocent people and the Dictator who made it happen didn't even care about it for once. Charlie Chaplin was making popular Comedy film in Silent mode then but then he took the right opportunity to make his first true sound film to break the silence on anti-semitism, fascism and Dictatorship. The film has a very interesting plot surrounding World War II affected zones and of course with fictional changes but one can clearly guess what it is and whom it is all about. Hitler was raging against Jewish community and at the same time legend Chaplin made this film which seems Unbelievable! Just like his other his films he added his trademark comedy and funny moments to keep people entertained for 2 hours but then in last 5 Minutes he went berserk over an Important social message on humanity, equality and peace. That's what the world needed at that time. The trick of exchanging characters of The Dictator and a Jewish Victim (both played by Charlie Chaplin) was so clever and effective. Many scenes and dialogues by supporting characters on the inequitableness and conformity of humans were enough to give Goosebumps. Acting by Charlie Chaplin was outstanding and probably one of his career's best. Rest of the cast was fantastic too. Screenplay, cinematography, Background Score were Good enough and suitable. Overall, The Great Dictator is truly by all 'A Great Film' and indeed The Most Socially Important and Effective film of Charlie Chaplin's incredible filmography. A MASTERPIECE !RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",

We want to live by one other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to despise and hate one another; In this world, there is room for everyone - The Good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful. \nBut we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned Men's souls, has barricaded the world with hatred, has goose-stepped the world into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed but have shut ourselves in, machinery that gives abundance has left us in want, our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind, we think too much and feel too little. \nMore than machinery, we need humanity, more than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness; without these qualities life would be violent and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together, the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.\nTo Those who can hear me I say, \"Do not despair\". The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die. The Power they took from the people shall return to the people and so long as Men die, Liberty shall never perish.\nSoldiers, don't give yourselves in to brutes. Men who despise you, enslave you, regiment your lives - tell you what to do, what to think, what to feel; who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you like cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machine, you are not cattle, you are Men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts, you don't hate - only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers, don't fight for slavery. Fight for Liberty.

In You, you the people have the power - the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of Democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite, let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future of old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie, they do not fulfill their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise, to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, Let Us All Unite!\"I am absolutely certain when I say that is the greatest work of art that was produced in the 1940s and in Chaplin's lifetime. In levels of art and accuracy, it is on par with Modern Times if not even better and in terms narrative of the story, only Limelight was more highlighted perhaps of because how close these topics were close to the great man's heart.\nI have read through the reviews and most of the top ones giving it a 10 outta 10 are absolutely right in their statements. I can't possibly add anything better except that it is most non-funny work of comedy Chaplin ever wrote for the screen and by that I mean no insult or disrespect. The sense of drama and serene actuality was a necessity to tell such a story of grave depths, even though it is no way close to the actual persecution innocent people underwent through as was revealed in Victor Frankle's Man's Search for Meaning and other contemporary works of art that dealt in this particular situation. \nYou will miss something in your life should you choose not to watch this.",

He also plays a Jewish barber just recovered from twenty years of amnesia. He returns to his little barber shop in the ghetto, not knowing that his Doppelganger has taken over the country and is persecuting the Jews. He develops an interest in the spunky and very pretty young Paulette Goddard. She's pretty highly evolved, compared to the other mousy residents. She wants everyone to stand up and fight against the Storm Troopers, even if their shops and fruit stands are destroyed. \"What good is money?\" she shouts. Good question. When Paulette Goddard died about fifteen years ago she left the mass of her estate to New York University.I wish I could endorse this comic sermon without qualification but I can't. It's not as funny as it should be. There's little in the way of Chaplin's usual superb choreography. There's the scene in which he plays with a light-as-air balloon of the globe, but it doesn't compare to, say, the scene in the tilting cabin in \"The Gold Rush.\" And there's a scene in which he shaves a customer, suiting the actions of the razor to the tune of one of the Hungarian Dances. Maybe that's where they got the idea for the Tom and Jerry cartoons that used the same gag.Chaplin here deals with a genuine catastrophe -- the genocidal programs of the Nazis -- but doesn't slather the message with easy sentiment, thank God. Of course, in 1940, the world already knew of concentration camps but few had a very clear idea of the magnitude of the horrors. The German occupation of Poland was also satirized, in a far more sophisticated way, in Ernst Lubitsch's \"To Be Or Not To Be.\" Chaplin's movie is, in a way, more courageous in bringing the problems of the Jews to center stage, not just the Poles. That candor probably didn't help him when he was kicked out of the US for \"communist\" leanings.I'm trying to avoid the use of the term \"old fashioned\" but it's difficult. Paulette Goddard's downtrodden status is signaled by her wearing of nice clean rags and a simple, and rather becoming, smudge on one cheek. Make up in general is overdone. It's as if the audience were assumed to be locked into 1915, when such excesses were called for. Chaplin probably should have quit after \"Modern Times.\" His voice isn't really suited to sound movies and by this time, maybe, his inventiveness was flagging. How much brilliant stuff can one man put on the screen over the course of twenty-five years? This one is for kids, the kind who like The Three Stooges, but sadly the kids won't get many of the jokes.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator (1940) was written, directed, and produced by Charlie Chaplin, and made history as his first ever talking picture. The film's cinematography was done by Karl Struss and Roland Totheroh, was edited by Willard Nico and Harold Rice, and was scored by Chaplin and Meredith Willson. The Great Dictator stars Chaplin in the dual leading roles of Adenoid Hynkel and The Jewish Barber. The cast also includes Paulette Goddard, who was married to Chaplin at the time, and Jack Oakie. The film received numerous accolades and award nominations, including the Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, with Chaplin also receiving an Academy Award nomination for best actor in a leading role and best original screenplay. Additionally, Jack Oakie was nominated for best actor in a supporting role, and Meredith Wilson was nominated for best original score.The history behind the conception and production of The Great Dictator is fascinating. Charlie Chaplin's prior filmography had found success with German audiences, which was shown firsthand when Chaplin visited Berlin in 1931 while touring with his film City Lights, and he was greeted by huge enthusiastic crowds. This positive reception came at the dismay and scorn of the Nazi regime, who loathed Chaplin for the content of his filmmaking, and he became a frequent target of their vitriolic propaganda. In relation to social and political change, it is difficult to overstate The Great Dictator's relevance. The United States did not enter WWII until 1941, a year after the film was released, so producing this film was incredibly risky. Chaplin was advised by several studios not to make the film, and was warned that the film wouldn't be allowed to be shown in many countries, including Britain and possibly even in the U. S. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt learned of this news, he actually sent his right hand man, Harry Hopkins, to encourage Chaplin to still make the film. Chaplin ended up financing the entire film himself, and it was his biggest ever box office hit.One aspect of The Great Dictator that is especially noteworthy is the way in which Chaplin deliberately leaned into the similarities that he and others had noticed between himself and Adolph Hitler in order to further push his satirical portrayal. Chaplin and Hitler shared a similar physical stature and likeness, and were born only four days apart. Additionally, Chaplin studied films by German director and propagandist Leni Riefenstahl to help him more closely match Hitler's wild gesticulations and mannerisms. In terms of cinematic significance, the fact that The Great Dictator was Chaplin's first talkie was hugely important. Because of this, he was able to blend his superb physical comedy with a full sound production, heightening the effect of his actions and movements. In comparison to another film in this module, Do The Right Thing, The Great Dictator relies more heavily on this type of physicality to inject humor into the storyline.I truly enjoyed The Great Dictator, and laughed much more than I anticipated. The famous globe dancing scene was one of the funniest film moments I've seen in a long while, and I was also struck by the symbolism of that scene. Additionally, the ending five minute speech was profoundly impactful, and the fact that Chaplin performed it on public radio speaks to its importance. I would definitely recommend The Great Dictator, especially due to its historical significance.",

            "content": "Gambling with the set-in-stone Chaplin character developed over decades was daring, and it could backfire any time. The film's climactic sermon, for instance, spills over of schmaltz. When a dictator's imposter nervously approaches the loudspeakers, then starts to talk, Chaplin himself is inexplicably bootlegged into the story. He condemns repression and eulogizing social equality, but it collapses the farce and ends the movie as a lecture, followed by swelling music. It's terminal when Chaplin suddenly retunes the movie's strings, which might've been his purpose for making it.Chaplin speaks straight at us, in his own voice. No comic relief. Even as Chaplin acknowledges and utilizes sound's potential here, he reminds us of the more real assets of silence. For instance, Dictator Hynkel spurts a lengthy sentence to his typist, who hits a couple of letters. He bids a split-second expletive, and she types for numerous lines, tolling the carriage return. He's speaking pseudo-German, basically discontinuous coughs and stammers, with intermittent words like \"cheese 'n' crackers\" and \"Katzenjammer kids.\" When a pen won't abandon its holder, in exasperation it's just repetitive, abusive English. Sound mostly is just ineffective rage.There are other German terms that reappear among the claptrap\u0085like Juden. He's particularly keen on shouting these words, his face cramming the screen like Melanie Laurent's vengeful big-screen visage in Inglourious Basterds. Hynkel doesn't like brunettes either, but his counselor proposes pursuing Jews first. Then he can handle the brunettes and govern an entirely blonde world, himself the sole dark-haired individual around. He's so delighted by this, he waltzes with a bouncing globe to Wagner's strings. It's pure Chaplin, simultaneously fluid and silly. The nonchalant intermingling of terror and absurdity here and elsewhere is disturbing. It's not always hilarious and wasn't meant to be, but the celebrated gags and wealth of comic pantomime here are all indelible, a translation of the world into burlesque.Watching Chaplin's simulations of losing physical control, he appears to be truly collapsing into inopportune objects and people, but with accomplished, athletic poise. But it's not spoof or derogatory commentary. It's also not just the idea that totalitarianism can be deposed with hilarity. It's also the idea that anyone can be a fool. And the disconcerting result of Chaplin's becoming Hynkel is that he gives him some of his own charm. Hynkel doesn't actually dictate so much as take counsel, fantasize, love himself, throw tantrums. He's too timid and persistently uncomfortable around the sunny, unsubtle Napaloni.Chaplin relegates world history to a string of acts and caricatures sponged from his own work. The Gestapo are adaptations of the big bully who'd been chasing his Tramp since his dawn period. The Jews communally befit a Tramp variation, tender, crafty and reasonable in a mad world. Paulette Goddard reprises her enchanting urchin, but she's not so innocent here, with an enormous amount of rugged sex appeal. It's not much of a riposte to Nazism's upsurge. But Chaplin was up to something else. Ultimately, the Nazis aren't condensed into comic-strip clowns, but elevated to a much broader human madness.The movie's charm rests on the link Chaplin draws between the little guy and the oppressor. The brutes chasing Chaplin as prey are under the auspices of Chaplin the predator. He's his own tormenter and the voice of defiance against his own madness. The casting keeps tying what its plot undoes. The barber momentarily wielding a razor over someone's throat seems more threatening than Hynkel ever does. Hynkel in his demure moments essentially acts like the barber. In the climactic sermon, Chaplin begins to tirade like Hynkel. Wrath with good intentions is still wrath. He attacks the dictator in everybody, and his equating of oppressor and oppressed not only suggests that the clown could've been the evildoer but that even the good and the victimized, characterized by the world's favorite clown, aren't to be entrusted with such power. Chaplin's best extra hint, having made his authoritarian silly, is to evoke how much destruction even silly folk can cause.",

Both roles give him an opportunity to display the physical comedy which he was already so famous for. He also gets a lot of laughs by ranting in pseudo-German. The rest of the cast also do well in their roles, particularly the actor who played Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Mussolini). There was also some great cinematography and set design. The only minor thing I felt was wrong was the opening sequence, which I felt dragged on a little too long. Still, it was a nice throwback to Chaplin's previous silent movies and had some nice sight gags (really, there was quite a number of hilarious sight gags throughout).

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's famously prescient tear-down of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, filmed at the very outset of the second world war (England actually vowed to ban the film due to an early policy of Nazi appeasement, though their attitude flipped before opening day) and released before anyone really understood the height of the German atrocities. Chaplin himself would later express a certain degree of remorse, admitting he never would've made the picture if he'd known just how far the Nazis had gone.It's an important film, certainly an emphatically heartfelt one, and an astoundingly timely message, but it's also plagued with minor quibbles. A handful of conceptually proficient cornerstone scenes, genuine big-screen magic, are good enough to enhance the whole act. Chaplin's mesmerizing bubble dance with an inflatable globe, as a shining example. A cheeky shave-and-a-haircut routine, expertly timed to match the Brahms playing on a grainy box radio. His passionate, enduring speech at the film's climax, eyes locked upon the camera, which still rings, honest and true, in today's combative social climate.At the best of times it's a brilliant example of all Chaplin could offer as an entertainer; a perfect mix of silent film pantomime, well-timed musical accompaniment and passionate, assertive rhetoric. At other points, he clearly struggles with the urge to do what he's always done. To cast aside modern soundtrack demands and merely focus on telling the story through sheer physical poetry. Apart from those few radiant examples, his instinct doesn't come as naturally as it once did. Not every scene works. The plot jerks along in stops and starts. As the film's running time grows cumbersome, we miss essential scraps of story, cutting straight to the finish before each piece is properly aligned. Though Chaplin's noble Jewish barber ultimately gets his moment in the sun, his alternate role as the scheming Hitler-lite despot is hardly served a well-deserved comeuppance.The Great Dictator, essentially Chaplin's last bow as an international icon, gives us much to appreciate, and much to ponder, but a wobbly structure and off-kilter rhythm leaves a lot of its seething, righteous cinematic power unrealized.",

The music is lifting, adequate, the acting perfect as the actors barely needed to act -it seemed so real- ; all that topped with Chaplin's personal touch of satiric comedy, artistic intelligence, and melancholic nature.\nThat movie made Charlie Chaplin my idol.

            "review_title": "The Tramp Comes of Age: Chaplin's Crowning Masterpiece of Comedy and Political Satire",
            "content": "Most of Chaplin's silent film efforts were whimsical slap-stick comedies with slight undertones of social satire: booting the rear of an immigrant official, escaping the clutches of fool-hardy police, or being trapped inside a mechanized factory. The Tramp, the first iconic figure of the new medium of film/cinema, was the nameless but lovable immigrant, not knowing quite where he fit in. Always on the periphery of the establishment but ultimately of a kindly and innocent nature, the Tramp was endeared by audiences across America and Europe. For those coming to Ellis Island for the first time to forge new lives in a America, Chaplin's comedy probably reflected their grappling with this alien world. But on the surface, the main point was always entertainment, mostly comedic and occasionally sentimental but never biting. And then, Chaplin fused both comedy and political/social commentary into a film which really does make quite a political point.The Great Dictator is one of the best mingling of social satire and comedy, a brilliant and effective combination of entertainment and commentary to ridicule fascism which had taken over Germany and Italy. The Tramp or nameless barber is a private at the very end of World War I fighting for the fictional country of Tomainia. He along with a pilot escapes from the front lines, crashing in a plane, luckily just in time for the Armistice. But the Tramp is hospitalized for 20 years, and he suffers memory loss, and doesn't know the country is under new leadership.His country has put their faith in a new leader, Adenoid Hynkel, who looks one helluva lot like a cross between Adolph Hitler and Charlie Chaplin. In this country, Jews are being targeted. After leaving the hospital, the Tramp returns to his barber shop. He is immediately assaulted by policeman in helmets with armbands with crosses. A scuffle and chase ensues in typical Chaplin fashion, with lots of running around and a head being banged more than once, the service being provided by a woman in an upper window. As he navigates down the streets while evading authorities, he sees the word \"JEW\" written in bold letters on shops and windows.Eventually the film cuts to behind-the-scenes of Adenoid Hynkel, the new Great Leader of Tomainia. My favorite aspect of this film is the portrayal of the Leader/Dictator. He's pompous, arrogant, and vain, so exaggerated he would give Stalin and Hitler a run for their money, or would he? He has a military officer lick his envelope, and is simultaneously having his portrait painted and his bust sculpted. He ceases persecution of the Jews, not out of moral indignation, but he wants to borrow money from one of them! The Dictator then makes speeches on loud-speakers in a kind of gibberish which sounds German-like, with the words sour kraut repeated many times. In a couple of crazy scenes, the Dictator is shown bouncing around a large medicine ball which looks like the world. In another, he confronts another Dictator who looks like Mussolini, and they engage in a race to the top in barber chairs! Then the awful helmeted police are after the barber, presumably because he's Jewish. Through a crazy series of madcap adventures, not unlike many of his silent films, the Tramp, who looks like the Dictator, eventually is mistaken for him, and compelled to make a speech, one of the greatest in cinematic history.What the Nazis were doing in Germany and then in Europe was no joke, but Mel Brooks pointed out that the only way to deal with their hypocrisy, prejudice, and ultimate lunacy, is to laugh at them. And that's what Chaplin did many years before Brooks' \"The Producers\". But inter-spliced in Chaplin's comedy is a very caustic criticism of fascism. Of course, the reality of the Holocaust was not known to Chaplin at the time of production, and I don't believe he was making light of Nazi atrocity. At the same time, by pointing out the ridiculousness of fascist dictators, Chaplin was really harpooning those who put themselves above others as infallible and the ludicrous behavior which goes with it, usually blind adoration. Ultimately, the Dictator is just a Tramp.",

It has all: comedy, smart plot, a strong message to humanity, and a critic to the tyrants and those who opposed for liberty and democracy (here Adenoid Hynkel/Adolf Hitler and Benzino Napaloni/Benito Mussolini), during the II World War.The performances are wonderful. Notably Charlie Chaplin. What a memorable performance by the actor. That 'clumsy' aspect, typical of Charlie Chaplin, that he gives to his characters works so well, even in some serious scenes of this film, like the last speech, where the barber is confused as Hynkel, and is about to sit and falls. But more funny scenes are present, such as when the barber is on the plane upside down with Shultz and all the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. Those scenes are hilarious and so clever. Charlie Chaplin was really fantastic in this movie. Funny when it had to be and even when it didn't had to be. Amazing.The plot is very smart, funny and entertaining during the entire movie. Despite a lot of comedy, I think that the scene when the barber, confused as Hynkel, has to make a speech, he sends such a powerful and influent message to all humanity, and was really touching. But, despite that, the movie is hilarious and such an excellent critic to the tyrants of the II World War, making them look ridiculous, specially the scene when Hynkel receives Napaloni and during their meeting, he tries to work on his superiority to the part of Napaloni but fails and never achieves it, like the scene when they go to the barber shop together and they play around with the seats. That was hilarious. Very smart screenplay written by Charlie Chaplin.A wonderful soundtrack also, just for the information.Timeless masterpiece, with entertainment guaranteed, 'The Great Dictator', is without a doubt one of the most remarkable movies ever made in the cinema industry, and teaches us a lesson also. A movie for all different kinds of ages. 10/10.",

            "content": "The film starts with a long title sequence typical of early films. Charlie Chaplin is a bumbling, albeit somewhat effective, Jewish soldier in WW1. He's in an air crash and awakens after the war without his memory. His town has been turned into a ghetto and the the anti-Semite Hynkel has seized power. He tries to return to normal life, but of course can't, as the anti- Jewish laws are far too powerful. He and a friend from WW1, who is now a pariah, try to stop the evil Hynkel and his ally Napoloni. Towards the end, the Jewish barber/soldier is mistaken for Hynkel and delivers a speech of brotherly love that appears to stop the coming war.I now really know what a \"gag\" is after watching this. I had seen such things in \"Airplane\" but never known them by this name. As the barber tries to operate the AA gun, as he throws the grenade, and as he and Schulz are in the plane. It's really a collection of many funny sketches in the beginning. The airplane was particularly funny with the feigned exhaustion of Schulz. I couldn't stop laughing as Schulz tried to drink from the canteen. The scenes in the ghetto are often gnashing, because, as we know now, the situation was much darker. However, even giving attention to these is something many didn't do at the time, so it looks more artistic than calloused. This is still a pretty funny movie, although a modern movie would probably be quicker paced and have more recognizable actors. It has, after all, been about 74 years. It's still funny though - a big recommend.",

            "review_title": "\"Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental\"",
            "content": "\"Desperate times calls for desperate measures\" goes the saying, so it is fitting that the second world war and its concentration of some of the most inhumane atrocities in human history yielded one of cinema's most overt and audacious political satires as response. The roots of legendary comic mastermind Charlie Chaplin's decision to lampoon looming Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly stemmed from his outraged discovery that Hitler had imitated Chaplin's own 'Little Tramp' moustache for the sake of acquiring an iconic image, provoking Chaplin to ridicule Hitler's own image in the same way he felt his own had been defiled - a fascinating case of art imitating life imitating art. And one cannot overstate the role of Chaplin's The Great Dictator, raising awareness of the atrocities of Nazi Germany to largely unaware overseas audiences as courageously as it sends up the man figure-heading the conflict. Nonetheless, there remains an interesting process of collective cultural memory in which the quality of the actual piece is considered synonymous with its historical impact or relevance, and Chaplin's wartime satire is no exception. As such, while unquestionably still a very strong film in its own right, on contemporary examination, while The Great Dictator is unquestionably one of the most important films of all time, sadly it cannot also claim the title as one of the best.While Chaplin is notorious for obsessive perfectionism, one gets the sense that with The Great Dictator his mind was more occupied with its socio-political relevance than its construction as a film. Predicated on parallelling the lives of fanatical Hitler surrogate Adenoid Hynkel and the stand-in Tramp figure, a shell-shocked Jewish barber (both played by Chaplin), the intercutting between narrative strands feels awkward and uncomfortable, both requiring too much exposition to blend seamlessly together. Equally, the film on the whole feels unnecessarily drawn out, its two hour running time consistently lagging through overextended gags (as unforgettable as the two main comedic set pieces - Hynkel impishly playing with an inflated globe and the farcical battles for dominance between Hykel and Mussolini surrogate Nappolini - are, both run past the point of remaining truly funny) and frequent patches of 'dead time' which are neither comedic nor serve to further the plot (the extended WW1 opening sequence feels largely unnecessary). Similarly, banking the narrative on a highly contrived climax (the barber being mistaken for Hynkel) makes the entire film feel somewhat forced, also detracting from the enjoyment. However, the main concern is that the film, for lack of a better term, simply isn't that funny, with the general tone pitched uncertainly between pantomime silliness and sympathetic reverence and thus functioning as neither as enjoyable or proactively poignant as it could have been.Despite the film's essential function of raising audience awareness of the devastating cruelty inflicted by the Nazis, there remains the feel of Chaplin soft-pedalling the inhumanities depicted, whether for the sake of not overly upsetting audiences or due to legal concerns, but either way lessening the film's potential impact. Equally, Chaplin's infamous ending monologue remains a source of eternal contention, yet no matter how ham-handed a disruption of the narrative or excessively saccharine, there remains a tremendous power and resonance in his earnest words, serving as a fitting message for hope in the midst of a time sorely lacking in it. Finally, the film's hefty production values (despite the discordant presence of some obviously fake sets) ably elucidates the absurd opulence of the Nazi propaganda displays in a more tastefully subtle (and thereby more effective) fashion.As with the majority of Chaplin's films, the true joy is to be found in the performance(s) of the man himself. In fact, the real shame is that Chaplin resisted the temptation to drink in his own antics more, as his Hitler impersonation is a comedic triumph, each bout of mangled German profanities, enraged flared nostrils and over-important strutting a wonder to behold, and his Jewish barber nostalgically recalls the best of the Tramp (though both characters sharing Chaplin's never before heard reedy voice feels another piece of poor planning). It comes as somewhat of a shame that Chaplin generally pitches for the obvious humour, rather than allowing for more unorthodox moments to breathe life into the picture: one of the most hilarious points in the film is a throwaway moment when Hynkel, hurrying between appointments, stumbles and staggers across a sumptuously decorated hallway - an exquisite moment of slapstick belying the humanity beneath, and ultimately a more effective method of undermining Hitler's steely persona. Apart from the star's dual roles, the majority of the cast feel too sombre and straight faced to infuse much of interest into the film, though Paulette Goddard rekindles the feisty warmth and spunkiness she displayed in Modern Times and Jack Oakie appealingly tramples the scenery with a deliciously campy Mussolini impression.While more problematic as a film than its reputation suggests, Chaplin's The Great Dictator remains a timeless testament to the power and importance of satire and film's potential to function as a vehicle for urgent social commentary and information. Despite being one of the lesser Chaplin efforts as a film, its vibrant daring is one of a variety simply not attempted by contemporary cinema, making the film worth experiencing by itself.-8.5/10",

It's not a good thing when you sort of drift in and out of the film, suddenly realising that you weren't paying attention, and also realising that you didn't really miss anything. This almost always happened when the barber was on screen, rather than dictator Hynkel. I really didn't care for the melodramatic stuff, which is too much on the sappy side for my taste.The real joy of watching this movie comes from the crazed antics of Adenoid Hynkel. Things pick up pace every time he appears and Chaplin's satire take on Hitler is really good. In his scenes, the film lives up to its classic stature.The film feels very well made for its time, so I have no problem there either. The famous ending speech by Chaplin ruins a lot, though. It's all done with the best of intentions, but today it feels very naive and doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie.

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin was an actor and director who was known for his very unique style of slapstick and comedy in general. This was his first venture into all-talking, all-sound film, thirteen years after the end on the silent era. The result was one of the finest pieces of cinema in the last 70 years. First impressions are, for any veteran Chaplin fan, simply familiar territory. We see a hapless private during the war fail at the most basic tasks and be humiliated for it. Then we see a ludicrous bomb spin around the flour in circles after our supposed protagonist. Personally this form of comedy is not to my tastes yet Chaplin is one of few comedians able to make it work for me, leading more to my great respect for this filmmaker. This really sets the tone for the film of serious situations and events portrayed in a more accessible way for the audience. Considering the 1940 release this was very important in order to raise awareness of the war in Europe. And it is clear that this was one of Chaplin's goals as the conclusion to the film shows. Chaplin gives a typically on form performance filled with great timing and physicality that he became famous for. Hilarity ensues whenever he wants it to and this fact is why he is one of the greatest comic actors of all time. In many ways this is a one man show, not suggesting the supporting cast is in any way irrelevant or underwhelming. They are just great for Chaplin to bounce off. Yet combined with him leads to some brilliantly choreographed sequences. The sets are visually impressive when coupled with this choreography and the mise-en-scene overall has to be commended. Its comedic twist on authentic, what was current eastern European lifestyles and militaristic parodies of Nazi uniform and propaganda are ingenious. All this combined makes for a fantastically memorable film that has stood the test of time, yet it is considered one of the all-time greats. This is because of, what I consider to be the most potent, relevant and emotionally impactful speech in not only cinema history but in the last one hundred years. The raw, unrelenting passion Chaplin exudes during these defining moments are is nothing short of beautiful. What makes this so expressively vivid is how, as a modern audience member of the twenty first century, I can see how the same problems remain after all these years. Chaplin glimpsed a future without division, without hatred, anger, war and intolerance, a future we could so easily attain. Yet we are all human, something The Great Dictator shows will just lead to the same problems again and again as Chaplin's character fails again and again. Yet with the courage and hope he gains at the very end, the world changes. As The Great Dictator shows, without hope all is lost.",

I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical Chaplin slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber.

There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of \"Hynckel-ism\" to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.As good as Chaplin is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of \"Bacteria\" - \"Benzino Napaloni.\" Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of \"Osterlich\" had me in stitches.This was a very good movie, and well worth watching.",

            "content": "Being quite a fan of Charlie Chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was eager to see 'The Great Dictator' as I had been told this was, arguably, his best film. I was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, Chaplin-wise.The start is typical Chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, Chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.Historically, the film got a few things right as well. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at Hitler's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. The 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.",

I was however disappointed and the film was not as good as I remember it being. It however is still a classic and good film.I think that Charlie Chaplin was possibly the greatest slapstick comedian of all time. In some of his earlier pictures this is displayed more effectively than in The Great Dictator. The Gold Rush springs to mind, and Chaplin should perhaps be viewed in this picture if you want to see him at his absolute best.That's not to say there are not sublime moments in Great Dictator, the classic scene with the giant beach ball of the world being paticualy brilliant. I also really enjoy the opening sequence in the first world war. It is perhaps the finest part of the film, with a paticualy good scene being the flight in the aeroplane.I also think the satire and the obvious rubbishing of Nazi Germany are brilliant. It really shows how the Nazis were a ridiculous group of individuals. The fact that Hitler saw the film twice, is testament to Chaplins brilliance and magnetism on screen.You can tell that it is Chaplins first talkie. As he is clearly not totally comfortable with the concept of a film of this kind. Some of the strongest scenes are those which remain silent. Chaplins strengths were never in verbal comedy and it is unfortunate in some respects that the spirit of the times forced him to adopt it.Still it is a very good and very well made film. As I have said, not his greatest picture, but then perhaps his most important and influential. I think without it we certainly wouldn't have a lot of the satire which is around today. It is definitely a benchmark and the starting point of modern satire on the big screenI was originally going to score this an 8. However I think a 7 is more appropriate for what is a great, but somewhat flawed film.7/10",

            "content": "What makes this film great is the historical context in which is was made. Having been made early in the second world war, this film is a great spectacle of wartime propaganda and satire against Hitler. Unfortunately, as Charlie Chaplin's first talkie, his well-renowned comedic timing suffers in the film. Chaplin's signature comedic walking makes one appearance, and his signature suit makes about two. All in all, visual gags are only provided every 15 minutes or so. This is understandable, as he is mocking Hitler for half the film, and he's attempting to replace visual gags with something more appropriate for a talkie. His pseudo-German is hysterical, but he relies on it too heavily. English dialog is extremely dumbed down compared to the Marx Brothers' films of the same period, leaving political jargon that, rather than having satirical merit, tends to simply slow down the film. After an hour of bearing with this shortcoming, the film does pick up slightly, especially after a turning point in the film involving new diplomacy. We do get a nice idealistic speech at the end that reveals some of Chaplin's political views.As for the aggression against Jews in the film, one might expect Chaplin to turn the scenes into something similar to chase scenes from his silent films. Modern films, on the other hand, tend to develop the victims in the film well enough so we can feel some connection. In other words, I would expect to feel the need to either laugh or cry if Chaplin were to depict this kind of situation. Unfortunately scenes are more uncomfortable to watch than they are compelling.Perhaps this film is highly regarded for what it stands for, but as a fan of Chaplin's silent films, as well as a huge fan of comedic talkies from this era, I felt highly disappointed and nearly fell asleep watching the film.",

            "content": "Maybe this was *An Important Movie* and that's why people rank it so highly, but honestly it isn't very good. In hindsight it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos, so you can't fault him TOO much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnect remains.More disappointingly, the movie is just clunky; it's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era. The set pieces, those involving both the Jewish Barber and the Dictator, don't flow into each other; they just sit there like discrete lumps of storyline that progress in fits and starts, moving SOMEWHERE but never arriving at resolution. Some are funny, some less so.What charm the movie has is strictly in the person of Chaplin himself. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing, and there's no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch. But virtually everything he surrounded himself with was ANNOYING. Hannah was TOO DAMN American. The Storm Troopers were TOO DAMN American.Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I don't know what purpose was served by having Garbage be the source of evil behind the throne. It almost seems like the film is saying that, if it weren't for malign influences like Garbage, Hynckle wouldn't have been that bad a guy.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin was still making silent films as late as 1936 because he began his career as a silent filmmaker and therefore that is where most of his talent seemed to lie. His tramp remains one of the most recognizable figures in cinematic history even almost 100 years after his introduction, but Chaplin knew at the time that it would probably be fatal to the character and possibly to his career if he were to give the tramp a voice. People just wouldn't be able to accept it, or at least it would just not sound right. However, in The Great Dictator, he seems to pull off this seemingly impossible feat very successfully. Sure, it's true that he wasn't exactly the tramp in The Great Dictator, but the costume and the behavior was similar enough for them to be considered the same character. In this film, the tramp is a Jewish barber who lost his memory during battle in World War I, and therefore doesn't understand what's happening when he is later discriminated against by the Nazis. He later becomes confused with Hynkel, the Nazi leader who looks exactly like him. This misidentification does not happen until pretty late in the film, so it is the events that lead up to it that make up most of the comedy here.It's pretty obvious that Hynkel is a thinly disguised parody of Adolf Hitler, which is fitting because Hitler copied the tramp's mustache as his own. Chaplin was always very sympathetic to the poor and underprivileged in his films, and he took the oppression of the Nazis as another chance to do that. He makes a hilarious mockery of Hitler while preserving just the right amount of respectability and authority in his character so that he remains credible. Hynkel is clearly a bumbler in the film, and it's great to see that Chaplin had the nerve to give Hitler a good slap back in 1940.\nThe Great Dictator has been criticized for the fairly extensive speech that ends the film, if only because it is so uncharacteristic of a Chaplin film, but that is unquestionably one of the most powerful scenes in the film. Chaplin spends the entire two hours making you laugh at the tragedy that is going on in Europe at the time, but at the end he gets serious and really makes sure that his message is felt powerfully. As was the case almost 50 years later in Life Is Beautiful, a story about the Nazi Holocaust is told in an entertaining and amusing way, but the powerful message does not lose any of its effectiveness because of that. Chaplin made dozens of hilarious films about uncomfortable subjects and topics, and The Great Dictator remains one of the best and most memorable, as well as one of the most important.",

The man was a genius of his own craft, and besides being a film-maker/story writer and obviously very good actor/entertainer of many fields/music composer... as a mere comic, just as a mere comic he could be hilarious in many different ways: through his nervy mimics and tricks and facial/whole body gymnastics, his interaction with surrounding props, situational comedy, coming up with ridiculous visual ideas for a scene, ridiculous concepts for a character's name or attributes, with his own voice... he was the complete entertainer/performer, and this being said not nearly in the cold academic,'accomplished artist' sort of way, but truly a creator of on-screen magic, provoker of visceral and sincere laughter, and a man whose greatest quality were in fact none of these things, but the weight of his heart and the great warmth of his humanity. All of this finds truth and application in this film in particular as he's in full-blown Chaplin mode and displays his full effect here. The famous speech this film is notorious for deserves recognition as it is in essence good while of course utopic, and although it seems the film was made for that scene they did a good job really crafting a good motion picture in itself, as a whole. Structurally the film isn't perfect, it's very good for the first 3/4s but then perhaps slows down in pace for a little while towards the end before lifting off again with that final speech. All in all, it's a great comedy. You'll find at least something funny somewhere in it, and as a film it's an entertaining, well made bit of cinema.",

Basically it is the last days of the First World War, and military pilot Schultz (Reginald Gardiner) has his life saved by a clumsy soldier (Chaplin, also directing), who crashing the plane loses his memory, and goes back to his job as a Jewish Barber. In Tomania meanwhile, dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin), who unintentionally looks very similar to the barber, is gripping the country. He is discriminating the Jewish people, but the barber's territory is untouched when Schultz recognises the man who saved him, and Hynkel needs someone to take the blame for when his plans go downhill. Schultz is arrested for being a friend to the Jews, where they are all placed into Concentration Camps, and Hynkel's next plan is to march his army into Osterlich to show up Napaloni - Dictator of Bacteria (Oscar nominated Jack Oakie). Schultz and the also captured barber manage to escape the camp in disguises, and when Hynkel is mixed up for the barber while fishing, the barber, posing as Hynkel, gets his once in a lifetime chance to end the tyranny with all of Osterlich and Tomania listening. Also starring Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, Billy Gilbert as Herring, Grace Hayle as Madame Napaloni and Carter DeHaven as Bacterian Ambassador. The best moments of the film for me are Hynkel's hand being raised to silence to crowd immediately, and of course the ballet like dancing with the balloon globe of the world, bouncing on his hands and bum. The critics are entitled to their opinion, but I personally don't think it's quite worthy of five stars, but from what I id laugh at, it is certainly a good first sound picture from Chaplin, and an amusing wartime satire comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Music for Meredith Willson and Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Chaplin.

He mocks war and extermination in order to become a messenger of peace (his final speech is one of the best monologues I've ever heard), and he doesn't hesitate to achieve that through a satire on WWII Germany and Adolf Hitler.The movie's two protagonists are both played by Chaplin himself: one is a Jewish barber recovering from amnesia after a war accident who falls in love with Hannah (Paulette Godard), a girl who lives in the ghetto; the other one, who looks just like the barber, is dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who's planning to invade a couple of countries and overshadow \"colleague\" Napaloni (aka Mussolini) as well as exterminate the Jewish minority. Expect trouble, misunderstandings and lots of laughs...This film is perhaps the best satire ever made, as Chaplin manages to entertain while still blaming the horrors committed by the Nazis, and he perfectly embodies both the romantic naive barber, who has one of the funniest lines in the movie (\"Strange.And I thought you were an Aryan.\" \"No, I'm a vegetarian.\"), and the megalomaniac, ego-driven, constantly shouting Hynkel (his improvised speeches in fake German are hilarious), delivering a movie that makes people laugh and also think.

            "content": "What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? Fictional dictator Adenoid Hynkel tries to expand his empire while a poor Jewish barber tries to avoid persecution from Hynkel's regime. We start the top 10 countdown with one of the eldest of the collection of all-time greats, a later day work of a director we all know and love more often than not for his charismatic and vaudeville performances on the screen rather than his blueprinting off it. Along with all great directors throughout history, Chaplin's greatest work is disputed to a short fallen conclusion. Notable for his consistent recurrence of the themes of strife of the downtrodden and 'good triumphs over evil' fables, The Great Dictator is, at face value, no exception. But the film's rich tapestry holds so much more to it than that, elevating it to a stance of assuming easily the role of not only Chaplin's greatest but one of history's greatest. One has to admire the bravery of Chaplin to produce such a touching, topical and quite frankly worldly historic piece of propaganda entertainment in 1940 for his loyal subjects: the distressed, the downtrodden and fed up allied population. It's piece of work that, as it rumbles into life, seems to be a misfit and muddled fledgling of a picture, soon turns into the greatest comedy ever made. Yet, astonishingly, after it assumes this role, it proves ever more versatile to the dumbfounded and subdued audience, showing a climactic bout of emotional power and vigour in the form of Chaplin's Dictator's famous dictatorial speech. The skill to represent both the weak and the powerful with his interchangeable portrayal of two characters, who take turns in being the mature and immature of the pair, ending on the prior mentioned sublime and bittersweet monologue of conflicting internal ideals of the satirised Hitler as a largely solo effort, just goes to show the untouchable echelons of what performance and direction working in harmony in the right place at the right time can be like. The Great Dictator is often said to be a weaker film amongst its competitors of the 1940s and 1930s, but cometh the hour of darkness: cometh the document of courage and faith with both humanist and more serious intent.",

Its historical value is impressive if we think it was shot right before World War II, at a time there was not nearly as much information on Hitler and his regime as we have now.For the first time, the usual visual comedy routines are relegated to a marginal role, as more space is given to the plot and especially dialogues. Chaplin plays both the victim and the perpetrator, but while his portrayal of ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel is still entertaining to watch, most of the Jewish Barber scenes didn't age too well. They serve as a good counterpoint to Hynkel's biting satire, but tend to rely on old school gags and mawkish melodrama a bit too much. The final resolution makes use of the good old mistaken identity trick, but it could have been planned out way more smoothly as identities just get swapped out of the blue with no buildup whatsoever.The final monologue is one of the most famous moments in cinema history, and still manages to pierce your heart and hit the right spot. However, it sounded more like Charlie Chaplin making a personal statement rather than the Barber speaking, as if the man behind the curtain took over his characters in the end.",

I've always believed in the power of satire as an effective weapon in the war against injustice and evil, and The Great Dictator is a satirical masterpiece created by the original celluloid master-satirist. I've heard the same rumors that many have noted about the supposed lukewarm attitude Chaplin had about Hitler's regime, but a simple glance at the production and release dates of this film should once and finally put an end to that disinformation. This was not only a brilliantly hilarious lampooning of a vile ideology, I consider it to be the Gold Standard of cinematic satire. I can only hope that the lucky few Jewish survivors of the Nazi's inhumanity who saw this movie found it in some small way satisfying. For everyone else, I I hope it communicated effectively its (I believe) intended message that, although we'll never extinguish evil everywhere, we should ridicule it relentlessly when and wherever it's found",

            "content": "One of the funniest opening sequences followed by a highly audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious work of Charlie Chaplin ending with a rousing poignant speech. While playing his run-of-the-mill tramp character with his usual flourish, Chaplin delivered a masterstroke as Hynkel - a mockery of Hitler by generating laughs from the eccentricity and egotistic nature of the character. By making a comedy out of the highly precarious situation of the Jews exactly during the full blown Holocaust might have garnered a reputation for bad taste, but enough care was taken not to hurt feelings and all the angst is directed towards the fascists.A Jewish Barber (Charles Chaplin) suffers amnesia after getting injured in the war saving a General. The barber remains contained in a hospital staying ignorant to the ascent of a tyrant Hynkel - the eccentric dictator of Tomania (Charles Chaplin again) and the condition of his kind. When he stands up to the harassing fascist soldiers after walking into the turbulent world he earns love of Hannah (Paulette Goddard) but wrath from the fascists saved timely by the General. Meanwhile Hynkel is plotting to invade Osterlich by tricking Napolini, the dictator of Bacteria into pulling back their army.Charles Chaplin is already a legend in playing the tramp character, but Hynkel was a different ballgame for him. It is a character of aggression, superiority and eccentricity but still clumsy as the tramp. The war sequences, rich palace settings elevates the scale of the movie compared to his previous outing, an equally magnificent 'Modern Times'. Chaplin is a gifted all rounder with a profound writing talent that always portrays the triumph of looking at life in positive outset and a sense of humor. The background score is melodious and rich according the situations. Paulette Goddard looks aged and heavy compared to 'Modern Times' but retains the charm and infective energy she possessed there. The remaining actors and the technical departments do an apt job in putting together this masterpiece.Audacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious",

            "review_title": "Chaplin at his best",
            "content": "\"The Great Dictator\" is one of Charlie Chaplin's most dynamic and most entertaining films. His first speaking film, it allows him to add a level of verbal comedy and wit to his always-funny pantomime and physical comedy.Playing a dual role both as megalomaniacal dictator Adenoid Hynkel (based on Adolf Hitler) and a lowly Jewish barber from the ghetto, Chaplin, flexes his repertory performing talents to convince the viewer it could be different actors playing these roles. The barber character allows Chaplin to breathe new life into his well-known tramp character, complete with signature hat and cane. The Brahms shaving scene is so dynamic that even without a word of dialogue it stands the test of time to entertain viewers decades after its release.Much of the film's intrigue comes from its symbolism. Beginning with the \"double cross\" symbol, playing on the Nazi swastika as well as the public being double-crossed, the movie goes on to explore the notion of how, as Caesar once said, \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\". As Hynkel even notices when he says \"you make me afraid of myself!\" the world is not unlike the balloon prop Chaplin uses to entertain viewers; it may be fun to play with, but if you squeeze it too hard it will explode.As an added bonus, the movie explores the notion of what can happen when two men with great power but even greater egos go against each other for control of the world. Arguing over military deployment and treaty negotiation, Hynkel and Italian dictator Benzini Napaloni (based on Benito Mussolini) quarrel at a complimentary buffet, but eventually settle their differences and remain friends. This, one could say, is a strong allegory to the uselessness of war and clueless nature of those with the power to start wars.In delivering speeches in the character of Hynkel, Chaplin expresses the fire and intensity of an evil dictator while remaining absolutely ridiculous and entertaining. In preparing for his role, Chaplin spent a lot of time studying a lot of tapes of Hitler's speeches, mastering his posture, body language and voice inflection. Thus, the fire and malice of his messages are communicated, although if you listen closely you can hear Chaplin use such words as \"schnitzel\", \"lederhosen\", and other terms most Americans with little or no German training can understand. In addition, Chaplin \"Germanizes\" English phrases to make them sound more comical, such as \"tighten-de-belten.\" But, never breaking character allows Chaplin to sell his portrayal. As true as it is today, it was the same in 1940, and even back in 1440: It's not what you say, it's how you say it.Chaplin also excels in the directorial aspect of this movie. He uses many different aspects and strategies to portray the world that surrounds his storyline. Without utilizing very much in the way of camera movement, Chaplin uses other ways such as music \u0096 both diegetic and non-diegetic \u0096 as well as creative cuts and pantomime to change the movie from being words on a page of script into a living, breathing work of art. In the scene involving the coins within the puddings, each table member finds a coin, which would mean they would have to sacrifice themselves to police. Each person passes theirs to Chaplin, who subsequently tries to swallow each coin in order to hide it. As he eats the pudding and bites down to find a coin, a crescendo of music tells the viewer what has happened.Another method pursued by Chaplin in making this movie is what is known as the \"Kuleshov Effect\". This occurs when a show is coordinated alongside a different shot or sound effects, and the viewer perceives a link between the two. When Hynkel and Napaloni are viewing the armies, the camera remains focused on the two dignitaries, adding in background noise. The viewer is told that the two are looking at fast planes, and the sound of a plane engine is accompanied by the two men turning their heads quickly, seemingly watching the planes fly across the sky. As the larger artillery is viewed, the viewer hears heavy clanking metal and the two heads of state turn their gaze much more slowly. This is the Kuleshov Effect at its best, because even though the two actors are staring at a film crew and the inside of a movie studio, the viewer is convinced the two are actually conducting a military review.In Hynkel's final speech, actually delivered in the character of the Jewish barber, Chaplin uses camera-work to combine unlike shots as well. As he calls out to Hannah, his love, he looks to the sky. Simultaneously, she wakes up miles away, and looks to the sky as well. Although the two are miles away and there is no way that she can actually hear him calling to her, the viewer can't help but think that she can hear his voice carrying on the wind. This is Chaplin's directing at its best. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who loves to laugh.",

            "content": "Chaplin plays the Dictator & ironically a Jewish Barber. There are eerie scenes resembling the Third Reich rounding up Jews which was happening when the movie was made.This film features a lot of tried & true talent in the cast that worked with Chaplin in the silent era. It has a captivating performance by Paulette Goddard (Chaplins second wife) As the Jewish Barbers Girlfriend. Comedy bits by Chaplin in it are top notch from the beginning. It is his only sound film where Charlie still exhibits the energy he had in his silents. The script is a marvel for which Chaplin should be congratulated. The ending is a major dramatic surprise. It is a dramatic speech in which Charlie looks wooden on screen while delivering the speech, but it is the words of the speech which are most important. The speech is a message from Charlie's heart, a plea for the modern world he saw in the late 1930's to please move towards world peace. This message is powerful enough to evoke tears, even in the modern viewer. The sad note is that even today, as then, nobody listens to this plea. The fanatic Hitler did not listen even though Adolf Hitler often seemed to use the news cameras to look like Charlie Chaplin. Chaplins dance with the globe in this film illustrates what these fanatics want, but the destruction of the globe illustrates what they will get. This film has some of the greatest symbolism in the history of film, all at the hands of the little man who made us laugh, & out of character at the end of this film, makes us cry.This film is the essential Chaplin, both historically & monumentally a great film.I never heard this speech until I saw this movie. The entire film is a gem but to put this speech in perspective, Charles Chaplin] wrote this speech during one of the darkest times in 20th century history - in 1938 and 1939- during the rise of Adolf Hitler. Putting this in perspective - the speech is a plea for humans to care . This was Charlie Chaplin's first sound movie, and he wrote and directed it. Chaplin played Anoid Henkel - and Hitler's twin - a Jewish Barber. in the film, it is the Jewish BARBER making this speech. When set in the film, just before this speech, the Barber who everyone thinks is Henkle, is told he must go make the speech Henkle (Hitler) is supposed to make in front of a huge audience, the Barber's words are \"I can't.\" What follows is this speech which is one of the greatest moments in Film History.",

            "content": "Both were born in the 'Old Continent', some days apart in April 1889, both had vaguely similar features incarnated by their memorable toothbrush mustaches \u0085 more importantly, both would become the most famous men of their era: Charlie Chaplin and Adolf Hitler, international stars for the better and for the worse, in the twilight of 1939.Despite their similar backgrounds, the two men represent the opposite poles of humanity. One dedicated his life for silent comedy as a universal language meant to inspire the purest and most human emotions, while the other turned the country of Kant into a supremacist nation, justifying such atrocities as invasions, mass murders and ultimately, genocide. Chaplin was a man of emotions, Hitler of a rationalism whose meaning was twisted until it became synonym of bestial superiority: the law of the strongest, or mechanical thinking, through the dedication to technology in total contempt for the emotions that resonate for Nazis as the language of the weak. \"The Great Dictator\" is Chaplin's answer to this absurdity, a message that speaks for Humanity: universal, inspirational \u0085 and hilarious.One scene incarnates the universality of silent comedy, the 'globe ballet', illustrating with a poetic finesse, the devastating ambitions and the madness inherent not just to Hynkel, but to all the dictators in the world, the balloon popping at the end is the prophetic reminder that justice triumphs sooner or later. The whole film contains many classic Chaplin moments including the iconic shaving with Brahms's Hungarian Violins reminding how Nazism dishonored the beautiful heritage of its civilization, other scenes include the confrontation between Hynkel and Napolini, the dictation, and the inflamed speech in German-sounding gibberish. In \"City Lights\", Chaplin used gibberish to humorously denounce sound's futility, in \"The Great Dictator\", Hynkel's gibberish sounds like barks reminding what Hitler's voices incarnated to the oppressed people, something inhuman, hateful, violent ... still, better to be mocked than wept over.Chaplin's treatment, more than in any of his films, tackles a difficult subject with the perfect mix of comedy and drama, incarnated by Hannah, Paulette Goddard whose illuminating beauty represents the driving force of the film, as the eternal dream on a brighter tomorrow, as the virginal wound in people's devastated hearts. Never losing faith in humanity, Hannah epitomizes Anne Franck's famous \"In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart\" The tender relationship with the Jewish barber demonstrates the evilness of an ideology that prevented people from the simplest things, simply from being human. In the 'coin in the pudding' scene, one of the funniest, we realize that despite all the noblest feelings, the men from the ghetto are just ordinary guys who don't necessarily want to be heroes, a subtle but no less clever depiction of Jewish humor, subtle mix of wit and self-derision.Chaplin said that if he'd known the extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi, he couldn't have made fun of it. This is a honest and admirable recognition of the value of comedy, it's not a weapon but it attacks, not rational but it makes you think, whatever takes itself too seriously is put in its place and whatever is mocked by the majority gets an extra level of depth and poignancy. This is probably why Chaplin was uneasy with the gap between Hynkel and the 'original' dictator who forever marked the course of history, the comedy is still innocent enough to be regarded as an answer to Nazism's horrific barbarity. Which might explain why a few films made fun of Hitler after \"The Great Dictator\" and why most of the comedic takes on Hitler were from Jewish directors, as if one had to carry the wound of the tragedy to translate it into laughs, as a posthumous attempt to strike back against the evil, humor as a defensive, almost cathartic, process \u0085 I guess.I also guess Chaplin believed in that and unconsciously saw himself as one of the oppressed people, whether they were Jewish or Gentle, Black or White, he saw himself as part of humanity. And this is where the universality of \"The Little Tramp\" relies on, he's the \"Little Fellow\" who speaks for all the little fellows in the world, with thrilling words expressing the very principles Chaplin stood for: kindness, love, brotherhood, happiness, universality. It's not the Jewish barber but Chaplin himself delivering the most beautiful and intelligently inspirational message transcending the bounds of Cinema. Chaplin who never spoke, finally let out all his emotions, beliefs and feelings, so important that the fact that he was out of the character, wasn't relevant. The climactic speech rejects the barbarity of Nazism, fascism, any ugly word ending with -ism, rejects machinery that became synonym of alienation and destruction as foreshadowed in his previous \"Modern Times\", and accepts technology only as an instrument to unite people, to strengthen human spirit, solidarity, empathy. Not Tomania, or Bacteria, Chaplin, spoke from the bottom of his heart, a place named Utopia, a beautiful dream, we tend to reach every day. Like a true prophet of his era, Chaplin, ahead of his time, points the danger of Nazism. The applauds at the end indirectly highlights the fantastic aspect of the film, released in 1940 when the worst was to come.But Chaplin made his point and the film works as fantasy with the last metamorphosis of a character, proving that justice can triumph over fanaticism and while other film-makers imagined cold-blooded killers machine-gunning Adolf Hitler with an orgasmic satisfaction, Chaplin appeals to humanity, asks people to think as one indivisible brotherhood, no nations, no frontiers, no use of malicious technologies, only kindness and humble intelligence to put wings in human souls so they can fly to rainbows of hope.Not just Chaplin's ultimate masterpiece, \"The Great Dictator\" is one of the most humanistic cinematic message that never lost its resonance, not even after 70 years.

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin turns his comic focus on the dictators of his time - Mussolini and Hitler. He mocks their mien, their speech, and their policies. Chaplin shows himself to be brave and shows again that he is a comic genius. His imitation of Hitler and the scene of Hitler hanging from a moving plane shine in this film as Chaplin's shoe eating did in \"Gold Rush\". In contrast to the dictators' policies, he offers a beautiful vision of the future.Chaplin obviously is a comic genius and was deeply committed to opposing tyranny. He used the talents he had to oppose it, and for that he should be commended. Hitler is seen as blustering and Chaplin hilariously lampoons his overheated style, practically spitting into the front row so overwrought does he become. The speeches are comic gems because of his use of pseudo-German, some actual German, and that aforementioned overwrought style. His advisors Garbitsch (Henri Danielle) and Herring (Billy Gilbert) are oafs and psychopaths by turn. Garbitsch, obviously modelled on Goebbels, is the psychopath. Danielle chills the blood with a stark, cold depiction of a man whose quiet confidence about extermination only re-enforces the psychopathy of the Final Solution. Herring is an oaf who can do nothing without making a fool of himself. By mocking Goebbels, Goerring, and Hitler so mercilessly, Chaplin gives us a release from the stress that comes from hating people.On the other hand, there are residents of the Jewish Ghetto who live fearfully owing to Naziism's escalating oppression. They have tough lives but live with dignity and self-respect. They are routinely harassed and badgered by roughneck SS officers. One day however, a chance World War I encounter between a Nazi officer and the barber brings some of the harassment to a close, at least for some time. The difference between Hitler and Mussolini on the one hand and the Ghetto residents on the other is stark, but given the horrors that Hitler and Mussolini inflicted on the world, they turn out to be prescient. There are some good performances from Paulette Goddard as a humble resident of the Ghetto, and Reginald Gardiner as an informal leader in the community. They bring humility and decency to their characters.As usual, Chaplin's comic gifts shine through in set pieces. In this film, the set piece of Chaplin hanging from the wing of a moving plane is hilarious. Another hilarious scene is that of a bumbling crew messing up the debut of a new weapon. Neither shoe might hold up to the famous shoe eating in \"Gold Rush\" but they are worthwhile rivals.The film comes to a head as the Ghetto barber as well as arrogant dictator Hinkle (both played by Chaplin) are mistaken for one another. The humble barber must address an assembly of Hinkle's most brainwashed followers and the unexpected speech leaves the crowd shocked.As a statement opposing authoritarians it is very powerful movie. It is a pity more artists haven't used their power to condemn authoritarianism. It is a bit pie in the sky but at the time, the Final Solution hadn't yet happened and so what we see in retrospect was not inevitable. Chaplin's movie offered the world a beautiful vision of the future, but if idealism isn't expressed, it doesn't even stand a chance. Chaplin showed his cards and stuck his neck out and as I said, I have a lot of respect for Chaplin making a movie that was obviously deeply felt. It might not have happened but it's a beautiful, as well as very funny, vision to aspire toward.",

Especially masterpieces like THE GENERAL, and SHERLOCK JUNIOR, Keaton was actually **funny**; while Chaplin tended to be **just** simply cute and sweet (obvious connection to modern humour there).Now I've just seen this one, and I've finally admitted that Chaplin does have the knack to be out-and-out rib-ticklingly hilarious. Of course, I could also have remembered classics like \"Easy Street\" and of course \"Modern Times\" (which I really have to check upon again); but definitely in this film, there were scenes that were so perfect and spot-on hilarious, with impeccable timing and pure side-splitting hilarity.Not only the famous \"playing with the world scene\"; but the whole opening segment with the Big Bertha gun; including the bit with the anti-aircraft gun, the walking through the smoke scene, and of course the upside-down aircraft bit. Pure comic genius!!!And to top it off; the absolute satirical punch of the Dictator Hynkle - the speeches, the gestures, the bits with the microphones, the competition with Napolini... And I think Jack Oakie has to be totally on par with Chaplin in this movie. The sheer gusto of the big guy's performance is breathtaking. Especially the classic \"food fight\" scene! This film has all the great comic bits!Another actor that doesn't get enough credit I think in most discussions of this movie is Henry Daniell. I just saw him a few months back in TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS - the difference in character between that and this is quite amazing. Further proof that with the right material, a very serious drama actor can be a great choice for a comic movie. (Am I the only one who Garbitch reminds of Professor Snape? Not knocking either character or anything, though.)And the final big point - just look at the date this film was released (1940 - right in the middle of WWII.) Talk about topical! Can you imagine any filmmaker today who would have the guts to make this type of movie about a subject matter that was hitting the headlines so blatantly? It would be like the Farrally brothers today doing a trash comedy about Osama Bin Laden - (and I know just mentioning the idea is going to have some people flame me ferociously!) And to think modern filmmakers think they're \"so current and trendy - not like the olden days when people just made frivolous entertainment.\" Ha! Double Ha!Thie is a true comic masterpiece.

An overly political film from Chaplin, The Great Dictator is considered a classic today but of all the feature-length films that I've seen of his so far, it's also the weakest.Set 20 years after the First World War in the fictional country of Tomainia which was on the losing side, The Great Dictator follows two story lines; first concerning a Jewish barber who suffered memory loss during his service in the war & finds himself under a new oppression after returning home while the other storyline concerns Tomainia's ruthless dictator who is trying to expand his empire.Written, produced, directed & scored by Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator marks his first stint with sound cinema yet Chaplin shows a great level of comfort in what's an unfamiliar territory for him. The timeless elements of his silent classics are present in this picture but Chaplin also employs sound in a manner that adds more weight to his already unparalleled slapstick humour, as evident in Hynkel's speech.The film is usually at its best when there is no dialogue needed or when the spoken words don't make any sense. Chaplin absolutely nails the character of Adenoid Hynkel; the Dictator of Tomainia, and whatever gibberish comes out of his mouth is pure gold. And he's excellently supported by Jack Oakie, who plays Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Benito Mussolini) & they together provide the viewers with the film's finest moments.The technical aspects are refined to the smallest of details, as always the case in most films by Chaplin. The sets are impressive to look at, Camera-work is expertly carried out with long takes, controlled movements & sharp focus. Editing is a slight mishap for some sequences linger on for too long or become repetitive. Humour carries Chaplin's unique trademark but there are a few empty stretches in between. As for the soundtrack, it simply fits.Chaplin also plays the Jewish barber in addition to the dictator and is excellent in that part as well. While the barber character does borrow a few elements from The Little Tramp, it's Hynkel where Chaplin really shines this time. However, what brings the film down for me is what was absent from his earlier features; the voice-over, as Chaplin's narration is annoying & intruding at times, especially when he tries to explain what Hynkel is saying in his gibberish speech.On an overall scale, The Great Dictator may not be as remarkable as Chaplin's finest films but it nonetheless works as an audacious piece of political satire that's superbly filmed & outstandingly performed. It offers an enjoyable ride for the most part, features plenty of amusing moments but lacks the smooth flow & closely-knitted structure of his usual works and although the universal message of the final speech does transcend all races, borders & boundaries, it can also feel a bit preachy. Either way, The Great Dictator comes recommended.",

But it's not all about comedy; behind the laughters lies a critique of the war and how pointless, damaging and inhuman it is. It shows the situation of the Jewish people, who were often abused and ridiculized by the German army. It satirizes the greed and lust for power of Mussolini and Hitler, who most of the time act like children and not like grown-up adults, fighting with each other for the biggest piece of cake. The ending of the film is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I guess that, at this point, most people know a word or two of the famous speech. It was so heart-felt, human and splendid I couldn't help but cry. The Great Dictator is a film that is not to be missed.",

            "content": "Bumbling Jewish soldier (Charlie Chaplin) was lucky to survive WWI. He leaves the hospital years later suffering memory lost thinking he's gone for only a few weeks. Ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (Charlie Chaplin) has taken over the nation of Tomainia. The Jewish soldier returns to his barbershop in the ghettos. He gets into a fight with the storm troopers and earns the heart of the defiant washer woman Hannah (Paulette Goddard). He's about to be hung on a lamp post, but is rescue by Commander Schultz whom he saved during WWI. Then Hynkel loosens the reins on the Jews to attract a loan from a Jewish banker.I appreciate the attempt, but like 9/11, there were attempted jokes right after that was too soon. It's also too on-the-nose. Chaplin is playing the Jewish barber as the tramp lite. The story just doesn't quite have the comedy or the heart. Standing up to the storm troopers is the most compelling for the barber. Meanwhile dictator Hynkel is more weird than funny. It's how I feel about playing with the balloon globe. It's quirky weird but I would never laugh at it. Napaloni is a funnier dictator. Then there is the big final speech. Chaplin puts all his heart into it. Again I appreciate the attempt. It was probably more compelling back in the day. For all the appreciation at the political statement, I'm giving it a good score but not for any comedy.",

            "content": "For all that Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" was very much a topical movie in its time, it is still both entertaining and pertinent. Chaplin treats the subject of the Axis dictators with enough satirical humor and thematic depth to make it carry beyond the immediate concerns of the day. Chaplin's silent masterpieces are still his best movies, but this one shows that he was also capable of making a smooth transition to sound pictures.Chaplin himself does very well in his dual role, which gives him plenty of room to perform a good variety of material. After her excellent performance in \"Modern Times\", Paulette Goddard's role here is unfortunately much more limited, but she does well when she has a chance. Chaplin's most entertaining scenes are probably the ones with Jack Oakie, as the dictator's would-be companion in conquest. Together, the two make those scenes work both as funny satire and as a clever depiction of the dictators' fragile personas.Even if this hadn't worked so well, it would have been quite a creditable attempt by Chaplin to find humor in such a grim topic. Very few film-makers could have made a picture that hit the appropriate balance as well as this does. \"The Great Dictator\" no longer has the urgent significance that it held for its original viewers, but it retains its relevance in a more general sense. It's nearly as entertaining as Chaplin's best silents, and like them, its message still holds something worthwhile.",

Not one thing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle, but that was one of desperation. The Tramp's first - and only - talkie where he speaks (he sings in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in \"Modern Times\" and \"Gold Rush\" - two films that are at least ten times better than this film. There's literally only one good scene in this film, the one where Hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball. That's it.Okay, so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war, even long before we entered the war. Nope. Not true. Simply not true, so that praise can be turned down a bit. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with \"You Natzy Spy\" - ten months earlier than the October release of Chaplin's film - and that movie was actually funny! If you want to watch Chaplin's greatest film, watch this only for reference. And then pop in \"Modern Times\", \"Gold Rush\", \"City Lights\", \"Limelight\", \"The Kid\", or even \"Tillie's Punctured Romance\".",

            "content": "This is probably the film that Chaplin is best known for, even though it isn't actually one of the films from the repertoire of silent classics. In a way it is not so much a criticism of Fascism in Europe but rather a criticism of US isolationism. However, it doesn't necessarily seem to be that as Chaplin seems to be making a mockery of the fascist dictators in Europe as opposed to actually confronting his viewers with the reality of the situation, and while in a sense we may, at least at this time, consider Hitler to be something of a joke, the reality of the horrors weren't going to come to the fore until much later.The film beings in World War I, where a Jewish barber is fighting on the Front Lines, and then ends up not only saving a pilot, but after crashing the plane ending up in hospital with amnesia. Twenty years later we have him leave the hospital and return to the ghetto to see that in one sense nothing has changed, but in another sense quite a lot has changed. The thing is that the Jews up to that time have always lived in Ghettos, and have always suffered persecution under the hands to those around them, however things seemed to be getting a lot worse.The Great Dictator cuts between Hynkle, who is played by Chaplin, and the Barber, who is also played by Chaplin. The Hynkle scenes are in a sense a lot of slapstick, in a way that politicians are mocked. It is similar with the barber scenes, yet Chaplin seems to be trying to challenge us with the problems that the Jews were living under at the time, and the nature of extreme racism. However, he also seemed to be trying to open our eyes to the fact that this wasn't just the case in Germany, but everywhere. The thing was that nobody particularly cared about the Jews, which is why Hitler was able to get away with what he did, though we must remember that he did work to cover the holocaust up somewhat.It isn't a silent film though, which sort confronted me at least since Chaplin was one of the masters of the silent era. However, I doubt it would have worked as one. What is interesting though are the speeches. Obviously there is the great speech that is delivered at the end, which is in effect let's stop being mean to each other and start to learn to actually get along. We also have Hynkle's speeches which are basically gibberish. At first I thought he may have been just mocking Hitler, but there is also that essence with the idea that it is not the content that actually matters, but the energy with which it is delivered. In a way Hitler, like many other populist politicians, are able to get people on side simply by telling them what they want to hear. Also, one could even suggest that the content could be drastically changed, but as long as the energy that delivered the original speech is replicated, then people will simply continue to follow along blindly, which is why the barber was able to get away with what he did.",

            "content": "Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania.  He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache.  Sound like anyone you know?From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini.  Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc,  Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name).  Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless.  All this does is to humanise him.  When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable.  As dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations which don't work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside.  In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic.  At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi.  Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer's face, \"your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people\"?  And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto?  If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform?  Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age.  As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of 'silent' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line.  There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah.  Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage.  \"Gee, ain't I cute?\" she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over.  Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn't come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature.  The 'wouldn't it be wonderful?' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film's underlying weakness remains.  If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him?  And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?",

            "content": "Review for ART 1145 American Cinema - The Great Dictator\nThe Great Dictator is a film directed, written, produced, and starring the famous comedian, Charlie Chapman. This 1940 movie set in World War I follows a Jewish barber from the ghetto and a dictator Adenoid Hynkel who is a parody of Adolf Hitler, the fascist, anti-Semitic dictator of Nazi Germany at the time. Throughout the movie, we follow the realities of both the Jewish barber and Adenoid Hynkel, and somewhere down the line gets mixed up since they look alike (Chaplin played both parts). This leads to the Jewish barber giving one the best and emotionally driven speeches in Hollywood. Passionate words that want freedom, justice, liberty, and genuine goodwill for all. This satirical comedy-drama film, in more ways than one, is the start of many important starts in Hollywood. This film made this Chaplin's first true sound film since this was a time \"talkie\" has just begun in the film industry. This was a very big step for Chaplin, considering he was most famous for his silent films. Also, this is the first movie in history to b parody and be against everything Adolf Hitler stood for (dictatorship, fascism, antisemitism, etc.). This is quite surprising, because in 1940, America was still very isolated on the horrors Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany were doing. Chaplin was able to capture the disturbing and dangerous world of fascism while still having genuinely funny slapstick humor. This was a darkly funny and emotional, that still very socially relevant today. Hate and animosity still exists in many communities, and Chaplin's speech is something everyone should take in and listen to.",

This is one of my favourite, arguably number 1 comedy ever, and one of the best war movies ever made. I am not an easy critic to please when it comes to comedies, but the Great Dictator blew me away. It's incredible.The plot, for most of the film, doesn't go anywhere. This is beneficial for the film, because instead of forcing direction like many comedies, Chaplin decided to run the film like a series of sketch comedies. Alternating between the Dictator and the Barber, we see a series of situations occur to both characters. While the barber is 'similar' to the Tramp, Henkyl is outstanding. His first speech, absolute gibberish with a few words tossed in for humour, made me laugh out loud. Hard. I can't remember the last time a film made me do that.Towards the end, developments happen and the pacing is impeccable. Just when the sketches could start to seem redundant, the invasion plans start. Whereas most comedies stop humour for plot movement, the Great Dictator keeps the laughs rolling. I won't discuss the plot, but it sets up a timeless ending. (More on that later.) One other character tickled my funny bone- Napaloni. His Italian stereotype cracked me up, with his a-words, his a-hand gestures and costume. The satire here is spot-on. The film's ignorance is it's greatest strength. The film would be much safer, less shocking, or have not happened if Chaplin knew what was happening at the time. But because it was released when it was, we see a more raw, explicit parody of a madman and his ideas.It's funny, the importance of this film. A parody of a conflict, and what a conflict it was, while the war raged. Imagine if someone made an Afghanistan version (without puppets 'Team America') today, without fear of judgement or knowledge of the atrocities that are surely happening to both sides. That is the Great Dictator. Used to anger Axis soldiers (read the IMDb trivia), banned in many countries, and seen by Hitler himself twice. This is the movie I wanted Dr. Strangelove to be: zany and witty.The Great Dictator, despite its age, is one of the funniest movies I've seen. And then at th end, Charlie stops and gives a timeless, touching speech about war that I don't want to spoil: see it. A historical masterpiece. 9.5/10",

So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace.This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music.Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality. It is to Chaplin's credit that he risked his career, as well as his own capital, in pressing ahead with such a vast commitment. But his political naivety always showed, as when someone suggested he should make a similar film about Stalin. \"It is hard to play a man who has no faults\", came the astonishing reply.Finally, no report on The Great Dictator is complete without some verdict about Hitler's own rumoured screening of it (as a one-time Chaplin fan). Two prints were acquired from Portugal and delivered to the F\u00fchrer's private cinema. Albert Speer declared that Hitler never saw the film - but he couldn't strictly have known. Some say he watched it twice in total silence and made no reaction. Chaplin said he would give anything to know what he thought of it.",

The parodies of Hitler and Mussolini often speak in foreign gibberish. Its a style common back then, but rare now, so its pretty niche. I thought it was okay - a few scenes made me chuckle, and no joke completely failed. It could have been 30 minutes shorter.I wouldn't watch this film for its satire of fascism alone. There are some good lines and scenes, but it generally lacks depth. Its far from my favorite comedy of all time, but that's personal taste. I also respect it for having more ambition and empathy for humanity than most movies back then, let alone comedies. And of course, the ending alone guarantees a respectable rating. Watch the film if you're a fan of Charlie Chaplin or The Three Stooges, and watch the final scene regardless of your opinions.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator Is written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. It also sees him play duel roles. In the primary role he plays Dictator Adenoid Hynkel of a fictional country called Tomainia. Who over the course of the film tries to expand his empire by trying to borrow money from a Jewish banker In order to Invade his neighbouring country of Osterlich. After being refused the loan he orders the purge of Jewish community which was already being subjugated under his orders.Chaplins second role Is juxtaposed against Hynkel, he plays a Jewish barber(his name is never given) and Is a WW1 veteran. Who In the process of saving the life of a wounded pilot, loses his own memory. Twenty years later returns to the ghetto where he falls In love with Hannah(Paulette Goddard), and tries to go back to being a barber. However after being constantly harassed by Hynkels stormtroopers, finds himself on the run.The set up and story of this film is fairly basic, and offers no surprises, but the film never Intends to. Instead this Is a platform for Chaplin to voice a larger message. The film was made In 1940, at the time the USA hadn't entered the war yet. Whilst the horrors and persecution of the Jewish people hadn't been fully realised yet at that point In time. If It had of been know, I think this would've been a very different film, It probably wouldn't of even been made.This if one of only a couple of films In which Chaplin spoke In, and It's this reason why the film feels more powerful then It would've been had someone else starred In It. This is personified In what many people would agree to be the finest speech In film history at the end of the film. The last five minutes of the film are by far and away the most famous aspect of the film, and for good reason. It's a rousing and profound speech, that comes straight from Chaplins heart. It's a speech that speaks too the very goodness of humanity. It's also made all the more effective coming from a man known for his silence.Whilst the last few minutes of the film has a very serious tone and message. The film contains the usual levity and slapstick humour that Is associated with Chaplins work. There are many moments of excellent satire peppered all throughout the film. my personal favourite being when the Barber meets up with the pilot he saved twenty years later(Schultz). Schultz saves him from being taken by the Stormtroopers. He says to the barber \"Strange, and I always thought of you as an Aryan\" To which Chaplins barber responds \"I'm a vegetarian\" In a deadpan manner. There are a few jokes that do feel a little dated. The majority however hit their mark, and feel fresh and contemporary In todays current climate.The Great Dictator came out at an Important time not just film history, but human history. Whilst some of the satire Is a little too on the nose. The film did what it needed too do with flying colours, It's a beautiful film to watch and the editing and direction is on point. The Great Dictator maybe arguably one of the most important films ever made. It's a film that everyone should watch at-least once In their life-time.",

Luckily it was Chaplin himself.Oddly enough, Chaplin plays a Jew who happens to have the same moustache as the Great Dictator, and it's only a matter of time before someone makes use of this coincidence somehow ...The story gets put on hold every so often with comic set pieces that make it clear why Chaplin was so highly regarded.  The penny-swallowing scene and the bit set to Brahms's fourth Hungarian Dance are hilarious and more than hilarious - agile and beautiful as well.  (On the other hand, the globe scene, which I'm surprised to see people rave about, goes on forever.)  Yet the story - or at any rate the basic situation - is still interesting enough to hold things together.  The central character is the most reluctant of reluctant heroes.  In a word, he's a coward.  He HAS no hidden reserves of courage to draw upon when he needs them.  But somehow he rises to the occasion anyway.As a satire of Nazi Germany it's inevitably lacking, constrained in a hundred ways by the political conditions of, and lack of hindsight available in, the year in which it was made.  The speech at the end is all very well but the content doesn't seem quite right today.  (It would be more fittingly directed against Stalin than Hitler.)

            "content": "There are a few films that are destined to be great, because they are challenging and daring. They are so because they challenge the times in which they are made. The highlights amongst these films are Kubrick's \"Dr Strangelove\" and \"The Great Dictator\", a film that everybody in Hollywood said nobody wanted to see. Thank god Chaplin made this film anyway.What Chaplin offers in this film and why it is so important as a historical piece today is an insight into the eccentricities of fascism that dogged the early 20th century. Chaplin and his actors masterfully copied the mannerism of the important figures of the time and then amplified and exaggerated them. We are therefore shown the Third Reich in all its dark and loony glory, in all its bloodthirsty expansionist policy and inhuman treatment of `sub-humans'.Chaplin's rendition of Hynkel is masterfully put forward as jibberish, with dramatic poses and movements that include him pouring water down his pants. The famous ballet with the globe was Chaplin's ultimate film moment that symbolizes just how reckless the Nazi expansion policy really was. However some of the most entertaining moments come from Napoloni, who visits \u0091Hynki' to discuss the invasion of Austerlitz by Tomania. A direct parody of the appeasement policy and the breaking of the Stresa front, Chaplin does not only have a go at Nazi Germany, but also at the people that just let it happen.Chaplin's final speech in which the Jewish barber takes the place of Hynkel, questioning Hitler's own Arianness, is filled with a plea to the world to stop war forever instead of simply saying that the world should stop the Nazis. This film should be compulsory in every country and in every school and the fact that the world is still embroiled in wars all over shows that this film is perhaps more relevant today than it was in 1940. When one looks at this film one can see, Robert Mugabe, Mohammed Al Caddaffi, Saddam Hussein and George W. Bush. Obviously we have not learnt the lesson yet!",

            "content": "As far as really good examples of Pro-American, Pro-Allied Forces, Anti-Nazi Germany World War II films to come out of Hollywood are two. One is the Walt Disney Donald Duck short subject,DER FUEHRER'S FACE(1942). The other is discussed in the following. It has been said that The One and only Constant is Change. We're not sure who said it; though we did know, it changed on us! This World wide Change or \"State of Flux\", if you will, was very evident in the period between the two World Wars, and in every aspect of life. Political unrest, Pop Cultural Shock, Shifting Mores and a Post 'War to End All Wars' Era all combined to give us a World barely recognizable to the Populice of 30 years or so before.And just think! First it was \"How You Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm, Now that They've Seen Par-ee!\", and then they went and stuck us with National Prohibition! That's another thing, The Volsted Act, Mother of Temperence, or Organized Crime? But in any case, we had a great wave of change had overtaken Hollywood, hitting it from every direction. Undoubtedly the greatest shock-wave here came from the Sound Revolution. The Motion Picture had spent the previously 30+ Years in being forged, honed and fine tuned. The result was a Beautiful New Art Form; being a perfect Marriage of Visual Imagery with the Printed Word(Title Cards), with some emotional support of Musical Accompaniment.Now along comes people like Inventor Lee DeForrest and Company. With them they brought processes like \"Vitaphnoe\", \"Western Electric Recording System\", \"RCA High Fidelity\" and even \"Photophone Recording Process\". Almost over night, the Studios and Movie Going Public became just about totally obsessed with SOUND, DIALOGUE, ALL-TALKING & ALL-SINGING! Charlie Chaplin was in as good a position as any to meet the challenges of the 'New Era'. His position, wealth and influence had rapidly and steadily grown from the time of his signing his first one year deal with Mack Sennett and his Keystone Studios. The popularity of his 1 and 2 Reeler Comedies brought him successively better financial growth and artistic autonomy over his films. Progressivly improving contracts with Keystone, Essanay, Mutual and First National, led to his owning and operating his own \"Chaplin Studios\" and his co-founding the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation.* So Mr. Chaplin had successfully been able to forestall the intrusion of Sound and \"the Talkies\" into his film world. Both CITY LIGHTS(1931) and MODERN TIMES(1936)had sound tracks, but it was mostly filled up with Musical Scores(written by??**)and some sound effects. But the 1930's were rapidly coming to an end, and August 31st with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany from the West, followed by The Red Army of Soviet Russia's pouring in from the East.Chaplin wanted to make his next film something truly special, unique and truly a \"One of a Kind\" for the Depression Ridden '30's. It would surely appear that 'The Little Tramp' succeeded.In THE GREAT DICTATOR, we are shown a metamorphosis on the screen, right before our very eyes. It was done subtly, without the obvious being said, shown or even implied.In the earliest scenes we are brought up to 'the Front' in World War I. It is a fictionalized version , though only lightly so. The 'Enemy' Army is identified as being the Army of \"Tomainia\", but the soldiers, Officers and Enlisted Men, all have a decidedly German look to their Wartime Fashion. A certain allusion is made to \"Big Bertha's\" being used by the 'Enemy'.*** At this point we are introduced to 'A Jewish Barber'(Charlie Chaplin) who is on an artillery crew turned into Infantryman. The scenes involving the battle, heavy smoke and an encounter with Allied Forces(could have been either Brits or Yanks, uniforms similar).But as this segment winds down, we are essentially saying good-bye to the \"Little Tramp\" and his beautiful, mime filled world of silence/silents.From then on, Wrtier/Director Chaplin uses A Case of Mistaken Identity(The Jewish Barber & Dictator Adnoid Hynkel both=Chaplin); by God, it's the old \"Evil Twin\" plot! To this we see real-life like incidents, such as the Big Meeting of Dictators, Adenoid Hynkel & Benzino Napolini(Jack Oakie in his hilarious Parody of Benito Mussolini)and the annexation of 'Austalich'(the Austrian 'anshlucz'or union).In addition to the already mentioned Mr. Jack Oakie, we have Paulette Goddard, then Mrs. Chaplin in the Female Lead(Hannah). Also featuring Henry Daniel, Reginald Gardiner, Billy Gilbert(Herring=Herman Goering spoof), Bernard Gorcy(Leo's real life Dad), Maurice Moscavitch, Richard Alexander, Hank Mann, Leo White, Stanley \"Tiny\" Sandford,Chester Conklin, Cyril Ring, Hans Schumm and many others.Perhaps a little long for some maybe, but there is no wasted film here. Sir Charles took every opportunity to paint his Hitler parody as a buffoon, a maniac and a dangerous fool.And Chaplin, speaking as himself, wraps it all up most seriously and imparting a wish of Hope to a Crazy World. NOTE: * THE UNITED ARTISTS Corporation, founded in 1919 by Douglas Fairbanks,Mary Pickford,Charles Chaplin and D.W. Griffith.NOTE: ** With no formal training and not being able to read music, Chaplin did compose his own scores and even hit songs, \"Smile\"(from MODERN TIMES)and \"Love This Is My Song!\"(from A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG,1967 his last film).NOTE:*** 'BIG BERTHA'(in German 'Dicke Bertha',nickname the Germans had for their Model L/14 Heavy Mortar-like Howitzer.",

His previous feature, Modern Times (1936), was his most \"political\" film to date, and in that masterpiece he demonstrated how fluidly he could merge the political and the comical, turning out a \"message movie\" that went down smoothly. The same is true for much of The Great Dictator, which is a frequently hilarious film that boldly uses caricature and satire to ridicule the leading despots of the early 20th century. Even many years later than it's first appearance on the screen this movie is more updated than ever! The totalitarianism and alienation of people are now a daily reality. Like their release of Modern Times last fall, Criterion has done fantastic work with The Great Dictator, giving us a new 2K high-definition transfer taken from a combination of a 35mm fine-grain master positive and a 35mm duplicate negative. Extensive digital restoration has removed virtually all signs of age and damage without losing the image's grain structure and film like appearance. All in all, there are no complains here, or even minor quibbles, for that matter. The image is sharp, well-detailed, and beautifully rendered in gray scale, with good black levels and excellent contrast. The monaural soundtrack, transferred at 24-bit from the sound negative and digitally restored, likewise gives the film a new lease on life.

The Great Dictator was Chaplin's first sound film after he had resisted to format for over a decade. He picked quite the poignant subject matter.In The Great Dictator, Chaplin does something that, while easy to do and common today, was considered controversial in 1940. He made fun of Hitler. Believe it or not, before the US entered WW2, a lot of people were on the fence about that monster and his horrible ideology. But Chaplin understood the dangers and evil Of fascism and saw it as his duty to finally say something. The result is this film, possibly the greatest political satire ever made.Chaplin makes us laugh and think as he did in all of his other films. He was a master of making every joke have some sort of double meaning. The act might be hilarious, but the reason for the act could be depressing. Take the scene in his classic silent comedy The Gold Rush were the Tramp cooks and eats his shoe. The act and visual of a man eating his shoe is quite funny. But why is he doing that? Because he's trapped in a blizzard and is starving for food. Makes you think right? The Great Dictator is full of instances like this.Chaplin plays the double role of a Jewish barber and a Hitler stand in. Both of his individual performances are great. The rest of the cast are fun as well especially Jackie Oakie, playing the stand in for another evil man, Mussolini. Their argument is one of the funniest parts of the movie. Chaplin adds some sort of message or theme to nearly every scene in the movie. Nothing is without meaning. Chaplin took away power from these people, by laughing at them. Granted, what the Nazis did in reality is nothing to laugh at, but chaplin takes their wretched beliefs, breaks them down and laughs at them. Mel Brooks would do something similar in The Producers.On a technical level, The film is very well shot and the sets, reminiscent of silent movie sets, help give the film a lot of character. Chaplin made films that made us laugh, cry and think. So few filmmakers have the power that he possessed. No one could have made this film but him. The final speech from the film is an exhilarating piece of filmmaking. One long take of this man pouring his heart out, pleading you to stand for peace, equality and justice. Its brilliant. One of the best scenes ever filmed. If this had been Chaplin's last film then what a way to go.The Great Dictator is odd in hindsight. We weren't aware of the horrors of the Nazi death camps yet and Chaplin said that he never would have made the movie if knew of the camps. While I respect Charlies views, I'm glad he made this movie. It convinced a lot of people that Hitler was another evil dictator who only wanted conquest and to exterminate those he saw As beneath him. Chaplin's film is quite possibly the best political film ever. A technical and philosophical marvel of cinema, The Great Dictator is one of the most profound and brilliant films of all time.",

            "content": "Charles Chaplin's first sound movie might seem not very subtle work of the great auteur. At the first glance 'The Great Dictator' is a straight-up mockery of Adolf Hitler (even the character's name is not very subtle - Adenoid Hynkel), and the movie became prophetic as at the time of its production the whole extent of the terrors by Nazi regime wasn't known to the wider public. Chaplin himself later revealed that, had he known about the full extent of the horrors, he would have never made this film.'The Great Dictator' is a brilliant mixture of satire, melodrama, slapstick, and lighthearted espionage comedy. The usual Chaplin style comedy is toned down (of course there are a couple of Chaplinesque stunts like the barber diving headfirst into the bin) and the dramatic bits seem like this film could have worked as realistic drama. Satire is deep, sharp, and subtle but in the next moment, it grows blatant mockery of Adolf Hitler (which is brilliant itself). Chaplin even entered into the 'method acting' territory by learning Hitler's speech and facial expressions. The other actors seemed to take their roles in a serious manner without trying to be comical. The exception is of course the fantastic Jack Oakie as pompous dictator of Bacteria, Napaloni. These quiet performances enhanced the comical behavior of a Jewish Barber and of course, over the top insanity of Hynkel. To totally different roles - what a way to make a talkie debut.That legendary end speech. It is said that this was Chaplin's real speech. Well, it could be, but did you notice how his speech progressed to look very similar to Hynkel's (Hitler's) vigorous spouts of hate. Although Chaplin wanted to give us comforting words that the world needs more mutual respect and care but did he wanted to say something else? Like, when someone talks about love with such rage in their voice, they are equally dangerous as those who speak hate? I don't know. I guess we all can make our own assumptions. Interpretation - that is one of the great perks of good art.One thing is sure - if you don't like 'The Great Dictator' then you are an Adenoid.",

That it was wildly popular but drubbed his career and signalled his decline is depressingly predictable - this is the fate of anyone who not only sticks their head above the parapet but pole-vaults over it whistling. Not all of it works, but the dreamy slapstick is surprisingly effective and the dark overtones are jarringly arresting to say the least. That final vaunted speech still rings out like a loud scream in the night from the darkest period in modern history. When I first saw it over a decade ago I was stunned and inspired. Now hearing it, it strikes a rather different feeling, and the night after seeing it I had restless horrible dreams of what would become of this statement now and what would happen to the ones making it.",

            "review_title": "A great dictator, but merely a good movie",
            "content": "\"The Great Dictator\" is an American black-and-white movie from 1940, so this one is over 80 years old now and it is mostly in the English language. Two other languages are merely minor inclusions. The star of it all is of course Charles Chaplin, who was around the age of 50 when he wrote this, directed this and played the title character. As there is more seriousness to this film than there usually is to his works, nobody should be surprised that he was not credited as Charlie this time. The movie runs for slightly over two hours, so it is not a short film at all. It is maybe Chaplin's most known career effort as of now and as many still consider him the greatest character that film has ever seen, this means quite something. His (in terms of length) record-breaking standing ovation at the Oscars was as self-explanatory as the rating here on imdb (that currectly has the movie at #62 in the top250) and also the amount of people who saw and rated a film this old. I am not exactly sure why, but this film is/was shown in movie theaters again these days. I hope it does not have anything to do with the current political climate, especially the situation in Eastern Europe, but let us not get into that now. The biggest female character in this film was played by Paulette Goddard and it was not the first time she worked with Chaplin. Still, it must be said that everybody other than Chaplin was just a supporting player in here. He is so much at the center of it all that he even plays two key characters, one good guy and one bad guy. I will get to these a little later. I felt that at the very start when we see the World War I action this movie made it obvious that sound was still something relatively new to the movies and it looked a bit amateurish, but you cannot be mad at them if you see the year this was made. Actually, the sound got much better later on, so no hard feelings. From the technical perspective, it is also interesting how in the final speech there are references about radio and airplane being really new technological achievements, so this was surely interesting to watch from a contemporary perspective and I am sure people back then never would have expected the aviation industry to look the way it does now in 2022. And pretty much already has for decades.But back to this movie: I mentioned the final speech already. I know many think it is the greatest speech from any movie ever, but I would not agree. The contents are good and also won me over and are a really nice counterreaction to previous speeches from this film obviously. I still struggled to see the barber (who was basically pretty much the Tramp before that) give such a presentation after he barely said a word earlier in the film. It was of course all about Chaplin making a statement about tolerance in the face of current political events back then. It was not really his character speaking anymore. But I still liked this speech more than the ones earlier, but it was probably intended that those by the equivalent of Germany's leader back then were really just random rambling that was almost impossible to understand. Admittedly, that bad he was not, but it's a parody anyway. I did like some of the plays on words here. This includes the names of the people, but also in general what they came up with language-wise. My top favorite there was Garbitsch I think. Herring too of course. There was another I already forgot, but I really loved it. Don't think it was in connection to somebody's name, but something else. Anyway, also aside from that, there were many funny moments. That were closer to Chaplin's usual routine and some of it felt a bit like Three Stooges even. Look at when they were at this great parade at the stadium and Napoloni was just chewing snacks and the protagonist (and maybe we too) thought he was saying something and this is why he was moving with his mouth, but nope. Aside from that, I really, really loved the sequence with the coins inside the pudding. That was vintage Chaplin, something that could also have been part of his older short films and how the poor barber was forced to swallow one coin after the other to live was quite hilarious. Slapstick comedy galore and certainly a moment when this film deserved more than three stars out of five. This was also Chaplin's only acting nomination at the Oscars, but he lost, maybe because he refused to accept a previous award. Just like the film lost its four other nominations too, including Oakie for playing Napoloni and Best Picture.Another aspect that also felt more like the old Chaplin was surely the story with the girl, wird Goddard's character. There is no really explicit romance included here to make sure the attention is not drawn away from the politics aspect, but a running gag like the woman hitting a soldier on the head with a pan was quite old-school. Also some weird moments were included that did not do too much for me, like Hynkel's strange noises when he was drooling over a secretary or something. When the film made fun of Hitler through substance, it was good. But this was not always the case. We even get a little lesson in political power through the idea from Garbitsch that Hynkel should sit higher than his Italian errr. Bacterian counterpart. This results in a battle pretty much eventually and both rise really high. Felt like countries trying to beat each other in terms of who has can come up with the highest skyscraper. There was another funny quote in this film when I think it was Garbitsch again who brought Hynkel some bad news that included two derogatory statements about Hynkel and it was entertaining how Hinkel disapproved of one, but the other he even emphasized in a way that as if it could not have been any more true and this was depicted in a way where we should think it was not intentional, but that he was just pretty stupid. I think the end ot let's say the last 25-30 minutes I did not like too much. It all went too fast maybe. I mean look at how all of a sudden the barber ends up there giving the speech and how the actual dictator was caught by some other guys and he is out of the film. Felt surely random. In an attempt to still divert a bit attention from himself, Chaplin then let another character have the final words of the movie. Nonetheless, it was all about his speech of course in this film that was released during the days of World War II.Also I was surprised how often they used the term \"storm troopers\" here. Has a fantasy or video game tone to it. I mean it is of course accurate, but even I in my mid/late 30s am somebody who associates the English word for this with the likes of Star Wars or Dune rather. A bit embarrassing. My bad. Oh yes, of course there is also talk about the ideal of strong male with light hair and how it really contradicts the way the title character looked himself. One of the biggest absurdities ever. Concentration camps do not play a big role here as it was not particularly known what was going on or about to go on. One of the darkest chapters in the history of mankind. Ah yes, Austria is Osterlich, one of the less impressive plays on words. Pity I really cannot remember the other one. Was it the alternative term for fascism? I'm not sure. Another aspect I certainly have to mention here is the music. There were two inclusions especially that I really adored. One was Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5 and the other a version of Valse Triste played during a dance sequence in the second half. Really great, you can find these on Youtube of course too as part of the film/soundtrack because of how famous it is. Some entertaining moments went on for a little longer and others were really brief like the one when we see two painters try their best to come up with a portrait of this utterly despicable historic figure. They must be quick. Oh and Pretzelberg is a nice name for a village too. Actually sounds a lot like Prenzlauer Berg.Some more brainstorming: I must say the other politican (obviously Mussolini's equivalent) being called Napaloni confused me a bit with Napoleon/France initially, but of course the name was no coincidence. The ways in which characters died while trying to come forward with new technology (yep, bulletproof was special back then!) was okay in terms of comedy. What was sweeter was the female protagonist finding herself pretty and telling the barber that he could look decent too if he tried more. The latter's reaction to that was so Chaplinesque really, the expression I mean. There was not a lot of talking from the barber as I stated. The sequence at the start inside the plane... well I did not find it too funny, but it was also handled with expertise like almost everything else in this film and it all depends on your individual taste anyway which sequences you like the most. The grenade part early on also did not impress me too much, but I am glad the barber survived because otherwise the film would have been over too quickly. Oh now I know finally, the play on words I was thinking about that is maybe even better than \"Garbitsch\". Of course I mean \"Pfuirer\" instead of \"Fuehrer\". I found this so funny the first moment I read it. Yep, watched the original with German subtitles. So yeah, this is it then. I think this film surely deserves a thumbs-up all in all and you can go watch it. If you haven't already. I am not sure if it is my favorite from Chaplin, but I am generally not as big on him as many others are anyway, but I surely enjoyed the outcome and it is definitely among the best I have seen from him. And I have seen a lot. So don't worry if you do not know any of the other cast members here (except Goddard maybe, if at all). This does not have a negative impact on the film. It is all about the (dialogue) writing and Chaplin's performance. This is it. Positive recommendation here was never in doubt, even if it is also not a super enthusiastic \"go watch\" I am screaming out into the world this time.",

I guess that's more power to the artistry of Chaplin.  \"The Great Dictator\" is obvious in it's sadness since it was done in 1940, and the movie finishes with such hope but looking back from our \"modern times\" we all know that there were five more miserable years of Nazi facism, concentration camps, and misery.This is obviously a great propaganda piece, but there's much more to it than something like Olivier's jingoistic \"Henry V\" (another excellent film of the period).  What I find refershing is how perceptive Chaplin is in his speech at the end to unite all religions and races etc.  Sadly enough it sounds dated to our \"modern\" ears, sort of like John Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" must sound in this era of right-wing talk-radio pundits pushing \"compassionate conservatism.\"  PS -- There's so much in this film that's eternal it's awkward reading some of the misinformation in the reviews, and people whining about the costumes or whatever.  For instance, in the review from Aug 12, 2000 that they are using as the only review on the front page of IMDB.  It wasn't the Hynkel/Dictator who was \"endearing\" in the gun & upside-down aeroplanes.  I thought it was obvious that was the barber, who after his antics as a soldier crashed with Schultz and had amnesia.",

            "content": "Charles Chaplin's The Great Dictator is a political statement wrapped in a comedy with a little bit of drama here and there. It is not his best work, but I would definitely recommend it to Chaplin fans. I feel that Charlie Chaplin was at his most powerful in his silent films. Here, he seems a little unsure of himself, in terms of balancing acts that he could pantomime with verbal jokes. Don't get me wrong, there is some hilarious dialog in this movie. It is not short on laughs by any means, but Chaplin's best films had a brilliant sense of balance to them, a balance between drama and comedy that few have ever been able to match. It is a very good movie, but, unfortunately I don't feel it matches up against Chaplin's best, although, I can't think of many films that do! What this film does have going for it, and it has quite a bit going for it, is another brilliant performance from Charles Chaplin. Only this time, aside from his spectacular physical comedy, Chaplin proves he also knows how to deliver his lines with a comedic timing that is every-bit as precise as his pantomime. The highlights are the brilliant dance with the globe and the powerful, moving speech that Chaplin gives at the end of the film. His performance as Adenoid Hynkel, a biting satire of Adolf Hitler, is so off-the-wall, so silly that it accomplishes exactly what Chaplin sought out to do - to make the world laugh at Hitler, to rob him of his power. Mel Brooks would do a fine job of defaming Hitler twenty-eight years later in his hilarious debut film, The Producers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this movie (that isn't expressed in the speech at the end), it's that laughter can sometimes be the best medicine. While no one can ever undo the atrocities that Hitler exposed the world to, we can survive, as long as we have our ideals and our sense of humor.",

Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring Osterlich whilst finding time for numerous, oddly flat set-pieces. The dictator's much-celebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded, underwhelming and unfunny.Chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon Hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid - his much-maligned final speech is actually the bold, memorable highlight of the piece - but the film simply isn't sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it, nor to demand repeated viewings. The best gags are away from Hynkel's tiresome posturing and involve The Barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb (a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop.Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory, whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and The Great Dictator certainly ranks as such.",

Until watching it, I only knew of it's fame. Now I know how much the film deserves it.The film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short-fused and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his near and dear staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. Also, it entails the exploits of an amnesiac, emotional and often clumsy Jewish barber, a veteran of the First World War.Stopping with the plot, I would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful. While the comedy is decidedly both verbal and slapstick and incidental, the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a theme with various interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills range far and wide in the film, he keeps revving it up and up until he simply explodes. Paulette Goddard's position as an ambitious Jewish would-be revolter and Henry Daniell's delivery of a nasal, calm-as-Death-serious-as-a-heart-attack lines makes for wonderful viewing.Further, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it pulls no punches.

Second, and more importantly, it was a brave and ahead of its time condemnation of Nazi Germany.Chaplin has been called the master of slapstick, and The Great Dictator doesn't disappoint in the comedy department. Take the opening World War I battle. Chaplin finds himself wandering through smoke until he finally comes out alongside other soldiers. But wait, these are enemy soldiers. Chaplin drops his gun, exclaims, \"Pardon me!\" and runs away. Or when he makes his escape with Schutlz and their plane is inadvertently rolled upside down. Chaplin observes his watch dangling up and nonchalantly comments, \"We seem to be defying the laws of gravity.\"But what has truly made The Great Dictator so timeless was its scathing criticism of Nazi Germany. The movie began production in the late 1930's while the US was still at peace with Hitler, and in fact it was released more than a year before the US entered the war. Condemning Nazism was taboo, and Chaplin, a Jew himself, was only able to make the movie because of creative and financial independence. In fact, Chaplin put $1.5 million of his own money into the project, and this was at a time when it couldn't be shown in some places due to \"neutrality.\" Needless to say the film didn't have the best box office prospects, but that only stands as a testament to Chaplin, a man more interested in artistic expression and fighting injustice than the bottom line.Modern studios should take note; it became Chaplin's highest grossing film.8.5/10",

I'd consider this Chaplin's finest film precisely because it is so brave, boldly taking a stance against a very real threat and using its comedy to send a message of love for all humanity at a time when the world needed it the most, and would soon need it even more. Its satire is used in a number of ways: to lampoon dictatorships, as well as a certain someone in particular; to heighten the ultimately ridiculous and power-hungry motives of its targeted regimes; and to create sympathy for those being unjustly persecuted. It is comedy that works on many levels and the balance between the usual slapstick 'Chaplin' style with the more pointed satirical stuff is a usually deft one. The flick brings everyone down to the same level and never seems mean-spirited. It makes sure to include some darker elements, though, so as not to make light of the situation entirely. Indeed, its slapstick asides do ever-so-often seem slightly too immature compared to its real darkness and on-point political themes. This is never a true problem, however, and the sequences in question don't last for too long, while also serving a purpose. There are some jokes that cut too close to the bone, though - since they sometimes have a startling and sobering accuracy, unseen when they were first made. These are impossible to laugh at nowadays, unlike the more general jokes which can be taken for what they are despite the gravity generally associated with them. The piece also takes somewhat of a slow detour towards its final movement, during which time the heart of the story is sort of lost. However, this flick still resonates strongly today. Its timeless message is told with an endearing execution, whether that be through its direct final speech or through its layered satire. The film has a point and makes tells it well, actually feeling incredibly important. It's just as impactful 78 years after its release, perhaps more so. It is also an interesting historical study about using your medium to take a stand, even if everyone else tells you not to. 9/10",

The final speech by the Jewish barber is the crowning glory of this movie. The greatest words ever spoken and ever heard by the human species. The collective aspirations of humanity through the ages crystallized into a wonderful speech, is sure to render one speechless. A speech that is a judgment and an indictment of all that has gone wrong in the world. The movie is a spoof on Hitler and his Nazi party. The insanity of his times and the helplessness of the people in the face of such evil, makes this movie even more ominous. A speech that seeks to chart out the future course of human progress, only if humanity and her uncaring leaders care to listen.",

            "content": "Chaplin's movies are not really in my line, but with The Great Dictator he has earned my everlasting respect and my great admiration. When watching this movie one should remember that the people parodied in it were at the time of its release very, very much in power and that they had powerful friends in all countries. Yes, it must have been a tremendously courageous act. Mr Chaplin risked his name and possibly large parts of his wealth by doing The Great Dictator and I believe that it was honestly made out of idealism.The use of sound is outstanding. The ideas for it seem to come from the silent era: careful, very good choice of musical scores, the creation of funny situations by special sound effects. The dialogs are wooden, there is hardly any really meaningful exchange. But then there are Chaplin's monologs. His imitation of the German language is funny and at the same time chilling. Amazing how well he caught the rhythm and speech-pattern of that foreign tongue \u0096 I guess for him it was all a kind of music.In a strange way Chaplin reveals himself to be an Englishman at heart. The use of sound in The Great Dictator reminded me strongly of British Comedies from the Ealing Studios, the Goons show, Monty Python. Somehow they all seem to stand in the same cultural tradition. It was just amazing to hear how English his voice sounds when he makes his final speech (and who had heard Chaplin talk before?). The speech really comes from the heart and is very powerful and moving. It is a strange internationalistic frontal attack against modernism as a whole, the very economical eruption he owed his wealth and popularity to. Just compare it with a song of his compatriot: John Lennon's Imagine.There may be flaws in this movie (the beginning is confusing, Paulette Goddard seems somewhat lost, the storyline is sketchy), but the terrific performance of Chaplin \u0096 who even had the greatness to let himself play literally against the wall by a fellow comedian: Jack Oakie as Benzino Napaloni \u0096 more than compensates for them. It's wonderful to watch Charlie move. Such elegance and agility! And he was over fifty, the same age as Adolf Hitler.",

            "review_title": "The Chaplin six pack",
            "content": "This is a brief review of Charlie Chaplin's last six feature films.A comical take on Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927), Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" opens with the words \"a story of industry and individual enterprise, humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness!\", an ironic jab at the mantras of industrial capitalism. The film then finds Chaplin reprising his iconic role as \"the tamp\", a poverty-stricken but lovable outcast whose ill-fitting clothes epitomise, amongst other things, his inability to fit in.The film watches as the tramp struggles to survive in a depressed economy. Like \"Metropolis\", it satirises labour, management and dehumanising working conditions. Elsewhere life for the worker is seen to be precarious, alternatives to playing the game are but death or prison, giant clocks speak to the daily grid of blue-collar workers, bosses are shown to be obsessed with speed and production, the property class relies on police brutality and all-encompassing surveillance, and the workplace itself is painted as an absurdest torture chamber. The film ends with the tramp on a road, America's future uncertain.\"Modern Times\" made waves when it was released. It was banned in fascist Germany and Italy, then allies of the West, and scorned by those in power in the United States. It was also heavily praised in the Soviet Union and France, particularly by philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merlau-Pony. The film's middle section, which featured Chaplin waving a red flag and unwittingly leading communists and worker unions, would get Chaplin on several government watch-lists.Chaplin followed \"Times\" with \"The Great Dictator\". Hollywood studios wanted the film scuttled, so Chaplin financed it himself. It contains two criss-crossing plots, one about a Jewish barber who is essentially persecuted by Nazis, the other about a brutal dictator, a stand in for Adolf Hitler. Funny, scary and sad, the film would rock the US establishment. Hitler was, at the time, a US ally and good for business. What's more, he was viewed by those in power as a tool to destroy communist Russia. For many, Chaplin was a \"subverisive\" who was \"inciting war with an ally\". Deemed particularly offencive was a last act speech in which Chaplin urges the people of the world to \"love one another\", \"throw away international barriers\" and foster an \"international brotherhood\". Though deliberately vague, this speech was viewed as inflammatory. Was Chaplin extolling the virtues of the United States or the Soviet Union? Regardless, the US' approach to the conflicts in Europe promptly shifted. It became an ally with Russia, Hitler became the enemy and Germany attacked Russia. In the blink of an eye, \"Dictator\" went from being sacrilege to prophetic.Chaplin, British, was born into extreme poverty and often found himself sleeping on the streets of London. As such, he identified with his \"tramp\" character completely, as did millions word-wide, who saw themselves in the tramp: desolate, poor and forever bumbling down life's highways. Prior to shooting \"Times\", Chaplin would embark on a tour of the world, intent on seeing the effects of poverty. He'd talk to many prominent figures, most notably Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, Einstein and Gandhi.As Chaplin grew in consciousness, so would FBI files on Chaplin. He was put under government surveillance and forced to appear before a Senate subcommittee in 1941 where he was accused of being \"anti American\" and an \"unofficial communist\". Many newspapers, including the Times, began a campaign attacking Chaplin, and called for his deportation. In the mid 1940s he was charged with the Mann Act and the FBI would collude with newspapers to smear Chaplin as a sex maniac who \"perverted American culture\". From here on, conservative political pressure groups would attack each new Chaplin release. Some of his films would be boycotted or outright banned. In 1947 he'd be brought before the HUAC committee.Chaplin followed \"Dictator\" up with \"Monsieur Verdoux\". A black comedy, the idea for which came from Orson Welles, the films stars Chaplin as a bank clerk who loses his job and so murders women for cash and land. The film's point is explicit: if war is an extension of diplomacy, then murder is the logical extension of business. And so banking terminology is used to rationalise murder, weapons manufactures are idolised and the poor are condemned for trying to play by the rules of the wealthy. \"Numbers sanctify!\" Chaplain says, pointing to Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the ruthlessness of post-war capitalism; kill millions and you're a hero.Next came \"Limelight\", Chaplin's ode to silent film. Elegiac and autobiographical, the film stars Chaplin and the legendary Buster Keaton as two fading comedians. A meditation on time's passing, the film's also relentlessly optimistic; man must assert his will, his desires, no matter how glum the times! The film would be banned from several US theatres. Chaplin himself was swiftly banned from entering the US and several of his assets were seized. He'd live in Switzerland henceforth.\"A King In New York\" followed. It finds Chaplin playing an usurped \"dictator\" who seeks refuge in America. Also autobiographical, the film pokes fun at various aspects of US culture, its irrational hatred of all things left-wing and the way in which humans are both always branding and refuse to look beyond the political, beyond superficial branding, to tolerate even the slightest bit of difference or dissent. Chaplin's son would play a hilarious anarcho-communist, but the film as whole messily mixed silent gags with sound comedy.Chaplin's \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" confirms that Chaplin's films were moving from the lower to the upper echelons of society. Here Sophia Loren plays a Russian \"tramp\" who is taken in by a wealthy politician (Marlon Brando). His worst feature, the film watches as \"humane\" capitalism benevolently absorbs the \"detritus\" of Russia and Asia. Chaplin accepted an honorary Oscar in 1972. He received the longest standing ovation in Oscar history.9.5/10 - See the slightly superior \"Duck Soup\".",

Charlie Chaplin was the first person brave enough to insult Hitler's overblown ego, and also the first to speak out against his wrongs.Chaplin once again proves to be a very energetic comedian, while at the same time doing it with the deadpan style of the silent days. He also gives us a ton of wonderful, well thought out and timed gags, showing us why he's the greatest comedian who ever lived. And he mixes all that with a heartwarming romance and social commentary, which fully proves his genius.Like I said before, this also shows us what life was like for Jews back then, while brilliantly avoiding being too depressing. It's been said that Charlie Chaplin wouldn't have made this movie had he known about the full extent of Hitler's crimes against humanity, this is still a respectful satire of the situation. It never makes too light of the situation, except for maybe a joke about a gas that can kill everyone (I bet Chaplin especially regretted that joke after learning about everything). Another thing I loved about this was the famous speech at the end. It was so epic, heartfelt and inspiring that it made me want to march right up to Hitler and kill him myself. Except, uh, I guess it's a little too late for that. But the speech was still epic.I recommend this to any fan of Charlie Chaplin and anybody who enjoys good political satire.",

All of Chaplin's classic slapstick routines and physical humor are there but there is also satirical humor involved. Chaplin's works double duty playing a Jewish barber similar to \"The Little Tramp\" character and Adenoid Hynkel, who is a character making fun of Adolf Hitler.The Great Dictator had a lot of complex shots and camera-work for example the opening scene is a long single take following the movement of soldiers through a maze of trenches. The Great Dictator was a very important film because it was dealing with a serious issue at the time. While Chaplin was playing Adenoid Hynkel, Adolf Hitler was in power in Germany and The United States was two years away from ending its neutrality and entering into World War II. In Chaplin's ending monologue he sort of breaks from the character of the Jewish barber and preaches a beautiful and personal message of hope and democracy.",

            "content": "Chaplin's films are like the ocean. The surface seems calm and unaltered, yet a great shift is stirring up underneath, the surface changing only when the powerful undercurrent is in full swing.So it is that \"The Great Dictator\" (1940) is a part of this sea-change that finds Chaplin on a path to the apotheosis I'd place in \"Limelight\" (1952). No longer similarly spirited like Chaplin's earlier comedies, or the middle period of the late 1920s and 1930s, Chaplin is persistently moving toward a new kind of cinema already emerging in \"Modern Times\" (1935).His transition to sound unquestionably had much to do with it. He had to let the Tramp go. Thus The Great Dictator marks a watershed in a filmography already brimming with turning points. I'd say this is where \"late Chaplin\" truly begins, Modern Times being a kind of transitory film. And as I've stated, this is not only a superficial transformation but a deeper development also in what he perceives as cinematic, funny and tragic. Surely Chaplin's films have always had that sinuously sad and dark undersong, commingled with the more apparently comical, as he was himself quick to point out,[1] yet it finds its maturity in this later period.Seeing The Great Dictator after World War II and its aftermath is like reading James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) after almost a hundred years of literary criticism and analysis. It's so pregnant with cultural meaning(s) assigned to it that it's quite impossible to watch it not through the prism of history. But I think it's important to remember that this was filmed in the late 1930s, and as Chaplin would famously muse, he had no idea of the full extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime against the jews and others.The film, then, stands in the anteroom to either history or fiction. Yet I can't help but see it as at its core as a kind of Chaplinesque fantasy, where the battle of good and evil is personified in the two doppelg\u00e4ngers.[2] The evil was not hard to find at all, yet neither was the good: it was the Tramp, of course, who, thanks to the advent of sound, is morphed into the Jewish barber.As such, The Great Dictator is a superb achievement. Its place in not only film history but world history actually works in its favor, accentuating the comedy with the tragic and the tragic with the comic. It's a work of precision, intelligence and, characteristic of Chaplin's genius, deep wisdom. Has there ever been a filmmaker who has understood us better than him? I think it's immensely useful to approach The Great Dictator as a dyadic exploration. On story level, there's the good versus evil contradistinction; technically there's the constant discourse between the silent and sound eras, which presents itself not only visually or in sounds, but also in how sound and what is seen become an integral element of the story, a kind of continuation of City Lights. Chaplin has such extensive fun on Hitler's expense in the public monologues that I wonder whether, in Michael Wood's words, \"he may in part be using speech to remind us of the beauties of silence.\"[3] In the story there's some drastic and some very subtle use of undercranking, as befits 1910s, the silent era, the film starts with.[4] We're extremely lucky, by the way, to have the Criterion Collection putting these out on Blu-ray. Everything they've released so far from Chaplin has been immaculate.FOOTNOTES: [1] \"The Gold Rush\" (1925), for example, was inspired by the Donner party tragedy, as recounted by Chaplin in \"Mr. Chaplin Answers His Critics,\" from The New York Times, 27 October, 1940. On page 18 in the booklet for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray.[2] \"Just think,\" Chaplin would say, \"he's the madman, I'm the comic. But it could have been the other way around.\" In \"My Father, Charlie Chaplin\" by Charles Chaplin, Jr.[3] Michael Wood, \"The Joker and the Madman,\" on page 8 of the booklet for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release.[4] As pointed out by Dan Kamin and Hooman Mehran in the audio commentary for the Criterion Collection edition.",

Even though Hollywood had moved to talkies in the late 20s, it would take Chaplin almost two decades to do the same with this film. The Great Dictator was filmed as a criticism against the oppression of the Jews rampant in Germany at the time. Chaplin plays a dual role as both Adenoid Hynkel, the megalomaniac dictator of the proud nation of Tomainia, and as a Jewish barber who lost his memory during World War One, and who's return home is soured by the marching stormtroopers.The film was a huge hit upon its release. And why not. If nothing else, it's brilliant propaganda against the onslaught of Nazism. That being said, I'm not personally all that impressed by it.The biggest problem I see with the film is the fact that Chaplin is still so clearly tied to his roots in silent film. The film is more of a collection of sketches than a proper story. Many of these sketches have no dialogue, being nothing more than an excuse for Chaplin to prance around, showing off his athletic skills and funny expressions.Not to say there's no content or depth to be found. The film's message against oppression is a strong one and whenever the film takes time out of Chaplin's prancing to tell a story, it tells it well. And the final speech at the end given by the barber is very powerful, speaking of hope and the triumph of good will over evil.If only the rest of the film could have been like that.But that the biggest flaw with Chaplin. His movies are rather alike and he's very fond of his tricks and mannerisms. The Great Dictator is an important film historically, but as a modern cinema experience it leaves a lot to be desired.",

            "content": "\"The Great Dictator\" is Charlie Chaplin's film set in the fictional country of Tomania, which is analogous to Germany prior to and during the rise of the Nazi party. Chaplin successfully blended humor with anti-fascist social commentary to produce a great film.Chaplin himself has a double role in the film. First, he is Adenoid Hynkel, who represents Adolf Hitler. Chaplin manages to make his representation of the nefarious dictator highly amusing. He also plays another role as a Jewish barber subjected to the repressive policies of Hynkel. The other performances in the film were excellent as well, and Jack Oakie deserves particular note as the showy and blunt Benzini Napaloni, representing Benito Mussolini.The film starts by showing Tomania in World War I, and there are some amusing scenes here before the end of the war and the rise of Hynkel. Hynkel is shown in a scene that mocks the platform speeches of Hitler. Admittedly I didn't find the speech shouted in mock German particularly amusing, although it was amusing how the Goebbels and Goering equivalents were named \"Garbitsch\" and \"Herring\".After the platform speech, this film gains a lot of momentum. There is a variety of humor, including funny physical comedy scenes like the \"globe\" scene and the portrayal of Hynkel's routine. There was a lot of great comedic dialogue too, some of which is darkly humorous given the full historical context. When this film isn't funny, it remains interesting with its anti-fascist message through depictions of repressions of Jewish people by Storm Troopers. The film's score is appropriate in both the comedic and political scenes. Chaplin's final plea against fascism at the film's end remains deeply moving and has lost none of its potency. The Great Dictator\" remains strong as a comedy film and a political message.",

            "content": ". . . during his outrageous speech which destroys the narrative flow at the close of THE GREAT DICTATOR? If L.A.'s Rodney King had yanked the mike from Hitler during the 1938 Nuremberg Rally and pleaded \"Please, folks, can't we just all get along?\" would that have prevented 100 million people from dying in WWII? Hynkel blathers \"the Soul of Man has been given wings.\" Mostly mute Lucky, in Samuel Beckett's 1953 masterwork, WAITING FOR GODOT, begins one of the great speeches in the English language, \"Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattman of a personal God Quaquaquaqua with a white beard Quaquaquaqua outside time without extension\" . . . (My ellipse) \"who can doubt it will fire the firmament that is to say blast hell to heaven so blue still and calm.\" Hynkel continues, \"He's flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope.\" Lucky adds, \"in a word I resume flying gliding golf over nine and eighteen holes tennis of all sorts in a word for reasons unknown in Feckham Peckham Fulham Clapham.\" Hynkel finishes up, \"The glorious future--that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us: Look up, Hannah, look up!\" Lucky concludes, \"I resume alas alas abandoned unfinished the skull the skull in Connemara in spite of the tennis the skull alas the stones Cunard . . . tennis . . . the stones . . . so calm . . . Cunard . . . unfinished . . . \" Okay, if I had to MEMORIZE one of these speeches to save my life, I would go for Hynkel's (even though it's probably a little longer than Lucky's). But which speech makes the most sense, disrupts the flow of its (screen)play the least, and best represents the \"real world\"? Why don't you copy both out in \"long hand\" in their entirety (as my class had to for Senior Dramatics), and decide for yourself.",

This film absolutely stunned me, Chaplin, wrote, directed, produced and played the lead role in 'The Great Dictator' and dear god did he do a good job. In terms of acting, Chaplin is just unbelievable. There is an incredible combination of silent and spoken performance, and it evokes both extreme laughter and sadness. One can easily the remnants of his silent career in this and his mannerisms, his physical acting is hilarious. The speech at the end of the film is probably the best I've ever seen in any film, his delivery is just incredible, its thought provoking and full of emotion. Chaplin is just the absolute maestro some of the clowns who perform nowadays should most definitely take heed, individually I've never seen a comic performance or dramatic performance that good, but together, its left me speechless, I actually can't convey how good he was in words.Script wise, its again just fantastic. The characters' names to start with are hilarious (herring and garbage being my favourite) whilst the absolute nonsense he spouts when speaking German is also very good. There is also silliness but with such close attention to detail, most notably, I thought, was checking his tie in the bald man's shining head or the ridiculous moments where he goes into to be sculpted or painted before dashing out again a few seconds later. The speech at the end is legendary. This is quite seriously worthy of some great politician and its deliverance, as I have said, was outstanding.I can't really think of anything else to say and I actually feel as though I haven't even nearly done justice to this piece of cinema. It must go down as one of the greatest films ever made.",

That ending can come off as overly idealistic as a result, but it is still an effectively written and amazingly acted sequence.As for the rest of the movie, it's mostly really good. There's some great comedy (the funniest scenes are the ones that feel like they are from a silent comedy, like the WW1 opening, the globe scene, the shaving scene, and the scene with the coins in the pudding), and the comedic moments are fairly well balanced amongst the more serious moments (and it does contain much more drama than Chaplin's other features from the 20s and 30s).It might be a little long, with some sequences in the film's second half dragging. Also, I feel like more could've been done with the premise of a Jewish barber being mistaken for a fascist dictator, as it really only happens towards the end of the movie to allow that final scene to happen. But given that that ending is very memorable, it's largely forgivable.",

            "content": "With war raging in Europe and only a matter of time before America's entrance Charlie Chaplin took it upon himself to go where other moguls feared to tread with this courageous satirical broadside. The Great Dictator does not mince words with its comic evisceration of Adolf Hitler and his Fascist cronies. It is a savage mock-up in which only Chaplin alone could make a comic moment out of the fascist lynching of a Jew without devaluing the impact of the film's firm indictment and condemnation.The film opens on a World War l battlefield with Charlie evoking his 1918 Shoulder Arms silent character manning Big Bertha. He suffers battle fatigue and is sent to a sanitarium to recuperate. Meanwhile Dictator Adenoid Hynkel capitalizes on his country's economic woes by scapegoating the Jews (and after them the brunettes). The vet unable to comprehend the passing of time returns to civilian life and his job as a Jewish Barber, unaware of his country's moral deconstruction. Hynkel continues to lust for world power while the Barber is brought up to speed by cruel storm troopers when fate intervenes.This timely and absurdist black comedy on the eve of WW ll might be the finest piece of Hollywood political activism in Tinsel Town history. Chaplin could have easily stayed out of the argument but chose instead to wade in not with some prepared statement or sit down protest but with the full weight of his prodigious talent resulting in a motion picture that sits between Duck Soup and Dr. Strangelove in displaying the brilliance of satiric Voltarian discourse by way of Mack Sennett.Chaplin's script and Hynkel's portrayal along with fellow cronies is devastatingly funny and demeaning reducing them to comic buffoons; removing their Conrad Veidt to vanquish them from another angle. Hynkel is a vainglorious Moe and Chaplin cuts him to the quick with a comic jabber and an unsettling but balletic display of lust for power. Henry Daniel as Garbige is chillingly serious and persuasive in mock contrast to funny but a bit over the top Billy Gilbert's Herring and Jack Oakie's Napaloni, though Mussolini newsreels from the era reveal not by much.Chaplin does get overly preachy during the climax and it deflects from the no holds barred style of the humor and pace somewhat but overall it is a brave and audacious piece of film making in which someone can so powerfully assimilate pain and laughter without diluting the impact of either.",

TGD is a flawed work, sure. It's too long and its political commentary is heavy-handed. Some of the jokes are too corny for their own good. But there are some great comic sequences, mostly involving the temperamental dictator Hynkel. His antics with the Mussolini stand-in are worth the two hour run time.Many have criticized the ending speech, saying it feels tacked on or that the barber character was not eloquent enough to make up something like that, let alone on the spot the way he did. It's never felt that discordant to me, though. The speech is so humane and brilliant; my suspension of disbelief isn't stretched too much when those ideas come from the little barber.This isn't Chaplin's masterpiece (Modern Times (1936) was his last great film, in my opinion), but its messages of peace and tolerance have kept it relevant through the decades.",

The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer.

It is interesting to compare this performance with the versions of Saddam Hussein presented in modern films(like say \"Hot Shots\"); again a dictator is portrayed as a pathetic, comical figure with a high-pitched voice.

The interesting part of the evolution of this film was the fact that shooting began in 1937, but as times and history changed over a three year period some of those same pros had become cons and vice-versa. It was also Chaplin's first full-audio, full-talking film. Regardless, the film is ahead of its time. It did touch on many sensibilities and it did create a fervor of backlashThe comedy seemed a little stiff and forced, but the point is there. Chaplin claims, when he began making this film, that he didn't really know much about the extent of the terrible atrocities that the Nazis had done and felt all he really was doing was making fun of a really bad guy. You can definitely see how good of a craftsman Chaplin was with his filmmaking and you can see how painstakingly it was for him to put together a movie that took over three years to finish.This may have been a problem too, considering the 125 minute run time does bring on the drag a little, but, all in all, an excellent addition to the history of film and to the world.

Charlie made great use of these new fangled talking movies, but he still had the great physical comedy which made him famous with his hundreds of silent films. While this movie is great as a comedy, it is even better politicly.  Anybody watching this movie should realize that it was made in 1940, so the Nazi party had yet to be uncovered for what we see it as today.  Because of this, Chaplin's views were way ahead of their time, and in a way, he was taking a serious risk standing up for the millions of Jews that were being persecuted during this time. In short, this film is the best example of satire humor I can think of.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially for someone that knows anything about Nazi Germany, Hitler, or the Holocaust.  I would also recommend it for classroom use for students studying the WWII period.  One final thought: To anyone who plans to watch this for the first time, pay special attention to Chaplin's speech towards the end of the movie.  I think if Adolf Hitler had sat through the whole movie and saw that speech, even he could be converted to a humanitarian.  Cheers!",

            "content": "For being made at the very hight of World War 2, The Great Dictator is an extremely brave film. It could have only been made if enough passion and commitment was present to see it through. Luckily for us, Chaplin had this and so much more. He was sure he could make a film for the people of the world and those suffering from the chaos of the war. Chaplin set out to make fun of perhaps the most evil man of all time, (Adolf Hitler) an extremely hard task, but one he pulled off massively well.The Great Dictator is effective in its message even today, it seems a safe distance away from the war to make fun of Hitler and his fellow evil dictators. However, when trying to understand just how much of a risk this film was to make in 1939 it seems extraordinary. When the film was released in 1940 it was extremely successful commercially and critically, despite being banned in many countries around the world. Hitler at that time was becoming the most powerful and dangerous person in the world, millions were scared of even slightly offending him. So when a film like The Great Dictator came out, one that made Hitler look like a joke of a man, it was a huge world statement. One that stood up for all that was still good in the world.Much had been said about the similar appearances of both Chaplin and Hitler. They were two people on opposite ends of the world spectrum. They were in fact born on the same year, of the same month, in the same week. However one was a man that gave hope and laughter to millions of people around the world, and one was a monster that would be the cause of millions of innocent deaths. The Nazis even published statements about Chaplin, calling him an \"evil Jewish clown.\" This was partly the reason Chaplin decided to fight back, and he did so in the way he knew best, by making one magnificent film.The Great Dictator was above all a statement of freedom and democracy at a harsh and frightening time in history. It was a lone voice at speaking out against a big bully. We see Chaplin's version of Hitler, Adenoid Hynkel constantly mess up and show himself to be a hollow and empty man. One of no love and little seriousness. As someone that just wants the entire world, nothing more, nothing less. Someone that we could only feel hatred towards and someone to be laughed at. Even as Hynkel gives an angry and aggressive speech to a huge audience he looks ridiculous. His hollow anger even results in microphones bending away from him and spinning around like cartoons. He constantly trips or is knocked over like a child by bigger people. At one point he even struggles to pull apart a plate of cooked spaghetti with his hands, showing just how weak he really is.The films cartoon portray of this Hitler-like dictator may seem wrong or even offensive to some people effected by the war. However, I feel certain people miss the point with the film. Sometimes the best way to get by in hard times is with laughter. Laughter can sometimes be the most powerful weapon humans have in this world, Chaplin understood this as he had already shown in film such as The Gold Rush or Modern Times. He connected comedy and tragedy very closely and was the master at showing how one could defeat the other. Chaplin used comedy in The Great Dictator to genius effect, and made an extremely evil man look just a little less intimidating, which was certain to have helped the spirits of millions around the world \u2013 even if just a little.One thing that was criticised in The Great Dictator was the films final speech by Chaplin. He seems to step out of his character in the film and address the world as a doppelganger of Hynkel but as Chaplin. He speaks passionately about world freedom and the bitterness of dictators, he encourages soldiers to take stand, to not be treated as machines but as men. Critics have said that this step out of character is confusing and disorientating, I think they are completely wrong. Why not end a film of such importance in a plead for freedom, why not give people hope in the human race and why not speak from your heart at such a hopeless time. The speech Chaplin gives is beautiful and passionate, love burns off his every word \u2013 even if this is at the expense of 4 minutes out of character.Asides from its message, the film is home to some well written characters and some classic slapstick set-pieces, the kind that only Chaplin could do so well. The films music is both touchingly sad and brightly comical, it is well worth watching just to hear. There are some lovely tracking shots and some wonderfully detailed set designs. The films black and white photography is beautiful to see along with its silent-era styled editing and pacing.The Great Dictator is a great place to start if you wish to explore Chaplin's filmography as a director, again he puts his heart and sole into every process of its filmmaking. Even by today's standards its message is relevant. The Great Dictator shows that sometimes the only way to battle evil in the world is to laugh at it. It may prove to not be much, however it could feel your spirit with the hope it needs to carry on.",

            "content": "Plot: In Tomainia during the war, a Jewish barber then soldier saves a general's life only to awake later in a hospital, suffering from amnesia. Now ready to go back to his civil life, he is totally unaware of the new situation for his people, the Jews: not only are they permanently persecuted, but also gathered in ghettos. Fast he experiences it, and he fortunately is protected by Schutz, a prominent dignitary of the militia. This does not last since Schutz is soon dismissed of his functions and hide at the barber's. Both end up arrested and sent to a concentration camp. Meanwhile, at the other side of the social ladder, tyrant Adenoid Hynkel \u0096 the perfect look-alike of the Jewish barber \u0096 is relentlessly directing his country to the war, and appease people's anger in balancing Jews persecution and the project of invading Osterlich. When he learns that Napoloni, the head of Bacteria, is also ready to invade Osterlich begins hard negotiation, which ultimately lead to sign an agreement not to invade this country, which of course Hynkel won't respect. But as he fishes near the concentration camp where the Jewish barber is arrested, Hayken is mistaken for the latter who had just escaped with Schutz and is sent to the concentration camp. As it is foreseeable, the Jewish barber is mistaken for Hayken and impersonates him under Schutz advices and authorizes Osterlich invasion. He is then to deliver a speech before 500 000 people, after his minister of propaganda's praise of dictatorship. It's with great emotion that his speech praises universal brotherhood, and humanity.Comment: One of Chaplin's best movies. Maybe there are less laughs and more drama \u0096 especially with hindsight \u0096 but not less talent. Chaplin was way ahead of his time and shows genuine genius. Humor is never displaced in this masterpiece, ridiculing Hayken's hatred or the mocking the barber goofiness and innocence. More than a comedy, it's a testament of hope in human nature",

It reflects how inhuman the tyrants are by portraying what was experienced in a very difficult time for humanity, story is dark in exposing the hypocrisy, greed, ambition and how inhuman this dictator was. The humor works very well balancing the depth of the message with the jokes, especially the dictator jokes, the acting is impressive, the production design is impressive, the direction is elegant, the ending is amazing and the fact that the film was released at the time of the Second World War makes it a key piece in the art of cinema. I think the only thing missing was developing the characters a little more, but everything else is very good.It is a good film that apart from entertaining the public, manages to give a convincing and thoughtful message to the audience.",

I previously watched Modern Times which was satire on industrial revolution and this one was satire on Adolf Hitler.

The execution could have been little bit more tight but overall the experience of watching it was good. Yes, the movie was not great but it was fun watching as it entertains you.Overall, it was a good comedy satire and will make you laugh at some scenes and the final speech still feels strong when you hear it.",

It's a good effort, and at times a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately the moments of Chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent screen master, just uses too many words in this film, and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films, such as (better) \"Limelight\". Still, Chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable. Paulette Goddard doesn't have the glow she did in \"Modern Times\" (her off-screen affair with Chaplin was cooling at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to Chaplin's famous creation Hynkel.",

A few moments of hysteric laughter where present but overall it wasn't that funny.We have Hinkler throwing a balloon version of the world around and mumbling/screaming this annoying German inspired fantasy language. And of course we have a guy who looks exactly like The Tramp who walks around and acts stupid. Not too funny at all. Paulette Goddard also left me incredibly dry in this one.BUT the worst part of the film is how this tries to be overly patriotic. Obviously it was made as a propaganda film against the Nazi's but that doesn't help. Long speeches about freedom are not fun at all and ruin the atmosphere completely.As stated there is some good in it too and it's perfectly watchable. I just disagree with the majority on this one I suppose but I really have a hard time understanding it's incredible status.",

But that famous final monologue was extremely good and timely.Although there was an attempt at urgency and risk in the story early on, it really didn't resonate. Chaplin did say if he knew what was really going on, he would not have made it so light.Yes, I know it was 1940 but the backdrops were extremely obvious vs standards today.

            "content": "The Great Dictator was released in 1938. The director was Charlie Chaplin, who also played the two main characters. This film focuses on a Jewish barber turned soldier in world war one. When at war, he saves a German pilot named Schultz, not knowing he was from the enemy, and flies him to safety. Due to unfortunate circumstances, they need to crash land, which gives the barber amnesia. For twenty years, He does not know who he is, but he then recovers his memory and returns to his barber shop in Tomania. When he returns, he finds a dictator named Hynkel has taken over under the Double Cross. The Double Cross is arresting jews and putting them into camps, but the barber is spared thanks to Schultz. The barber then falls in love with a maid named Hannah, and gets in touch with his former neighbors. Unfortunately, He and Schultz are found out and put into a concentration camp. The dictator gets into a boating accident, and is then mistaken for the barber. The barber and Schultz then take advantage and escape, and steal the dictators uniform. Everyone then believes that the barber is actually Hynkel. Charlie Chaplin released this movie in order to ridicule Hitler, and portray him as a clown. It moved on to win five oscars, and is highly acclaimed. In the film, Chaplin, acting as the barber, delivers a speech that represented Chaplins own views on Hitler and the world wars. This caused a lot of controversy, but reached the audience and has gone down as one of the best speeches ever.",

            "content": "It is the best movie I have ever seen. The way that Chaplin depicts Hitler and combines Hitler's sovereignty with idiocy makes us start feeling that he was a real stupid. The scene that he is playing with the globe balloon and all of sudden it blows gives us an excellent model of what was going on for Reich and the Fuhrer. He imitates Hitler's way of speaking very significantly and even though I don't know one German word, I knew that he was saying nonsense to imply that Hitler's speeches were all nonsense. He plays Hitler's role like a bumpkin to show that his actions were all unwise.The movie reaches its zenith at the final scene that the Jewish barber gets to talk for the world. The scene is shot masterfully such that we are really inspired that we and Hannah are listening to him along with all alive creatures in the world. I am not overrating it; this scene is a masterpiece after all.The Great Dictator not only points to Hitler, but also to all the dictators bigger or smaller than Hitler and I think what we see in this movie will last forever. As long as dictatorship and fascism exist you can watch \"The Great Dictator\" and see Chaplin talking to all generations.Chaplin is still alive! Do not miss this movie!",

But the movie isn't meant to be pure comedy; the stormtroopers are genuinely scary, and so is Hynkel even for the small conquests he made during that era. Even though there are contrived elements, such as the Jewish barber being hospitalized without contact with the world for twenty years and still having has barbershop available to him, and his being able to impersonate Hykel, even getting the right uniform, but the movie's message is still effective.Unfortunately Chaplin would find that his talkies would be nowhere near as good as his silents.",

The character of Adenoid Hynkel is obviously Adolf Hitler and the character of Benzino Napalon, played by Jack Oakie is obviously Benito Mussolini. Written and directed by Chaplin, it is truly a masterpiece. The movie begins with Chaplinisk slap-stick comedy, which had me rolling with the silliness of it. But, as the film progresses, the theme changes and by the end, when Chaplin delivers the closing speech, the raw emotion is very nearly overwhelming. Sadly, though there is no longer an obvious monster to despise and blame for the ills of the world, the film remains poignant and pertinent. \"Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose- stepped us into misery and bloodshed.\" The speech has as much applicability to our modern world as it did in 1940. It remains for me a monumental mystery that we are continually being shown the harshness and callousness of society, yet we continue along the same path.The Great Dictator is a wonderful, germane, comedic, powerful, moving testament to human nature. Hopefully, one day we will graduate from our ignorance.",

            "content": "During World War I the Tramp fought for his country Tomania. Unfortunately, since the dictator Hynkel took the charge over Tomania, the Tramp has become in grave danger since he is a Jew. One of his friends is the charming Hannah...Although many critics claim that Chaplin's best film is one from his silent era, like \"City Lights\" and \"The Gold Rush\", I'm going to boldly claim that his first sound picture \"The Great Dictator\" deserves that honor. Chaplin was nominated for 3 Oscars for this ( best film, screenplay, actor ) and it's a pity that he didn't win at least one. Because \"The Dictator\" is far superior to some other Oscar winning World War II films, like Bengini's silly \"Life is beautiful\". The whole story is extremely stylish, Chaplin's gags are mendaciously graded and executed and almost every gesture or movement is orchestrated like a good ballet. Just take the scene where the tramp is on the battle front and gets an order to throw a hand grenade. He wants to throw the grenade, but it falls down his sleeve. The way the tramp gets in panic and quickly removes his clothes is something so hypnotically funny you just have to see it to believe it.---------- Unlike his previous films, which were excellent but a little childish and outdated, \"The Dictator\" is dark, serious, cynical, touching and mature. Some gags are satirical ( German's minister of propaganda Goebbels is here called something like Garbage ) while some are just plain full of style ( the storm troopers want to hang the tramp on a light bolt but when their commender shows up they salute him and drop the tramp ). Also, the fact that the dictator Hynkel looks exactly like the Jewish barber gives the story a more profound message, the one how maybe he is hating and prosecuting himself and how even the most evil people have their good sides. The open ending underlies that, since the tramp and the dictator change their places. This truly deserves to be in the top 100 best films. A shining achievement.Grade: 9/10",

In fact, when you look back he is the mastermind behind all of his movies: being leading actor, director, screenwriter and even composer.\"The Great Dictator\" is a hilarious but deep meaningful story that resembles (and even foreshadows) the rise of Adolf Hitler and the start of WW2.The movie intentionally makes fun of Hitler without actually referring to him. And draws a lot of inspiration from the Nazi party and the start of the war. In the same way the movie talks about the discrimination of the Jewish people in the state leading to what would be known as The Holocaust.What mostly got me attached to this film was the incredible humor of Chaplin and the resemblance to the actual turn of events. Although near the end of the movie we are given a call for peace instead of war.A true shame the actual turn of events that happened but we are at least given we a special and lovely ending. Besides this movie would have been known less if it weren't for the comedy and slapstick of Chaplin.A beautiful comedy indeed.",

            "content": "WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERSWith The Great Dictator, after holding out for years, Charlie Chaplin finally joined the world of talking pictures. On a purely cinematic level, the results are far from perfect, but Chaplin picked his subject matter well enough to more than make up for it. Rather than just being another adventure of the tramp stumbling through an uncaring world, The Great Dictator is a merciless mockery of Hitler's deranged regime. It reminded the world, at a time when it seemed to be willfully blind, just how stifling, corrupt, and inefficient Nazism really was.At the centre of the picture, and easily the best thing about it, is Chaplin's portrayal of the titular character, \"Adenoid Hynkel.\" His resemblance to Hitler in appearance, voice, and action is uncanny, and this makes his constant efforts to make Hitler look ridiculous all the more effective. You go from watching what almost looks like documentary footage to seeing Hynkel gesticulate lewdly about \"die Aryan maiden,\" and then fall down the stairs (it's more funny in context than it sounds here). Equally brilliantly handled are the points about Hitler's fixation on Nazifying classical art (Venus and the Thinker giving the salute), the ruthless military experimentation (the bullet-proof uniform, the parachute hat, both of which messily fail), and Goebbels' (here called Garbitsch) attempts at psychology not being nearly as brilliant as he thinks. Plus, the obsessive one up-manship between Hynkel and \"Benzino Napaloni\" is pure gold.The weakest parts of the film are those that don't deal with Hynkel, and unfortunately, there's a lot of them. Chaplin's other role is as a Jewish barber who is almost-but-not-quite the tramp. The scripting for these sections is much less sharp and much more meandering, and there are too many characters who aren't very strongly drawn. To his credit, however, Chaplin relies on his old mastery of silent comedy a lot to give these scenes some impact. The chase around the roof is a classic, and the \"coin in the pudding\" sequence is priceless, not to mention some of the barber's professional antics.In the final scene's bombastic speech to the audience officially has the barber impersonating Hynkel, but of course it's really Chaplin himself speaking. Perhaps it is a bit shameless and obvious, but one has to remember that when it was originally spoken, the \"medieval maniac\" that Hynkel was a parody of was still very much alive and menacing, and had more than a few sympathizers around the world. A film that's so blatantly political and yet so good on its own is not something we'll likely see again soon. Though something called \"The Appointed President\" might not be amiss...",

Running time: 125 minutes Year: 1940 Directed by: Charlie Chaplin Written by: Charlie Chaplin In his time, Chaplin has made some great films. Compared to lacklustre comedy of today it is still a masterpiece, despite still being completely out there. His comedy is not for everyone and at times is very subjective, especially with it being repeated from film to film, however with The Great Dictator we find something completely different, this is a comedy but one with huge themes and a giant message. The film is based around the beginning of the Second World War and pokes fun at the tyrant that is Adolf Hitler, before he had even become his most evil. The film brandishes him for all of his sins before he has even committed them. After doing a little research, some believed that this film could have been the tipping point for Hitler himself! We start off following Chaplin during the First World War, where he accidentally saves a man's life on the eve of its end. This man ends up rising high in the new government where as Chaplin suffers memory loss from his exploits during this war and ends up being hospitalised. When he finally returns to his home in the Ghetto, where he is a barber, he sees that a new Dictator has taken over and his town is being terrorised by Storm Troopers. This new Dictator is Henkel, a portrayal of Hitler himself, also played by Chaplin. He is the leader of Tomania and is deciding whether to issue war or a truce against fellow Dictator Napaloni, leader of Bacteria. If this isn't taking the mick I don't know what is. In the Ghetto the Barber , on several occasions, attacks the Storm Troopers for racially abusing him as a Jew, and upon capture is save by the man he saved years before in the war. The Barber is then deemed untouchable and continues his life whilst wooing the woman next door. However his luck changes when the man he saved is outcast as a traitor and the Storm Troopers cease their chance to get their own back on the Barber, leaving him in a Concentration Camp. The film is hard to believe considering it came out before many of Hitler's war crimes took place, especially with on watching you see how true all this seemed to become. At the time the film was tarnished as unwittingly brandishing the Jews. Little did Chaplin know that in hindsight he was right on the money. On reading this you will think the film is very unlike Chaplin and to be fair it is, but we are still treated to the very same Chaplinesque moments, all which break the tension when it is needed. At one point Henkel shoots a guard dead before walking off and tripping up his own feet. You get his evil brandished with his stupidity. However Henkel is portrayed in a way that you never sympathise with him and in fact always hate him. You laugh at him, not with him and I can only imagine how hard that must have been to do at the time of this film. In hindsight we can happily laugh at the man that attempted to destroy the majority of the planet but back then, on the eve of the beginning, this must have been seen as a step too far. It is deep considering it is Chaplin and upon watching I found myself enjoying it but not for all the typical Chaplin reasons. Yes it made me laugh but it is nowhere near as funny as some of his previous work. On the other hand there is a much deeper plot and narrative and ultimately a real meaningful message. The only thing that keeps this in keeping with previous Chaplin is the horrible continuity problems, but I'm starting to expect that from old films. It's just something though I can't allow my eye to miss. It is a decent film and you will be engaged, however you will find yourself at times thinking that the comedy elements are completely out of place, especially when it is not seen in hindsight by Chaplin himself. Not one of Chaplin's best but I'm sure the film he will be most remembered for. His final speech, spoken out of character by Chaplin himself, is a message to all those out there during the war and does put a lot of their pains into perspective.3 / 5TolliCheck out my blog: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I had seen this movie on TV some years ago (at least 15) and when it hit the cinematheaters again this christmas I know I had to see this wonderful picture as it was ment to be over 60 years ago. Was my hopes satisfied? More than so! Despite some minor problems (unrelated to the movie it self; battery-malfunction on my hearingaid, need to go to the toilet and an \"desperatly\" laughing audiens (have to laugh, it's Chaplin, even when he just falls on his but!). Due to this problems I went to see it yet again two weeks later (fresh batterys and toiletvisit just before entering the theater. The Audience I can't do anything about!). So this time I coul fully appriciate the film! The Restoration makes it a pure joy to see, the opening scen looks like it was shoot just the other week, not more than 60 years ago.I didn't remember so much of the film as I thought, I think I might mix it up with some other War-movie with CC. But my favourite scen is something I will never forget, the great dictator dressed as an austrian sitting in a small boat with a big shotgun, I start to laugh even before you see him in the picture, greater comedy has probably never been seen on the great white screen. But this is not a comedy at first, it's very vitty and strong political documentation so ahead of it's time that it's hard to beleive it's so old. The Serious part of the story shouldn't have to be as (aktuellt) now as it were back then, but sadly it's probably even more now! Whithout a doubt this is one the greatest movies ever! (The word AKTUELLT is the swedish word for witch I can't find a proper translation right now, but I think you catch my point just the same!)",

            "content": "I mean, it's cute, but I really don't get the hype.The Great Dictator is a 1940 Charlie Chaplin and it follows two plotlines: the first follows a Jewish soldier (a barber, really, when there's no war) who suffers some kind of amnesia after getting injured in the front during WWI. The second plotline follows Hynkel (obviously a parody on Hitler), the crazy dictator of Tomainia, as he plans on world domination.Now, this is the first Chaplin film I've ever seen, and I'm honestly not sure if it didn't really click with me because you need some level of comfortability with Chaplin's vibe and humor and...maybe some subtle messages that went over my head? But anyway, here's my opinion as for now.I like some aspects of the humor here. Sometimes it's quite witty and fun (the double-cross thing is great, for instance), and sometimes the absurd, cartoon-ish humor works well. It is, though, a double-edged sword. When it works it's fun, when it doesn't it just feels dumb (for instance, most of the humor during the WWI sequence didn't really click with me).The cinematography, acting, dialogue...it's all okay, I guess. Nothing exceptional, nothing terrible.The emotional part feels a little half baked, probably since it really changes the tone of the film in a weird, almost forced way. I mean, the film does have some moments in which it tries to communicate some romantic chemistry or strong emotions between characters, but it's just kinda there. Not bad, not particulary good.So, yeah, I know that it was short this time, but I really don't have much to say here. Has some fun moments, has some tiresome moments, but it's a cute film overall. Its main strength is the humor and the satirical aspects (with Hynkel). Again, just cute, nothing beyond that. Feeling a 6.6/10 on.",

I mean the jokes are a bit lame and a bit predictable, but I definitely enjoyed it more than some cheesy comedies of the last years. The jokes in the movie seemed more pure. It is a bit sad to look at the impression of concentration camps and violent actions towards Jews, as in reality it was all incomprehensibly tragic and much more terrifying. But the movie is nice, sometimes it is a bit hard to follow and not to notice some editing details, for one who's used to modern movies, where you can't really find visual flaws that much. But I truly enjoyed the movie as it was more of a philosophical piece (as the speech at the end has become quite popular on the internet), but with some moments that I could laugh, though it is not easy to make me laugh. I really think this movie was ahead of it's time.",

            "content": "***May have a spoiler or *** The great Dictator is a satire on Nazi Germany. Staring Charlie Chaplin as the Dictator Adenoid Hynkel (dictator of Tomania) and Jack Oakie as Benzino Napaloni and Paulette Goddard as the smart and sassy Hannah. The great dictator may sound a dumb movie and not worth your time, but honestly it's one of Sir Charlie finest works! The movie starts off in the First World War were Charlie plays a solider and loses his memory but alas the world goes on. When he recovers he goes back to his barbershop. You see Charlie not only plays the Dictator but a Jewish barber. This is the time where the Jews were separated. Soon he meets and befriends Hannah (a girl who is fed up what is happening to her people) and an old war buddy. But sadly things get worse when Hannah and her family flee and run into a safe land but the barber and his friend Commander Schultz (his war buddy) are sent to Concentration Camps. Until the Barber is mistaken for Adenoid Hynkel. This movie may sound like a horrible comedy about Nazi Germany but it's a great movie. First off the movie was made in the 1930s when Nazism wasn't a threat and it was more like a comedy with some great truth. Charlie Chaplin is not only playing the dictator but an oppressed barber who wants a chance to speak. In fact the movie is quite serious at times. Take for example there is a scene were a group of men decide to comment suicide.)i'm not telling you what happens) The movie has some great comedy parts and some great drama parts that will make you cry. Chaplin isn't being frivolous but is telling the truth. When there are sad and scary parts there is no incongruity. Those scenes are meant to be like that. It isn't one of those action packed movies that have guns or lots of killing but a movie you have to pay attention to, you have to think! Some may consider this politic movie and yes at a certain angle. I would like to point out is that this movie is the only one who can show us people not born before the WW2 the true feelings that people had before the war but it was released when Nazism was indeed a threat in Europe. Some say the film is overrated but I disagree it's a great film. I believe that everyone should have the chance to see this because not only it's a war, drama and a comedy but also it may teach our youth who have seen way to much violence and not much truth in movies. I'm not telling you the ending but a assure you, you won't forget.",

The first audio film created in the context of the accelerated expansion of the German Nazi Party and the massacre of Jews after World War II was released in the United States on October 15, 1940. It satirized the ugly acts of the German Nazi head Hitler's massacre of Jews, and expressed the desire for democracy and freedom. The film's release date is the peak period of Hitler's massacre of Jews, and it was also the peak period after Germany's capture of France. Chaplin still insisted on creating under the dual pressure of United States and politics. In order to ridicule Hitler 's dictatorship, Chaplin 's courage and conscience are truly admirable. In the story, Chaplin is decorated with two horns. One of them is a Jewish barber. He was drafted into the army in the First World War and saved the Schulz chief (Hickler's minister). Become a barber again, dare to fight the oppression of the German Nazi Party; another is the great dictator Hickler, alluding to Hitler, who has the ambition to rule the world and has killed millions of Jews; The girlfriend is a Jewish Hannah, kind, brave, and never succumbed to the persecution of the German Nazi Party.",

Chaplin chose anti-fascism and anti-racism as the themes of his first talking film, a move that was at odd with the public sentiment of the time or, at least, of the United States, which was trying to maintain neutrality during World War II. Despite opposition from some people, Chaplin proceeded with the film's production. This film excellently uses humor to satirize totalitarianism and militarism of Nazi Germany. I really love the scene where Field Marshal Herring rushed in to inform the Great Leader of the discovery of \"the most wonderful, the most marvelous poisonous gas\" and further enthusiastically stated that \"It will kill everybody\". The film also highlight the persecution of Jewish people fueled by irrational racism and the hunger for power of the Nazis. The most memorable moment of the film is surely the final speech by the Jewish Barber. Chaplin did it with such a passion that almost everyone will be captivated by the speech. The call for peace, cooperation and democracy in the speech is still relevant to these days. And that is unfortunate because that means the problems pointed out in the film still exist in the present day although may be not as severe as in the past.",

He takes apart piece by piece the senselessness of Hitler and Mussolini's ideology by making them a caricature, but closer than you think to the reality of the time. He then makes a joke of the little people that circle around the Dictator (the fat general that tries to tighten his belt, the reckless military scientists, the Tomanian war hero, to name a few) but, in doing so captures their essence in just a few memorable scenes. The only inaccurate portrayal is that of the concentration camps, seen more as prisons than extermination camps, but remember: this film is from 1940, so it makes for a bold statement against all the totalitarian regimes while they were at their peak while giving the free world a picture filled with Hope.",

At an area of Hollywood where political stances are forbidden to be shown in productions, he took a stand. He broke the 4th wall, and utilized his traditional popular 'Tramp' persona. All for this movie, debuted 1940. It is a declaration of war on the breech of human rights, horrendous act and discrimination. It was a time which Nazi Germany is at the prime of their power, and the Ally forces, which was then only recently established, had suffered numerous defeats in the European ground even world wide. Fair is to say that, at the year 1940, there were quite a few signs that Nazi German would ascend to world domination.He had nothing to gain from making this movie at that time, and everything to lose, he could face a disastrous controversy and be black listed for all his work. He could be jobless, homeless and on the run for the rest of time. But he made this satirical movie as his stance toward the atrocities committed by the actual dictators of the world. He put his life on the line.It is easy for us to condemn Hitler and Nazi Fascists now. It is easy for us to speak up against them or write papers, novels and films about that matter. Will you still have done it, in 1940? Will you? He did. It isn't a perfect movie production, limited perhaps by time and by technology. But the Actors and Actresses were fantastic. and It deserves a perfect vote for their outstanding performances and the plot. It has no special effects, yet it echoed through a century.His final speech in the movie, albeit controversy is what I view as one of the finest moments in movie history. He spoke to his audiences, millions around the world, in those few minutes. His true passion, conveyed in a fashion that mimics (satirically) Hitler's speech pattern, has reached their souls.I recommend that everyone should watch this movie again, given the political turmoil around the world recently, and remember what this movie, the history and the great men and women fought for our freedom have tried teaching us.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator (1940 United Artists) is a mediocre movie which contains wonderful comedy and acting fragments provided by Charlie Chaplin, who directed and wrote it, and by Paulette Goddard, his girlfriend (some accounts state they were legally married) during the late 1930's. Goddard also starred with Chaplin in Modern Times (1935), the movie Chaplin did immediately before The Great Dictator (1940 United Artists) and Chaplin's last \"silent\" movie (contained a music soundtrack and a brief singing sequence where Chaplin sang a nonsense song lasting less than 2 minutes....most of the movie was silent and had old time silent movie \"titles.\")The Great Dictator (1940 United Artists) was and is a propaganda movie, pure and simple, aimed at defaming the German regime of Adolph Hitler, at war with England, France, and the USSR in 1940, but not yet at war with the USA (that didn't occur until very late in 1941, almost 1942).Many people and organizations in the years immediately prior to WWII times were outspoken about not wanting to join in the \"European\" war, and indeed it took an event in the central Pacific Ocean (the attack at Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in December of 1941) to cause the USA to send soldiers and treasure into Europe and battles against the German government.The prospect of the USA engaging Germany in yet another war (following WWI in 1917-18) was controversial, and The Great Dictator (1940 United Artists) movie was blatant propaganda favoring one point of view about the war entry question which in fact was disputed widely.The movie is a hodge podge of sequences which include Charlie Chaplin's famous and familiar mime clowning, pratfalls, and sight gags often seen in his justifiably famous and honored silent movies. He was an acrobat and physical clown of high gifts.Interestingly, The Great Dictator (1940 United Artists) was the very first movie which allowed viewers to hear Chaplin's voice, which was not at all trained, sonorous, easy to hear, dramatic, or at all one of his great talents along with mime work, script writing, directing, and sight gag clown performance. His voice was rather soft and high, not deep, masculine, and commanding in the manner of traditional sound movie leading men movie stars (Ronald Colman, Glark Gable, Spencer Tracy, and others of that era).The Great Dictator (1940 United Artists) predictably defames Adolph Hitler (called \"Adenoid Hynkel\" in the screenplay....Germany is called \"Tomania\"). One sequence depicts the Hitler character played by Chaplin himself as ordering 3,000 factory workers executed because they threatened to go on strike. The enemy government leader was styled as a monster. So also were government police officers oppressing Jewish ghetto residents, which included the character played by Paulette Goddard and Chaplin himself (who also plays a Jewish barber).The movie alternates between sequences of pure comedy not related to or required by the anti-German theme of the movie...Charlie Chaplin serving up high quality comedy, and doing it well, and Paulette Goddard, a gifted actress of those times, also providing very good examples of acting in various fragments of the movie.------------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

Chaplin manages to make a great transition between the two characters, the Jew and the Dictator, he does it in a way that makes each of the characters unique with their own personal characteristics.

            "content": "Though some may not agree with my opinion on this unbelievably marvelous and ingenious film, I still stand by my belief that this is undoubtedly one of Charlie Chaplin's greatest films. By portraying two characters (that of a dictator and a Jewish barber), many with one track minds do not understand the marvelous intellect behind the dual characters. Chaplin depicts these characters to show the different perspectives of each individual. It's a simple plot, not meant to be perplexing and lead to confusion, which many have said it has done. The artistic value of Chaplin's characters are priceless and the speech at the end of the film is beyond awe-inspiring and would make Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech look like that of a 4th graders book report. The speech leaves you on a hopeful and motivational note, even in this era. I can only imagine the feelings of the people who viewed this film in 1940 when it first came out into theaters. It gave them the belief that maybe, just maybe, there was still hope in the world and that it could be saved from this feared and power hungry dictator.This film reflects Chaplin's beliefs and his bravery. He did not fear Hitler, and showed others that they shouldn't fear him either. I'm sorry if I have offended anyone in this commentary. I do not mean to offend, I only mean to express my opinion and reveal what others might not have understood about this wonderful film.",

            "review_title": "a rather disappointing evening at the movies",
            "content": "I sat down a couple of hours ago with every intention of enjoying this Chaplin classic - one that I have not seen in about 40 years. It appeared to have everything going for it, a good cast, two handfuls of Oscar nominations and an interesting plot with a strong anti-Nazi slant. All this appealing to me. Instead of laughing and getting in the swing of the film I found myself complaining -to myself- that for 1940 the movie, the camera work, the sets, the script and dialogue, the music and the way information and emotion was presented -ie humor and pathos- were hopelessly outdated. Jack Oakie's character -who garnered an Oscar nomination ???- alternated between a Marx Brothers Italian accent and a \"dem-deese-does\" Brooklyn one. It appeared to me that Chaplin had not progressed in his thinking or in his technical skills at all since his silent days. It was like watching a silent movie to which sound has been added as an after thought. In the film's final speech, after which NONE of the issues set up by the plot are resolved, I was prepared for your basic emotional appeal and was not disappointed. However I did find myself wondering why a Jewish barber would be quoting the Book of Luke? And so it went. I found myself wondering if my time would have been better spent watching, \"You Nazty Spy\" the 3 Stooges film that came out 9 months before the Great Dictator.",

Funny, touching and provocative are all words that come to mind to describe this film. Chaplin's genius is evident in his ability to incorporate his standard comedic \"schtick\" into the context of the story enriching the film as opposed to taking away from it. Chaplin's final speech brought me to tears. Although the acting style might be considered overwrought by today's standard, the content is incredible. Excellent supporting performances abound. I couldn't help remembering the hype around \"Life is Beautiful\" a few years back. People were shocked at a film using comedy to portray the horrors of the Holocaust. Although not dealing directly with the Holocaust, this film uses the same idea in a sometimes more successful and earnest way. When this film was made, there was a chance for it to make a difference. This film cements Chaplin's genius for me.If you love movies, see this film.",

A ruthless and reckless authoritarian, who is indifferent if not hostile towards human life, has decided to impose his worldview by defying peace, attacking a country of people just wanting to live their life in harmony. The name of the authoritarian is Putin. The year is 1939 and another country is invaded. The name of the authoritarian here was Hitler. Now, do not get me wrong, I am not comparing both, but the pattern is a tragic reminder that humanity is doomed to repeat its mistakes.In 1940, just at the beginning of the most significant tragedy in all of human history, a genius did not want to offer the masses an amusing parody but a truly timeless masterpiece.It does a wonderful job at satirising not only the fascist dictators but also their brutish regimes built upon hate and subjugation. The ridiculous is amplified efficiently.Chaplin, cunningly using his resemblance with him, does a marvellous job at parodying Hitlers mannerism. The gibberish version of german sounds quite accurate in its aggressive ridiculousness.Despite the the heavy source material, especially from a retrospective point of view, Chaplin still mainly aims to make us laugh and he largely succeeds at that.The iconic, poignant speech of an unparalleled rhetoric force, of genuine passion and idealism gave me goosebumps. It is without doubt one of cinemas greatest monologues and one of history most remarkable speeches. It certainly is a sudden change of tone, but that is not important.Additionally, the filmmaking is brilliant, notably on a technical level. The relatively impressive World War I imitation is a solid exemple of that.Produced, written and directed by Charlie Chaplin this film is a powerful and brilliant satire whose passionate cause will never die until humanity has achieved the goals advocated by Chaplin.",

It has a direct and explicit message of criticism and denunciation, it makes me brave whoever has taken this type of material in the middle of a war context where nothing was certain. It made me a bit long and at times capable a bit monotonous but the humor and how it handles the plot giving it sour and sweet flavors at the same time, keeps you following the thread.Chaplin and his final speech is what crowns not only the theme of the film itself, but also himself as an actor, the way he increases his voice, and his gestures until he is completely carried away by that euphoria really projects not only a political speech but a politician himself. Paulette Goddard is enthusiastic, a character who in her weakness shows a lot of strength, the end made it her own.I am surprised that this film did not sweep the Oscars because of the courage and conviction of the creator. Nominated for 5 Oscars, among them \"Best Picture\", \"Best Actor\" for Chaplin and \"Best Supporting Actor\" for Jack Oakie, which I accompanied acceptably.",

All great satire is based on going out on an edge. Also, all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis.

From the very opening disclaimer (\"Any similarity between the Great Dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental\") the movie is a laugh-a-minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor.  And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution.

The movie is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their henchmen and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the Jews. It was daring and forward for 1940 and must have made a lot of people squirm.When compared to Chaplin's earlier works, this is quite pale in comparison. The sweet, funny style of his silents, in my opinion, is far superior to his first talkie. There are lots of meaningless bits that drag on. If this was a silent, it probably would not have happened.I find one of the funniest moments to be the musical barber moment and the globe dance. One of the most touching moments is, obviously, the speech at the end.The Great Dictator is an effective and at times moving film that is a very big part of both Chaplin's history and movie history. It is flawed, but Chaplin is in great form.",

            "content": "I liked this film less than Modern Times, The Kid, The Gold Rush or City Lights. Why? There are several reasons for it. First of all, to my mind, Chaplin's films about The Tramp are much better being silent than talking. In his previous films Charles demonstrated us how beautifully he managed to show everything without dialoges. These films were much funnier. In The Great Dictator we have some moments of visual humor, but they are more rare and less funny. I really liked about 10 moments, especially the one with pudding, but in other Chaplin's movies I laughed or smiled all throughout the film. So the main disadvantage of this picture is having just a few really funny moments, though film is much longer than other ones about The Tramp. I know what Charles intented to make laugh at, but maybe war isn't the topic he made best films about. Many dialoges are dull or pointless, as well as some scenes in the movie. But others I liked. For instance, the way the barber is represented or his last speech. The speech is really great and is much better than other dialoges in this movie. It's a shame that people still don't understand the things Chaplin said.All in all, this is not the best film about The Tramp, not the best comedy about WW2 (in this respect I like Life is Beautiful and Jojo Rabbit more), and not the best film about war either. But it's definitely not a bad movie. Its humorous jokes, final speech and some other moments still make it a good movie, though not as good as other Chaplin's movies.",

            "content": "\"In this land of the crazy the sane are mad\", wrote Edmund Cooper. This 1940 Chaplin classic is as great an example of that phenomenon as you will find. Yes, it is indeed strange that Chaplin's Adenoid Hynkel should pull spaghetti apart in frustration, whilst arguing with his dictatorial rival in the shape of Jack Oakie's Napoloni; but how much stranger, darker and ultimately madder were the hatreds engendered, crimes committed and murders perpetrated during the run up to, and through the course of, WW2? A satire has to contain recognisable human characteristics, instincts and foibles - when this was made it was known how bad Nazism was, but not the extent of the persecution, death camps and ethnic cleansing. A quite extraordinary line in the film about the discovery of a wonder poison gas, acutely and poignantly envisages the ultimate madness, the gas chambers.The delightful scene in which Hynkel plays footie with an inflated globe, bouncing it twice on his buttocks, before finding it burst in his grasp, is a great metaphor for Hitler's megalomania; and the touching Paulette Goddard, who plays Hannah, is both willing to take on the stormtroopers and go out with an amnesia suffering, older Jewish barber, living below her parents rooms - boy, if I could achieve such social success, I'd grab the scissors right now and forget all things good, bad or indifferent beforehand.Chaplin's final soliloquy may be deemed somewhat pretentious, but his condemnation of anti-semitism and call for racial tolerance amongst black and white, all classes, races and creeds, should be pinned to the wall of every UN representative's office, right now. 21st Century audiences can learn as much from this film as 20th Century ones. Hynkel and Napoloni may be buffoons, but this acerbic classic is as potent now as it was then. Buffoonery can sometimes, just sometimes, be evil.",

            "content": "Chaplin is a wizard. In this he furthers his ability of comedy but combines it with drama to make for in my opinion his best movie. Both his writing and his acting in this are superb, culminating in one of the best writen scenes with acting so good it's bound to give you chills. Chaplin plays two characters in the movie, one of which is the dictator. The dictator is clearly satire as the moustache and all of the ludicrous decisions he makes are him pretending to be Hitler. This role holds up to day with the power of hindsight and warning us about those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it, but also it would have worked especially well then, in 1940, whilst the Second World War was happening and being propaganda. He also plays a Jewish barber, which ties in with the insanity of the plot, how Chaplin hates his other character and vice versa. The Jewish barber is a clear and obvious juxtaposition to the Great Dictator, the Jewish barber being the best of humanity dancing and singing etc whilst the great dictator is meant to be the worst, causing violence unnecessarily and his drive being his ego and the pressure placed in him.\nIt preaches a strong moral and it is a movie that is a great watch for today in such a political climate. And it's really funny, chaplin's brand of slapstick will always get a laugh out of me.",

            "content": "An overrated film. The satire works very well, especially since Chaplin has sussed that Hynkel-Hitler was the empty puppet of his impulses. But Chaplin can't resist inserting slapstick and farce, which interferes with the developing terror. The Brown Shirts may have been buffoons, but their buffoonery killed people. Chaplin shies away from following the logic of his plot to its dark conclusion. The final scene, obviously meant to be a stirring call to arms against tyranny, turns the plot into sentimental farce. Satire is allied to tragedy, and doesn't need a happy ending to make its point. But perhaps the American audiences of 1940 preferred to laugh at slapdash tyrant instead of considering the moral imperative laid on them by recognising evil.I watched this movie because of its reputation. It's become a curio, important for its historical significance. It did help mobilise American opinion against Hitler. But it's also an example of the muddled mess that Chaplin was capable of producing when not restrained by a strong director. A mixture of inspired satire, slapstick, and comedy, but that's all, a mixture. The movie doesn't have the structure that I expected. It's a series of set pieces loosely strung on an underdeveloped plot line. Too often, I got the impression that Chaplin was showing off, or relying on his audience recognising a shtick he'd used many, many times before.Worth watching if you're a Chaplin fan, or if you want to understand how old movies coudl affect public opinion.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator was published in 1940. It's Chaplin's first sound film. Chaplin plays two roles in the movie. It was banned in some countries for many years especially in dictatorships.Adenoid Hynkel (Chaplin) is the dictator of Tomainia. He is a fascist who hates democracy and Jews. Hynkel would like to invade Osterlich. Ministers Garbitsch and Herring are his loyal helpers. At the same time a Jewish barber (Chaplin) return from hospital after 20 years where he was from the end of World War I, because he lost his memory. He doensn't know anything about Hynkel or his regime. The barber meets again his old friends who tell him about the current state of Tomainia. Commander Schultz who has decided to defy Hynkel meets the barber who has rescued the commander during World War I. Later Schultz and the barber try to save Osterlich when the barber pretends to be Hynkel. Hannah (Paulette Goddard) is the barber's neighbour and the object of his love.It's very strange to watch Chaplin movie which is a sound movie. The movie is still very good. Chaplin had many great silent movies. I like them little more. The Great Dictator is a great parody and drama in the same package. Scenes which contains music and little talk are definitely the best. Main characters are memorable and some side characters are very funny. The movie could have been little shorter. Occasional overacting isn't credible. Chaplin's slapstick comedy is very funny as always. The script is full of political satire like a country called Bacteria or a dictator called Benzino Napaloni. The last scene is really emotional and impressive. The Great Dictator is Chaplin's personal appeal against dictators. 9/10.",

Chaplin's first talking film and he does a fine job, much of the dialogue is clever and memorable, my favorite line being from the scene where Hynkel is being briefed by Garbitsch, the latter refers to the problems of an austerity regime gearing up for war, in his Henry Daniell voice he mentions \"Complaints about the quality of the sawdust in the artificial bread.\" The casting is inspired, Henry Daniell as \"Garbitsch\", Billy Gilbert as \"Herring\" and Jack Oakie as \"Napoloni\"-he really did look like Mussolini and has a lot of his mannerisms down pat. I read that much of Chaplin's best dialogue were the speeches he gave in mock-German, they are effective, I speak enough German to know that is what \"Der Fooey\" sounded like, and the scene where Hynkel says \"mussten skrimpen und saven und tighten den belten\" and Herring jumps up and says \"Hail Hynkel, Ich will been den firsten\", the timing is superb and is worth waiting for.",

When I first saw it (which is fairly recently), I was quite surprised that it was his first \"talkie\" - naturally being used to his silent films, I was quite pleasantly surprised by his pleasing voice and that he didn't move to sound earlier.

There is plenty of speaking to go around, and it is done quite well for a man who mostly resided in silent films. From an entertainment aspect, the film is sometimes boring, but it is very funny. I did find myself chuckling quite often at what was going on, but overall the entertainment side was lacking. But these 7 stars come from everything else this film brings. At the time, the US had not yet entered WWII. However, 1940 is when Hitler was gaining traction, and his ideas and beliefs spreading throughout the world. This film is a direct parody of everything him and his regime stood for, and that is a BOLD move. Such blatantly obvious criticism of a political party and regime nowadays would seem almost inconceivable. But Chaplin did it. The speech that the Jewish Barber delivers at the end is perfect. I don't mean like, \"yea it's perfectly place\". I mean that every single word in that speech is perfect. The speech itself is quite pertinent in today's society as well - I'm writing this on November 17, 2020 - and stood the test of time for 80 years. A beautiful criticism of hatred and a wonderful plea for love and peace.",

            "content": "I couldn't believe it. Chaplin made the movie in 1940. I hardly ever watch old movies, because, no matter how great they are, it just doesn't fit my current expectations. But, Great Dictator is an exception. I borrowed the two DVD's (one DVD had extra commentaries and color footage behind the scenes taken by Sydney Chaplin, Charley's brother). The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of humour and sophistication. Chaplin in later years said that if he knew the extent of Nazi's atrocities, he would not have made the movie. What a loss it would have been. The interesting thing was that, it was reported Hitler himself saw the movie, though it was banned in Germany at that time. One of the survivors of his inner circles said that Hitler would have definitely laughed hard if he indeed had seen it. What a pity, that he learned nothing from Chaplin's closing minutes in the movie!!!The way Chaplin portrayed the two characters (the Hynckler, or Hitler and the jew barber) was astonishing. While they were two different characters on the set, they were the same actor (Chaplin) and somehow they both related to Hitler. Hitler himself suspected he may have had Jewish blood (one of his close advisors later told him, after extensive research, that there was a 50-50 chance he might be one quarter Jewish), my gut feeling was that he was probably more Jewish that he thought or his advisors told him he was, just because he never liked to listen to what he didn't like to hear!! Then the barber's service in the firs world war (Hitler fought in WWI), and how Germany lost that war while he was hospitalized. And at the end, Chaplin presents a scenario in which the barber, as the new Reich, is leading the country away from death and destruction to peace. I think Chaplin had a feeling that Hitler probably had this other side within him that, if nurtured, would have taken him and the world to a different direction. It was not to be. There was also the opposite forces within Hitler (my personal opinion is that the source of this force was his ultra EGO which the DEVIL itself) that fought with the forces of peace and love. He chose the other way, and became nothing at the end. The movie, in my opinion, also portrays this fact very neatly, as the real Reich sitting in Jail, with his globe balloon burst. Chaplin not only portrayed the past and present in his movie, he some how foresaw the future. It is a great movie.",

Highly inspiring and thought provoking this film will be watched for hundreds of years to come and beyond.The time the film was released also reveals further meaning. It shines an honest light on the Nazi (double cross) atrocities and mocks then in comedic fashion, while tastefully poking fun at the sometimes thuggish foot soldiers, all in good humour and yet wraps it all up in a spiritual message of unity in the closing speech. The whole show is done in such a way as to raise moral of the allies and was not only educational, enlightening and hilarious, but also served to remind everyone what we all really want is peace.10 out of 10 stars.",

Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin's first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber's chair , among them .Production on the movie started in 1937 and shot in 539 days when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace , as was the case when it was released in 1940 ; however , this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to its satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America . The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wives , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished The Great Dictator . The picture was released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities was the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland . This movie was Charles Chaplin's biggest-ever box-office hit , grossing about $5 million at the time.",
