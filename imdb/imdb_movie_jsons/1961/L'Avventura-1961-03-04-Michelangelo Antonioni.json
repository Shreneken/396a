            "content": "At some point in the film Monica Vitti turns to her love partner and passionately proclaims \"I want to see clearly!\". They're standing atop a convent, and saying this, accidentally she tugs on a rope. Bells go off around them. A moment later, from a church in the distance bells ring back an answer.Wow.And so finally I arrive at the end of my Antonioni quest going backwards in time from The Passenger, back at the start. This will not be the last of his films that I see, but I feel I've reached a point that enables closure. I'm where it all began, in the craving mind, where all the formations of life and cinema are born. I will rest from my travel here, with the magnitude of this film.But L'Avventura is famously a mystery of disappearance, so why do I speak in the title of this review of 'appearances'? Perhaps because, in the aftermath of that disappearance, Antonioni sketches for us the first appearance of desire. Romance in his later films was already stale or not allowed to blossom (it appears again in Zabriskie Point, under a different context), but here feelings are pursued, in an effort to reflect if love can be our saving grace.That appearance, born in a barren rock in the middle of the sea, rests on a twofold interpretation.On one level, perhaps in understanding by Anna's inexplicable disappearance the precarious balance in which hangs our fleeting existence, the randomly cruel laws that govern it, the two partners turn to each other for solace. And perhaps more, seeing deep down in their own selves how quick life can be forgotten, how everything we hold to matter ultimately matters little and how this speck of life we value is merely transient and will come to pass, they turn to each other to desperately defy it, to prove to each other and the world that love cannot simply vanish.Antonioni frames first this realization of transience against the elements of nature, the imperishable, secondly he frames, traps, blocks within the desperate relationship, mostly faces in silhouette, against old medieval buildings, man's folly to mimic the imperishable. This is Antonioni's spatial stroke of genius, the visual vocabulary which he consistently executed for the rest of his career.But whereas in the subsequent films I was fascinated with the abstraction of human struggle, here I'm also fascinated with the struggle itself of human beings fumbling in the dark. The woman cautious of love at first, then allowing herself to be swept in it, believing if something can make her \"see clearly\" that it should be love. The man pushing obsessively for that love then, having consummated the need, conquered his prey, losing interest, aimlessly wandering the streets. The sated beast now becomes casually destructive, as we're shown in the scene where for no reason he spills ink over a young man's drawing.Antonioni fills this with portents and divinations, like the woman's premonition that Anna has returned. More subtle sketch of the madness of desire is the surreal scene where a mob in the grip of sexual paroxysm gathers in the street to ogle at a beautiful woman. Monica Vitti's character later experiences the same oppressiveness of the \"male gaze\", yet doesn't feel threatened by it, until her man emerges from a building, at which point she runs and hides.The finale in this sense is a poignant enigma like few in cinema, the smile of a Mona Lisa. The two lovers, now bitterly broken by how their desire has failed them, stand in a plaza with the view of a mountain in the horizon. The woman lays a hand on the man's head, but is the gesture forgiveness or reproach and is she telling him to stay or absolving him to go? Rushing back through his career, a chronicle emerges. Here the appearance of desire in the hope that it will liberate, later the failure of that desire to liberate, the willingness to not pursue it at all in L'Eclisse. Later yet, the liberation from desire, the realization in Deserto Rosso that we need to make ourselves whole from within, the chimera of the mind in Blowup and the liberation from it, the chimera of ideas in Zabriskie Point and the liberation from it, until the eventual, stunning to behold emergence of nirvana in The Passenger. A state of awareness where all bonds to clinging and desire are severed, the illusions of ego and identity dissolved, the characters now embracing their transience.This is why Antonioni matters to me. Not because Kubricks, Polanskis, and Peter Weirs all took from him, planting seeds in the fertile ground of his cinema, and not because he did more for cinema as we know it than all of them together, but because his enduring legacy, mastery of medium, conceptual exploration of ideas, all of this cannot fully account for the experience of the spiritual journey they enable. Which is to say that something elusive exists embedded in the frame, a true perception, that makes his films mysteriously extend into the soul.Antonioni saw further perhaps than any other director, before or after.",

            "content": "There's something strange going on in this film.The first time I watched it, it seemed to wash over me without affecting me in anyway. Later on(and I've read this in other people's comments here as well) I found images and dialogue from the movie creeping into my subconscious; entire dreams would take place upon the island where Anna goes missing(often in monochrome), or I'd start to compare real life events to those that occur during the film. Did Antonioni plant subliminal messages within the movie? Probably not. It's more likely the masterful pace he employs here, coupled with the busy, deep cinematography is the cause of this. Notice how the backgrounds NEVER go out of focus, no matter how much is going on within the frame. Check out the scene about an hour and ten minutes in, where Sandro and the old man are talking in the middle of an extremely busy street; nothing blurs or goes out of focus, even when a tram comes in and out of the shot, nothing loses it's perspective, and as the scene ends and they walk deep into the shot we can see way past them and far, far into the distance.This seems to be why the film has such a deep affect on the subconscious. The characters are deliberately shallow and are placed at the very foreground of every shot, yet the backgrounds are rich tableaux bustling with life. In the scenes on the island where Anna disappears, we see the main characters always in shot, yet in the background there is a feeling that something strange within nature itself is going on. The darkening of the clouds, the sudden mist upon the water, the rocks falling to the sea, even the sudden appearance of the old hermit character, all give a certain unease.There's also the haunting feeling of the film, as Anna's friends begin, almost immediately to forget about her. Soon, they don't seem to care a jot about her, and neither, in a sense, do we. It's this feeling of loose ends and guilt on our part(for joining her so called 'friends' in forgetting about her so quickly) that leaves the deepest impression. The characters in this film are so morally shallow(the ending bears this out) yet they are the reason this film leaves such a strong impression on those who watch it, and who become captivated by it.I cant recommend this film to everyone because I know that the Hollywood Blockbuster has reduced most modern cinema-goers attention spans to almost zero. But if you fancy a challenge, or merely wish to luxuriate in classic cinema.....begin here.",

            "content": "I first saw this film about three years ago. It had come up in my reading, and it sounded interesting. So I rented it. I found it good, if a little boring. However, later I discovered that it was one of those films that may not be entirely entertaining when it is watched initially, but that comes back full force in the memory at a later time. This is true both for this film, and the only other Antonioni film I have seen, Blowup. Still, tonight was the first time in three years that I have actually sat down to watch L'Avventura (and I actually plan to re-rent Blowup in the next couple of days and any other Antonioni films I might be able to find).As I have said, L'Avventura has been built up by my mind ever since I saw it. Was it as good as I made myself think for the past three years? Yes. I have confirmed my suspicion: L'Aventurra is one of the best films ever made.\nIn subject, this film is a lot like La Dolce Vita. Its main theme is the decadent lifestyle of the wealthy. The decadent wealthy in L'Avventura are a lot worse off, though, than those in La Dolce Vita. At least those who were living Fellini's version of the sweet life were having fun. Sure, it was soulless fun, but, while watching the film, this thought, no matter how much I wanted to suppress it, was pounding in my mind: \"Jeeze, I wish I could party with these people.\" Their lifestyle seems just plain fun. They may have to pay for their hedonism in some way, but at least they're having fun in the meantime! L'Avventura's sweet life is the definition of \"l'ennui.\" Life to them is an unfortunate event. The script to this film, as well as anything else about it, is absolutely ingenious. To simplify things, let us say that the first plot point in the film is Anna's disappearance. This is the initial problem that the characters have to deal with. In a film made under the classical guidelines, this would have been the goal that would have to be solved by the end of the film. But as L'Avventura advances, the script allows us, or maybe even makes us, forget about Anna. This process is very gradual (and she never completely disappears from our minds, especially since Claudia mentions her so explicitly near the end), but it begins very quickly after she disappears, with the infamous kiss between Sandro and Claudia. There are miles of interpretation and discussion left to go, but it is unneccessary to continue here. This is just a beginning.The title to this film is, of course, ironic. There is no literal adventure. One could make the argument that the adventure is one of the mind, but I do not believe this. The adventure, I believe, is an adventure in reinventing the cinema.",

            "content": "Having recently seen L'Avventura and Scenes from a Marriage back to back they seem as different as it is possible to be. Yet they do share a common ground, namely humanity's quest for love and understanding and the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that lie in the way. But whereas Bergman's film has moments of true warmth and happiness, Antonioni's L'Avventura is as brutally cold as a Scandinavian winter.Plot summary is not entirely important (and would spoil potential surprises), suffice to say that the movie is uniquely structured and may not proceed the way you expect it to. There is a mystery, and romance; but not in any traditional sense. The men and women of this film stumble through a loveless, desolate Italy, occasionally pausing for forced, wretched couplings. Alienation and the inability for humans to connect to one another have never been so painfully presented in film.While discussing the guilt felt in betraying a mutual friend a woman asks \"How can it be that it takes so little to change, to forget?\" to which the man responds, \"It takes even less.\" Before one of the films many desperate scenes of impersonal copulation the woman cries out in a fit of existential despair, \"I feel as though I don't know you!\" to which the man responds, \"Aren't you happy? You get to have a new fling.\" The film is so brutally cynical about friendship, love and human interaction that it feels unreal. Strange alien landscapes, magnificently filmed among the rocky islands around Italy serve to underline the insurmountably barren distances between the characters. And as they grope and fumble for some kind of connection in the darkness that surrounds them, the viewer is pulled into their mire as well.When they are not desperately searching for some kind of connection with each other, the characters struggle to come to terms with their own absurd existence. A man knocks over a bottle of ink, destroying an art student's in-progress drawing. A woman makes faces in a mirror at herself. Another woman pretends to see a shark in the ocean she is swimming in. None of these distractions are remotely successful.By the time the film has reached its unbelievably cynical ending (dependant on one of the most effective uses of a musical score in film history), it becomes clear. These people have lost their way.This overwhelming bleakness seems like it would create an unbearable viewing experience, but there is a truth to it all as well. Companionship is a basic human need, and it can often seem impossibly difficult to form any real connection. However, what is important is that it only seems that way, it is not impossible. Antonioni has shown us only one possible outcome. By watching a movie filled with people slouching towards oblivion, unable to form even the most basic human bond, the mind rebels. There must be another way",

            "content": "I first saw \"L'Avventura\" many years after its original release, probably sometime in the late '80's. I don't remember the exact year but it was at the Queen's Film Theatre in Belfast and I came out of the cinema entranced, on a high. By then it had already been voted the second greatest film ever made and Vitti's performance lauded as amongst the finest in the movies although by the time I saw it, it had fallen somewhat in the lists of best films. Still, it was and is regarded as a masterpiece and rightly so.I watched the film again last night for only the second time. It has lost none of its power; it is still entrancing, a film of such visual beauty that it takes your breath away, although it didn't disturb me, (I don't think it ever did). Like Sandro and Claudia, you forget Anna quite quickly. Perhaps I should feel guilty that I did; that a human life meant so little to me, but in Antonioni's scheme of things, that's the way it is. These are indolent, amoral people; they don't have much in their make-up to redeem them, so it is little wonder that you quickly put Anna's disappearance to the back of your mind.By now, of course, everyone knows this is a film about a girl who vanishes on an island off the coast of Sicily that is nothing more than a crop of rock. Did she commit suicide? Did she fall into the sea? Or did she take a boat and simply take herself off somewhere? (There are numerous 'sightings' of her later in the film). Her lover, Sandro, and her friends search the island for her but she is never seen again. Her vanishing, of course, is not what the film is about. This is not a thriller, but a study in ennui; it is about being bored but it is never boring. It is about amorality and empty lives filled with sex but not with love.Sandro is the film's 'hero' but he is a sad, vindictive man for whom we feel nothing. The heroine appears, at first, to be Anna, but she too lacks warmth; anything that might draw us to her. Then, like Hitchcock in \"Psycho\", Antonioni 'kills off' his heroine thirty minutes into the film and the giggling friend in the background moves into the foreground, and Vitti's extraordinary Claudia becomes the heroine.Like Sandro, and like the audience, she, too, loses interest in the fate of her friend early on. This should diminish her in our eyes but Vitti has a vibrancy and a warmth to her that lifts her character and makes us feel for her. We care what happens to Claudia and despair for her at being let down by Sandro, with whom she has fallen in love. The characters are memorable even if we never grow to like them. Claudia, Sandro and Anna may be at the centre but the bickering couple on the yacht and the island and at the villa and the rich woman and her lover who care about no-one or nothing, (they treat objects and people with equal disdain), are equally central to the 'action'. They have lives, however dull, that transcend the confines of the screen.Of course, these people are not unique to Antonioni or to \"L'Avventura\". Directors like Fellini, Bertolucci and Resnais were finding them under every stone and at every strata in society around this time. What anchors Antonioni's film is that no other director, before or since, could place his characters so profoundly within a given space. It was as if his characters were bleeding into their surroundings, (or their surroundings were bleeding into them).Much has been made of Antonioni's use of architecture and location; the way he places his figures in a landscape, the rooms he chooses to put them in and the way he chooses to photograph those rooms. As the moral fibre of his characters disintegrates, the places in which they move and live take on a strength of character all of their own. That is what I meant when I said that visually the film takes your breath away. Each frame has the quality of a painting that his characters are simply inhabiting. And a word, too, for the performances; they are all superb and Vitti's tragic Claudia, (tragic because she can't break free of her own desires), is the most remarkable of all.",

When I realized my emotional connection to this, I realized that the actors did a marvelous job of putting forth a portrayal of despair. These people deserve each other. The spoiled brat Anna who puts everyone through their paces because she is so important and so desirable. The others, living off their entitlements. They come and they go in all their alienated glory. They seem to care for each other once in a while, but that is short lived and it always gets back to their constipated lives. The architect who through laziness, self doubt, and an overactive libido is unable to fire anything but blanks is at the center of the movie. He does very well as does his love interest. It's tedious and troublesome, but the cinematography is terrific and sustains the ennui of their troubled lives.",

            "review_title": "A movie about nothing (wait, not what you think)",
            "content": "\"L'avventura\" is Michelangelo Antonioni's mind-blowing film about nothing. No, I don't mean \"nothing happens.\" On the contrary it has a suspenseful story which, in the hands of someone like David Fincher, would be a steamy heart-pounding thriller. A girl goes mysteriously missing on a remote Italian island while her fianc\u00e9 and her best friend have a mystery of their own. A ton happens. But the movie is about \"nothing\" - the palpable spectre of oblivion, the unknown, and hollow faith that haunts us all.Antonioni made the statement at Cannes: \"Today the world is endangered by an extremely serious split between a science that is totally and consciously projected into the future, and a rigid and stereotyped morality which all of us recognize as such and yet sustain out of cowardice or sheer laziness (...) Moral man, who has no fear of the scientific unknown, is today afraid of the moral unknown.\"In other words, he is saying we have accepted the scientific unknown (an infinitely unknown universe) and embraced it exploration into the future, but in terms of morality we cling to traditional, archaic stereotypes of the past. There are definitely religious overtones in images of empty churches, but specifically the film focuses on the institution of marriage and the concept of everlasting love which, when not attained, leads people to misery; yet we cling to it \"out of cowardice or sheer laziness.\"\"L'avventura\" focuses on the inherent \"nothing\" of love. It opens on a woman bidding farewell to her father in a very cold, emotionless way as he himself conducts a soulless business deal--selling their sprawling property to be razed and turned into cheap apartments. She then goes to meet her lover whom she hasn't seen in a month, but at the last minute she decides she'd rather go have coffee by herself because she prefers the feeling of being without him. The story unfolds as they and a group of other wealthy Italian couples take a boat to an isolated island, and on the way over we quickly learn that each couple is a loveless marriage with each person barely tolerating if not despising their spouse. And yet they remain together out of cowardice or sheer laziness.Then the film does something absolutely brilliant to illustrate this concept of \"nothing\". About 30 minutes into the story, the entire plot disappears. Literally we are left without a plot, without a protagonist, and with nothing but a bunch of characters stumbling around trying to figure out what to do next. If you're not prepared for this shift you may end up frustrated or hating the movie because suddenly there's no point. But \"no point\" *is* the point.As the characters lead a lukewarm effort to search for their missing companion (symbolically, the plot) they become increasingly apathetic toward the whole tragedy, and instead they resume their miserable lives, their loveless pairings, and their general lazy adherence to the way things always were. And in this way Antonioni illustrates what he said at Cannes. When faced with the moral unknown, rather than seizing and exploring it as we would with science, we fall back on familiar, tired patterns.The film then breaks off to follow 2 characters in their half-hearted search. They travel through wonderfully surreal settings: towns that are completely deserted, or the opposite: a chaotic spectacle of hundreds of lusty men chasing after a pretty girl who has ripped her skirt. All of these scenes are majestically and gorgeously shot, and even if you don't immediately grasp the symbolism, you can't help but be stunned at how gripping the images are.Initially booed by the audience at its premiere, \"L'avventura\" is definitely a challenging film. It gives us a plot but then rips the plot out from under us, replacing it with another, and then even that plot gradually sinks into a \"love story\". But if you're paying attention, you can guess that even the love story is ephemeral and fleeting. When the final, breathtaking scene ends, come back here and re-read the Antonioni quote (or better yet, search for the whole text and read it all) and you'll get it. \"L'avventura\" is about nothing.",

Antonioni practically discovered the new movie language in L'Avventura. By using formal instruments he is expressing emotions of the characters (loneliness, boredom, emptiness and emotional detachment) and the viewer is forced rather to feel this same emotions himself than to be involved in the story and its events. These formal instruments are: slow rhythm, real-time events, long takes, visual metaphors like inhabited island(s), fog, extreme long shots (small characters in panorama) and putting protagonists on inhabited streets or large buildings and landscapes.Great cinematography.

A frequent theme in his movies is the desire to escape our overly commercialized society (as seen in \"Time Bandits\" and \"Brazil\"). Whether or not it did, this is an undeniable masterpiece.

            "content": "Many of the post-war new wave European directors seemed to have problems making \"American Films\" that addressed US concerns. Today the distinction no longer arises, media globalisation/colonization being almost complete. But while Antonioni's \"Zabriskie Point\" was a weak attempt at \"portraying America\", his previous films have become only more relevant, working as effective portraits of very specific modern conditions.Unlike the neorealist films that he was reacting against, Antonioni's major films don't portray any working class alternatives to the lives of the bourgeoisie. Instead, his films induce a kind of paralysis. They have a noxious and toxic quality, which his characters experience and his audience is forced to share. This paralysis is itself the consequence of what happens when gender stratification and class domination are pushed to the extreme points that they are in a medium-late capitalist society. In other words, Antonioni's internal suffering, his existential nausea, is the precise \"subjective\" consequence of an \"objective\" regime of accretion for its own sake.Antionioni's cinema embalms the viewer in a sort of suffocating subjectivity, until we feel nothing but the neuroticism, narcissism, and cataclysmic disinterest of his characters. And yet, his camera constantly forces us into a distant, almost inhuman, position. It is this strange juxtaposition between an inhuman, almost anthropological distance, and a subjectivity so suicidally sickening, that makes Antonioni's films so unique.More importantly, it is because of this internal malaise, that Antonioni's characters are constantly on the run. One of man's greatest flaws is his incessant belief that some external flight is capable of inducing some meaningful state of internal happiness. That by retreating to another location, man's problems may disappear. That by superficially changing his environment, escaping to a fantasy world, indulging in physical pleasures or acquiring and accumulating material objects, man may finally be at peace. But time and time again, Antonioni reveals these tactics to be nothing more than temporary distractions.As such, Antonioni's characters seem to fall into two categories. His Italian trilogy (and Red Desert), for example, focuses on wealthy characters who haven't a financial care in the world. If we think in terms of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, then this is a group of people whose requirements - financial, physiological, social or otherwise - are always amply met. But it is precisely because their needs are met, that these characters are trapped in a state of contemplation. They are free to think. And it is precisely this freedom which brings about a painful sort of super-awareness. Rather than struggle to survive, they question their own survival. And so they suffer from self-imposed loneliness, from an inability to connect with other people except on the most superficial level (they stage shark attacks and bouts of sex for quick thrills), and from, not frustration so much as anhedonia, an inability to take pleasure, and also, more shockingly, an inability even to have dreams or desires.While Antonioni's \"wealthy characters\" now work as apt stand-ins for post-modern man, for every man and woman in the developed world, Antonioni's English-language films tend to focus on photographers and radicals. That is, they are artists and voyeurs, outside of both paralysis and capitalist logic. They seek to escape their identities, live free on the margins of society, or bring about some social disruption or even revolutionary action. But again, there is no solution. Antonioni's filmography never resolves the problems he tackles.Unique with Antonioni is the way his characters fail to comfortably inhabit the spaces in which they exist. Antonioni's characters always seem to be in an awkward relationship with their personal environments. They slide within vacant houses, are suffocated by industrial wastelands, search ragged islands, and though they dream of blissful beaches or utopian deserts, there is no escape, only an ever-expanding landscape of paralysis.And within these spaces, all Antonioni's drama is internal. Antonioni's cinema is a cinema of inaction. Nothing external happens. Instead, we witness the immense tiredness of the human body. We witness the outcome of some unseen drama and the result of some long past trauma. Watch how Antonioni begins his films with relationships, not only long established, but already dissolved. These characters carry the burdens of a complete past history. A history forever unknown to us. Think of \"The Passenger\" which begins with Jack Nicholson already lost and in the wilderness, or \"The Eclipse\", which begins with lovers breaking up.In a sense, Antonioni also predicts the after-glow of the Sexual Revolution. He portrays a universe dominated by the superego injunction \"to enjoy\". Pleasure is the goal, but partaking in such pleasures, now readily accessible with the collapse of religion, culture and morality, only lead to a callous indifference to pleasure itself. And so we have a desensitisation to pleasure: an inability to find gratification in money, love, ideology or objects.Monica Vitti, Antonioni's beautiful leading lady, thus becomes a symbol for this dissatisfaction. Antonioni objectifies Vitti, treats her as a pillar of sex and beauty, an object of temptation and ripe possibility, yet simultaneously portrays her as a disinterested and disaffected zombie. Love cannot flourish without sex, but love is impossible precisely because of sex. Sex is thus, to put it in Zizekian terms, simultaneously the condition of the possibility and the impossibility of love.Unsurprisingly, as we begin the 21st century, the problems faced by Antonioni's middle-aged characters seemed to have been transferred to an even younger generation. Indeed, if Antonioni were making films today, his characters would probably be in their late teens. Perhaps this is why today's younger viewers (the very viewers who would benefit most from his films) find it hard to identify with Antonioni's films. Perhaps what we need is an Antonioni of the 21st century. A younger, hipper Antonioni. The kind of Antonioni that Antonioni tried to be with \"Zabriskie Point\".8.5/10 - Masterpiece.",

Early on there is something raw and elemental about the dramatic setting, an island with the sea roaring around its craggy inlets, rock formations that look ancient, and the wind howling as it blows up a storm. The people that have come to this place on a pleasure cruise off the coast of southern Italy are generally all unhappy or dissatisfied, most of them with the person they're in a relationship with. When Anna (Lea Massari) suddenly goes missing, a search ensues.I loved the premise, and loved even more where the film went from there. Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), Anna's fianc\u00e9, begins pursuing her friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) from the first day of her absence, which is pretty shocking. And the further the action moves away from the island and we see the other characters either getting on with their lives (most of which involve infidelities of their own), or making what seems to be a pretty distant effort to know what's happening, the more we wonder, but what about Anna? If it were a conventional film, I'd be thinking that given the guy starts dating her girlfriend pretty much immediately after she goes missing, why are the police not investigating him? Or questioning a character named Corrado, who had gone off in a boat to a smaller island right beforehand? But the film is not meant to be a mystery, it's making a point about the human condition.What does it mean to live one's life how one wants, to seek happiness, and to be able to adapt and move on, things that you might think would all be positive, at least to some degree? Does it mean inherent selfishness, infidelity, and unkindness? And can monogamous relationships survive in a world where little dissatisfactions set in, and there is always another person to be attracted to? I thought the film was well paced and had no issues with its length, as it allows subplots to develop, and the longer it went, the more it caused me to occasionally wonder ... what about Anna? And is this what we do to the people in our lives, pushing them out of mind when it becomes convenient? I loved how the film stayed artistically pure, seeking its vision, without caving in and giving us canned or artificial moments. And in that last moment, what I saw as forgiveness for what is an unforgiveable act ... perhaps it signals something that seems pretty depressing, that infidelity is inevitable, and it takes an almost divine act like that hand on the back of the head to stay together as a couple.Through it all, director Michelangelo Antonioni gives us a beautiful, beautiful film. His compositions and attention to detail - in grand, sweeping shots and those that are closer - are wonderful. There are countless scenes that are visually appealing, and while it felt like there was a unifying theme in the aesthetic, he seems to experiment a little, such as that great shot from the boat back towards the dock, lightly bobbing with the waves, and the rocky island rising up in the background.Some other little bits:\nAnna had two books with her on the trip, F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Tender is the Night' and the Holy Bible. I liked how the father conveniently disregarded the first, with its themes on the unhappiness in marriage, and took the Bible exclusively to mean that she hadn't committed suicide. We see what we want to see.Just as human relationships are subject to impermanence maybe out of neglect, one of the people clumsily drops an ancient vase discovered in one of the island's caves, and it makes no difference to them.There is reverence for the freedom and spacing of the architectural style of ancient buildings which have survived, but our lives seem so dreadfully transient in comparison. In one scene Ferzetti's character deliberately tips over an inkwell on an artist's drawing, seemingly out of spite. I wondered if he was jealous of youth, or jealous of having sold out on his old dreams to become more of a businessman than an architect - sensing his own mortality, or his compromises in a too-short life.In keeping with the elemental early scenes and the commentary on the fundamental nature of people, there was something primal about the very aggressive southern Italian male gaze from dozens of men in a large crowd around Monica Vitti in one scene, which was very creepy.Favorite quote, Anna at about the 25 minute mark:\"I'm distraught. The idea of losing you makes me want to die. And yet I don't feel you anymore.\"\nShortly afterwards, she's gone.",

            "content": "\"L'Avventura\" is an artsy sort of film and the winner of an award at Cannes. While I don't think it's a bad film (and some of the director's films, despite his reputation, are just bad) but not at all as marvelous as some think it is. It is, however, in some ways rather innovative if not especially pleasant.The story itself is paper-thin. Anna is a disaffected young woman. Although she is pretty and has every apparent reason to be happy, she mostly sulks during the portion where she is in the film. When she and a group of others are on an outing on the islands, she mostly behaves unpleasantly. Out of the blue, she disappears and even when the authorities are called, she cannot be found.For the rest of the film, Anna's boyfriend, Sandro, as well as her friend, Claudia, look for Anna. They follow clues throughout the countryside and soon, Sandro is like an octopus--with his hands all over Claudia. At first, she is offended but after a while she reciprocates and soon the pair are talking about getting married. By the end, however, Sandro screws everything up and there is an ending that is a bit vague.The film has a few strikes against it. Most importantly, it's not especially exciting fare--with quite a few lulls and a plot that isn't especially complex. Additionally, the characters are either vague (such as Claudia) or unlikable--such as Sandro and Anna. However, I don't write off the entire film as a pretentious art film. The film was quite groundbreaking in its frankness about sexuality. While there is no nudity (at least in the version released by Criterion), sex is very matter-of-fact. Yes, folks who are unmarried have sex--something which I didn't think was invented until the 1980s. Mildly interesting at best, I just cannot see most people giving a darn about this one. Be forewarned about all the hype.",

Selfish, fickle and aimless, she typifies the sense of ennui which seems to surround all the characters in Michelangelo Antonioni's breakthrough film. The opening half-hour of the film is as aimless as the characters aboard Sandro's (Gabriele Ferzetti) yacht, a smug and smirking bunch who crack humourless quips. There's Raimundo and his wife, who are probably the most grounded of the group; Corrado, who constantly snipes at his wife Giulia 's literalism (he's got a point); Anna and Sandro, both of whom seem to have drifted into an engagement that one is unsure of and the other indifferent to, and Claudia (the gorgeous Monica Vitti) who is the only faintly sympathetic character amongst them.The film is made up of two halves, and things go pretty much as you'd expect following Anna's disappearance. Her worried friend's search the island before they split up \u2013 some returning to the mainland to alert the authorities while the others remain to continue the search. It's only when the police arrive that things start diverging from the norm. Sandro begins to overtly display his attraction to Claudia, much to her initial discomfort, and as the search for Anna moves from the island to the mainland, the impression is gradually given that, as they drift into a relationship, both Sandro and Claudia forget what they are looking for.How profound, you might think. Well, yes and no \u2013 or maybe.One thing that struck me about reviews for this film is how they almost all praise the film without really attempting to explain \u2013 or seeming to understand, for that matter \u2013 what it was about in anything other than the most general terms, and I'd challenge anyone to divine exactly what was at the core of Antonioni's thinking when he devised the film. Quite frankly, the film is so impenetrable on anything other than a general level that it leaves itself accessible to any interpretation you wish to attach to it. Great if you're an up-and-coming filmmaker out to make a name for yourself, but not so wonderful if you're hoping for some kind of understanding of what you are watching. For this reason I sometimes wonder whether some of these classic films are given 10/10 simply because they have been universally hailed as classics and appear near the top of all the critics' all-time greatest movies lists.The film looks great: interesting locations, handsome and beautiful actors, and truly outstanding cinematography. The character of the shallow, self-serving Sandro is the most interesting and I would like to have seen it focused on in a little more depth. His motives, and those of most of the characters, however, are too obscure to be understood, which, I suppose, provides us with the film's second unsolved mystery",

            "review_title": "A unique film with a deeper meaning",
            "content": "When this film was screened at the \"Cannes Film Festival\" in 1960, it was booed by members of the audience (Antonioni and Vitti even fled the theater). According to film critic and film professor Gene Youngblood, people booed during long sequences where, supposedly, nothing happened to further the film's plot. I understand why it had a rough start, because it's very easy to miss its deeper meaning. However, after looking up a couple essays, I now understand why it's as popular as it is.After a woman named Anna disappears while on a boating trip, her boyfriend, Sandro, attempts to find her. Once they make it back to the city, however, he soon forgets about her and falls in love with Claudia, one of her friends.I think the film's purpose is to have you ask the question: Why would Anna run away? This film uses the actions of the characters to answer this question. Shortly after she disappears, Sandro begins forcing himself on Claudia as they search for her on the island. At first, she shies away from his advances, but when they make it back to the city, she begins to fall in love with him as well, betraying her friend. Throughout the film, their relationship continues to grow to a point where Claudia confesses that she's afraid of Anna returning, because if she does, Sandro might return to her. She then finds Sandro making love to another woman in a hotel. These two scenes show the themes of this film at their finest as it shows how unfaithful both of them are to Anna. I also feel like the film's purpose isn't solely to show why Anna ran away, but also to create a recreation of their relationship since the ending shows Sandro cheating on Claudia as well as Anna. Then, you have the final scene where the two characters, presumably, realize why Anna left as they cry together on a bench.I've seen quite a few people bring up this interpretation, but I feel like there are a few other details which are also important to the film. The first scene happens shortly after they first notice Anna disappear. Once that happens, Sandro says that type of behavior is typical. This hints that Anna tried running away several times in the past. Another vital scene is while Claudia walks in the streets alone, every single man stares at her as she walks by. This could indicate that another reason why Anna ran away was because she hated the society she lived in as well as her friends. Also relative to Anna disliking her friends, when Claudia meets up with her boating friends in Palermo, nobody seems to take Anna's disappearance seriously except Claudia. This is all the more reason to believe that Anna disliked her friends. The most important detail, however, is Sandro's disaffection caused by his failure to maintain his career as an architect. How this affects him is shown in the scene where he spills ink on a students' architectural drawing. This is also shown when Claudia runs into a paint store to hide when she mistakes a woman walking by Sandro to be Anna. Once Sandro walks inside, he stops her from buying a can of paint, highlighting his disaffection towards architecture.I've seen a lot of people praise the cinematography. However, I'm mixed on the way it was shot. I loved the part of the film which took place on the island as it felt like a barren landscape. Not only did this make for some visually striking scenes such as Claudia observing the sun rising as she stepped out of a shack, but it also seemed foreboding and unrelenting. There was the constant feeling that if one of them were to step over a hill, they would be confronted by an endless array of rocks, lowering the chances that they'd be able to locate Anna. Once they got off the island, however, this feeling was gone and the cinematography lost a lot of the power it had during the first hour. There are probably good reasons for why not to have the rest of the film take place on the island, but the scenery is so good, I can't help but feel an absence from the film in terms of its visuals. There were a few instances where we would see barren landscapes outside of a city, but these shots didn't give me the same atmospheric feeling I felt in the first hour because the characters weren't particularly in the middle of them like they were while they stayed on the island. Despite the visual shortcomings of the latter parts of the film (the visuals may grow on me in the future though), I still appreciated the several stunning shots cinematographer Aldo Scavarda was able to capture on the island.In conclusion, this was a really good movie. Partly due to the visual aspect, it may not quite reach perfection for me, but I completely understand why it often makes \"Best films of all time\" lists since it's unique in the way of its deeper meaning. I can see my opinion of it increasing if I give it another viewing a few years down the road.",

            "content": "When a girl goes missing from a yachting party on the Mediterranean, her lover and best friend drift into an affair...Antonioni expands exponentially on themes he first began to explore in CRONACA DI UN AMORE and there's a lot going on despite the fact that nothing much happens. Once again, the superficial mystery that sets (non) events in motion is only a catalyst for the exploration of an isolation inherent in existence and the uninhabited volcanic isle, deserted towns, forlorn seascapes... well, Antonioni is a master at having the characters' surroundings mirror their emotional states and the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is sublime.Contrary to popular interpretation, L'AVVENTURA isn't all about the idle rich since everyday people (the pharmacist and his wife, the town's menfolk) are just as problematic as the aimless upper crust. The fortunate few that don't have to worry about where food, shelter, and clothing come from are unfortunately free to face a few unpleasant, inevitable existential abstracts that don't plague the rest of the human race simply because most are too busy trying to survive. If the \"luxury\" could be afforded, the average person would be no different from Antonioni's characters and that's a scary thought -and a brutal truth. Although it's open to any number of interpretations, I thought Anna's disappearance was no mystery -the girl was so disaffected and emotionally isolated she just vanished into thin air, into nothingness; what happened to her ultimately doesn't matter very much and her fate is a metaphor for everyone else's.In Antonioni's universe, humans are innately dysfunctional and their attempts to connect on an emotional level are generally unsatisfying experiences; men, apparently, can't help it (threatening crowds of them surrounding unaccompanied women) but \"I love you\", \"you're mine\", and \"marry me\" are spoken much too quickly and without comprehension by either sex. Mankind is also masochistic, guilt-ridden, and possessed of a destructive urge symbolized by Sandro's philandering and purposely spilling ink on a young artist's beautiful sketch. The final scene has Claudia stroking the back of Sandro's head -a gesture that illustrates the same profound noir truth that Kirk Douglas imparted to Barbara Stanwyck in THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS: \"It isn't your fault. It isn't anyone's fault, really ...it's just the way things are.\"A visually compelling work fully capable of causing existential angst in a sensitive viewer. Is it art? Absolutely.

            "content": "By the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Italian economy had already started stabilising and moving away from the devastating consequences of WWII. The stabilisation and subsequent economic growth took place through rapid and widespread industrialisation. One can also clearly notice a shift in the sensibilities in the Italian films which were made during these years by acclaimed filmmakers like Antonioni, Fellini, Ermanno Olmi, etc. Their films shifted away from the concerns of neorealist films of the 1940s and early 50s. In this context, it is very interesting to note the dissimilarities between a typical Italian neorealist film and a post-neorealist film like 'L'Avventura'. While Neorealism dealt with the economic fallout of WWII, 'L'Avventura' deals with a sense of disillusionment in the midst of rapid industrialisation(the very first line of dialogue revolves around how the natural woods are being being replaced by houses). While Neorealism focused on the poor working class Italians, 'L'Avventura' focuses on the privileged upper class or the bourgeois section of the Italian society.From a technical standpoint, it has to be said that 'L'Avventura' is exquisitely shot. The camera movements and numerous tracking shots are executed with a distinct sophistication and methodical precision. There are a lot of complex frame compositions that take place in the interior scenes which scream perfectionism on the part of Antonioni. The overall tone for the film is one of extreme austerity. This austerity and lack of humanity to the film is clearly meant to represent the supposed lack of humanity in the midst of mindless industrialisation and consumerism. I think one thing that the viewer has to assume in order to buy into the film's plot and story elements is that the film takes place in Antonioni's own world which is a little different to the real world. This is because accepting the reaction of some of the characters to certain occurrences in the film will involve a certain amount of the suspension of disbelief.The problem I had with 'L'Avventura' is that after a while, the relentless austerity started to get a little unbearable and tough to be receptive to. It's interesting because I know the austerity is absolutely deliberate and it's intended to epitomise the ennui that the characters get afflicted by along with Antonioni's own idea of the blandness and aimlessness of life in contemporary industrialised Italy of the early 60s. The first hour of the film is absolutely spectacular and rich with abstract existentialist intrigue. But once the group leaves the island and we re-enter civilisation, the film gets progressively less intriguing for me. I generally don't get negatively affected by the austerity of Kubrick or Bergman. But the second half of this film really started to progressively weigh me down.I don't think any acting performance in the film is particularly special. But of course Monica Vitti offers vulnerability and a sensitive touch to her character and she is the only one that the viewer can find any reason to sympathise with. But to be honest, it is clear that Antonioni is in no mood to make any character singularly likable.Overall 'L'Avventura' is a film that clearly shows a master at work who clearly has a visual flair and a philosophical voice. But the austerity and lack of humanity in the film makes it tough to rewatch and revisit too often.",

            "content": "We follow Anna (Lea Massari) and Claudia (Monica Vitti) as they prepare themselves for a sea excursion with a group of friends, which includes Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) whom Anna has not seen in a month. However, this time apart didn't make the heart grow fonder for Anna, and to me, I thought she was indeed a hard woman to please, probably because Sandro couldn't satisfy her, both physically and emotionally. And to think that I've experienced for myself the incomprehensible emotion interpreted through an uttered \"I want to be alone\" statement before, Anna's cold reaction toward Sandro leaves him perplexed, confused and likely in frustration, as her no-reply to his probing eventually causes indifference.Come to think of it, all three are quite unlikeable characters, easily with flaws that we can identify with ourselves. For Anna, if she had not consciously chosen to make herself scarce, then it's quite highly irresponsible for her to do a Houdini, and take off without a trace, knowing that in any group excursions, your friends are likely to (unless you made bad choices on who you call friends) exhaust all possibilities in their search for your whereabouts. Despite it being a small rock island, it is still fairly large with its varying landscapes, and dizzying, dangerous cliffs. And like Lost the television series fashion, a number of strange incidents occur, such as an Australian who appeared from nowhere in the rain, and the sounds of many unseen, but heard of, boats, which continue to plant ideas in your mind.Making up a shark incident too to spoil the day for others just because you're feeling lousy, tells of a very selfish nature. So it's probably good riddance that we never see her ever again. It made me wonder too if love lost and wanting to be alone meant ditching all your current friends and current lifestyle, in order to bury memories and start everything afresh, which is quite an extreme behaviour.So therein lies the mystery as to why the story chose to left this thread hanging. It's never fully resolved, and there are a number of theories proposed at one point or another in the narrative, but that's just it. And if you suppose with the attention now shifted to Sandro and Claudia would make things better, it just turned out to be a tip of the iceberg. I thought Antonioni's debut feature Story of a Love Affair took off from a tangent, and there were some similar parallels between the relationships of the two lovers then, and now between Claudia and Sandro. In the former movie, the lovers were kept apart by the existence of another woman. Here, the opportune with Claudia's absence set the lovers free, and paved way for the two to succumb to the advances of each other like animal magnetism. Claudia was apprehensive about throwing caution to the wind, as with most rebound cases, and almost always feel guilty about the speed at which they fall into each other's arms. Having the fear of Anna potentially re-appearing as sudden as her disappearance, repeatedly cast doubts into her new found relationship with Sandro.Sandro continues the unflattering look at the weakness of male characters in Antonioni films. He might seem like a cad for having to forget his lover Anna at a drop of the hat, but frankly it looked as if a big weight had been lifted from his shoulders, that he need not try to appease the whims of an unreasonable woman. In 3 days he moved from what could possibly be a tragedy with Anna's unknown, unproven demise, and went ahead to forge a new romance. While he relentlessly tried to pursue the truth, in his frustration his ugly demeanour reared its ugly head, in a scene I thought was particularly interesting where he ruined a perfect work-in-progress, by spilling black ink all over it. He's a man with a roving eye, and once he had tasted the liberating forbidden fruit, probably craved for more, hence his additional dalliances with someone I thought would have been a closer resemblance toward what he had lost.It's a tale of two halves, with the first dwelling on the mystery and its background and circumstance leading toward it, and the second essentially became like a road trip which focused on the aftermath of the characters. A running element in both halves are the time that Antonioni devoted to look at relationships, with 2 supporting sets of couples placed strategically into the story for comparison and contrast purpose. Looking at it, it seemed that married couples do have some loss in romanticism in their relationships, especially personified through Guila (Dominique Blanchar) and Corrado (James Addams), where the latter almost always chide and mocks his wife's less than keen observations. And for Guila, given the lack of respect from her husband, and being constantly flattered by a certain Prince Goffredo (Giovanni Petrucci) meant that Corrado will have to wear a green hat as she conscientiously drifted toward the lavish attention paid, and reciprocated physically.Perhaps I failed to appreciate various subtleness in the finale which I suddenly felt the minutes tick by, in sequences that were hugely devoid of dialogue, but filled with moody melancholy, revelation and betrayal. There were hands that looked like they could strangle someone, but started to ease off and ruffled some hair instead, as if to say all was understood, forgiven, and all could be well. At least that's my interpretation of it, as with life, we see things from our own perspective, and is indeed a challenge to step back and take a broader, objective look at what had transpired.",

            "content": "What begins as a joy cruise around Sicily becomes a nightmare for all the people aboard the pleasure yacht of rich Italians. Anna, a beautiful spoiled young woman who at the start of the story is seen arguing with her father, has been in a relationship with Sandro. Anna, and her friend, Claudia, join the cruise after stopping to pick up Sandro, who has a lot in his mind. As the yacht nears an isolated island, Anna decides to jump in for a swim. It's reckless from her part, as the others see her disappear in total disbelief. Sandro jumps in to join her. Later the whole party decide to go to the arid island for a short visit. Anna, without any explanation disappears, taking everyone by surprise. No matter how they comb the barren place make any difference; Anna, for all practical purposes has vanished and there are no easy explanations.Thus begins one of the most enigmatic films by Michelangelo Antonionni, one of the best Italian directors of his generation. This film marks a departure for him in the themes he brought to the screen. Antonionni had his roots in the neo-realism; with this film he makes a 360 degree turn as he abandons the way of making movies, as we knew, in favor of more introspective account of the human soul as he saw in the Italian society of that time.\"L'Avventura\" which came out in 1960, shows an Antonionni that is concerned in exploring human relations. The director found a fertile ground in the elite classes he brought to the screen. He must have felt a fascination to see what he could get out of these idle rich. In a way, the film compares with \"La Dolce Vita\", but whereas Fellini depicts life of the upper classes, he concentrates on minor, more earthier types. Antonionni, in contrast finds the people in his film more to his liking because of the complex nature in most of them.\"L'Avventura\" was written by Tonino Guerra and Elio Bartolini, with the help of Antonionni himself. It's worth noting that once Anna's disappearance is out of the way the director concentrates on the dynamic he sees in Claudia and Sandro as they embark in an love affair. It's not hard to imagine that Sandro was fed up with the fickle Anna, as he turns into Claudia, a woman he has desired but was never able to get his way with her because of Anna.Monica Vitti, Antonionni's favorite actress, makes an enormous contribution to the film. As Claudia, she registers all kinds of emotions ranging from the concern she feels for Anna's disappearance to the way she doesn't seem to accept Sandro as he turns to her. There is a great moment in the film as Claudio and Sandro are seen touring a belfry and they begin pealing the bells of the monastery across the way. The ending shows Claudia with a contrite Sandro. The other interesting scene shows Claudia, outside a police station, waiting for Sandro and sees, to her horror, how suddenly she is surrounded by what seem to be all the men in town who covet her because of her beauty and for being different.Gabriele Ferzetti, one of the most handsome Italian actors of his era, does excellent work as Sandro. Like other men of his circle, Sandro shows an ambivalence about the way he perceives love. No sooner is Anna out of the way, when he turns to Claudia for consolation, although one has sensed the animal attraction he feels for this beautiful woman. Then, even after having Claudia, Sandro has no problem making out with the eccentric woman he had seen before in Palermo.Lea Massari, an interesting actress, doesn't have much to do. She is Anna, and once she is out of the picture, we tend to forget that she was the one that triggered the chain of events that followed her disappearance. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job for the director.\"L'Avventura\" owes a great deal to Aldo Scavardo, who photographed the film with a loving eye as he captures the beauty in the desolate places where he and Mr. Antonionni take us in the story. The music by Giovanni Fusco adds another dimension to the action. Michelangelo Antonionni gained international attention after this film came out and it's a tribute to his genius the film looks as gorgeous today as when it was made, more than sixty years ago.",

We'll never know what has become of Anna and the camera will no longer be attached to her, by contrast the focus of the film will move towards the duo formed by her former lover and her best friend.

While in a yacht trip with her upper class friends including her best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) in the Sicily coast, the group decides to visit a desert volcanic island. When the weather changes and they have to leave the island, they note that Anna has vanished. Claudia, Sandro and another friend stay in the island during the night trying to find Anna, while the rest of the group returns. On the next morning, they bring the coast guard and Anna is not found. Along the next days, Sandro and Claudia search Anna in the most different places in Italy and develop an attraction for each other, becoming lovers.\"L' Avventura\"initially impresses with the magnificent cinematography and the beauty of Monica Vitti. In most of the scenes, there are characters interacting in the background, and sometimes the camera shifts the take to 180o and the character that was distant on the back turns to the first plane, with the other ones in the back. The dull romance about meaningless lives is absolutely original and the viewer never can guess what might happen with the characters on the next scene. With a simple storyline, the screenplay discloses amoral characters without feeling of friendship and any preoccupation other then having good time in their empty lives, living the present the best way life can offer. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"A Aventura\" (\"The Adventure\")",

            "content": "That review summary may sound very confusing and oxymoronic, but it does show how complex my feelings were watching 'L'avventura'. 'L'avventura' is a film that captivates many people, those that consider it a timeless masterpiece and a quintessential character study on alienation and psychological sterility, but still troubles just as many people, those that don't find themselves investing in what the film is trying to say or the overall film itself.Both opinions are completely understandable, this is not going to work for everybody. 'L'avventura' was not a film highly regarded straight-away, that reputation was garnered over-time. In fact at the time it was met with booing at Cannes and criticisms of it being immoral. To be honest, it took me more than one viewing to have the opinion had now, on first viewing it alienated me with its portrayal of its themes being a shock to me and not investing in the characters (the slow pace was not an issue), while still acknowledging its importance and what people saw in it as that was easy to see. Gave 'L'avventura' another viewing after it was recommended giving it another chance, and found myself loving it and appreciating it far more.'L'avventura's' weakest element is the character writing and development, which are shallow and vague.However, 'L'avventura' also has so much working in its favour. First and foremost, it looks wonderful with some truly beautiful and atmospheric locations and some of the best and most vivid cinematography of the 60s and ever, it really is a masterpiece of cinematic technique. Michaelangelo Antonioni directs exceptionally, it was the film that put him on the map and to this day it is one of his best and features some of his most accomplished directing. Haunting use of sound too.Didn't find myself bored, despite the slow pace and was fascinated by the frank brutality of the subject matter, ground-breaking and also shocking at the time, but it also allowed for some very beautiful and powerful moments too, depicting the characters' emotional states that become increasingly fraught, that made it such a captivating experience. The acting keeps one riveted, with Monica Vitti and Gabriele Ferzetti especially unforgettable.All in all, divisive and troubling but brilliant and ground-breaking. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "...yet any viewer can see why L'Avventura (in English \"The Adventure\", which is interesting considering what unfolds) put him on the map in the art-film/new-wave era.  He tells a story of a group of high-society types, the kind that seem all the more empty as they are examined character wise, who on a boat trip stop on an island to walk around, when a woman, Anna (Lea Massari), goes missing.  They search for her, send out more people to search for her, but as the film progresses it can be seen that the search for her is futile, and it becomes an existentialist examination of the character played by Ferzetti and Vitti.The major flaw that I can see with L'Avventura is that it's at times a bit too assured with it's own storytelling skills, and occasionally it plods along.  However the story works most of the time and it's non-formulaic structure keeps it very credible.  But, what made me take notice and not nod out at all during the picture was the whole aura, the atmosphere. Antonionni, along with his director of photography Aldo Scavarda, always have a beautiful shot up on the screen, scenes which may seem of desperation are perfectly captured in the frames and any one could be freeze-framed and put on a wall to view like a painting (another film like this could be Raging Bull).  On that level of pure skill and movement, as well as the realistic character development, L'Avventura is an accomplished piece of filmmaking.  Important, to be sure, though some may feel turned off after a while.  Grade: A",

And that sets up the rest of the film's plot.All of these characters are jaded, haughty, vain, shallow, and self-absorbed. They're preoccupied with romance and their personal feelings toward each other. As a result, I did not find any of them interesting or appealing in the least. Indeed, the Anna character comes across as spoiled, irritable, something of a prima donna; Claudia only slightly less so.The film's plot is slow, with long camera \"takes\". In the film's first half, a lot of time is consumed with characters walking around on an island, casually searching for the missing person. In the second half, the plot gets sidetracked, with a sequence or two on \"modern\" art. This artistic motif has little or nothing to do with the missing person, and thus conveys the impression that the film is being \"padded\", in an avant-garde sort of way, to prop up the flimsy story concept.With the howling wind, the crashing of waves against the shore, and rocks falling into the sea, the film has some impressive sound effects. The B&W cinematography is rather conventional, a little disappointing given the lush and exotic locales. Still, the Mediterranean scenery is beautiful in its own right. With a runtime of well over two hours, a thin storyline, and long drawn-out scenes wherein not much happens, the film comes across as pretentious. This is especially true given that some viewers regard \"L'Avventura\" as \"revolutionary\". Maybe it is, in an extremely subtle, artsy sort of way. On the other hand, its reputation may be based more on wishful thinking than on substantive evaluation, given the intellectual audience that this film seeks to impress.",

The vanishing woman symbolically transfers her affections, especially by letting Ms. Vitti know she looks better in a shirt while the women are changing. Telling a fishy story about sharks in the water reveals Ms. Massari is not trustworthy. Announcing her departure after a quarrel, Massari pulls a Garbo after telling Mr. Ferzetti, \"I want to be alone.\" He didn't seem interested in commitment. There is less mystery than meets the eye as Massari simply hops on a boat while everyone languishes on a rocky, volcanic island...Apparently...As the film goes on, characters (and viewers) doubt that scenario.Michelangelo Antonioni existential \"Avventura\" wants to leave you adrift. The film is very slow-moving, and it is not helped by the discipline and surrealism evident in the Mr. Antonioni's later films. However, it is artfully directed; and the performances, photography by Aldo Scavarda and soundtrack by Giovanni Fusco are excellent.Antonioni should have ended with the disappearance of Ferzetti. The \"story\" is \"complete\" (it is not the story of Massari's disappearance), but a much more powerful one could have been told. Imagine an ending where Ferzetti simply disappears from the picture, leaving Vitti alone and - by extension - leaving viewers deserted. This would take the story to the ultimate - we all end alone. Here's how: the final act gives Ferzetti some of his best acting moments; so, to preserve Ferzetti's dalliance with the other woman, move it forward to occur earlier. Then, Vitti forgives him. Cut the final \"I love you\" as Ferzetti leaves Vitti in bed. We do not see him again. In all the final scenes, subtract Ferzetti.

And everyone who watched it knows the narrative is far from being conventional. I guess it must've been very groundbreaking back in 1960. Despite the film being more about the character's dramatic relationships, L'Avventura is often very funny as well. All the males of the film (mostly 40 year old men) took that very well done stare at Claudia's (Monica Vitti) legs, be her just walking on the streets or in a luxurious mansion. I also found weird that the protagonist looked so much older than her,and he wasn't attractive at all. Go figure.\"*Interesting from a visual standpoint.*\u00a0Is also a very well shot film, I mean, really well shot, despite not being a very well lightened film, the placement of subjects, scene's profundity, the narrativity in every shot etc is very unusual and cleverly done. The final shot is a prime example: Claudia puts her hand in Sandro's back. This is the most powerful and intimal moment between both characters in the film, because is when finally Claudia understands Sandro, who fell apart and shows his angst. This scene was very oddly crafted, because we only got to see their by behind, in a wide shot, and they are not the focus of the scene. Is what I would call \"subversion of filmmaking'. The film also ends in a very unconventional manner anyway, with a very abrupt cut. Which kinda fits the film overall atmosphere of indecision and weirdness.\u00a0*Acting was underwhelming.\u00a0*The film got a few flaws though. Besides a few goofs in the set's lights, the acting isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. In fact, far from that. The actors ranged from decent to bad, but none of them I recall being good. Monica Vitti was certainly a stunning beauty but not very talented.\u00a0*The use of music...*\u00a0To finish, the use of music. It was weird. That main theme is certainly very good, and very catchy, I admit, but there were a few times, specifically in the ending, that the soundtrack became similar to one used in a psychological horror film, and added to these quiet final 15 minutes, resulted in a haunting atmosphere. Which was odd, since there wasn't really anything to justify the use of such soundtrack.\u00a0Conclusion:\u00a0*Is a masterpiece and definitely a must watch for anyone.\u00a0*",

            "content": "A fine and startling movie. It's still fine but it may be less startling now than it was on its release. I have a flashbulb memory of emerging from the theater and noticing that my date was in a some sort of post-ictal twilight state as if, like the Buddha, she'd just left the garden and discovered unhappiness.Nothing quite like it had been on the screen before. Now, of course, I would expect the majority of movie goers to be bored by it -- a film in black and white, distracting sub-titles in Italian (or Urdu, for all they know), and not a single limb being sawed off by a hedge trimmer. All talk.Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and Anna (Lea Masseri) are a couple in modern Rome. Claudia (Monica Vitti) is Anna's friend and they more or less drag Claudia along on a tour with some pals to a couple of rocky, uninhabited islands in the Mediterranean. (First, they make an embarrassed Claudia wait outside while they make noisy love on the other side of a closed door.) Anna disappears from the island and no one knows what's happened to her. The search is fruitless. Did she drown? Commit suicide? Hire a passing boat to take her away? Claudia and Sandro team up to see if they can find her. There are rumors that she's shown up in one or another small town in Sicily. The two of them drive around, vaguely searching for clues, but then apparently fall for each other and forget about Anna. Sandro brings up marriage but Claudia is reticent. This is Anna's boy friend and there is a certain guilt involved. One night, with Claudia waiting in their room, Sandro doesn't return from a party. At dawn she begins looking for him, running from room to room, until she stumbles on Sandro making love to an air-headed high-end hooker whom we have earlier met surrounded by reporters, showing her legs, claiming to be a writer on tourism who really wants a career in the movies -- and she has this dumb British accent when she speaks Italian, asking Sandro to leave a \"piccolo recordo\" as payment for her services. How low can you sink? But no matter. Sandro scurries after Claudia, catches up with her, and they fall into an embrace, with desperate sobs. That's about as far as I can go in the plot, which is both simple and complicated, full of divagations. I'll try to take two scenes as emblematic of Antioni's very bleak vision of life.One is when Sandro and Claudia come across a turgid rumor that Anna has been seen in the small rural town of Noto. They drive to Noto -- and you ought to see the place. It's full of sterile, formal, geometric buildings with shadows uneasily skewed across the streets which, like the houses, are all empty of humans and of soul. No one answers Claudia's shouted queries. Every shot is out of de Chirico. Antonioni was to spell all this out later in \"L'Eclisse\", which was, for me, a little too in-your-face, right down to the title -- \"Eclipse.\" At least in \"L'Avventura,\" the insanity wears a mask.The second scene involves Claudia and her friend Giulia (Dominique Blanchar). Giulia is being followed around by an effete-looking teen age boy who claims to be an artist and who is infatuated with Giulia. Giulia is half embarrassed and half beguiled by the kid's crush on her, and she begs Claudia to accompany them when the \"artist\" wants to show off his paintings. Some paintings! Not only are they almost all female nudes, but they're done with about as much skill as a high-school freshman secretly drawing dirty pictures -- perfunctory faces, big knockers and whopping nipples like umber quahogs. When the kid begins to kiss Giulia and leans her back across a table, Claudia is at first amused, then disturbed by the increasing intimacy of their encounter. By this time, Giulia is aroused and determined. When she asks Claudia angrily, \"What does a woman have to do to have some privacy,\" Claudia replies, \"Just close the door,\" and Giulia does so after opening it so Claudia can get out. The sex, one imagines, will have about the same depth of meaning as the youth's pornographic nudes.Don't want to run out of space here, so just a few fast observations. Anna comes across as a bit shameless and impulsive, but Claudia is given to more sensitive, conventional sentiments. Sandro, on the other hand, is a real conniving bastard. An embittered ex-architect who sold out to make more money in another business, he deliberately upsets a bottle of ink over someone's half-completed, perfectly precise sketch of an ornate window. He's handsome, wealthy, gracious, and utterly shallow, with the moral code of a flesh-eating bacterium, and I had the uneasy feeling that Antonioni expected us to feel sorry for him because he was so empty. Monica Vitti has the blond good looks of northern Italians -- and she can act too. Catch her in a completely different, far foxier role in the surreal \"Modesty Blaise.\"This movie may remind you a bit of Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\", and there are similarities. But Antonioni's film lacks the upsetting tilt of Nino Rota's score and the entertaining, if improbable, grotesques.Anyway -- see this.",

Even BREAKDOWN, the rip-off of both that featured Kurt Russell in the lead, had its moments of genuine suspense (though not many). L'AVVENTURA is a much-too-mellow melodrama that lacks even the saving grace of a murder to make it viewable. It's little wonder the bride-to-be disappears near the beginning of the film: she'd obviously read the script, and knew that it led nowhere.

After the search turns up nothing two of her friends follow a lead and try to find her.I watched this because it is very highly regarded by Martin Scorsese and in some quarters is regarded as a classic. Having now watched it, its is hardly a classic.The basic plot seemed interesting: woman disappears without a trace despite being in a location where that should be impossible, investigation ensues, plot thickens. Well, that's how I thought it would go.From the outset though it didn't seem as straightforward as that. For the first half hour all we have is empty chit chat between the people on the boat. We do get some insight into the character of the woman who disappeared and also into some of the relationships between the people on the boat. This background made me think we could be heading for a film similar to Roman Polanski's 'Knife in the Water', released only two years later.Once the disappearance occurs, the film gets more interesting but this heightened engagement doesn't last. What looked like a mystery drama turns into something else, and it's quite meandering and dull. The lack of character engagement - there's nobody particularly likeable in sight - doesn't help either.I can see how at the time the film might have seemed original and profound.

I respect Antonioni, one of the greatest Italian director, and after 5 minutes of the film, I have a hunch that I would fall in love with this one when I see the protagonists are on their way to an unknown island, but sadly the truth turns out, it is an illusion more than a hunch. After the disappearance of Anna and the island, my interests diminishes little by little. There is no adventure ahead, as running around 150 minutes, the rest is tiring. One big problem is the cast, I must say that I have tried my best, but I fail to see any chemistry between Gabriele Ferzetti and Monica Vitti, I think the former should take the fully blame as his hollow performance and charmless appearance really gets into my nerves (maybe 50 years ago, the appreciation of the beautiful for sure totally different from now). I understand it is also Antonioni's intention to fade out the performances, but should at least have provided us some real eye-candy for audiences to chew or simply don't allow the camera lingering or focusing too much upon them as it is still a film, not a documentary (which should be a professional integrity for a film director), take another comparison with Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which is much more decent to show how to use the marvelous natural sceneries to influence the audience. Monica Vitti is beautiful but I prefer her supporting role in La Notte one year later (personally I love La Notte more, it's a 8/10).Beautiful shots penetrates in every scene, which I cannot deny, but in my opinion the images should always serve the characters, otherwise why just watch some exquisite landscape documents instead. When the background becomes the foreground, certainly it is another way to shot films, just I don't have the appetite for that. For me, it is not surprise that this film could gain so much admiration 50 years ago, but time passes, few classics could remain their high reputation from generations to come. It is an inconvenient truth, otherwise we are really not evolving. So maybe the film's importance is largely due to its role as a vanguard, which has initiated a new era for so-called art films since 1960s, still I will not hesitate to stand my ground as I am always stick to my real afterthoughts.my blog: http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",

It may be because this is the first film of the director's that I have seen, but I found it wilfully alienating and profuse in its indulgence.This is first and foremost a cinematographer's film; absolutely astounding work here at times... there is an artist's eye to these canvases, such scope and depth to the pictures; it's quite beguiling. This is all said to be representative of Antonioni's vision of dislocated, isolated figures within a barren, icily arid Sicilian landscape. The vision is soundly, perhaps too laboriously executed. Everything moves at a stubbornly staid, slow pace; surely meant to be symbolic of the odd, inert existences of the main characters. Inertia is excellently evoked; as is the emptiness of Ferzetti's character's emotions. Monica Vitti has an incredible screen presence, yet too much of her character is just built around playing at being enigmatic. Antonioni's camera revels in capturing this classical beauty in her languorous glory. Yet it is the film's studied languor that really does alienate. The first 45-60 minutes, with the central enigma posed, leave one expecting something more special in the remainder. A hope that is not fulfilled, as the affair between Ferzetti and Vitti is padded out to its extremes. It's just not so interesting and involving a film once the action shifts away from the island. Everything is lingered on for perhaps inordinate lengths of time. Of course, the photography bewitches, but the actual dramatic matter of the film begins to grate a little after a while. There is an excellent usage of subtle, background sounds to create a naturalistic, slightly unnerving effect, particularly in the island scenes, which form the most compelling part of the film. Also, the use of extras and bystanders, particularly late on, in the party scenes, is fantastic. Very subtle glances and body language from these extras help give a sense of odd scale about things. Adds a little more ambiguity as well.\nThere is little dialogue actually in this 145 minute film, and really the lines that do occur are not always that important; it is a film that rests on its photogenic lead performers and the intimidating tableaux of the photography. I did not really enjoy this film as an experience overall; it disappoints, perhaps because of its comparatively narrow focus, and the way things are stretched out needlessly. So, a film to be admired, and credited with a valid \"vision\", but not one to be loved.Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",

A mystery without resolution, the narrative involves the clich\u00e9 notions of alienation, social isolation, immorality, and decay, but those words do not tell the story. Instead, viewers experience detached, barren feelings and passionless sexual encounters. By use of visual metaphors, Antonioni, perhaps, transposed these experiences into the poetry of the film (this would be, I think, a matter of concern for New Critics). Aldo Scavarda, remembered also for his work on \"Prima della rivoluzione\", did the innovative and memorable cinematography.Lapses in continuity (because of production problems) would outrage a viewer in other films. Here they do not matter.One of the most intriguing aspects of this film is that three actresses in it become powerful icons. These are Gabriele Ferzetti, Monica Vitti, and Lea Massari, remembered from her later role in Louis Malle's exquisite \"Le souffl\u00e9 au c\u009cur\". I love Roger Ebert's famous comment that the characters in this film are \"on the brink of disappearance\" (quoted from Wikipedia: Ebert, Roger, \"L'Avventura 1960 - Great Films\", Chicago Sun Times, 19 January 1997, retrieved 20 September 2008). One sees Antonioni explore this emptiness in other masterwork films, including \"Eclipse\",\"Blow Up\", and even the maligned \"Zabriskie Point\". The review here by Poison-River is helpful and excellent.",

            "content": "I have to change my opinion about \"L'Avventura,\" and post a revised comment here. I had posted before based on a single viewing of this film on video years ago. I just saw a screening of it again at the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago as part of its summer retrospective of Antonioni, and had a different enough experience from the first time that I felt a second posting was needed.I almost feel guilty at my reaction to films like \"L'Avventura,\" and I'm hoping that others who have studied film will understand. On my first viewing, I wanted so much to see the masterpiece that film scholars told me existed, and felt obligated to worship Antonioni's brilliance. But what impressed me most about this film on a second viewing was how little I enjoyed watching it. What interest it has for me is purely academic. I appreciate its place in film history, but I have no desire now to ever revisit it, like I do other classics that were important but also entertaining. Watching other people try to decide whether or not life has any meaning is tiresome when you've reached an age where you've decided the answer to that question yourself.But I will say that what Antonioni has to say here he says very well. The male and female protagonists of the movie, who go searching for their lover and friend when she goes missing on a yachting party, battle an overwhelming sense of indifference that the movie conveys brilliantly, almost too well. They have to struggle to continue caring whether or not they find the missing woman, and to some extent realize that their lives would be better off if she weren't found at all. The pervading mood of their scenes together and of the movie in general is ennui, but the feeling of ennui extends to the viewer as well. Just as the characters slowly begin to lose their interest in the missing person, we lose our interest too, in her, them and the movie in general.So how do you rate a movie that you know is well made, is culturally significant and changed the landscape of international cinema, but which you would rather do almost anything to avoid having to ever watch again?

Mr. Antonioni has, through an unusual narrative structure and a very slow pace, skilfully hid a secret.Two young women, Anna and Claudia, travel from a suburb of Rome on a yachting cruise in the Mediterranean. Anna's lover, Sandro, has joined them in Rome. She is not sure about her feelings in him. He drives the two women to the coast where they join two wealthy couples. The next morning, they sail around small islands north of Sicily. Anna is visibly nervous. She confesses to Claudia a vicious game with her lover. At one of the smaller islands the party comes ashore. Anna and Sandro go off alone and talk about their relationship. After a frivolous discussion she is gone without a trace. They explore the island and find nothing. Shortly after that, Sandro and Claudia develop an attraction for each other...The holes in the story, which are very visible, have further intensified a mystery. Scenery is very impressive. Rich people, which are emotionally and mentally empty, were faced with a strange accident and intensive romance. A meaningless life is unpredictable. It is a small prank by Mr. Antonioni. He pays no attention to the small details. A sensational event has caused certain immoral situation. Love was born out of nothing. The protagonists would like \"something\", but are not capable of anything. They are lonely and they seek for help.The tension at the beginning of the film was replaced with anxiety. The characterization is excellent.Gabriele Ferzetti as Sandro is an energetic and impulsive, but boring and bitter character. A lover with immoral code and limited understandings. It's hard to sympathize with a guy like him. Monica Vitti as Claudia is a coquettish young woman. The blame for grabbing lover and fear of an unrequited love are mixed in her character. Lea Massari as Anna is a vain wealthy girl. She does not want anyone's love, more attention. Eventually, she has received a desired attention.Mr. Antonioni, through a weird adventure, has managed to fit an anxious mood and nonsense in a recognizable life mosaic.",

The film's subtle psychological exploration is masterful, dealing with isolation and the protagonist's passive lifestyle forced to change under new circumstances.

The film fixates on the character's different emotional states and massively shallow and fleeting outlooks on life, relationships and friendships. None of which are taken seriously as they live moment by moment for what their immediate wants which makes you feel like smacking the characters for their lack of respect and extreme shallowness. Most scenes are long durations of people looking around while pondering their internal qualms while the picturesque Italian scenery makes it pleasantly palatable to watch them do so.

But this is, if I were objective yet receptive, probably the Best film I've ever seen. The only film that could make his Blowup seem less than it is, which is fabulous. I saw this film only once, on the big screen, thirty years ago. Even now, just thinking about it knocks me off my foundation and forces a reevaluation of all that I believe about humans interacting between nature, themselves and each other.\nAfter reading the other reviews, I must add one observation. All my long adult life I have read about segments of `otherwise' great films dragging. Even accounting for the 'enjoy a baseball game' vs.  `NBA gives action every second'  mentalities and the endless MTV Generation attention span analogies, this is a load of dung. This is not a matter of taste. It is always a matter of the filmmaker's realization going over the viewer's head, to put it bluntly. When I was a kid, scientists explained that we use only five percent of our brain. Each decade they admit to a bit more of it being used to some effect. How learned exponents of the scientific method could ignore atrophy and evolution is beyond me, but film fans are often expert in this exercise in self delusion. We don't grasp something, so we call it a mistake. We don't see how something is helping us, so we say it doesn't do anything at all. It's called ignorance, not stupidity. Nothing to be ashamed of. We can learn if we continue to expose ourselves to the work of filmmakers more talented than ourselves.\nThe griping about today's blockbusters being special effects and deal driven are well known, and largely true. Here is a film that illuminates and reveals, I suspect, more than we viewers can ever perceive from it. It works superbly on so many levels at once that it dazzles us with its brilliance. It informs all of that with pure filmmaking consisting of director's craft, acting ability, writing talent and cinematography. It reveals its vision with its spaces as effectively as with its active elements. It allows us to bring much of ourselves to it by not filling up the experience wall to wall with specifics. It forces us to see most films as the obvious, spoon fed tripe that they are. What more could you ask from a film?",

How can a father seem perturbed that his life is interrupted with a search for his daughter? How can a finance move on to the next woman just days after a disappearance, and then move on to a prostitute when she is unavailable for the moment? It doesn't really matter who the stars are in this film, as they are unimportant. It is Antonioni's comment on how we are self-centered and live only for immediate gratification.

He was a a director that always managed to do this in a very effective way, making his movies special- and great viewing experiences.No, this approach of course doesn't always make this movie an easy one to watch, especially since it's also quite a long one. It's a sort of movie you need to be in the mood for at the time, since you can't really afford to not play closely attention to everything, or you might loose track. So I can understand people not liking this movie and consider it a slow and boring one, especially when they aren't familiar or accustomed to Michelangelo Antonioni's way of film-making and storytelling.And I must say, as much as I enjoy Michelangelo Antonioni's unique approach to film-making, I don't really regard this movie as one of his best examples. Problem that I had with this movie was that it basically could be divided into two different parts, that are different in style and approach to its story. And problem with this was that I liked the first half of the movie way better than its first. I liked the mystery-elements in it, as well as its settings and characters. This all changed in the movie its second half. It really doesn't make this always a consistent movie.The main characters still manage to intrigue throughout though. They are well developed and I just can't understand some people calling them flat or shallow. They have much depth to them and go through some transitions throughout the movie. There is something missing in each of their lives, whether they really realize this or not and try to search for that something that it is they miss in their lives and try to really hold on to it, once they have found it.As you could basically always expect from an European movie, it's visually a great looking one, with some great Mediterranean settings and nice black & white camera-work.Just give it another shot if you didn't like it at first, since there simply is no way that anyone could ever call \"L'avventura\" a bad movie, unless that person doesn't understand its special approach of storytelling and film-making by Michelangelo Antonioni, or just simply wasn't in the right mood for it, the first time around.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Anna and Sandro are unhappy, and following an argument, Sandro wakes up from a nap to find Anna missing. After a frantic search, the group leaves the island, and Sandro and Claudia begin a guilty love affair. They carry on the search for Anna, but as the film goes on, she is gradually forgotten and the two indulge their desires.Michelangelo Antonioni makes slow films. He is more concerned with setting a tone, and creating the world that his characters inhabit. This is evident in the two films of his I've seen, Blowup (1966), probably his most popular film, and The Passenger (1975), a film I consider to be one of the best, if not the best, film of the 1970's. L'Avventura is no different, and Antonioni takes his time showing the morally corrupt and emotionally shallow world these upper class characters seemingly float through. The pace allows time for the central mystery of Anna's disappearance to slowly leave our mind, as Sandro and Claudia's love affair comes to the fore. They are initially full of guilt, but it becomes clear that these characters will have what they want.Released at the same time as Fellini's hugely successful La Dolce Vita, the two films tackle similar subjects. The life of the rich and care- free are apparently soulless adventures in partying where the consequences of actions are irrelevant. While La Dolce Vita was an excellent film, L'Avventura shows ultimately the darker side of this society, and it's impact greater. The characters in La Dolce Vita look like they're having fun, but in this, they drift through their lives like ghosts. These are horrible people, entirely lacking in emotion or any true feeling, apart from disconnection and isolation.The cinematography is jaw-droppingly beautiful, with nothing left out of focus. Every frame has a crisp and polished look to it, as if Antonioni is asking us to look at what else is happening, what else is lying beneath the surface. It was booed at Cannes, but went on to win the Jury Prize, and has since then gone on to be recognised as one of the greats of world cinema. I must admit the slow plotting did sometimes hamper my enjoyment of the film, but L'Avventura leaves its mark and it's beauty becomes apparent after the credits have rolled.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

There are some small clues as to what may have happened to Anna, but the disappearance is for all intents and purposes a classic \"Maguffin\". Its visually very interesting as Antonioni uses many visual motifs and metaphors to structure this ambiguous film. L'Avventura has two meanings in Italian, one is \"adventure\", the other means \"fling\", both strangely are quite appropriate.

I just saw the film and, like all the movies I've seen from Antonioni (eight so far), I'm still at the stage of \"absorbing\" what I just saw. As always, the usual \"brands\" and director's style are present in this excellent film: desolate and isolated scenarios brilliantly filmed, few dialogues and long sequences without dialogues, few \"happenings\" during the film, slow development of \"action\" difficulties of communication between solitary, complex and contradictory characters, existentialist issues, etc. In short, when we see the films of Antonioni it seems that we are always watching the same film and this also does not escape this \"rule\".

Herewith is a new theory which has never been put forward, and which may be just as valid as any other. It has to do with Monica Vitti's hair. 1960 brought a transition in women's hairstyles, phasing out the lacquered helmet heads in favor of more naturalistic tresses (which nonetheless still required much processing and care). While Bardot was busy ushering in a long, tousled \"do\" that's imitated to this day, Antonioni presents Monica Vitti with a most flattering layered style that survives windblown islands and rolling around in the hay. Consider the oddly placed barrette she often wears in the back of her head, which either adds height or anchors a hairpiece (or symbolizes any number of other things). Sixty years later, it still looks good. Try watching this film from a standpoint of her hair for new meaning and understanding.",

If so, I am sure glad I live in America. \"L'Avventura\" would still have been a weird foreign film even if it had been shorter, but at least it would have been a better movie because there would have been less of it.A bunch of people get on a boat and end up on a small volcanic island. After they walk around for a while, they decide to leave and discover that Anna is missing. They search everywhere, but she is gone. There is only one possibility: she drowned and her body drifted out to sea with the tide. Of course, we can still wonder if it was an accident, suicide, or murder. But one thing is certain: she didn't just vanish into thin air.Wait a minute! What am I saying? This is a weird foreign film by Michelangelo Antonioni. When you enter the theater to watch one of these movies, you have to check your reason and common sense at the door, or it will just get in the way of experiencing existential wonder, if that's what you're into. So, of course she might just have vanished into thin air or teleported off the island or was abducted by aliens or whatever.In any event, Anna's friend, Claudia, and Anna's boyfriend, Sandro, don't have much reason and common sense either, because they leave the island and start looking for Anna. I mean, they actually think she might be wandering around Italy, visiting museums, staying at a hotel, or anything that someone might do who wasn't last seen on a small island with no way off except by boat.They recognize that she might have drowned, but that doesn't stop them from knocking off a quick piece, because though they just met, yet they are wildly in love with each other and just have to have some right in the middle of an open field. Of course, that doesn't stop Sandro from knocking off a quick piece the next day with some woman on the couch in the hotel lobby. When Claudia catches him, he cries. He shed not one tear for Anna, but this is different. No problem, because Claudia still loves him.And Anna? You mean you're still wondering what happened to her? What do you think this is, an American movie?",

            "content": "L'Avventura is a challenging movie: Antonioni's lugubrious pacing, his open disdain for the story he is narrating and its characters can be off-putting, as he plays with the medium in the first episode of his so-called \"Incommunicability Trilogy\".Nominally, L'Avventura is about the (ultimately never explained) disappearance of a young woman, Anna (Lea Massari), during a visit to a semi-deserted island, and the attempts by her fianc\u00e9 Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and her best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) to find her. This is closer to Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock than to a conventional mystery.Antonioni takes his characters, who are volatile cyphers (see their constantly shifting attitudes towards each other and also towards Anna's disappearance) and places them against vivid, sharply defined backgrounds. Weir's Picnic was the unsettling story of an enigma which haunted all those involved; Antonioni's movie is chillingly indifferent. Anna is nowhere to be found - the two main characters move on, leave the island, their attempts to find Anna getting increasingly bland. The key moment happens late into the movie. Sandro (an architect) contemplates a beautiful vista on a baroque town. The town of Noto was destroyed by an earthquake and its rebuilding was meticulously planned, with incredible attention to every detail and to the final scenic effect, by a single man. Backgrounds and landscapes are the focus here, not characters. In fact, the last shot is more eloquent than any line of dialogue uttered by the protagonists.Like in Picnic at Hanging Rock, the sexual (especially homosexual) subtext is explicit. There is a strong hint that Anna's disaffection for Sandro is linked to her closeness to Claudia. Frustrated by her relationship with Sandro, the young woman literally vanishes into the bare, magmatic landscape of the island. See how Antonioni mirrors Anna in Claudia: Massari's and Vitti's facial features are strikingly alike. After Anna's disappearance, Claudia uses her clothes, effectively becoming her double. Sandro falls for her, so the whole thing plays like a love triangle, where the disappeared Anna is represented by the quest to find her. Unlike Scottie in Vertigo, however, Sandro doesn't try to \"duplicate\" Anna, to rebuild the perfect copy of the woman he loved - he couldn't care less. He cheats on Claudia after she finally falls in love with him. See also how Anna's malaise and mysterious disappearance are foreshadowed by her pointless lie about the shark.",

It's legendarily slow pace didn't bother me at all, but I did find the insights into the characters, how empty and desperate they are somewhat repetitive over time. I'll admit to moments of feeling 'yeah, I got it already'. Antonioni brilliantly uses lonely landscapes to show how isolated these people are. But some of the performances didn't thrill me (there's a key difference between playing a shallow character and being a shallow actor, and it sometimes seems confused here). It stayed a very intellectual experience \u2013 an essay about the lack of humanity in the upper classes beautifully illustrated. But it seemed so removed and exaggerated, even from my own comfy existence, that I found I wasn't moved on a deeper level.That said, all these same criticisms could be aimed at 'Barry Lyndon', a film I have come to love deeply on repeated viewings.

It doesn't really have an atmosphere to it and, frankly, just sort of unfolds in front of you, without engaging you in a meaningful way. Of course, its purposeful moments of silence and telling but subtle glances will probably feel like a subdued and appropriate way of telling the tale if you're actually invested in any of it. It is well-made, technically speaking, and its unconventional storytelling consistently seems like it ought to be effective. It just isn't, though.

We begin with a character Anna, and the mystery is why she behaves a certain way. It is only through another woman (Monica Vitti) filling her shoes that we uncover the mystery (as much as we can ever understand another person's actions). Antonioni was interested in the distance between people and navigating the changing postwar emotional landscape. For some these films will just be too slow and interior; they need to be, because they are about the process of getting to know people, and also self-definition.I think any modern viewer who does not like \"slow\" art films but who wants to take a stab at this would be greatly benefited by listening to the commentary track (on the Criterion DVD) with the film FIRST. This is one of the absolute best film commentaries I've ever heard, someone who loves and understands the film on many levels, technical, artistic, and intention. To understand that what is on the screen is not a symbol, but exactly what the thing is, is what was new for this time, and too literal for some, that even the sets and nature are used to express action and character.This film is comparable to walking through an art gallery show.

            "content": "L'avventura was one of the first prominent examples of narrative disjointed and trailing off into nothing...booed at first screenings because large portions of the film don't do anything to move the plot forward. If anything the plot is rather listless and plain - there's somewhat of a hint of mystery surrounding the disappearance of Anna, and the characters even suggest that something is in the air like this was a thriller. But in the end she is not found, and the puzzle never solved. Modernist film at it's best. So beguiling too that many viewers still make the same complaints. The apparent missing ending where Anna's body is recovered from the sea is what they want because of conventional expectations, but it would completely dull the power and wrench the focus from the main pair. This film benefits greatly from a second watch, which allows you to discard, to put it softly, the loose plot and narcissistic dialogue and really focus on Antonioni's other elements with the knowledge that you do not have to be watching out for clues or hints regarding Anna's whereabouts. What's most impressive is how a character that is unseen for a good two thirds of the film drives such an impossibly deep chasm into the relationship of her fianc\u00e9 and friend. Here we have two ironies. The first is the confinement that these rich, decadent characters are struck by even though they have the financial and spatial freedom and youthful carelessness to pursue whatever they desire. We see this in Antonioni's wide compositions, stunning in how they create such a suffocation of the tiny figure within the idyllic holiday destinations. Never has a beautiful setting been so constricting. Their lives becomes so mundane that they even have to lie about shark attacks to spice things up, and chase lewd sexual endeavours that are surface level - see the tawdry Gloria Perkins who 'accidentally' rips her dress, and the way that Giulia basically falls over herself to embrace the boyish charm of a fresh-faced 'artist' who woos her with his crude, smutty sketches (\"No landscape is as lovely as a woman\" - a teenager's line). Sandro and Claudia too, I imagine, would have descended to this level had Anna not disappeared and plunged their existence into anguish. The less fortunate too have the same kind of problems (see the couple running the pharmacy) but are not afforded the same freedoms that these wealthy, high-class beatniks have. Ironically this dulls their existentialism pain - it is not 'true' despair they feel. They are altogether too shallow for that endeavour. Claudia complains about being ogled, but would also complain if it didn't happen. The second is the inability to communicate and the silence and suffocation of their relationships despite their close proximity. We see this in the many two shots where the characters look at each other but might as well be talking to a wall, and when the compositions are arranged so that they are right next to each other but staring out in different directions infinitely. The final shot is perhaps the best example of this, Claudia and Sandro both literally and symbolically confronted with a blank wall. The pair sleep together as they naturally fall together in their despair and search for Anna, but it is with the same shallowness as their other companions. Eventually Claudia has to come to terms with the fact that she is endlessly worrying about Anna's return wrenching Sandro away from her rather than actually finding her. Her guilt leads to the pervasive self-consciousness that the film is drenched in; a relentless questioning about the listlessness and futility of their vapid conquests, the superficiality of their connections, the painful mystery of their existence. Like the issue of Anna, there are no clear answers.",

            "content": "For me, \"L'Avventura\" carries an effect similar to a Bergman film: a lot of profound, moving imagery (brilliantly photographed), characters that seem to exist in an alternate universe (where emotions dictate every move), and a balance between pretension and 'art' that delivers on the latter about 75% of the time. It is also, like Bergman's work, a film that almost lulled me to sleep during its opening 30 minutes. After a nap, I recovered sufficiently enough to be taken in director Michaelangelo Antonioni's grip for the remainder of \"L'Avventura\"'s running time. The film is a character-driven piece, as Sandro (Gabrielle Ferzetti--\"The Night Porter\") seeks out his girlfriend, Anna (Lea Massari), who disappears without a trace on an uncharted isle; in her absence, he becomes smitten with Claudia (Monica Vitti), Anna's best friend. The rest of the \"L'Avventura\" is only vaguely about the search for Anna, instead concentrating on the awkward romance between Sandro and Claudia. While the romantic aspect is convincing and heartfelt, Antonioni allows the slim story to meander too often, leading to scenes that serve no function in the plot and add to an already overlong film (clocking in at 143 minutes). That being said, the plot really isn't an overly important aspect of \"L'Avventura\"--most of the time, the stunning sets, lush locations, dexterous camera work, and sexy cast made me forget about cinematic convention and appreciate its aesthetic merits. Still, that doesn't keep it from being overlong by at least 30 minutes and occasionally artistic to the point of pretension.",

Boredom, for a lot of meaningless and unbearable scenes and dialogues, especially in the second half of the picture; rage, for the one i felt towards those characters. Speaking of which , there's no character you should like or love: Anna, the bored girl, the personification of emptiness, dull pessimism, literally a figure consistent as the air; Sandro, the envious man with lot of regrets that is incapable of loving something and that would jump into bed with everything that breathes; Claudia, the \"bimbo\" (a dear friend of Anna..), that sacrifices herself to escort Sandro in the desperate research of Anna, with so much commitment and desperation that they nearly go to bed together after a few hours, that two days after she has known Sandro \"wants all that HE wants\". The climax of the hate i felt for them is maybe in the last scene, where a jealous Claudia finds the \"love of his life\" kissing and cuddling with a prostitute (an expensive one) in the hall of the hotel they are staying in, she runs out in the balcony, and she cries, desperate (as if she thought that a man that didn't spare a tear for his ex, that could be dead or worse, had loyalty towards her, his new doll...) Sandro runs to her, not before paying the prostitute, and after that....he cries too, the poor little boy... and as if that wasn't enough, she forgives him.I can say of myself many things, but for sure I don't get bored easily. And the funny thing is that the director, Antonioni, was surely inspired from an Alberto Moravia's book called, precisely, \"la Noia\" (Boredom). And his intention was to show this boredom mixed with regrets and incapacity to communicate of this rich people. He wanted the picture to look realistic, and i'm okay with it, but i can accept reality, for how much tedious and bitter it is, cause it is reality and in most of cases you can't run from it but you have to front it... but dear Michelangelo (rest in peace) this is a movie and if it isn't asking too much i would like to love/like at least one character, to help me get through the movie. If you make me hate all the characters of the movie, how do you expect i would like it?They made me study this movie at the \"film history\" course at the university and it is a remarkable piece of italian cinema according to lot of critiques. For what is worth i appreciate the Photography, the editing, the location and i can even appreciate that it was filmed by a small troupe with lots of budget problems, but i really don't appreciate the script, the acting (in most of the cases) and the message that supposedly and passively the movie would like to refer.

Ironically, if there's anyone that captures this YOLOL notion for me, it's Italian filmmaker Antonioni.The first hour leads us to believe that Antonioni is going to deliver on his promise of the titular adventure. It starts with a boat ride around scary cliffs where the waves keep clashing in. There's a sudden sense of danger when Anna claims to have seen a shark in the water during a swim. The party embarks on a small island on a quest to visit some ancient ruins. Then, Anna disappears.Anna's boyfriend Sandro and her best friend Claudia starts looking for Anna. During a brilliant, almost wordless segment (a device later perfected in L'eclisse), the party wanders around the island with only the ominous sound of thunder and waves (actually, consider the use of waves and the sparse soundscape throughout the movie).The search goes on, but so does life, with painful clarity, as Sandro and Claudia hesitantly yet inevitably become lovers. The literal search turns into an existential one of sorts, as Anna's disappearance doubles as a physical realization of the disappearance of emotion, happiness. It highlights our insignificance and lack of impact. Sure, the protagonists smile and laugh on occasion, but there's a sense of apathy and melancholy bubbling underneath, like when Claudia during a loving conversation suddenly seems to lose all energy. \"Everything is becoming so hideously simple,\" she proclaims at another point, and painstakingly adds; \"even to get rid of a pain.\" A lot of the dialogue is about nothing in particular, which works in a true-to-life sense, but symbolical lines also abound. The first line uttered by Anna's father \u2013 \"there's nowhere to run\" \u2013 is certainly foreboding. The double meaning in comments like \"islands, I don't get them. Surrounded by nothing but water, poor things\" is unmistakable.I can see at least two reasons for disliking L'avventura. First, the self-absorption of most characters and the fact that they complain despite their wealth can be a source of annoyance. Second, I'm not gonna lie; it's two and a half hour and not much happens. Regarding the former, as someone who is fairly privileged and undeniably miserable, I can dig, and it works for me as a reminder that existential issues transcend material status. As for the latter, the first time I saw the film I didn't enjoy it all that much precisely because nothing in particular happens for the most of the duration, but the profundity for me lies in omission rather than commission, in what isn't felt or said, much like the catalyst is a character disappearing, not appearing.",

Between the two they revolutionized film making, of that there is no doubt. What there is doubt about is whether anyone apart from film students will get much out of watching them forty-odd years later. I have an uneasy relationship with 'Breathless' but I do get some entertainment value out of it, especially the performances of the charismatic Belmondo and Seberg, who at least play characters I'm interested in. 'L'Avventura' is much more difficult because the two main characters (played by Monica Vitti and Gabriele Ferzetti) hold no interest for me. I don't care about them, their ennui, or what happens to them. Sorry. Both movies use genre conventions (in 'Breathless' the hard boiled crime thriller, in 'L'Avventura' the Hitchcockian mystery) as excuses for experimenting with film itself, editing, camera angles, framing shots, dialogue, and how to tell a story (or more importantly how NOT to tell a story, because plot in both movies in minimal and not the most important element). For these reasons they are worth watching. But if you are an old fashioned viewer who values PLOT or CHARACTER over aesthetics, then this is probably not the movie for you. Watching 'L'Avventura' I am taken back to being a little boy chided by my mother and forced to eat cabbage and brussels sprouts - \"But they are GOOD for you!\". Maybe, but I'd rather have that juicy steak over there, or some luxurious desert. Sitting through 'L'Avventura' is too much like doing homework, and while I am as interested in the history of cinema as much as the next guy, that is not the main reason I watch movies. I watch them to be entertained or to get some insight into people. This movie isn't entertaining, and apart from \"the rich can be as dissatisfied as anybody else\" doesn't say much, at least nothing most people haven't figured out by their teens. Life is meaningless and the things we use to distract ourselves (money, sex, travel, food, clothes) ultimately don't help. Yeah, tell me something I don't know. I must admit Antonioni's movies are not my bag. 'Blowup' is the only film of his I genuinely enjoy, the rest are way too cold and cerebral for my liking.

As I was fascinated with the first two, I opted to go for another one.It was mostly the unconventional plot, which especially attracted me to l'avventura. One of the main protagonists disappearing mysteriously quite at the beginning, a fact that later on in the movie is almost forgotten and never resolved, this was so unusual that I really had to see this one. Considering this, I was of course in a completely different situation than the first nighters, who did not have this information and hence probably were waiting for the whole rest of the film for the riddle to be resolved. As their expectations were not met, the film apparently was being barracked at its premiere.My expectations, however, still were a bit discharged, because the lost person is not as much forgotten in the movie as most movie comments suggest. After the disappearance, there can always be felt a certain indisposition among the new lovers. Due to this fact, the film to me is not so negative since after all, people in the movie still have their qualms whether it is right to forget so soon There is, of course, a certain decadency in the life style of the boat trip society, but a life in riches usually gives this impression to the ones, who do not have the luxury of being idle from financial sorrows. Moreover, the lush environments in Sicily (beautifully captured by Mr. Antonioni's long takes) also contribute to this impression and to the mindset of enjoying life.What was it then what Mr. Antonioni motivated for this kind of movie? This can only be a guess but I think that Mr. Antonioni was mostly interested in showing that moral values not necessarily hold if people are exposed to emotional excitement in stress situations, especially with the growing importance of individualism. Confusion and opportunity make the thief, so to say. Probably he also wanted to show how unimportant each of us becomes once he has left the scenery, as life always needs to go on. This may not be a pleasant thought but it cannot really be denied.Moreover, the flawless performances by Gabriele Ferzetti and a fascinating Monica Vitti alongside with the beauty of its camera work make this movie overall to a gem, that has to be recommended to all those who are looking for a movie that, for its loose ends, probably would no longer be produced nowadays.",

The film concerns the disappearance of the character Anna during a Mediterranean boating trip, and the subsequent romance of her fianc\u00e9e Sandro and best friend Claudia. Though initially L'avventura appears to be a mystery, the lack of resolve regarding Anna's disappearance makes the film function more as an art- house drama about the existential ennui of the leisure class. Though certain scenes drag on, the film as a whole holds up well and lives up to its stature as one of the key texts of 1950s/60s European art-house cinema.When a group of upper-class friends go on vacation in the Mediterranean, a young woman named Anna (Lea Masari) disappears during a stop at an island. Anna's husband-to-be Sandro (Gabriel Ferzetti) and close friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) subsequently lead a search initiative and become lovers. Like a shark attack Anna fakes before her disappearance, Sandro and Claudia's affair is merely performed as a means to escape the ennui of their luxurious lives, to rekindle a lost feeling of excitement. The film ends with Claudia catching Sandro with another woman; their \"adventure\" over, the characters are left to continue their monotonous existence.The pacing can be slow, and many scenes linger on for extended periods of time, becoming longueurs which test the viewer's patience. However, both the acting and script-writing are well-executed in that they come across seamless and never pop out at you in a cringe-worthy way. The film's greatest strength lies in the camera-work of Antonioni and cinematographer Aldo Scavanda. There's a painterly level of composition to many of the shots, for example the way Antonioni's camera pans right to a rule of thirds shot of the search party cross-armed against the island backdrop, upset at not having found Anna - Antonioni is very good at conveying narrative on a purely visual level.In summary, L'avventura is an important text in 60's art-house cinema and still worth revisiting for modern movie goers. From the 70's movie brats to Sofia Coppola, directors attempting to tell stories of wide-screen alienation have drawn heavily from Antonioni, and this is probably one of the director's most famous films. It may at times be tedious, but one can't deny its artistry and the driving truth of its themes, nor its role in influencing a generation of filmmakers.8/10",

One of them disappears; this affects the lives of the others, but she is never found.Director Michelangelo Antonioni, shooting in more or less real time, took a giant leap forward with L'Avventura, starting out with conventional narrative (the missing woman's lover makes a pass at her best friend with indecent haste), but then virtually dispensing with it, instead creating visual moods signalled by the volcanic landscapes. The film is a challenging, rigorous exercise, but a fascinating one. It is the first of a \"trilogy\" by Antonioni, followed by La notte (1961) and L'eclisse (1962).",

I have to see it myself. I have given it the benefit of the doubt by bothering to read several of the comments here. I'm glad there are those of you that got something special out of this film. A good editor with a sharp knife could have improved this film considerably. Even that would still not be enough for me.Certainly the cinematography was beautiful. I just returned from a trip to Sicily and that was the initial motivations for viewing this film. It turns out that even that was not enough for me.I don't mind that Antonioni's motivation for doing the film was to explore the delicacy of human relations. I do mind that he disguised his purpose for so long. Okay, I get it that Anna brings it on herself to encourage Sandro's wandering eye. But Claudia's motivation is a mystery to me. Antonioni spends too little time motivating Claudia. Even the kiss on he boat is not nearly enough. Sandro didn't appear to be THAT good a kisser. Where Antonioni DID spend his time was largely wasted. The interminable search for Anna on the island. In real life real characters would certainly search thoroughly. But we don't have to see ALL of it. Other directors and editors have discovered ways to shorten the screen time and still give us the impression that a serious and thorough search was made. And Claudia's \"running down the hall\" scene ... hello? What about abandoned town of Noto scene? The deeper meaning was lost on me. If this is a part of the \"new\" language and \"new\" images everyone is talking about, well, I just don't like it. I spent 30 years in the movie biz and if I learned one thing, it's that screen time costs money. If it doesn't have a direct bearing on the plot, don't put it in. Again, if Antonioni is just breaking this rule to give us a new way at looking at movies, I don't like it.It's okay if it's not important to Antonioni as to what happens to Anna. But I feel that it is unfair for him to expect us to pay to see his movie and not tell us. We are regular folks and have a regular curiosity. But by the time this ponderous epic was finally at an end, I really didn't care either.And as to the ending, this really didn't do the women's movement any favors, did it? Like the \"battered woman syndrome\", she takes him back almost immediately. Bummer.I will give it another look. So many have said you need at least two viewings. Many have also said that it helps considerablu to read what critics have said in order to completely understand it. This is just wrong on so many levels. If a film can't stand on its own, it's just poorly done. I have seen many films that I have gotten more out of each time I see them, but they were always films that were worth re-watching after a first viewing. I can't say that for me this is one of them.I gave it a 6 for the cinematography.",

This major work are innovative in many ways: it is a movie that breaks free of the traditional narrative and in doing so becomes very confusing at first, but for those who are patient will emerge as quite fascinating and profound.

            "content": "This movie is a masterpiece, certainly, but as admirable as it is for its technical mastery and genre inversion, it somehow fails to entertain. This should not discourage anyone from watching it, they should simply know what they are getting into from the outset. More than anything, this is an experiment of film: testing new possibilities for the medium (a trend that Antonioni would follow in the next two installments in this trilogy, La Notte and L'Eclisse) and new methods of emotional manipulation. The first thing to notice is the camera- work and direction style. It is a truly beautiful film, jumping from extreme close-ups characterized by frenetic movement to wide overhead shots of an island or city in which one or two distant figures can be viewed etching out their paths like ants in the sand. It often distracts from the underlying story, especially in the later parts of the movie when the story itself has almost seemed to vanish along with the missing girl who acts as the focal point of the film, if it can be said to have one. The story itself offers some severe challenges to the audience. The first thirty minutes are devoted to establishing the mystery involved in the disappearance of Anna, the best friend of one of the film's protagonists and lover of the second. In a departure from the traditions of the genre, however, this mystery does not lead to a criminal conspiracy or hard-boiled investigation, but is instead followed by a series of the most mundane events imaginable. This is not to say that the lives of the two protagonists do not turn upside down, merely that this upheaval is internal rather than dependent upon external circumstances. As their half-hearted attempts to locate Anna lead them nowhere, Claudia and Sandro find themselves committing a more profound betrayal than if they had abandoned Anna to die outright: moving on with their lives. Rather than serving as the primary driver of the film, the mystery is covered up like an untreated wound festering just beneath the surface and infecting everything around it. Eventually the two characters reach a point in which the reappearance of Anna would no longer be the solution to a problem, but would in fact be the culmination of one. The final scene is striking in its ambiguity. Are we witnessing redemption, or the final stages of the fall from grace? Even the music seems to be unable to decide.",

            "review_title": "Love, Antonioni Style",
            "content": "Of all the directors in the Italian Neorealism movement, there isn't one quite as transformative over the entirety of his career than Michelangelo Antonioni. Through the span of two decades, he goes from using the soap-opera conventions of \"Story of a Love Affair\" to the rule breaking, Godard-esque, posh, hipster phenomenon of \"Blow-Up\". It's a long a vibrant career for one of the world's most cherished filmmakers. The films he made in between, however, think about the troubles of the human couple, and our inability to make rational decisions all the time when it comes to love and lust. \"La Notte\" and \"Red Desert\" both experiment the complexities of the human experience, through relationships and betrayals of relationships. Of the films leading up to \"Blow-Up\", one in particular is hailed as the best example of his curiosity of the unstable human character, and that it is the picture, \"L'Avventura\". Considering the genre of romance, this I would assume is the \"Lawrence of Arabia\" of said genre. It's an epic take on a frighteningly realistic idea that we all may or may not have considered when in a rocky relationship. The question is, is infidelity really worth it, when no one is looking? \"L'Avventura\" opens with the establishment of Sandro and Anna, a couple in a stage of deterioration. They try so hard to put the passion back into their relationship, but they just hate each other. The scene when Sandro visits Anna in her room, the negative chemistry between the two is simply brilliant. Anna kisses his lips, when she really wants to bite his face off. You can see the hatred between them building with every moment. As a way to spice things up, they take a yacht trip with another couple off the coast of Sicily, to visit the towering islands that make up the coast. This is one of the moments where I fell in love with the movie the most. Antonioni uses the entire space of the frame absolutely tremendously. As the yacht approached the island of Basiluzzo, it just leaves you in awe. The calm ocean flowing as the yacht approaches a huge mass of land, which seemed separated from all of human life. When it comes to location scouting, Antonioni couldn't have attempted to find a better one. This is one the most beautiful environments ever captured on cinema. In essence, the first hour of the movie on the island captures the spirit of the characters. You get the feeling of isolation, anger, fear and uncertainty, especially in the scenes where the couples search for Anna when she goes missing. When Claudia runs out to the cliff during the stormy evening, and screams Anna's name in desperation, we all feel the same way. The rain just pours down on the spiky rocks as everyone begins to lose their sense of reason as to where Anna is. What is arguably even more haunting than the environment of the first hour of the picture, is of course the relationship that buds between Claudia and Sandro for the rest of the picture. It's truly a shocking turn of events. Without even second guessing himself, he moves on to another women after spending the night searching for his wife with her. All bets are off, it seems, with finding and rekindling his love for Anna. Antonioni is telling us that love can change on the flip of a dime. Once we lose track of what we have, we have no problem moving on to the next lover we can find. The fragility of relationships, as Antonioni has it, is very dire. The end of the movie is what moved me the most, and seemed frightening to so many people when the film was released. Out of the clear blue, in the night after a lavish party, Anna returns to reconcile and make love with Sandro. When Claudia runs away, visibly upset, Sandro follows her outside. They meet at the edge, atop a building, as Sandro weeps, for he now love Claudia, but now knows that Anna being alive will haunt him forever. Claudio comforts him, and the film ends. It's a shocking end. Antonioni frames it an astounding way, as he follows the characters around the environment as they collapse under the heap of temptation and desperation. The music even builds to a screeching finale. The whole movie ends more like a thriller, and less like a romantic-drama, which was such a unique creative choice for Antonioni. This ending in particular is what separates \"L'Avventura\" from any other movie in its genre. It stuns you with its sexiness, and blindsides you at the end for falling into its trap. \"L'Avventura\" is a haunting romantic-thriller, and an excellent Antonioni film that exemplifies his incredible gift at storytelling. Nothing is ever subtle in any of his films, and that's what I enjoy most about them. They hit you hard, when you are least expecting it. Even if you don't know it at first, and I certainly didn't, \"L'Avventura\" is going to stick with me.",

Imagine Faith Hill with a Neapolitan profile, a Catholic (as opposed to Protestant) guilt complex and an earthy, almost boyish exuberance. L'Avventura, translated in English to mean The Adventure, is the story of a woman (Vitti) who joins her best friend, her best friend's lover, and a gaggle of wealthy Italians on a boat trip near Sicily. The best friend mysteriously disappears during an excursion to a barren island in the Mediterranean. The remainder of the film involves Vitti's search for her friend, as clues point to the possibility that she left the island on a boat and is spotted, via missing-persons and newspaper reports, here and there on the mainland. Vitti is intermittently joined by the misplaced woman's lover (Gabriele Frezetti), with whom she falls in love against her better judgment.L'Avventura and La Dolce Vita were released in the same year and have similar themes: they both focus on the emptiness of the very wealthy and a fruitless search for sensual pleasure. Antonioni's film captures the milieu with a unique style, oddly framed camera angles, full depth of focus in every shot, a meandering pace and virtually no music. The film does not have a plot in the conventional sense, and to me seemed like two stories in one. Essentially, it is the study of a woman drowning in an emotionally bankrupt social strata. Lonely, gentle readers will no doubt see their own emotional bankruptcy reflected in this brilliant Italian masterpiece.",

And for those who don't understand this film, it is easy to beat it down with their stupid reasons. While this film is clearly gorgeous, the way the story is told allows the film to emphasize how insanely gorgeous it is. This is easiest to notice in the beginning of the film, when they are on the boat. The story is laid out all in this sequence, but it actually wouldn't take as long as it did if another Antonioni didn't write/direct it. All the shots the progress the story are done in a short amount of time than how much time Antonioni allows us to dwell in the moment. Which, is where people find it boring. Which sounds very understandable, but not everyone realizes how literate Antonioni is just when he is moving the camera from place to place. I'm not saying that the film is meant to take place in your head by doing this, but Antonioni makes us realize how much is actually going on, even when nothing is going on. Not everyone is going to love this technique, but at the Cannes film festival it was given an award for creating a new language and for it's astonishing visuals. Which, I think is enough to say that this is an outstanding achievement no matter what people think of it. It is much like \"Citizen Kane\", in a way. The uneducated viewer may (not always) find it boring and doesn't care much for anything else in the film, but the more you know about film the more you come to adore the film.

            "content": "Now this is an interesting situation. Upon this movie's release in the Cannes Film Festival, the audience's reaction was very negative and almost violent. In response, several critics signed a statement recognizing \"L'Avventura\" as an important film that \"created a new cinematic language.\" Ever since then, this movie has been famous and well-liked, despite initial audience distaste. What happened? Are we all just letting critics tell us what's good? Did the film really speak in a \"language\" unrecognizable to a large group of people? And above all, what's the film really \"about\"? These are the questions that \"L'Avventura\" tends to bring up in most discussions.What I find particularly fascinating, actually, is how all that happened. At this point in time, people were very familiar with Neorealism, and though this doesn't exactly have the same motifs, a lot of its \"new cinematic language\" seems to have taken a cue from this well-known and well-respected movement. It might not contain such direct social statements as Neorealism was prone to do, but it definitely takes a cue from the listless and directionless quality of characterization and movement. Mix that point with Antonioni's stunning visual sense, and it's not really like the movie needed much of a story at all.On that matter, however, hinges a point which helps to understand this famous piece of art: this movie is much more about nothing than it is about something, a theme audiences have always been aversive to. But another thing that I find fascinating about this film and its history is how much people overstate it's sense of nothingness. Read any review or synopsis of \"L'Avventura,\" and you'll read something about how after the affair between Sandro and Claudia begins, the search for Anna is forgotten and remains unresolved. This is a complete lie. Anna is always there, hanging over the emotions and conflict of the characters, made very powerful by her absence. Anna is literally a manifestation of narrative negative space--her absence makes a stronger and more dramatic presence then her physical presence. A major part of what drives this movie is the characters' doubt over what exactly happened.And perhaps that is what the critics recognized. Or maybe it was the fact that said absence is created especially daunting by two rhyming images in the film, the one where Claudia opens the door on the island and the one where she looks out over the villa after her night of insomnia. Both moments spend a prolonged amount of time on empty space... there may be rocks, sea, sunlight, buildings, sky, but everything is blocked and square in both images like a modern art painting (I think Antonioni can be considered the consummate modernist filmmaker). These images reflect the spiritual isolation that the characters feel, but they also give a sense of universal voyeurism, as if whether absent or not, in some way Anna or the manifestation of what Anna means to Claudia and Sandro is still there, like a highly acute guilt complex.At any rate, critics and audience aside, somehow this movie has managed to subsist and remain recognized over time, and beyond all its discussion of semiotic language and newly realized narration is a movie that has somehow managed to grasp an relatively understated aspect of the character's lives. The reason why it may have been disliked AND the reason it sticks in people's minds is probably because \"L'Avventura\" so well recognizes an aspect of human life that everyone has experienced but not so many people have realized.--PolarisDiB",

The film chronicles her friends search for her and their ensuing love affair.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Love and desire are complex things. \"The Adventure\" referenced in the title refers to not knowing someone and discovering who they are.....often times, over and over again. The underlying message of the film is that you can never really know someone you love and figuring out who they are is a never ending process.PROS AND CONS: This is one of those films that is considered a classic. The film won a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival when it was shown back in the 1960s. I have always wanted to watch it but was never able to find enough time to sit through the whole film uninterrupted. After finally watching the entire work I must say that I was impressed.The film is beautifully shot and very intimate. It makes the viewer try and find meaning when there may not be any. There is obviously something going on with the characters, especially Anna at the beginning of the film, but we are not told what it is. These characters are playing games, but their motivation and meaning remain a mystery. There are hints of early Bergman in this work, but with much more passion between the characters. The use of cinematography in the film is outstanding, creating an intimate world of beauty and loneliness. The use of the Italian landscapes, seascapes, countryside, and architecture are stunning and create an hypnotic background for the protagonists in the picture.While watching the film it is almost impossible to take your eyes off the central characters. It is as though they are about to divulge some secret that is laying just below the surface, but in the end they remain silent and the viewer is left with an insatiable wondering about what is going to happen. It is as though the viewer is thrown into their lives without knowing the whole story and we can only watch as they struggle to come to terms with their passions and their guilt. This could be considered a 'chick flick although not the standard Hollywood variety. It deals with deep emotions and the struggle of rational thought over desire.There are a few cons in this film. It is dated in some of it's cinematic technique. The train rushing through the countryside in the middle of a passionate love scene is a bit of a clich\u00e9 by today's standards, but may have had profound symbolism when the film was made. American viewers might have a problem with the lack of a neat and tidy plot that has a beginning an arch and a conclusion. It is there, but it is pretty subtle.",

She exudes a sadness and depth of character you'll only find in novels. This is film as novel, and requires your undivided attention. There's a lot going, sublte characterization, frame composition thats integral to the story. Antonioni is always in complete control, nothing happens and noone speaks without a reason. An epic film about communication and the vain pursuit of happiness.There are so many scenes worth talking about, but i'll mention just one: atop the church, Vitti and Ferzetti ringing the churchbells like children playing, other church bells responding...simply the most gorgeous sequence ever filmed and a very sophisticated metaphor.Everything you think you know about film, you can toss out the window. Antonioni redefines the artform as only Bergman, Kubrick, Tarkovsky, and Kurosawa have done.",

By the last 20 minutes it becomes clear said boyfriend is going to cheat on Claudia and he is caught in the act. He goes after Claudia, sits on a bench. Cries. Claudia decides to comfort the loser.

            "content": "I first sat through L'Aventura a few years ago when a video store was selling all it's VHS stock out. A highly praised film, a legend among the Art House crowd ( I have retro sensibility) and a film landmark. OK, a song is what I can afford, might as well check it out.I sat engrossed for over two hours as not much happened to a group of sophisticated, superficial, upper middle class Italians on an outing to a deserted island. Well, something did happen, one of their party disappeared. Better find her! If she's not on the island somebody must try and track her down. After I watched it< I kept returning to it in my mind. In these days when people decry the lack of memorable dialog in films and the lack of coherent stories, here is one of the greatest films of Cinema history that has neither quality. It has stunning B&W photography and personable actors that seem to be the people they are playing. I read somewhere that this film is now seen as an 'antique' as most artistic breakthroughs seem with the passing of the years. I beg to differ.The impersonalization of human beings in a rich, decadent culture will never go out of style, especially today when we find ourselves sinking deeper into this ever-thickening soup. Antonioni's genius was to lock into it and through his film-making artistry and refinement portray an aspect of the Western march-of-progress that people are only now beginning to grasp. And he filmed this in 1959! (Maybe Italy was ahead of the curve in those days).If the above sounds like over-intellectualized nonsense, than so be it. What is certain is that L'Aventura is to Antonioni what Birth of a Nation was to D. W. Griffeth. Not every movie lover will like it, let alone sit through it enraptured - but they should.Oh yeah, I forgot, it's entertaining.",

And no discernible character development. I watched this film because I was too young (b.1942)to see it when it came out. I had seen \"Blow-Up\" by the same director when it appeared in my youth and thought it boring beyond words. Overall this film confirmed my view that the director is a poseur.

            "review_title": "Overrated",
            "content": "Some films that are labeled classics, or great films, are not even good films. Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless immediately comes to mind. Others, like Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, whose title literally means The Adventure, as well as Italian slang for a one night stand, are not necessarily bad, but still only interesting failures, and not worthy of their reputation. L'Avventura was the first in a trilogy of black and white widescreen films Antonioni would make about alienation and personal anomy. The making of such trilogies was the rage at the time in European cinema, and, to an extent, still is. The trilogy was rounded out by La Notte and L'Eclisse in the two following years. When L'Avventura was released in 1960, it was greeted with catcalls at its world premiere, but won a Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and film critics championed it around the world. A few years later, one poll of critics listed it as the third greatest film of all time, after Citizen Kane and Battleship Potemkin. It now comes nowhere near Top Twenty lists. Both L'Avventura and Breathless were part of a claimed European revolution in film, where symbolism came to its apogee, and also included Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8\u00bd, and the rest of the French New Wave. The reality of the film lies somewhere between the extremes. L'Avventura is a film that attempts much, but, after its interesting first third, it totally unravels with bad characterization, and narrative anomy, which is the fault of its three screenwriters, Antonioni, Elio Bartolini, and Tonino Guerra.It follows a group of rich hedonists who are frolicking in the Mediterranean, off of Sicily, in the Aeolian Sea. The three main characters are Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), a playboy architect, his frigid and scheming fianc\u00e9e Anna (Lea Massari), and Anna's best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti), the archetypal gorgeous brunet and gorgeous blond. They sail to a deserted island, Lisca Bianca, and during the course of their adventure, Anna simply disappears. Before she does, we have seen that she does not love Sandro, is passive-aggressive towards Claudia, and generally disdainful of her life and all others in it. She solicits sex to fill her inner emptiness, and gets her jollies by playing her friends with false claims of a shark in the waters. Before the other characters realize Anna has disappeared, we see a small boast speed away from the island\u0085. L'Avventura, despite its reputation for being innovative, fails for the exact same reasons that most less supposedly innovative films do- it has cardboard characters, does not follow through on an intriguing premise, throws in an unneeded romance that never convinces a viewer of its participants' sparks, goes on far too long, and is far too pretentious. On a more mundane level, I wish some of the money spent on the restoration could have been used to hire competent actors to dub the film into English. No DVD of quality should lack this feature. Film is a visual medium, and for a film which is supposedly so visual, this should be a must. If only this film's fans and apologists would actually take only what is seen on screen, and not imbue the film with what they think is there, or feel was intended, then a more just and objective evaluation of this film as an interesting, but ultimately failed, attempt at something different, could be agreed upon.In short, in art, intent is meaningless, because if not, we'd have to believe that very recognition of Antonioni's intent to bore the viewer somehow obviates the natural reaction of boredom, and thus all dull films could claim that boredom was their actual intent, thus leaving them not open to criticism on those grounds. Fortunately, intent is meaningless, and in that way one can say that L'Avventura misses the mark as a work of art, and is nowhere near as good as its vast reputation. Whether or not it's an actually bad film may depend only upon how much you value style over content, or gorgeous Italian babes in bathing suits. There are worse things to have to ponder, eh?",

            "content": "L'AVVENTURA was director Michaelangelo Antonioni's first international hit, winning the Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Here a small group of rich Italian socialites takes a boat out to a volcanic island. Anna (Lea Massari) quarrels with her fianc\u00e9e Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), and subsequently goes missing. The police are brought in and divers scour the waters, but Anna never turns up. One would expect the film to develop as a whodunit, either revealing Anna to still be alive or putting the finger on the person responsible for her disappearance.Instead, Anna never shows up, and the film goes off in a rather different direction. Anna's friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) is suddenly promoted from a background character to the very centre of the picture, with her interaction with Sandro driving the action. While the film lacks a traditional plot, and indoor scenes tend to be brief arguments between lovers, the main part of the film is held together with a series of long shots of landscapes. Appreciating Antonioni's style requires some work, but as in the lengthy late works of composers Morton Feldman or Toru Takemitsu, eventually the rewards come. The scenes of the ocean while the party is on the volcanic island are beautifully constructed and will have stayed with me after the film ends. Furthermore, becoming comfortable with L'AVVENTURA makes one all the more ready for Antonioni's later films, which further develop this theme of human beings unable to connect with each other or the changing world around them.Antonioni's casting of Monica Vitti was brilliant, for in a film that requires the female protagonist to stand as a witness to everything going on around her, Vitti's statuesque beauty is just the ticket. Esmeralda Ruspoli plays a ditzy young lady well, adding a touch of humour to what otherwise would have been a deathly serious film. And though the plot is untraditional, and the existential themes take a backseat to the composition, I'd say there is some closure, with Sandro's inner self stripped naked by the end.One further aspect of the film that I've only recently come to appreciate is its sort of exploration of Southern Italian culture. Antonioni was from Emilia-Romagna in the north of Italy, and his wealthy characters in the film come from Rome. The setting highlights the substantial divisions that exist within a supposedly unified country, as the south is significantly less prosperous, its people are of shorter stature, and of course Monica Vitti gets a lot of staring and wolf-whistles due to the south's culture of machismo. If you speak Italian, you can see how Antonioni uses the substantial difference between Italian dialect as another instance of people failing to communicate with each other.",

Most of the film is shot with a wide lens to get the immense landscape in the background. The characters are dwarfed in these shots and it suggests different things like how insignificant we all are. And Monica Vitti gives a truly wonderful performance. Maybe one of the greats. Her character is so complex and Vitti is asked to show an array of emotions and she does so convincingly. A great performance that would have hurt the film terribly had she not been so great. And she wasn't even nominated for an academy award! The best part of the story for me is watching these two characters fall in love but both still love the woman they are searching for! An extremely well directed and photographed film that is very thought provoking and Vitti is a terrific choice to headline this film.",

Anna is unfulfilled yet the only character who seeks guidance and an understanding of how to live (as represented by the books she leaves behind). Though there are initial attempts to find \"her\", almost everyone quickly moves on. Antonioni pointedly displays men as animalistic in their treatment of women as desirable objects that are disposable and interchangeable.Without guidance from other sources we are left to ourselves to decide how to live life. Claudia as the protagonist feels her feelings and emotions strongly but does not know how they can guide her on her path. Empty churches = empty pleasure, empty wealth and empty relationships. She ends the film accepting \"love\" that does not meet her expectations.Artful directing, particularly the carefully orchestrated blocking and staging, beautiful cinematography.

            "content": "It's been remarked that this is a very visual film, and that unquestionably rings true to me. Michelangelo Antonioni's orchestration of shots and scenes as director, and Aldo Scavarda's cinematography, are terrifically sharp and vivid if not outright arresting, an utter pleasure to behold as a viewer and without a doubt the most consistent aspects of the feature. Eraldo Da Roma's smooth editing comes in a close second behind this pair. The filming locations range from fetching to gorgeous, and in short order other facets like production design, art direction, hair and makeup, and costume design aren't far behind. I don't even rightly know how to describe it, but in its visual presentation 'L'avventura' is uniquely precise, natural, calculated, fluid, and vibrant, all at once, and all the time, in a way that's especially striking. Even at that, I'm not sure that the movie seems so distinct in this regard as to be hailed as a model for all those titles to follow it, yet there can be no doubt that Antonioni and Scavarda in particular prove themselves to be fine craftsmen.It's important to note the visual presentation right away not only because it's so excellent in the first place, but also because outside of that which our eyes take in, the picture seems less than flawless. It's not that the acting is bad, because it's not; I think the cast turn in solid performances, with Monica Vitti and Gabriele Ferzetti being most noteworthy given that more time on-screen means more time to shine. It's not that the music is bad, because it's not; I quite like Giovanni Fusco's score. These elements just don't readily leap out in the same way that the visuals do. And it's not that the screenplay is bad, because it's not; the story is theoretically compelling, and the scene writing, even if I don't think every last detail is wholly suitable for the narrative (e.g. The scene in the sewing shop) or fully convincing (the progression of the dynamics between Claudia and Sandro). It's certainly true that the plot is ultimately rather light, though, accentuated by the fact that wide swaths of the dialogue could be dispensed with and nothing would be lost. In fact, part of me feels like 'L'avventura' could be rewritten with new dialogue, pointedly changing the tale so long as it still comports to the imagery before us, and we'd still effectively have the same movie.Say of the writing what one will, however; there's one fault that decidedly stands out more. The pacing is not great. The first hour meanders so blithely, conveying so little in that time, that it becomes downright soporific; one hour took me two to watch because I really did keep falling asleep. The remaining length is more eventful, yet also weirdly deficient in its communication of the plot - just as the state of the primary characters' relationship to one another feels a little arbitrary, the broad strokes of their geographical journey are much clearer than the purpose of the stops they make along the way. With that in mind, even though more is happening on-screen after the first hour, still the pacing seems just as unbothered, as though the proceedings are just kind of shuffling around instead of meaningfully going anywhere. And for all this: oh yes, the visuals remain just as enticing, a real treat for movie lovers. Whether the camera is showing us landscapes, cityscapes, interiors, or shots of characters near or far, the result is always exquisite. Yet no matter how perfect a film may look, do the visions to greet us really matter if the storytelling is emphatically Lesser Than?This is the second feature from Antonioni that I've watched, and the second for which my regard diverges significantly from popular opinion. The disparity isn't quite so great as with 1966's 'Blowup,' and I don't specifically dislike 'L'avventura,' but my thoughts on it are quite divided. The fundamental sights before us are totally splendid. The course of events they are intended to relate, from scattered small moments to major character relationships to the overall narrative, are substantially weaker. What we have then, in my estimation, is questionable material rendered with exemplary execution; the latter elevates the former, but is that enough? I'm glad for those that get more out of this movie; I'd like to say the same for myself. Unlike 'Blowup,' I can at least say that I understand how other viewers could derive more earnest meaning from this, its elder. Still, whatever it is that other folks have seen in 'L'avventura,' what I see is a stunning visual presentation that does its best to aid its companion component of storytelling that struggles to limp along. I don't regret watching it; I am, however, unsure that the visuals alone especially made it worth three and a half hours of my time.",

To the viewer, the film isn't an adventure as the title would suggest. To the characters, the plot is an adventure filled mostly of sadness.

Like Peter Weir's later film Picnic at Hanging Rock, there is little plot as such, the film focusing on the responses of those affected, but if Weir's film is sensual and erotic, then Antonioni's black and white study is haunting, almost elegiac in parts. The fracturing of relationships has been a theme common to many of the director's films, but Vitti's outstanding performance in her debut role helps to make this into a wonderful study of a woman's unpredictability and responsiveness to mood. Rarely have the subtleties of a woman's emotional responses been so well captured in cinema. The film also marks the beginnings of change in post-war Italian social mores.

Moreover, he chose the wealthy family to depict the lonesomeness, materialistic approach of human being social life model.Claudia was in a turmoil throughout the whole movie, torn by her emotions, Sandro kept a steadfast attitude throughout the movie (a part from the last scene which I'm going to comment on later symbolizing the ''who next to f***'' paradigm, Antonioni uses silent scene to dig deep down the characters. each scene was represented on the other side by a natural and cultural landscape be it sea, island, architecture, fields \u0085. In the hotel art gallery scene where people from different nationalities were there to give their comments about some paintings, Antonioni singled out how ART is important to human life, and we noticed the difference between those people interested in art starring so breathtakingly at the paintings and the main characters of the movie! There are so many scenes about the unreasonable and unexplained nature of our sexual desires, so mysterious that they can't be handled, and Antonioni focused so much on that from Anna's disappearance to the hotel prostitute, how can we give some sense to our sexual relationships and how are we to restrain this inexplicable natural desires that we human beings haven't come yet to grasp.Even sex wasn't a refuge to the boredom and lonesome that the characters nothingness existence so tormented them, I want to go back to a scene where the young painter aged 17 was to show Giulia some painting and she found out that they were all painting of naked women, she then embraced and kissed the half her age boy, and urging Claudia to get out, that is to say the characters weren't able to find a meaning for their lives, still they haven't settled their minds about what are they in truly profound meaning!When Claudia saw Sandro with the prostitute at the hotel bar she went out running and Sandro followed her and then he sat crying his eyes out, Claudia surprisingly managed to comfort him, that is to say they have finally got to accept each other's nature, and each other's mistakes notwithstanding that they love each other.L'avventura is my first Antonioni's film and I was surprised how in some comments that I've read right before watching the movie that criticized Antonioni's film for being boring and slow-paced.

            "content": "L'Avventura / The Adventure (1960) :\nBrief Review -Michelangelo Antonioni's compassionate love story breaks traditional narrative methods with unusual pacing and characters, but makes no theoretical sense. It doesn't bother me what big words Martin Scorsese spoke about \"L'Avventura,\" because the ultimate motive didn't justify his statement or the film's subject. That's strictly my opinion. Others may vary, or rather, others must vary. The film is a progressive take on love-triangle, at least it starts off like that. An unhappy woman disappears during a Mediterranean boat trip. During the search, her lover and her best friend become attracted to each other. The lover wants to be practical while the girl is not ready to get over sentimental trauma. The mixture sounds interesting, but it doesn't grow as it should have been. Both of them change their minds suddenly and go back to their old principles for no reason. The kiss on the boat indicated the rest of the story much before it actually happens in the film. We don't have any clarification on the missing girl's whereabouts either. That would have made it more reliable and proofed. I don't know, maybe it's just me who hates such immoral romance and vulgarity in the movies, because I'm more of a moral cinema lover. A love triangle like Casablanca (1942) or \"J'Accuse\" (1919) or even something like \"Dodsworth\" (1936) and \"Brief Encounter\" (1945) fascinates me more because they prove out to be morally sensible stories. With L'Avventura, that aspect was murdered in the first half only, so it didn't really create any sympathy for the compassionate love story that takes place later. Otherwise, it's a very good modernised piece of filmmaking by the maverick director, and the performances are damn realistic. If it weren't for immortal love and infidelity, I would have liked it better.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "A landmark film. You could just let it go at that, but perhaps the best take on it beyond its obvious great eye, is it may still be the finest existentialist work ever. Period. Of course, thus dubbed, it is fated to be greeted with howls of laughter, right? A treatise on emptiness. And a rather boring one at that, at least according to those who find the stuff on the island compelling at the rest of it a letdown, comparatively. Probably so. The latter half is not so neatly stitched together as the first, but none of that matters much with this kind of uniqueness. If you want stuff from Antonioni that is truly terrible look at his latter stuff, he made this movie over and over and over again and each one got worse, perhaps from his own boredom. Who knows. This one was the one he was born to make. The countless exchanges are the finest existentialist toss away lines of all time, the compositions perfectly matching them. And the eroticism has never been matched. Simply superb languorous kisses that go on and on: especially the one where Vitti does the whole thing for what seems an hour with her eyes open wide all through it, never before or since that kind of wonderment; in fact the entire movie is one of the pains of love, even Annas absence ascribable to a perhaps vanishing to escape Sandro.But it is easy to see how many would junk this film as boring. It is in parts, but there has never been anything like it, the wonderful island, and the ambiguous search for Anna following. Enough overall to put it as one of the twenty greatest films of all time. Antonioni did himself proud with this one.",

            "content": "The first of Michaelangelo Antonioni's \"ennui\" trilogy, (the others being, respectively, \"La Notte\" and \"L'Eclisse\"), and, for my dough, the best since it is the only one of the three to examine boredom without itself succumbing to it. At no point in Monica Vitti's and Gabriele Ferzetti's two hour and twenty minute journey (or, as Antonioni mockingly terms it, adventure) to try to find happiness and purpose in their lives was I tempted to bail. Indeed, for the most part I was captivated. Perhaps this is because whenever the film starts to sag or waver the writer/director has the knack, shared by all great film makers, of introducing characters (like the Euro trashy actress Gloria Perkins or the miserably married proprietors of a small town pharmacy) and situations (like the visit to a cold, empty hill town called Noto or a decadent, seaside hotel) that revive one's interest. Or perhaps my fascination was due to the performance of Monica Vitti whose basic humanity in an inhuman world not only anchors this film but gives it depth and moral authority and whatever small glimmer of hope that people are more than just lumps of appetite and/or nastiness. Truly one of the finest acting jobs in Italian cinema, in my opinion. And if the Academy did not have its collective head stuck up its collective rectum she would have grabbed the Oscar that stupidly went to Liz Taylor for the stupid \"Butterfield 8\".Anything not to like? Yeah, Ferzetti's performance which just cannot stand up to Vitti's. Maybe that's the point, that the character he is playing is simply weaker than she is. Or maybe it's that Antonioni does gals better than guys. Still, whenever he's on screen without her the movie is less compelling. Give it an A minus.",

Is about a girl who disappears in an island and her boyfriend and her best friend fall in loved. The development of the characters (and the space they lived in) is constructed with care and detail, and maybe in it's first viewing could be confusing and even, why not, boring. But i really recommend, if you have interest, give it another chance. I think is not so hard to understand, but maybe is an acquired taste and could be hard to digest.Monica Vitti, is specially beautiful in this film and, actually the actors deal with it's characters very well, even in it's complexity as, specially in Vitti, must change their spirit giving'a deep dimension in it's personalities and how this develop the story.I think is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Theorically, this Italian film had the ingredients to be great. An interesting story, a talented cast, beautiful women, gorgeous Italian cinematography and a great musical score. The movie starts well, with a yacht trip, involving events, stunning settings and the Italian \"babes\" of the time Monica Vitti and Lea Massari. Also, later in the movie there are wonderful settings in Italy and an interesting story of romance.Unfortunately the movie can't manage to totally captivate. It wastes too much time in a plot with little strength which has little to do with it and don't help to create a truly memorable film. Besides, the pacing is somewhat slow, or maybe it's just the movie that is too long for its pacing and flaws. It's a long movie, but that could be compensated if only it was as good as its runtime is big. Perhaps the way how the narrative structure is made is another problem and the story doesn't appear to be very well solved. Another thing I don't particularly appreciate is its apparent \"feminism\", as well as the fact that it portrays women as hopelessly complicated - they are, they really are, I know, but...Opinions on this seem to be divisive. Some see it as one of the finest ever, while others have more reservations (myself included). I can see why in both sides and I understand both sides - after all, opinions are valid.Gabriele Ferzetti, Monica Vitti and Lea Massari are great as Sandro, Claudia and Anna, respectively.",

            "content": "I had a feeling that I have to revise my review since I watched L'AVENTURA several times after I posted my recent review in 2001. You know that, if someone you knew suffered for some trouble, then most people say \"It seems that He/She had changed\". In RASHOMON, Kurosawa and co-writer Hashimoto started lying in movies. Then every clever artists, art-house film makers all over the world started to lie in films also, like Resnais, Duras, and of course Antonioni. You see, Anna didn't vanished but Antonioni lied. You can see that Anna appeared on screen all through the entire film. If people believed in his lie, they didn't get much what he wanted to say, but if some people knew that he was lying, they'll enjoy the film. Claudia searching for Anna is like flashback, tracing back of Anna's memory. Then we know what she's been afraid of. That's clever of Antonioni. posted in 2013.many people have questions, that why anna is disappeared and where she's gone? but antonioni, the director didn't told us anything about what's really happened. thanks, he didn't told us anything. so we can imagine. that's fun. i think this film is got a 2 big keywords. first, anna's got a nerve. and the most important key is second, claudia. a character played by monica vitti. she's not real, she is. she's an illusion from the start. she's anna's imaginary friend or should i say anna herself. remember the scene at the sea. it seems that people on the boat didn't noticed claudia. they didn't pay attention, and they didn't even talk to her. except anna. and i think this is the most legendary mystery in the history of movies, that suddenly, anna has disappeared. but what's happening is simple, she starts dreaming. that's why she disappeared. by the way, anna doesn't just fades away. she changes into claudia. anna is claudia, and therefore, claudia is anna. and don't forget, that, in her dreams, all the other persons are also anna herself. so if somebody blames claudia, it makes anna blaming herself. anna dreams a dream of searching for herself. what's going to make her dream such dreams? she might felt something deep inside. a sense of guilt, because she loves sandro? is she afraid of something different? why can't claudia find anna? we couldn't seem to find any answers, but at least we can feel. at the end of this film, she's still dreaming. probably she can't face the reality, eternally, as long as she lives. whether she likes it or not. all the people in the world are frightened by a nightmare, because nightmare isn't just a dream. it's reality.posted in 2001",

            "content": "\"L'avventura\" (1960) is the first film of a trilogy, with \"La notte\" (1961) and \"L'eclisse\" (1962) being the other two films.In \"L'avventura\" Anna (Lea Massari) suddenly disappears.There are more films in which characters (strangely enough always females) disappear. In some films such as \"The vanishing\" (1988, George Sluizer) and \"Gone girl\" (2014, David Fincher) there is a plot behind the disappearance. In other films such as \"Picnic at Hanging rock\" (1975, Peter Weir) but also \"L'avventura\" there is no plot behind the disappearance, the disappearance is never explained and remains a mystery.The difference behind \"Picnic at Hanging rock\" and L'avventura\" is that in \"Picnic at Hanging rock\" the mystery of the disappearance permeates the film from the beginning to the end, while in \"L'avventura\" this mystery fades more and more into the background.Anna disappears during a cruise. Most of the participants of the cruise don't seem to worry that much, with the exception of Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), the boyfriend of Anna, and Claudia (Monica Vitti), the best girlfriend of Anna. Sandro and Claudia start a search for Anna, but during this search they fall in love with each other and the original purpose of their search becomes more and more vague.The characters in \"L'avventura\" are mostly rich and bored. Their favourite weapon against boredom is engaging in sexually oriented adventures. Not only are Sandro and Claudia beginning an affair, forgetting about Anna, but one of the former cruise participants, in viewing the paintings of a young painter, almost begs him to pose naked for him.Viewed from this angle \"L'avventura\" has a very similar theme as \"La dolce vita\" (Federico Fellini) from the same year. Also in this film rich characters are fighting their boredom. \"La dolce vita\" has an hedonistic atmosphere, while alienation is the dominant mood in \"L'avventura\" and in fact in all the films of the trilogy mentioned at the beginning of this review. \"Alienation\" was a very fashionable term in the '60s and '70s, but is used less frequently today. For this reason I do believe that, contrary to the general opinion, \"L'avventura\" has aged less well than \"La dolce vita\".",

I was absolutely swept away by the intensity of this poignant film which uses the actors' skills in performing instead of beating the audience over the head with lengthly dialogue and explanation. Every stimulating inch of this film contributes to the director's message from the landscape shots of distant rocky islands to the crumbling ruins of churches and even the march of schoolchildren with their tutors. Claudia, hounded by the penetrating stares of men, watches as those closest to her succumb to opportunity instead of remaining devoted to her. Sandro is surprised by how she \"must see everything clearly.\" She cannot understand how others can lose intensity in a relationship because her devotion is ever pure and strong.",

In one sense, famous Italian director Michaelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura seems painfully plodding yet the viewer remains strangely fascinated by its rhythms.  Every framed shot is a beautiful crisp black and white postcard.  The simple story grapples with the usual issues that defined sophisticated Sixties Europe--marriage, infidelity, ego, wealth, culture.  Monica Vitti stars as the close friend of a woman whose disappearance is the only real plot device in the film.  It was only her second movie and given her amazing beauty and timeless portrayal of alienation, it is a wonder she did not become a bigger star after leaving Antonioni's tutelage (she starred shortly after this film in two other Antonioni pictures).Integral to this movie's success is the very modern use of sound.  Three very talented Italian sound technicians did their first work in this film. Two, Claudio Maielli and Fausto Ancillai, have had long careers since.  In L'Avventura the sound of rushing water fades in and out of the soundtrack creating a dreamy auralscape--be it a raging Tiber River in the background of a garret apartment or as the ever-present sound of waves hitting the beach.This is major art house but worth watching.  Hang the type A jacket on the wall, L'Avventura is about 2 and a half hours long!",

Unfortunately, directors often have similar freedom to drag out their message without the constraints of length. Sometimes though, this \"constraint\" is actually helpful to the artist towards getting his/her message across. Antonioni should have hired a better editor, because he insists, without fail, to drag out every emotion and nuance in the main characters with a dough-roller. If this is your cup of tea, if you like playing mind games with the characters in movies for hours on end, then this movie is for you (since it literally goes on for hours on end). As it is, Antonioni seems way too absorbed in the beauty of photography (to his credit, every scene is visually stunning) to bother with a film that actually might be enjoyable to watch.",

One review claims that Antonioni's black and white films were his best - but L'AVVENTURA doesn't hold a candle to the later edgy, disturbing and far more interesting BLOW UP...which he directed and which is in colour. There are aspects of these two films which are similar , the deliberate pacing , the 'unknown' , the disaffected characters, but where BLOW UP is great to look at, well acted and very much of-it's-time, L'AVVENTURA is lame, flat, staid and lacking in sufficient plot to last more than an hour. Vitti is luminous and acts well but her character is so flat and dull. The others are two-dimensional clich\u00e9s and the cinematography is as uninteresting as the story. Several reviewers rave about composition. I have no idea why. Quite frankly this is one for the film-snobs rather than the film-buffs. Avoid it. Watch BLOW UP instead!",

One woman disappears after having a disagreement over her boyfriend's infidelity.  The woman is never found, and her best friend and boyfriend become lovers.  The rest of the flick deals with the girlfriend's guilt, and the man's further infidelity.  My cut is that it deals with the infidelity of feeling rather than sex.  The movie abruptly ends.

But L'Avventura is truly one of the dullest pieces of cinema I've ever come across, and I think most people will see it this way on their first viewing.  However, even though you may not make it, this film is definately worth a look.  It deserves 4 stars even though it doesn't look it.  It is deeply rooted in powerful meaning and symbolism.
