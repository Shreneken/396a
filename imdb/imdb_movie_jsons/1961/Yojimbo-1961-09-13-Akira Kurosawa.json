            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo is a not too long, not too short action film that uses its action with just the right touches of voracity and excitement, and in the backdrop is also a sense of humor to the process. If I had to recommend a Kurosawa film to someone who's never seen one before (and might be impatient to sit through the three and a half hour Seven Samurai, or might not get the non-linear structure of Rashomon), I'd put this one in their hands to try out.Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune is terrific as Sanjuro Kuwabatake, a drifter of a samurai who stumbles upon a town with an assorted cast of characters, with a split between two gangs. One of the gangsters, Unosuke (Nakadai), is the only one in town; it seems, with a gun. At first Sanjuro plays each side, but when he gets beaten roughly by whom he was \"protecting\", he realizes the fun's over, and it's time to fight back.Much has been made about how Sergio Leone took Kurosawa's story and characters (most in particular being a rogue from out of town) and made them into his breakthrough Fistful of Dollars- Kurosawa even sued Leone over the story rights. But to those who wonder whether Yojimbo is 'better' than Fistful or vice versa need to remember one of two things- Kurosawa took the story from Dashiell Hammett's gangster novel Red Harvest, so neither filmmaker is making something really original; and that since each film is made in a different continent, and with the slightest different sensibilities about its characters. For one thing in Yojimbo guns are scarcer than in Fistful, and there's a treatment Kurosawa has with his actors that sets it apart from the small town western scope of Leone's weapons and actors. So each film (noticeably) carries its own kind of visual style while working in a similar plot structure. In other words, it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges picked in the same farm (if that makes at all sense).Overall, Yojimbo on its own is a lean, cool Japanese crime/action film, helmed by a master, and featuring a number of highlights to look forward to on multiple viewings. Some of those include: the scene inside Seibei's brothel (with the women dancing and singing), Masaru Sato's wonderful musical orchestrations, Mifune's curiously low-key and rough performance (which did and didn't serve as inspiration to Clint), and a climax that is up there with one of Kurosawa's finest battles.

            "content": "Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.",

            "content": "If you ever watched Pulp Fiction and thought: movie cool was born here, or maybe you saw any single Sergio Leone movie and thought: this guy invented movie-cool (if you haven't, i thoroughly recommend it - Kill Bill is nothing to his Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West), then experience Yojimbo, or The Bodyguard. Kurosawa's camera sits behind Toshiro Mifune's man-with-no-name, inviting us to look up at the back of his head as he walks the earth, inviting us to be in awe of this man. And as he walks, super-cool walking-the-earth music plays. Later on, when he's taunted and asked to prove himself, he slices a guy's arm off and plays the petty, money-grabbing rival factions in the town he wanders into off each other.If you have it in your mind that a guy called Kurosawa couldn't make movies that would impress you, that the cultural gap would be too great - be assured that Kurosawa's movies are rife with Western values. Sure, they are rife with Japanese values (i am told), but Kurosawa had a great appreciation of Western culture. He based many of his movies on Western texts, like Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, or American gangster fiction and film. Yojimbo is one of the latter - inspired by the Dashiell Hammet novel Red Harvest (Hammett's novel The Maltese Falcon was put onscreen moment for moment by John Huston in the movie of the same name which immortalised Humphrey Bogart).Actually, the history of the story of the lone wolf, the wanderer with a weapon, who rides into town to play off two warring factions against each other - is quite a story itself. Dashiell Hammett, an American, wrote a novel with an American private eye as the stranger. In 1961, Akira Kurosawa transposed this story to medieval Japan, after the fall of a dynasty, where a Samurai finds himself with no place to go (at the beginning, we see him throw a branch up in the air and walk the direction it falls), and no master to serve. A bodyguard with no-one to protect. In 1964, Sergio Leone transposed the screenplay of Yojimbo (nearly word for word) to the spanish desert, and he brought along a young television actor named Clint Eastwood, and together they revolutionised the western with Fistfull of Dollars, and created an entire genre, the Spaghetti Western, which sported among its attributes a gritty, desolate landscape, and a cynical, postmodern lack-of-values ideology (traditional American westerns had quite plush landscapes and were always black and white (good and evil) in their value system. Despite the massive influence of Fistfull of Dollars, it pales in comparison to both its predecessor Yojimbo, and its sequals, For a Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. But still, both Yojimbo and Fistful are iconic movies, and very cool movies.With cool music, a cool anti-hero, a fun script, and a visually spectacular canvas of an image, painted by the eye of an artist (it is said that Kurosawa storyboarded his movies in full-scale paintings), Yojimbo is one of the coolest movies ever made.",

            "content": "I'm not going to waste time debating which was the \"greatest\" or \"best\" of Kurosawa's movies, but if you want to know the one I enjoy the most it's 'Yojimbo'. 'Rashomon' and 'Throne Of Blood' are probably deeper and more substantial, but for sheer entertainment value 'Yojimbo' is hard to beat! Being a Kurosawa movie it's no surprise that it stars Toshiro Mifune. The two made many movies together, but this is the performance I like to watch the most. I love looking at Mifune's face! His expressions are awesome. He was without a doubt one of the 20th centuries greatest movie stars. 'Yojimbo' was a massive influence on many spaghetti westerns, specifically 'A Fistful Of Dollars', but before you bay for Sergio Leone's blood, please read Dashiell Hammett's detective classic 'Red Harvest', published in 1929 and you'll see that Kurosawa lifted his plot from it.  I see no mention whatsoever of this source material in the credits for 'Yojimbo', so let's just leave the Leone bashing alone okay? Many people have convincingly argued that samurai movies were inspired by classic American westerns anyway. Walter Hill later \"remade\" 'Yojimbo' (or 'Red Harvest' depending on your perspective) as 'Last Man Standing' and David Lynch gave a small nod to it in his 'Wild At Heart'.  You can certainly see both the samurai and spaghetti influences in Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' 1 and 2, that's for sure. \"Influences\", \"inspirations\", these are things that go around and around, it's what a writer or film maker does with them that counts. 'Yojimbo' is a classic action movie. Maybe only 'Wages Of Fear' is better. Every film buff needs this movie in their collection!",

            "review_title": "First class samurai action tale with philosophy to boot",
            "content": "Classic samurai action pic; often imitated but never equalled.  Mifune creates a memorable character (who appeared in a sequel) in the Ronin who decides the course of his life on the toss of a stick, and ends up risking his life to save a village full of peasants he finds revolting.  It's possible to see \"Yojimbo's\" actions as either heroic or as the game of a bored warrior in need of amusement -- as often in Kurosawa's films, the fact that the characters' motives remain open to interpretation adds depth to the film.Wonderful images, and skillful direction that keeps the pace of the storytelling tight and tells most of the story through images -- this is the kind of film that is so good it can be watched a silent film without losing too much of its impact or meaning.I think that if Kurosawa had spent more of his time in litigation and less making movies, he might have made a living for the rest of his life off all the movies that have ripped off this movie.  Certainly Eastwood's \"Man with No Name\" character owes a lot to Mifune's contribution; not only in Leone's films (the first of which borrows its entire plot from Kurosawa; a court settlement ensued which made sure Kurosawa made most of the profits from \"Fistful of Dollars\" in Asia his own) but also in Eastwood's best film as a director -- \"High Plains Drifter\", which borrows scenes such as Eastwood's rebuke of the villagers from \"Yojimbo\".  The really funny thing about all this, and what not too many American critics or audiences have noted, is that \"Yojimbo\" is itself a western.  All the ingredients for a western are here, and the film's plot and style obviously owe a debt to Zinnemann's \"High Noon\".  \"Yojimbo\" even borrows the device of time, setting up a confrontation at 3:00 a.m. as shouted by the town crier.  I like \"Yojimbo\" better than \"High Noon\", so I don't want to go too far into this line of thought....",

            "review_title": "A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune - The undisputed masters of their respective arts",
            "content": "Yojimbo is a timeless masterpiece; elegant, enigmatic and taut; one of the best and the most influential of the action movies, and a delectable feast to the lovers of the genre. It is the most sought-after of the Akira Kurosawa's movies, shamelessly imitated on multiple occasions \u2013 the most infamous being 'A Fistful of Dollars' by Sergio Leone. Yojimbo is a delightful addition to an unending list of avant-garde movies made by the Oriental master. It is as superior to any of the movies that it has inspired as a master is to his artless apprentice. I have had the privilege of watching five Kurosawa movies before watching Yojimbo viz. Seven Samurai, Ran, Dersu Uzala, Rashomon, and High & Low and each left me mesmerized, but in a completely different manner than the last. In my past reviews I have repeatedly committed an invidious blunder of failing to acknowledge the ginormous contribution that Toshiro Mifune made in Kurosawa's colossal success. I would be remiss again if I fail to testify the fact that Yojimbo is more synonymous with Mifune than it is with Kurosawa and anyone who has had the privilege of watching it wouldn't want me to budge even by a slightest degree. The role of 'Sanjuro', though demanding, can be any performer's dream, but a slight lack of proficiency or commitment on his part can serve as a volte-face, transforming it into his biggest nightmare. I don't think that anyone but Kurosawa is competent enough to judge Toshiro Mifune's talent as a performer and so I would like to quote an excerpt from his biography: \"Mifune had a kind of talent I had never encountered before in the Japanese film world. It was, above all, the speed with which he expressed himself that was astounding. The ordinary Japanese actor might need ten feet of film to get across an impression; Mifune needed only three. He put forth everything directly and boldly with a great sense of timing. And yet with all his quickness, he also had surprisingly fine sensibilities\".In Yojimbo, Toshiro Mifune incredibly outdoes himself with a portrayal that can be excruciatingly hard to be described in words. Mifune is crafty, cunning, capricious and yet seemingly nonchalant as the ingeniously disingenuous ronin, a portrayal overwhelmed with so many contrasting attributes that it revolutionized the very concept of an anti-hero in the world of cinema. Sanjuro is a cross between a wolf and a sheep, a guardian and a usurper, a misanthrope and an altruist, a demon and an angel, a libertine and an ascetic, a fiend and a beloved, a mercenary and a messiah and that's what makes this portrayal singular and incredibly magnificent. Mifune has meticulously taken care of even the slightest gestures and the subtle changes in mannerisms during the portrayal; be it Sanjuro's perpetually grinned countenance or his nonchalant disposition. Each triviality and nuance evinces certain details that are hard to be expressed even through expatiation. Despite Sanjuro's rapidly changing expressions and his frenzied demeanor, Mifune always seems to be in absolute control.Yojimbo is a well etched, taut narrative with a dark comical look that makes it one of a kind. Yojimbo neither appears to be superficial nor superfluous and not a moment of it is extraneous. Human values and emotions are ubiquitously similar irrespective of the cultural and the social divide between the peoples of the world and hence everyone can savour the thought-provoking movies of Kurosawa; even those who are daunted by the handicap of using subtitles can relish a movie like Yojimbo as a silent movie (because of it being so visually descriptive like the Charlie Chaplin movies). The plot of the movie is simple and may even appear to be commonplace owing to the countless imitations that it has inspired, but it is the rapport between Kurosawa and Mifune (undoubtedly the best director-actor pair of all time) that makes it so especial and unique. A penniless ronin (samurai without a master) enters a town rotten with schism (Akira Kurosawa challenged his assistant directors to come up with an image for the film to let Sanjuro know he was entering a bad town. Eventually, Kurosawa himself came up with the idea of the dog carrying the human hand). The two gangs are sporadically involved in sanguinary duels resulting in mass slaughter. The ronin demonstrates his skills by slaying two members of one of the gangs. After asseverating his supremacy, he joins the other group for a substantial sum, but backs out just when a decisive battle was about to begin. He then climbs the nearby bell tower as a vantage for himself and watches with rapturous glee the bravado of the pusillanimous gang members disappearing in thin air as they are overcome by trepidation. They lunge and retreat on multiple occasions without making an actual contact before getting interrupted by the news of an inspector coming for an official inspection. The duel is postponed indefinitely to everyone's delight. In the meantime, Sanjuro lets them know that his services are open to bidding, inducing a tussle to acquire his services while he continues to act as an instigator further intensifying the rabid rivalry between the two groups. But soon the tables are turned and this child's play transforms into a moment of reckoning for the ronin as he finds himself haplessly pitted against the surviving gang. He is captured and brutally assaulted, but he manages to escape from some local help. This culminates in one of the best climatic endings of all time as Sanjuro single-handedly obliterates the whole gang, emancipating the town from anarchy and barbarism. It's a must watch for film students, action movie lovers, and especially those who want to acquaint themselves with the eccentrically brilliant works of the oriental master without exposing themselves to his more recondite works like Shichinin no samurai, Rashomon, Ikiru, Akahige, Ran and countless others. An absolute gem: 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

Soon, he arrives in a small town. A local caterer advises him to leave because, two local clans fight every day on the streets. However, a stranger decides to stay. The situation in a town is very good for one r\u014dnin. This is a good chance that he earns some money. However, he does not need a bloody money. He wants to destroy local crime lords...This tense story is full of lies, doubt, turning, pranks, blackmails and excellent fights. A careless and seemingly insensitive samurai is actually a peaceful and good man. Mr. Kurosawa has, under the influence of a western and noir, made a very exciting and visually impressive film. Of course, he has not neglected the significant situations that are related to the Japanese culture and tradition.Close-ups, almost perfectly, reflect an evil, arrogance, fear, invincibility and contempt on faces of some of the protagonists. There is a large number of villains, which are quite different in character.Toshiro Mifune (Kuwabatake Sanjuro) is a resourceful, interesting and determined as a wandering r\u014dnin and master swordsman. He, apparently, enjoys in his machinations, however, his goal is extremely benevolent. He's kind of a lone hero, regardless of a tactical evil and theatrical swagger in his character.His support are Tatsuya Nakadai as Unosuke a wild and insolent gunslinger and the biggest threat to a samurai. He is interesting because he is a completely different character from Sanjuro. Ky\u016b Sazanka (Ushitora) and Seizaburo Kawazu (Seibei) are fairly inconclusive as crime lords. However their primary relationship \"of a teacher and his student\", could be interesting. Isuzu Yamada as Orin is the the wife of Seibei. She is perhaps an initiator of conflicts. Daisuke Kat\u014d as Inokichi is a visually the most memorable character. A character, who is capable to commit a vicious murder, but also make the greatest stupidity.Simply, Mr. Kurosawa has managed to combine several styles in a small masterpiece.",

Swirling through and around him is a story that is both technically flawless and profoundly moving.Kurosawa meticulously infuses every detail with meaning; there's a purpose behind every shot, and aspiring directors should pay close attention (why is the camera slightly tilted? why are there concubines in the background?). His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot. And the story is equally well-crafted, with no plot holes and no inconsistencies.A wonderful tale that rolls beautifully from start to finish. See it, see it, see it!!",

This guy's amazing!I've been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it's getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch.  Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character  is when he's in Gonji's place lying on the floor.  He doesn't brag, but when he goes into action, that's it!  As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn't seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it.  His  demeanor is really amusing and it's great watching his plan unfold;   how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it's really funny).  Great thing too is he's not really a hero and he's not entirely a villain.  He doesn't hesitate to kill, but does so methodically.  You also have \"characters\" including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.Yojimbo's mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic.",

Toshiro Mifune stars as the nobody who calls himself Sanjuro (thirty but closer to forty). He enters a town destroyed by warring factions and plays a double-game to pit one faction against the other thus destroying the criminal element.Yojimbo (aka The Bodyguard) is one of the coolest and most stylish films ever made. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favorite actor, as the scruffy looking Samurai, Yojimbo has all of Kurosawa's qualities and none of the flaws. The music score is an essential element of the plot and strikingly good, but admittedly bettered by the Ennio Morricone version in the Spaghetti Western remake Fistful of Dollars. The visuals are great, from the samurai swordplay, to the desolate streets, the town crier announcing its 3 a.m. to the brutal torture scene.One of the unique things about Yojimbo is the central character. He is an anti-hero. We see him initially as a killer and a man greedy for money. But then, he saves a family by re-uniting mother and child and giving them all the money he was advanced. Mifune has never been cooler than in this film and Eastwood could only aspire to equal such a performance.Of the two remakes, I liked Fistful of Dollars for starting the Spaghetti Western genre, although Yojimbo is a far more superior and stylish film. The gangster version, Last Man Standing, was not very good and Bruce Willis made for a poor substitute to Yojimbo. This film looks fresh and undated even today - watch it!",

            "content": "After a string of classic masterpieces, Kurosawa confronted his influences head-on. Throwing John Ford's Western aesthetics into a blender and painting them pitch black. The results are Yojimbo and its legacy.Yojimbo (\"the bodyguard\") is the tale of a flea-ridden wandering swordsman, Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune, in his finest performance). He arrives at a gang-war ravaged town and starts hiring himself out to both sides, playing them off against another, in order to wipe all the scum out. Sound familiar?Even though Yojimbo the film is a thrilling ride and very funny dark comedy, it is hard to imagine what a bombshell this was for audiences at the time of its release. It is as far removed as can be from the then squeaky-clean aesthetic of samurai films: you can almost smell the sweat and the grime of the sordid town and characters. The action is fast and furious, enhanced by Kurosawa's deft use of telephoto lenses and Masaru Sato's avant-garde score. With all that, Yojimbo was a massive kick in the pants of a fossilized genre.It exploded beyond the confines of its own country and genre, forever influencing the very Westerns that had inspired it, particularly a new wave out of Spain and Italy at the time. One Sergio Leone copy/pasted the whole plot into his own revisionist Western and gave us the Dollars trilogy. The slightest of Spaghetti Western enthusiasts owes Kurosawa a debt of gratitude.As with all truly great work, its greatness exists even devoid of context, and for all the historical precedents it set, all Kurosawa wanted to make was an entertaining film.

            "review_title": "Homo Homini Lupus",
            "content": "The famous Latin phrase \"homo homini lupus\" meaning \"man is a wolf to (his fellow) man,\" could easily be the motto of Akira Kurosawa's 21st film Yojimbo (1961). It is purely a genre-film at its best: a film in which the basic realizations and contents of a genre have been internalized perfectly. In this case the genre is samurai-film which is strongly related to the genre of western. Whereas from western the American mythology exhales, from samurai-film Japanese does. Although, the history of samurai-film extends to the 1930-40's it found its dynamic form and was truly born in the early 1950's when Japanese films first came to Europe. The genre still lives on but Yojimbo is, without a doubt, among the five best samurai-films ever made. Both, ironic humor and conception of the eternal weakness of the human nature characterize this exquisite film about a mythical character.Western and samurai-film are often compared to each other, and Kurosawa has said that: \"Everybody likes a good western. Because people are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been made over and over again and in this process a certain grammar has developed and I have leaned something from it.\". They both take place to important phases of their country's national history and in the focus there are armed heroes. The heroes are often marginal characters in the society who return order to it but are also conscious of the fact that their virtuous action doesn't take them to the new, better, ordered society. And this is exactly what happens in Yojimbo as it does in A Fistful of Dollars for example. Kurosawa had the habit of placing his stories to history, far away, so the producers and managers of film companies wouldn't get upset of his anti-feudalism. On the big screen, he was safely able to tell about his thoughts without them being directly linked to the present day \u2014 and that's why it is samurai-film that he most eagerly studied.The story of Yojimbo is, from today's perspective, classical and has been lent dozens of times in A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Last Man Standing (1996) for instance. The Japanese word 'y\u00f4jinb\u00f4' means a bodyguard or a hit man and that is exactly what the protagonist of this film is. The film happens in a simple milieu where two selfish robber gangs work. Soon an unknown samurai \u2014 played by Toshir\u00f4 Mifune \u2014 arrives to the town and offers his services to one of the gangs. He cheats the other by claiming that he would be working for them. The other gang finds out and tortures him. However, soon our hero escapes and after a few days recovery he overthrows the hostile gang of 20 bandits and leaves the town in peace. There are no good and evil; just two evils from which the protagonist has to choose. We all know this situation. An ethical dilemma that is impossible to solve. We want to end the battle between these two evil but can't because we are too weak. In this the hero of Yojimbo differs from us. He can stand in the middle and quit the fighting. For Kurosawa this kind of social action is serious business and that's why he doesn't make a big deal out of it. He hasn't placed any hidden morality behind the hero's acts.Yojimbo shows that \"man is a wolf to a man,\" how people in reality are animals. The humor comes from the fact that we are quite ridiculous when we think that we are trying to attain morally righteous solutions. The message of Yojimbo and so many films seems to be that the world can't be observed through absolute morality. Both utilitarianism and virtue ethics collapse in the world of Kurosawa. For example, Sanjuro's only virtue is that he doesn't try to be bad, all the time. At times, he might make decisions that ostensibly are good but are actually built on selfish acts. Out of no solidarity or anything that has something to do with morality, he helps one evil to win over another. After he has performed his duty he can walk away and forget all about it. He resembles a god in Greek tragedies: he descends down, does his mission and once again disappears. In one particularly intriguing scene he climbs up and looks down at people, from the roof. He watches the lives of people as a grand comedy \u2014 a seedy anti-hero observing.Yojimbo happens in a stripped, closed and simplified landscape in which ruthless and completely selfish and unethical groups of bandits work. Their cruel attitude towards the world is relayed to us most luminously in the scene where one bandit says to his son that: \"To gain respect one has to kill more.\" Irony and humor mean complete destruction of morality. The desolation of Kurosawa's world view is most brilliantly projected on the life of Unosuke, the gunfighter. First his sight is innocent and curious. But soon the cruel corrupted world teaches its lesson and therefore he becomes a mighty gunman who digs up his own grave: \"He died like he lived.\"At times, Yojimbo is close to self-parody but Kurosawa brilliantly reflects the violence culture in the zone of irony and consciousness. Yojimbo is a pure genre-film. But it is also full of subjectivity and personal sights. Death instinct, life at the gates of hell, the harsh reality of heroism, life control and violence culture viewed under the samurai myth but, in addition, Yojimbo talks about war-like glory and sense of morality: the protagonist isn't a moralist. No higher moral purpose hides behind his action than cleaning up the town. He is cynical, melancholy and has a total lack of morality. Yojimbo is, at its heart, about an ethical dilemma, it's about the inevitable dialog between loyalty and glory. It is a grand story of humanity and morality.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.We are indebted to Kurosawa for one big thing and a couple small ones. Among the small ones is the deconstruction of the western, which was transformed forever by the chain of events started by (and depicted in?) this film. I recommend Yojimbo if only because of this importance.That chain starts with the spaghetti westerns which introduced irony into most elements of the form more obviously for us, well westerners. And it finishes (probably) with `Star Wars,' which is nothing more than a slightly shifted selfaware goof on the already outed western. That this is based on a Hammett story should be a tipoff as he did the same for the mystery genre. Kurosawa did this knowingly of course. You can see his other projects marching through other notions of film and revolutionizing them.Naturally, there are other values here: perfect framing; multiplanar visual storytelling through mime; and a camera that denotes the eye of fate. But by the time one gets to this after seeing such masterpieces as `Ran' and `Rashomon' and `Seven Samurai,' especially the first, one gets used to expecting skill from Kurosawa equalling the skill of his samurai avatar.If you know what this movie is all about, it puts `Last Man Standing' in a much more intelligent and cinematically important perspective. The title of this comment refers to the fact that it is essentially impossible to see any movie today and not be in part watching a Kurosawa film.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4 -- worth watching",

            "review_title": "Director Akira Kurisowa's Yojimbo is a masterpiece. Yojimbo is still pretty sharp.",
            "content": "Loosely based on Dashiell Hammett's western novel Red Harvest and Glass Key. This jidaigeki (period drama film), tells the story of an unnamed ronin (Toshiro Mifune), who arrives in a small town in 1860 Japan, where competing crime lords, Seibei, the Brothel Owner (Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu) and Ushitora, the Arms Dealer (Tatsuya Nakadai) fight each other for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the deadly newcomer as a yojimbo AKA bodyguard, but the unnamed ronin has a secret plan to get rid of both of them, by playing both rivals against each other in the hope that they will wipe each other out, faster than ever. Without spoiling too much of it, this movie is a great Samurai film, that is worth the watch only. The movie is beautiful shot. Director Akira Kurosawa's films are notable for being stunning visually, with beautiful backgrounds, sometimes verging on Scenery Porn. This movie might not have much of the Japanese landscape in the background, but it made great use of the set, and the weather. The way, he know how to use actors in a wide screen frame is amazing. He place actors in the foreground. Middle ground in the left or right. Sharp focus. Director John Ford type of a style. He use the shutters and doors, well on the Japanese set to reset shots so dynamically. Without cutting the shutters and door, create a look of comic book panels, frame by frame. Like in most Kurosawa films, rainy weather is present in a few scenes, increasing the effect of the characters' discomfort making emotional seem real. The windy weather all throughout the film represents the chaotic life in the town. The wind blowing while Yojimbo walks inspired many Japanese Animes and films. Kurosawa originated a lot of film techniques that are still being used today. A form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kurosawa is the wipe as a transitional device. It is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve. Yojimbo had great pan-focus shots, because they were crucial to the action. Action shot with a few long shots. It's way different than how action is film, today. This is one reason this movie stands the test of time so well. One thing that the movie does so well is editing. Kurosawa was a master in that. He was so good and quick, that Yojimbo had its Japanese premiere on four days after shooting concluded. Still, the movie does have some problems, as its jump back and forth between drama and comedy. It's a bit jarring at times. Most of the humor were hits than miss. I love the look of Sanjuro AKA Yojimbo's face when he sees the dog carrying the sever hand. The violence and gore was pretty intense, at times. It's weird to see, bloody limps being chop off in an early 1960s film, seeing how strict, Japanese censors were, at the time. The cycles of violence in this film is a lot tamer than that of 1954 Seven Samurai. Yojimbo's script is pretty good, but it lacks the intellectual challenge of 1950's Rashomon, the moral resonance of 1952's Ikiru, and the sweeping grandeur of Seven Samurai. He made a couple of great samurai films, but after seeing several of them, they get to be a bit repetitive. Most of the villains are forgettable. They are two-dimensional comically idiots without a shred of redeeming humanity thought. Kurosawa told Tatsuya Nakadai that his character was a snake, so Nakadai moves very snake-like. It didn't help, as his character has little to no personality at all. I just know him, as the man with the creepy smile, snake motion and the gun. The supporting characters, he helps out aren't memorable. I was really hoping more from the old undertaker and his family. Toshiro Mifune as the main lead was great. He's not only one of the greatest Japanese actors of all-time, but is one of the greatest actors of all-time period. Toshiro Mifune is a great actor, capable of great range and subtlety of expression. A complete badass, and everybody comes to realize this very quickly. He was able to perform, the way, the director wanted to. Akira Kurosawa told Toshiro Mifune to act like a stray dog, which is why he twitches his shoulders and scratches himself a lot during the film. The character of Sanjiro can be viewed as an early example of the \"Man with No Name\" because he made the name up at the shot. Kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived \"arrogant\" behavior, and you see that in this character. In many ways, the main lead character mirrors Kurosawa at the time. Claims of personal arrogance and harsh treatment of colleagues were often, said about the director. He could even sometimes be hard on seasoned, highly respected film professionals. During the filming of this, he lost his temper with one of Japan's preeminent cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. He was often, very tiresome, during filming. This movie would be, one of his last best influencing films. Still, it's been years since this movie first came out, but it's still influencing how films are made today. In 1964, Yojimbo was remade as Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, a Spaghetti Western starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. Leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to Kurosawa's film, resulting in a lawsuit that delayed the western release for three years. The movie influenced a lot of other movies in the west over time like 1996's Walter Hill gangster film, \"Last Man Standing\" and others. The movie even got a sequel, 1962's Sanjuro. The music from this film by Masaru Sat\u00f4 is very powerful to listen to. It's often use in other films and trailers. The film is easy to find. Try to get the Criterion Collection for the best value, just note that there is no English dubbing. Overall: It's a must-watch. Will Recommended.",

Only three years after its release another great director, Sergio Leone, who named Yojimbo one of his favorite movies, used it as the model for another masterpiece, \"A Fistful Of Dollars\" and rose the Italian Western to an international level.In 1860, a time when the sword is still the most common weapon in the Japanese province, but gradually gets replaced by the revolver, a lonely Ronin, a Samurai without a master to serve,(Toshiro Mifune) who dashes around the county, comes to a little town terrorized by two bosses and their criminal gangs and decides to end the people's suffering and free the town. He is hired by one of the gangs as a bodyguard, only to switch sides and pit the two, already hostile, gangs against each other.Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest character actors of all time, is impressive in his role of the Samurai, generally the acting is great in this movie, the supporting cast contains such actors as the great and unforgettable Takashi Shimura. The cinematography is great and the movie's brilliant score, composed by Fumio Hayasaka, is one of its kind. The writing and directing by the inimitable Akira Kurosawa is more than brilliant. One of the greatest movies by one of the greatest directors of all-time, and an absolute must-see for everyone interested in cinema!",

And Yojimbo does nothing to make me change that, if anything like Seven Samurai, Ran, Ikiru, Hidden Fortress, Rashomon and Throne of Blood it is another of his masterpieces. Like Hidden Fortress was a major influence on Star Wars, Yojimbo did the same for Fistful of Dollars. I've seen them compared a lot, but all I will say that for me both are milestones of their respective genres and both are movies to watch if not done so already. Back to Yojimbo, as always for a Kurasawa film, it is superbly made and made absolutely beautifully with epic scenery and great, stylish use of camera techniques. The music adds much to the story, and is remarkably atmospheric, the script is a fine mix of comedy, intrigue and sudden and quite unrelenting violence and the story is compelling and always entertaining, managing to both celebrate and subvert(but in a subtle way) the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune I have yet to see a bad performance from, and again he is a superb lead, who could be seen as an anti-hero as he sells his skills yet dupes both sides of the feudal community into slaughter. Overall, another fantastic film from perhaps the King of Japanese cinema. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Sanjuro, a wandering samurai enters a rural town in nineteenth century Japan and he finds himself the location run by two parties commanded by Ushitora and Seibe and their hired thugs . The samur\u00e1i sells his activities to both parts with devasting resulting for all ; as he then sets out to rid the town of all these ominous people .The noisy town is full of injustices , inequity , violence and killings , due to the hordes of gamblers and murderers that inhabit it. After learning from the innkeeper that the town is divided between two mobsters , he plays one side off against the other . As 2 clans vying for political power bid on the services of a silent masterless Samurai , a quiet Ronin . His efforts are complicated by the arrival of the wily Unosuke who often uses a bloody gun . There is a massacre , but the samurai runs away with the help of the innkeeper ; but while recuperating at a nearby temple, he learns of an abduction carried out by Unosuke, and goes back to the town to take on enemies .\nThis is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune , being his international breakthrough one . Yokimbo , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent Spaghetti Westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . The known film Leone\u00a8For a fistful of dollars\u00a8is mainly cribbed from this Japanese samur\u00e1i action classic ; however , some reviewers tell this Yojinbo bears little resemblance to Sergio Leone film . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a Samur\u00e1i who attempts to play the two warlords off against each other . This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune . At the beginning , Sanjuro seems to be a good Samurai , as being beaten after he reunites an abducted woman with her husband and son, then massacres his father's opponents. As well as Tatsuya Nakadai , still acting , as Unosuke, the son of one of the gangsters, who owns a revolver.This fiercely-charging , uncompromising pictures was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . The previous years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the \"Best Foreign Film\" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy .",

In some parts, it is very difficult to follow the story, since I can not understand Japanese. Further, there is a bug and the DVD freezes at 75:51 min. I tried two DVDs and both presented the same problem. The solution is to go back to the 'Menu', select the next chapter and 'rewind' back to 75:52 min.

My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Yojimbo'05 January 2005: I have just received the following remark from an IMDb User: \"Yojimbo doesn't \"recall those Italian ('spaghetti') western movies, with the death of all 'bad guys',\" considering that Yojimbo was released in 1961, and the entire GENRE of \"Spaghetti Westerns\" didn't really exist previous to Leone's Fistful of Dollars.

Kurosawa is of course excellent at setting up the conflict in the town and how it affects the people whilst also delivering on fine samurai sword fights (a man even has his hand cut off). Kurosawa wonderfully lets his scenes play out with plenty of long shots and small camera movements. Kurosawa and his actors also inject some occasional moments of humours to help lighten the mood when need be. But for the most Yojimbo is a serious drama with some very dark elements. Out of the Kurosawa films I have seen I personally prefer Seven Samurai for its scale and Rashomon for its ambition, but Yojimbo is still a worthy film and true film buffs need to watch it.",

            "content": "'Yojimbo' was Kurosawa's most commercially successful film in his home country of Japan. Now some critics and viewers tend to justify this commercial success by calling the film an entertaining action film without much substance. But after having watched it for the 3rd time in a matter of a year, I will have to disagree with that opinion. Yes, the film is very entertaining, but the screenplay written by Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima is deceptively deep and meaningful.The first and foremost thing that has to be understood about 'Yojimbo' is that the film is a dark comedy. Kurosawa actually wants to generate some humour out of potentially gruesome and depressing moments. Thematically, the film is all about Kurosawa's wish fulfillment. The character of Sanjuro is Kurosawa's surrogate. Sanjuro executes the things that Kurosawa himself wants. This is the reason why this character is not completely realistic. He is supposed to be a mythic figure, a wandering spirit. This mysterious, rugged outsider character that becomes entangled in something that he has little vested interest in, has a very iconic place in cinema history. On one hand, this character of Sanjuro itself was inspired by some of the rugged cowboy characters in American Western films that Kurosawa was an admirer of. On the other hand, this character has further inspired some of the most iconic characters that came later like Clint Eastwood's 'Man with no name' character in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns and the character of Mad Max in George Miller's films to name a few.Story-wise, Kurosawa is using a period setting to mirror the condition of the Japanese economy at the time the film was made. Sanjuro in the film randomly walks into a town that looks desolate, grim and depressing. The town is run by two rival gangster groups who work in close coalition with two rival business merchants. The merchants require the gangsters for the muscle and the gangsters require the merchants and their money for their existence. This greatly mirrors the social scenario in Japan during the economic boom. The businessmen and politicians brought in an age of unrestricted capitalism with extensive and undeniable help from the Yakuza. Kurosawa is clearly going back to the past to throw some light on the present. He is using Sanjuro to express his philosophies and comment against this unchecked spread of rampant consumerism. In a way Kurosawa is rewriting history. In a factual sense, the samurai class disappeared and the era of the merchants and the gangsters started in Japan. But in his fantasy version of history, Kurosawa has Sanjuro the Samurai come back from the cemetery and defeat the gangsters and thematically clean the town.The cinematography in the film to some extent makes the film for me. The telephoto lens works overtime to give us these gorgeous frames. When it comes to frame composition and expressive blocking of actors, Kurosawa is second to none. The wide angle photography of Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa is awe-inspiring. The exterior shots in the street are epic in scope. Kurosawa uses wind machines to crank up the epic nature of the outdoor standoff scenes. Kurosawa's style of shooting the action scenes is actually quite simple. He doesn't use fast editing like one sees in a lot of action films. He generally uses two diagonally placed cameras to capture the shots and relies heavily on choreography. Kurosawa's use of Masaru Sato's music is also brilliant. He choreographs the movements of the characters in certain scenes to the beat of the music which adds a poetic touch to the visuals. Toshir\u00f4 Mifune pretty much owns the screen in the film. He exudes gravitas and authority. He is charming, witty, suave and when required viciously aggressive. Mifune adds an immensely masculine charisma to the film. It was great watching him manipulate the rival gangs and direct the proceedings. Tatsuya Nakadai is great as the primary nemesis of Mifune. Nakadai's character carries with a long barrel pistol almost like a phallic symbol to represent this power. He too is very charismatic with the twinkle in his eye and threatening demeanour.'Yojimbo' might not have as much complexity as Kurosawa's other masterpieces like 'Rashomon' or 'Red Beard', but it still has something to say and comment upon. Kurosawa's brilliant filmmaking enhances and elevates the screenplay to the next level and makes this a must watch. This is certainly one of his best films. Highly Recommended.",

Basically samurai Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) finds himself in the middle of a Japanese village with feuding, neither side is particularly honorable, but Sanjuro is hungry and impoverished, so he finds work as a bodyguard (or Yojimbo) for a silk merchant Tazaemon (Kamatari Fujiwara). Sanjuro chooses over a job working for sake brewer Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura), but he pretends to work for him, as part of a plan for them to tear each other apart, but he is eventually arrested for treachery. Sanjuro escapes in time to see the two warring sides fight to the finish, the plan all along was to create and restore peace, Sanjuro leaves the village for further exploits, the character returned in the sequel titled Sanjuro a year later. Also starring Eijir\u00f4 T\u00f4no as Gonji the Tavern Keeper, Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu as Seib\u00ea the Brothel Operator, Isuzu Yamada as Orin, Hiroshi Tachikawa as Yoichiro and Susumu Fujita as Homma the Instructor Who Skips Town. The performances are fine, and the direction as always is great from Kurosawa, I will admit I did not pay the fullest attention to everything going on, and it did get confusing at times, but the 19th century feel is authentic, and the sword skill and fight scenes catch your eye, I can see some reasons why it would get full marks from critics, it did influence A Fistful of Dollars and the \"spaghetti western\" genre, a worthwhile adventure.

Perennial Kurosawa player, Toshiro Mifune, is the \"Ronin\"--a wandering samurai who is looking for work. He comes to a town and is surprised by the condition of the people. There are two rival warring gangs in the town and the people are literally held captive by the mass of depraved men hired by the two leaders. These bored samurai make life all but impossible for decent people.While Mifune is a samurai with extraordinary powers, he is a lone man and must use both his skills and his brain to free the people of this town. So, he manipulates BOTH sides into thinking he's working for them and gets the bad guys to wipe each other out! This is all done through a very skillfully crafted and funny script.If you enjoy this film, as I'm sure you will, try watching Sergio Leone's version of Yokimbo--FISTFUL OF DOLLARS featuring Clint Eastwood. And, if you like this, a not-quite sequel entitled FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is an even better Kurosawa-inspired film.",

            "content": "That's a quote from Kurosawa, if you hadn't already guessed. Here in \"Yojimbo\" (\"The Bodyguard\") he shows us exactly what he meant. This film is a real treat for the artsy crowd as well as people who go to the movies just to have fun. It's a technical marvel and layered in its story, and yet there's nothing complicated about it. If you're new to Kurosawa, or art films in general, definitely start here.The story follows our hero, a masterless samurai, who drifts into a bizarre little turf war between 2 rival gangs. The 2 gangs, backed by the \"silk trader\" and the \"sake brewer\", are mostly incompetent yet extremely violent and willing to hire any scoundrel who will fight. Our sly hero sees an opportunity.That's all I'll say about the plot because the rest is for you to discover. It's definitely a fun and exciting ride from start to finish, so fun that you may not realize that you are watching a fantastic work of art. Scenes are meticulously composed, choreographed, lighted, and filmed with such precision that any frame could be a photo to hang on your wall.Let's just take one example, one of the opening scenes. Our hero enters the town and is greeted by barren streets, shuttered windows, and... what's this from afar? A cute little dog in the distance. The camera, situated behind our hero so that we see him in the frame, keeps a tight focus on the little dog as the dog trots closer, and we start to make out something the dog has in his mouth. Closer, closer, always in perfect focus (which was no easy task with a telephoto lens), the dog comes to the foreground and we see the object so clearly that we can make out every detail: a human hand. What a bizarre and darkly comical start.Like the rest of the movie, that scene demonstrates technical wizardry as well as just plain old fun. There's a lot of humor, a lot of action, a lot of suspense, and a LOT of artistic magnificence. Take your pick and watch this film many times.",

The setting is typically western with the town consisting of businesses lining a central road and much of the plot follows a western blueprint, leading up to a final showdown in the center of town. It's not just the plot that is transferred over to \"A Fistful of Dollars\", but much of the look and visual style of the film is also adopted. The characters seem to come from somewhere else though. The film is a loose adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's \"Red Harvest\", and that novel's gangster characters seem to have been dropped into the western/samurai setting. The cross-genre blending is brilliant, allowing for new heights of cynicism and black comedy in the samurai, and ultimately the western, genre.",

It opens with an unnamed samurai entering a town; he soon learns that there are two rival groups vying to run the place\u0085 and he decides to destroy them both and get well paid in the process by working for both sides and stirring up as much conflict as he can. All appears to be going well for him until he decides to help a man whose wife was taken by one of the gang leaders\u0085 this act of sympathy could cost the samurai his life.As a long-time fan of 'A Fistful of Dollars' I was keen to see this film; now that I have I can see why Leone decided to remake it. The story is just what you'd expect in a western except that instead of six-shooters the characters wield samurai swords. There is plenty of action as well as a surprising amount of humour. The cast does a fine job; especially Toshiro Mifune who plays the lone samurai. Director Akira Kurosawa does a fantastic job bringing the story to the screen; perfectly capturing the action and drama of the story.Overall I'd say this is a must see if you are a fan of classic films, Japanese films or even if you just want to watch a film with a good story and plenty of action!",

            "review_title": "Just another masterful movie from the master of masterful movies",
            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's tribute to the western is a marvelous piece of cinema. Toshir\u00f4 Mifune stars as a ronin (samurai without a master) that goes to a small town, which is divided by two gangs of criminals. While there, he decides to play one off against the other in order to defeat both gangs. Yojimbo lacks the depth of some of Kurosawa's other films, such as Rashomon or Seven Samurai, but it is, on the whole, more entertaining and much more accessible than those two mentioned films, and most of the rest of Kurosawa's oeuvre. That's not to say that Yojimbo lacks substance however; there's more than enough here to please fans of Kurosawa's other works. Just like the majority of Kurosawa's films, Yojimbo is spectacularly well filmed. The black and white cinematography looks absolutely incredible, and the some of the scenes, in particular that involve rain, are extremely atmospheric and lend the movie a great gloomy style. Toshir\u00f4 Mifune's performance in this film is, in my opinion, his best. Mifune has been in some great films and given some great performances, many of them under the direction of Kurosawa; but the one here eclipses them all in my opinion. In this film, Mifune is most definitely the 'star'. In many other Kurosawa films, Seven Samurai especially, Mifune hasn't been alone, and although he isn't alone here either; he has to carry the film a lot more than he has had to with other films, and he does a great job of it. The answer to the question of whether or not he is believable in his role isn't even debatable; he is. So believable in fact that it's hard to believe that he's an actor playing a samurai, and not an actual samurai. Like a western, Yojimbo features several weird characters that add to the feel of the movie. The actors playing these smaller roles aren't as pronounced, or indeed as great as Toshir\u00f4 Mifune; but they all still excel in their small roles, making the support cast a very nice ensemble indeed.Yojimbo's influence can be felt across cinema. I dread to think how great cinema might not have been if the Japanese master; Akira Kurosawa had never picked up a camera. His body of work has influenced so many styles and genres that the mind literally boggles. If he never had made a film...well, it doesn't even bear thinking about. It is well known that for one, Yojimbo was remade into Sergio Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars', which in turn kick started Leone's career. That's just one great director we may have been without had it not been for Kurosawa. That's not all Yojimbo has had an impact on; the Spaghetti western sub-genre is littered with influence from this film, and even recent favourites such as Kill Bill have obviously taken influence from this masterpiece. Of course, cinema would be no worse off if Kill Bill was never made; but it's still credit to Yojimbo. Overall, every film fan should see Yojimbo. It's too important a film to miss, and not only that but it's guaranteed to give you 105 minutes of enjoyment. Highest recommendations from me.",

            "content": "You'd be forgiven for thinking that 'Yojimbo (1961)' is familiar if you've already seen 'A Fistful Of Dollars (1964)'; Leone's western is pretty much a shot for shot remake of the Kurasowa classic. Its long stretches of silence before a duel, its grimacing faces of weather-worn goons and its brief flashes of stylish violence all clearly inspired the design of the entire 'Dollars' trilogy. This is only really relevant to the experience of 'Yojimbo (1961)' if you watch the two movies in reverse (as it were), as they really are almost identical in narrative and tone. It's a good thing, then, that they're about as good as one another. This samurai story sees a nameless wanderer work his way between two feuding gang bosses, making as much money as possible and maybe just saving the people who really matter along the way. Mifune's protagonist is a bit of a blank slate, his underlying morals hidden behind a facade of unflinching toughness. For as good as he is with a blade, he rarely has to use it. This lack of action isn't a problem, however, as it simply makes the few fights there are all the more impactful. They're fast, frenetic and dirty, stained with beautifully shot black-and-white blood. There's a coldness about the killing that mightn't sit right with a good chunk of the audience and that's a valid criticism. Still, the thing moves fast enough that no cruelty is ever lingered on, focused on delivering a tight and engaging plot right from the start. It's an entertaining film, even if it isn't as deep or emotionally impactful as some of Kurosawa's other work. It's carefully crafted and stands the test of time, too. 7/10",

The town is a den of inequity, not only due to the warlords and their hired thugs, but due to the hordes of gamblers that inhabit it. The samurai sets out to rid the town of all these pestilences, his plan being to play the two warlords off against each other.Excellent movie by famed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Clever, unpredictable plot with some great twists along the way. Good character development and some great action scenes. The only blemish is that it is difficult to figure out which characters fit into the mix in what way. This is often heightened by Kurosawa introducing an important character out of the blue, with no background. They're often linked to the story via another character, a character who we also don't know much about, if anything at all. So some of the character-specific stories were a bit hard to follow.An influential movie in that Sergio Leone used this as inspiration for his spaghetti westerns - a Fistful of Dollars in particular. You can see it in some of the fight scenes: the slow, deliberate build-up, the music the Mexican standoff. A Fistful of Dollars is even regarded as a remake of Yojimbo.",

            "content": "What Kurosawa did in a short space of years is nothing short of revolutionary. American cinema (post WWII to Vietnam)was largely confined to self-affirming stereotypes -- especially in Westerns dominated by the Ford/Wayne cartoon good guy paradigm.He turned all of that upside down (aided and abetted by Leone). His samurai existed more as a tragic Greek figure -- afflicted by a fatal flaw -- rather than the guy who simply wears the 'white hat'. This is combined with Mifune's remarkable skill at creating the character and making the character (not the actor) live in the cinematic space.The key to this movie is the unprecedented visual composition. Images assemble into the frame, stacked two and three layers deep with no vanishing point. All of the elements are in the same focus, resembling a Japanese watercolor painting. Then Kurosawa cuts to a right angle shot (to the imaginary 'left' of the framing shot), twisting our perception around of just how deep the placement is. He also composes scenes that openly reference that this is 'being watched' - note the characters peering through windows at a second layer (usually mimed action) in the background, again all in the same focus. The effects here are striking, to say the least.Try to imagine Clint's man with no name characters, or 'Star Wars'(hacked off arm, a la Obi-Wan), or the 'Kill Bill' volumes (the one against many swordfights and beating inflicted on the bride) -- these are some off the top of the head examples, and there are countless more -- without the influence of this movie. It's impossible. By the mid-60's, Clint's amoral, stoic gunfighter had displaced his forerunners, changing the equation forever.Essential viewing.",

            "review_title": "Japanese Red Harvest",
            "content": "In the middle '20's, Dashiell Hammett (best known as author of \"The Maltese Falcon\") wrote two unrelated novels, \"The Glass Key\", about Ned Beaumont an alcoholic gambler who uses duplicity to save his mob boss from taking a murder rap for a corrupt politician (all the while fending off a rival mobster), and 'Red Harvest\", in which a nameless private eye (also alcoholic, a status shared by many Hammett heroes) is hired to clean up a small town kept in fear by two warring boot-leg mobs.I believe \"Red Harvest\" did make it to film in the '30's, but I haven't been able to track that down and never saw it. \"The Glass Key\" was first made into a (not too successful) film in 1935, and then re-made in 1942. The remake concerns us here. Directed by Stuart Heisler in a style that compounds the typical crime film briskness of the '30's with the shaded undertones of the then developing 'noir' genre, it is actually quite a good film, and in a number of ways daring for its period. True to the novel, literally everyone in the film is corrupt in some way, and especially fascinating is the appearance of William Bendix in a minor role of an overtly homosexual sadist of a thug. Alan Ladd plays Ned Beaumont as a true anti-hero, cold, calculating, true to no ethic but his own - a type Hollywood at that time was having problems presenting, since the strong ethics of the character undercut all the assumptions of sociopathy of such types popular at the time. The film finally betrays itself with a \"kiss-and-make-up\" final scene that completely undercuts the ethical problematic of the novel (in which Beaumont finally betrays his boss by running off with the boss' fianc\u00e9e). But until then, the movie moves towards its dark \"who-dun-it\" revelation rapidly and filled with tension.There is a scene dead center in \"The Glass Key\" where Beaumont is captured by the rival mob boss and tortured by the sadistic thug (which is from the novel), and filled with Freudian undertones due to the homosexuality of the torturing thug (Bendix) (also implicit in the novel). I think it was Japanese cinema expert Donald Ritchie from whom I remember an anecdote that it was this scene that fascinated Akira Kurosawa to such an extent that he felt compelled to make a film based on a Hammett novel. Interestingly, he did not do a remake of \"The Glass Key\", however. Instead, he transposed \"Red Harvest\" to the Japan of the civil wars of the 1860's, rewriting the nameless private eye as an equally nameless wandering samurai (played with exquisite panache by Toshiro Mifuni), while at the same time parodying the typical *chambara* (swordfight film) popular in Japan. I refer of course to \"Yojombo\" (1962). Nonetheless, the the torture sequence is lifted from \"The Glass Key\" and interjected as a pivotal scene in \"Yojimbo\". A couple of subtractions and additions need be noted here: Kurosawa strips the Freudian subtext out of the torture sequence completely, so that the torture becomes a study in the what Hannah Arendt referred to as the \"banality\" of evil\" - the torturers are just doing a job. This fits neatly with the critique of capitalism implicit in the film, and which is equally implicit in the Hammett original, so the loss of Freudian content goes by unnoticed.On the other hand, Kurosawa and Mifune add an earthiness to the nameless hero lacking in Hammett's tension filled original: Mifune's samurai is always scratching, eating, cringing or sneering. Perhaps this is to make up for the subtraction of the element of alcoholism that was the chief weakness of Hammett's anti-hero. But it also has the effect of rounding out the character so that he becomes human to us in a way Hammett's anti-hero is not.",

            "content": "Toshiro Mifune is cool and perfectly understated here - his character is a samurai who can dispatch a circle of guys around him in about ten seconds and everyone knows it, but he doesn't flaunt it, and is the ultimate tough guy. As many have commented, the debt that Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood owe to Kurosawa and Mifune can't be overstated, and at the time, I don't believe that was adequately understood despite the plagiarism lawsuit that resulted.If I'm honest, though I loved this film I thought its first half was too slow, in particular after it became apparent that Mifune's character was going to watch the townsfolk and rival gang members through a window and drive up a bidding war for his services. It builds to a glorious second half though, with some nice turns to a plot which was seeming to be all too linear, and iconic imagery. Seeing Mifune standing out on that street in the distance, the dust swirling around him, as a row of guys start advancing toward him, is an indelible image.Most of all, I love the complexity in Mifune's character, which seems other-worldly. He's the man with no name, a wandering samurai at a time when Japan was modernizing and they would soon be gone. He seems to have no sense of morality or honor, and yet we don't know what he would have done had he not overheard the clan he first pledged himself to talking about betraying him, and later he's an angel of mercy to a family, at the risk of his own peril. He's a man of the world, often seeming to care most about getting his next meal and some sake, and yet he also seems to have been destined by a higher power to come to the town to cleanse it of evil elements, of which there are many. The scene where he's in the cemetery and looks beat up and absolutely ghoulish amplifies this feeling for me. It's a remarkable character and performance.My only regrets for the film are its pace in the first half, as I mentioned, and in how cartoonish the gang members are. We see a lot of cowardice, calling for \"mommy,\" and idiotic behavior. Maybe the buffoonish character with the unibrow and moronic expression exemplifies this most, and I would have preferred it if it had skipped the comedy. There is certainly a comment on humanity or the modern, dishonorable world here, which instead of being happy to live in peace are endlessly fighting over material possessions, but it undercuts some of the menace facing the ronin. I loved how one of the characters (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to town with a gun, truly upping the arms race and representing the new world, and he's very effective. There's another who is very tall and wields a huge mallet, played by 6'7\" wrestler (Namigoro Rashomon), and I wish that weapon had been used in battle.As it is, though, that final showdown is brilliant. The moment with the gun towards the end is as well, as the ronin's action defies the expectations of the audience, and could be interpreted as supreme courage, world-weary indifference, or prescience. Maybe the film is saying there are very few truly kind or brave people in the world, and they are destined (or perhaps blessed) to remain somehow apart from it.",

The boss of each group tries to hire Sanjuro, who decides to solve the village's issues by pitting one side against another. Problems arise for Sanjuro when the son of one of the bosses shows up, who brandishes a gun and absolutely is not afraid to use it.\"Yojimbo\" was later remade into \"A Fist Full of Dollars\", featuring Clint Eastwood, and the similarities are certainly prevalent, particularly with their respective \"heroes\". Mifune, a great actor who is able to be extremely expressive without the benefit of a lot of dialogue, is once again excellent in this film. The story itself is a good one, and the film was entertaining overall. I fear, however, that I may have either tried to watch too much Kurosawa in a short period of time, or that I may have seen his three best too early, because there wasn't a lot that excited me in this film as opposed to say, \"The Seven Samurai\", \"Rashomon\" or \"High and Low\". At times the film seemed to drag a little, and Unosuke, the guy with the gun, became kind of a joke because after awhile the way he was acting menacing with his gun was really pretty humorous. I kept thinking about the Simpsons episode when Homer joins the NRA and was using his gun for everything, including turning on the television, and I don't think that was the reaction that Kurosawa intended.I'm not panning the film as a whole; I just think that \"Yojimbo\" is perhaps not one of Kurosawa's great films. Every great director has some films that don't seem to be in the same league as their masterpieces, (though I have yet to watch a Kubrick film that hasn't left me breathless with admiration) and I'm certain that Kurosawa is no exception. Because the film was decent, but not great, I'm giving it a decent, but not great rating \u0096 an average 5/10.--Shelly",

Initially, it's a little comedic how he plays with them but them he gets beaten up and the innocent get thrown into the mix and the humor leaves. This movie is really hard to follow because it's hard to identify each party as unique. One group are gamblers and the others are protectors of a brothel. The town obviously has no real presence of authority but the drifter doesn't bring any of that into play by being there. I'm assuming that this is because the wars are over and there is no one in power. I'm sure it would help to understand a little of the Japanese history to understand this movie -- unfortunately I have none. The movie really becomes pretty brutal and those left standing are just lucky -- I guess. Mifune's portrayal is a little confusing as well as he kind of snickers at both sides until he's beaten up and then he takes things into his own hands. A much heralded Japanese director in Akira Kurasawa made this film but I'm sorry I just didn't get the appeal of this movie.",

            "content": "I watched this film mainly because I had read it inspired one of my favorite Westerns, A Fistful of Dollars. I can say it was a pleasant experience, as Yojimbo is a remarkable movie, brilliantly directed by Akira Kurosawa.Instead of the Man With No Name, played by Clint Eastwood in the Dollar trilogy, we get Kurosawa-regular Toshiro Mifune as a nameless ronin (masterless warrior) who ends up in a village torn apart by the war between two rivaling gangs (the setting is medieval Japan, as in other movies by \"the Emperor\") . Tired of all the suffering he witnesses, our protagonist decides to take down both criminal groups. How? By having them destroy each other, one by one.Kurosawa brings another fundamental contribution to a genre and world he knows well with this compelling tale about greed, justice and loyalty. Even if you already know the ending, the film will keep you captivated until Mifune has delivered his last philosophical one-liner. He is very intriguing as the unidentified man who slowly but firmly restores order and peace (Eastwood would later do so too, but not with the same elegance, neither physical nor verbal).Yojimbo truly is a masterwork of Asian cinema, a powerful achievement which spawned dozens of copycats and influenced an entire career, having the same effect on Sergio Leone as Hitchcock had on Brian De Palma. Definitely worth a look if you want to see who did these things first and best.I do wonder what the Man With No Name's catchphrases would have sounded like in Japanese, though...",

Not that it matters, as the two films feature the same character but have totally unconnected stories. I actually liked SANJURO the better of the two, mainly because it was funnier and more tightly scripted. However, there's no denying that YOJIMBO is a great movie in itself, a film both highly influenced by westerns and which would highly influence westerns to come (Sergio Leone famously 'borrowed' the story for his iconic classic A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS).The story is taken from the pages of pulp fiction and involves a rogue samurai (Toshiro Mifune, on top form) who comes into a rural town and finds a war going on between opposing gangs. Determined to clean up the mess, he plays both sides against one another, with the stakes gradually raising as the action ensues. Along the way there are some great set-pieces as you'd expect from Kurosawa; I particularly liked Sanjuro's attack on the building where the wife is being held hostage.Kurosawa is, as ever, a master of form and the widescreen cinematography looks fantastic. He also elicits great performances from a strong cast, with actors bringing to life the nuances of the scripting. Tatsuya Nakadai really stands out as the slick bad guy but the actors playing the other bizarre and memorable, almost comic-book characters are fine too. All in all, YOJIMBO is an acknowledged classic and for good reason - it's great fun!",

A wonderful action film that has plenty of violence mixed in with laughs that makes it one of the all time greats.

Seeing an opportunity to turn his samurai talent into cash, Sanjuro seeks out the leaders of both factions in an attempt to up the stakes with each one. In that regard, Sanjuro has no particular loyalty, and can be swayed by the highest bidder. Or can he? I had to laugh the first time the clans of Seibei and Ushitora first opposed each other in the street. Both sides proved equally cowardly in their failure to engage the enemy, it bordered on the comical. I was impressed though by the size of Kannuki the Giant, the guy was massive. He reminded me a bit of Japanese wrestler Shohei Baba, better known in this country as Baba the Giant, active around the time this film came out in the early Sixties.There was a bit of a disconnect in the story for me when the opposing clans felt they had to break from their fighting when the inspector from Edo came to the village. My question was 'why'? What kind of penalty was the inspector going to impose if clan members wound up killing each other? There's really no satisfactory answer to that, that I can think of, and there was none offered in the story. It just seemed irrational to me.I think what I might have to do here is revisit this film once again later on as I did with Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\", which I didn't find that compelling the first time around but gained a greater appreciation for it with a second look. I did like Toshiro Mifune in this one though, consistently going back and forth between the warring leaders to constantly confound them by contradicting his prior intentions.

Yojimbo translates to bodyguard, but do not make the mistake of comparing it to the 1992 sappy mess The Bodyguard (Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston). This is one of the finest Japanese films ever made, directed by arguably the greatest Japanese director (Akira Kurosawa), and starring one of the top Japanese actors (Toshiro Mifune). It also served as the inspiration for Sergio Leone's classic 1964 western, A Fistful of Dollars (with Clint Eastwood).Based in 1860, we meet the unemployed ronin/samurai (Mifune) wandering the countryside allowing a tossed tree branch to determine the direction of his path. It leads him to a town where the ominous first visual is a dog carrying a human hand in his mouth. We realize this isn't going to be the most welcoming of towns.The town is controlled by rival factions: the Silk merchant versus the Sake brewer. They represent crime lords Seibel and Ushitora, respectively. Our clever ronin decides to play both sides against the middle and ends up hired as a bodyguard by BOTH gangs. As you can imagine, this leads to real problems for all involved.The psychology of (corrupt) power and fear is in play here, as is some dark humor (the coffin maker). The biggest clash comes with Unosuke who proudly carries the town's only pistol. He certainly enjoys the respect and power that comes with that handgun. The samurai are trained to be loyal at any cost, and it's quite interesting to see our protagonist adapt the self-preservation in his new world.Masaru Sato delivers a very unique score - one quite unusual for the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune has one of the great faces in cinematic history, and Kurosawa is in prime form. This is definitely one to see if you enjoy the best films from all countries.",

            "content": "\"Yojimbo\" (Bodyguard), is a wonderful drama. There isn't enough fight scenes that I would qualify it as an action movie, but it certainly doesn't fall short in style, substance and even comedy. Debatable comments have been made whether it drew influence from the classic 1929 detective novel \"Red Harvest\", the film shines as one of the best of the Kurosawa-Mifune collaborations, and was remade in America as the iconic \"A Fistful Of Dollars\" (1964).A wandering Ronin (Toshiro Mifune) comes across a town that is virtually empty at first glance. However, it doesn't take too long for him to find out that the town has two crime lords trying to dominate each other for supremacy. Realizing the possible potentials of profit, he decides to offer his services to each mob and easily flips every situation to his gain. How long can he keep this charade up?I find that our nameless protagonist \"Kuwabatake Sanjuro\" (\"Mulberry-field Thirty-youth\"), is one of Toshiro Mifune's most endearing performances. It easily captures the somewhat playful attitude that makes him such a lovable rogue, but he can also dive into an intense portrayal and scenario effortlessly. This is also the first Kurosawa movie for another eventual regular Tatsuya Nakadai, who had an extremely fleeting appearance in \"Seven Samurai\" (1954). He is a wonderful rival to Mifune, and he does extremely well with his character given the lack of dialogue.Finally what remains to be mentioned is the insanely wonderful musical opening score, and Kurosawa's camera-work looks as effortless as always. Clearly the image of a Samurai standoff in town hails back to any classical Western, and remains some of the most vivid imagery in all of his black and white movies. Just to note as well that Kurosawa's use of wind bellowing in some scenes really makes great and subtle emphasis.Final Verdict: I don't think I need to sell this movie to you anymore, watch it once and fall in love with it forever. 9/10.",

            "content": "Wandering in a desolated pre-Meiji Japan, a samurai entrusts a piece of wood thrown in the air to guide him once it hits the ground.He finds himself in a town where two clans fight over political and economical control: there's Seibei, a ruler dependent on the silk commerce and his domineering wife's judgment, and the greedier Ushitora, in the sake brewing business, who wants his share on the silk. \"The Godfather\" had five families, in \"Yojimbo\" we get only two, it's more economical but still calls for the same Machiavellian skills Michael Corleone demonstrated, he who learned \"to think as the people around. and on that basis, anything is possible\".The rivalry is exposed like a chess game where the Samurai moves the pieces. It means there's more time for thought than action and action must be quick and efficient. Inertia is a power never to be underestimated, being strong from a misleading passiveness. Look at Mifune in his first scenes, moving his shoulders, scratching his cheek. I read Kurosawa told Mifune to play his Samurai like an errand dog, maybe that explains the next startling shot of the dog trotting over the main street with a hand in his mouth, maybe it's only a matter of time before the Samurai starts the biting.And when the thinking stops, a few shots of sake helping, he says \"I'll get paid for killing, and this town is full of people who deserve to die.\" There's profit for him and peace for innocent villagers, it's a fair trade meaning every move has to be carefully prepared. So when he's taunted by three Ushitora's thugs, he knows he's being observed after having been the observer for a long expositional sequence, he's got to prove he means business. He kills two and chops one's arm, then order two coffins to the undertaker before retracting himself and asking for two, a scene reprised in Sergio Leone's remake \"A Firstful of Dollars\".This is \"Yojimbo\" character-establishing moment, from that point, each Family will want to hire him as bodyguard (the title's meaning). Unbeknownst to them, he'll work for both sides and for neither and he's far a better poker-player than sword-wielder, which is saying a lot. And these poker/chess games exemplify something remarkable in Kurosawa's filmmaking, his films are rooted in the present, whether in dilatation or acceleration. Think of \"Rashomon\" where the same scene is repeated over and over to accentuate the changes of body languages and emotions in each version, in \"Ikiru\", the present is the only thing a man can hook his life to and so does it in \"Yojinbo\".Even the name given by the Samurai: Kuwabatake Sanjuro is a throwaway alias inspired by the mulberry fields he was just seeing. Like Eastwood, Mifune has no name because a name has a past and he's a man of the present. And Kurosawa's directing is the embodiment of Sanjoru's skills, it's a total control of every moment, a slow ballet between inertia and movement, observation and action. Look at how messy and awkward the fights are until Sanjuro intervenes, and the fight is over as soon as it begun.The violent moments make for less than a minute in the whole film and the reason why they go so quick is because Kurosawa wants us to focus on something else. When Sanjuro's betrayal is exposed, an immediate ellipse shows him at an inch of life, no need to see the beating, the story must go on, but when he's beaten again by Kannuki the giant, the fight serves a purpose. To focus in \"Yojimbo\" is to try to give every detail a purpose.And this is why many scenes show characters in viewing position: the most emblematic one is Sanjuro amusingly watching from above the two clans getting ready to fight before it's cancelled by the arrival of a government official, a \"bugyo\" (a small role for Takashi Shimura). Later, a long close-up on Sanjuro's disfigured face reveals in the next shot the key to an escape he had just spotted. And that's the key literally with the film, the more you focus, the more you find. Sanjuro understands Ushitora is planning a murder to make the bugyo leave the town, he knows this is an innocent death he won't prevent. Hiding behind a stoic fa\u00e7ade some self-loathing feelings, he moves forward by bargaining the price of his collaboration and asking for more sake. That's a subtle detail in Mifune's body language I couldn't see the first time.There are so many areas to praise I wouldn't know where to begin, it's extraordinary how a movie that feels so effortless became so influential, showing for the first time bad guys against other bad guys, and Mifune giving quite an underrated performance as an antihero who redeems himself a little when he loses a few battles, meeting his match in Ushi-Tori's brother, Usonoke, the young and handsome Tatsuya Nakadai who proudly harbors a gun, the only element that added more unpredictability. At the end, there's one moment where Sanjuro doesn't keep his guard up as if he was ready to die like a Samurai or or because you can't cheat death so many times without giving it a free shot.\nMaybe that's why the present is so present, it's haunted by the fear of death; maybe the common denominator of Kurosawa's movies, the Damocles sword that force characters to move forward. That might also explain why the soundtrack is so incongruously modern, unlike the pompous gravity of epic scores, Kurosawa dares the synthetic sound and even sometimes pop music, allowing the film to free itself from genre conventions, foreshadowing the indispensability of music in the Western genre, thanks to a maestro named Morricone.Kurosawa trusted his instinct with a Samurai flair, he didn't just make movies, he defied conventions and became a perpetual re-inventor, or the true Sensei of modern cinema.",

            "content": "A scruffy, mysterious stranger with no name and no past enters a town ruled by feuding gangs. Joining one faction, then the other, he plays the two sides off each other, leading to a violent confrontation in which both are utterly destroyed. And when the dust settles, he gathers the spoils and rides on. No, this isn't a rip-off of Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars, this was Leone's inspiration. And as wonderful as 'Dollars' was, Yojimbo is even better.In this movie, Kurosawa isn't trying to be deep or highbrow, he only wants to entertain. On second thought, that's not entirely true. For some time, Kurosawa's critics had derided his work as 'too western,' a charge that I as an American am not qualified to comment on. Well Kurosawa decided to show them just how western he could be, drawing heavily from those most American of genres, the western and the gangster movie. And the results were brilliant. It may not have the grandeur of Seven Samurai, the emotional depth of Ikuru, or the complexity of Rashoman, but what it lacks in these qualities it makes up for in wit, style, and action.Sanjuro (the name the mysterious samurai gives himself) is one of Kurosawa's most interesting characters, despite, or perhaps because, he is among the least realistic. Quite simply, he's too good to be true. He fights like a whirlwind, effortlessly slicing his way through his opponents like the villain in a mad slasher movie, minus the gore. And he's cleverer than any man has a right to be. He strategizes like a chess master, pitting his enemies against each other without their knowledge, so that he can pick off the winner. And if the desired confrontation doesn't materialize, he creates a new plan, finds a new center of leverage to send them clawing at each other again.He's almost reminiscent of Blofeld in From Russia with Love- which brings up the point that he's not exactly the traditional hero. He's no villain; more than once he takes great personal risks to help those in need. But at the same time, he gives no thought to honor, serves no master but himself, and even when he commits the aforementioned kind acts it serves his own ends. Of course he's a saint compared to the bad guys. The crime lords, bandits, and gamblers who run the town are ruthless, double timing cowards, men without any redeeming value, in short, caricatures. But much like a Bond movie, this only adds to the fun. After all, you wouldn't want the audience feeling sorry for them when they're slaughtered.And leaving out believable characters helps turn the drama to comedy, which Yojimbo is, at least in part. Though the visuals are bleak and the bodies pile up at an alarming rate, the chief reaction is one of amusement, even humor. The comical supporting characters of the barkeep and the carpenter don't hurt either, nor do Toshiro Mifune's quips and one-liners. He really does a bang up job of acting here. As incredible as his character is, he really brings him to life, showing wit to rival Roger Moore and a sense of ironic detachment that would make Steve McQueen proud. Clint Eastwood's screen persona surely owes a lot Mifune's work here.Yojimbo is an absolutely wonderful blend of genres and styles that will leave you entertained from beginning to end. It's got laughs, great action, wit and charm aplenty, and all the polish and production values one would expect from a perfectionist like Kurosawa. This may not be his best film, but it's still the kind that most directors only wish they could make. Unless you're one of those poor souls who can't stand to read through a movie, find a copy of Yojimbo. You'll be glad you did.",

            "content": "Yojimbo, which was \u0091remade' three years later and only slightly different as Per un pugno di dollari (which I will refer to as A Fistful of Dollars from here on), is a really impressive piece of film-making. Made back in 1961, it is obvious the Japanese not only had quality actors, but also at least one good director. The story itself had not much surprises for me, since I've seen A Fistful of Dollars about five times and since that film is almost an exact copy of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Still I enjoyed watching Yojimbo, because it combined good acting, an amazingly modern score for its time and good directing. \nToshir\u00f4 Mifune (most famous perhaps for his leading role in the mini series Shogun) plays the main character in Yojimbo, who is just as cool and has just as many one-liners as Eastwood in the \u0091remake'. The only difference between Eastwood and Mifune would be that the latter one does not smoke. Even some of the gestures that Eastwood's character had in A fistful of Dollars are similar to the ones Mifune had in this film. It is almost surreal how much these films have in common. The films are equally well made and equally good as far as I am concerned, except maybe that there was no qualitative equivalent to Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 in this film. The only real difference I could find between the two films, was that Yojimbo is a bit more \u0091brutal' than A Fistful of Dollars (watch what the dog has between his teeth in both films). All in all, this is a pretty good film and certainly one that has earned his place in cinema history. I for one will go and try to consume more of Kurosawa's films and maybe you should go and see if you can dig up Yojimbo or another one of his films as well. 7,5 out of 10",

The story is simpler and moves along faster, and Mifune doesn't have to share the spotlight with others so much. It's his movie, and is he ever \"bad\"!There's a scene in the movie that puzzles me, I had to watch it several times, and still don't get it: It's where some government officials visit the village our hero's \"saving\", and soon find themselves passed out on some spiked sake... the man who's serving them goes up to each of the two passed-out officials, and replaces their little bottles from behind, and then gives their sleeve a snap as if to straighten out the fabric, and gives a little snappy salute or something I can't figure it out, maybe you can.\nIf you like samurai movies, you just gotta see this one, no getting out of it.

Remember any Western Classic from 60s and how much we all love them but what was it which was made before them and left influences? Here it is, Yojimbo. A benchmark in Action Oriented Cinema and Positive Machoism of the Protagonist. Yojimbo is about a crafty Samurai who arrives in a town which is divided by two criminal gangs and he decides to play them against each other to free the town and to earn money for himself. Unlike other Westerns made in the decade or before this one, Yojimbo doesn't really try to glorify the hero as a Good Man, even though he does some good things. All of sudden a Man with no morals and kindness does the Most Kind thing of his life and get punished. Later, his revenge begins and we find ourselves in Action Packed Zone. The production design of the film needs to mentioned on high priority because there are many details to know. It's just a Town, but the set-up, the places, the planning everything is smartly crafted. Toshiro Mufine as a deadly ronin shines like the first ever lovable Ronin. His macho image held my head and heart throughout the film. There are too many Supporting actors to name for thier acting efforts but to keep it short, all are Good. Background Score and Cinematography is unique and influential for this genre. Akira Kurosawa is a Master Director and it's proven again with this film. Yojimbo may not be philosophical and subtle like 'Roshomon' but it has everything for what it was made. Kurosawa took the perfect regional flavour and grinded it smoothly while pouring this yummy flour. This early Spicy Action Film for movie goers deserves all the reputation and legacy it carries. A Classic Samurai Phenomena.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Seeing a chance to earn a few coins he decides to sell his services as a killer to the highest bidder. In the process he ends up escalating the feud, turning the families against each other even worse than they already were. Sound familiar? That might be because this Akira Kurosawa film was remade in the West a few years later. Starring Clint Eastwood, the film was named A Fistful of Dollars. Perhaps you've heard of it.Keeping that in mind, the film is a fascinating watch. So many of the idiosyncrasies of spaghetti westerns can be explained by the fact that ultimately they're based on Japanese samurai films. The lonely, wandering hero. The gruff antihero that still ends up saving the day. The corruptibility of officials.It's also to be kept in mind that this is an Akira Kurosawa film. And quite honestly one of the best ones I've seen from him. The setting of the town is not all that big. A single street with a few important buildings, really. Yet it is used beautifully and the viewer becomes intimately familiar with it throughout the course of the film. Full props to Toshiro Mifune as well, playing the lead character, the cold and lethal ronin, who still hides a beating heart beneath his tattered clothes. One of his defining roles for a reason.Is the film without flaws? Not entirely. The musical cues are sometimes less than subtle, which is actually pretty common with Kurosawa, and the fight scenes, inventive though as they are, lack certain polish. A sword might miss by several hand-widths, yet the opponent still screams and falls. Small touches like that.Still, the story and the characters are so great here that I'm fully comfortable calling this better than A Fistful of Dollars. Not by much, but it does beat that classic.

For some reason I haven't revisited it since, so although I remember liking it a lot, it's as close as seeing it for the first time again as it just can be. This is my long, tedious thank-you note.Kurosawa's use of a wider aspect ratio is marvellous to watch. The frame is always rich in depth and motion, and often there is a rich supply of action not only in horizontal space but at the same time also either in the background or foreground. He likes to shoot intimately, shooting from afar but zooming in. I know I'm going to go to \"Sanjuro\" next, but I truly have to revisit the hidden fortress, his first film not shot in 4:3.And amazing use of music! It not only participates in what we see, it's sublimely ironic and truly a character of its own. This sly sense of irony permeates the whole film, and in effect there's hardly any need to justify or moralize. The action is violent, aggressive and remarkably fast-paced, and it bursts so suddenly and effectively that requires immense skill to build up to. And his escape from confinement, crawling under the r\u014dka (the corridor) creates a thrilling spatial restraint and actually manages to make the footsteps of the running enemies truly hostile. The violence of the wind takes on Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's utterly bellicose \"The Wind\" (1928).\"Yojimbo\" is so expertly crafted, so alive and full of wonders it's a treasure chest of cinema to cherish. I'm sure I'll not let the next visit linger on as long as it did last time.",

The fight scenes look static and the acting is real real over the top like live Shakespeare. Mifune does okay , but scratches his beard once too often.No make that twenty times too often.

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune collaborate again for the eighth chapter in a long and fruitful cinematic partnership. This act finds Mifune in a classic role: the cynical old samurai who rumbles into a small town, makes an impression and immediately lights the fuse to a long-simmering gang war. Casually manipulating both sides, if only to amuse himself and torment the unjust, he eventually presses his luck too far, gets in hot water and transforms the dalliance into an icy tale of violence and vengeance.As usual, Mifune makes the part his own, stirring a delicious blend of bold irreverence and well-earned arrogance; always the coolest guy in the room, even when he's held captive and taking a beating. There's something about the way he carries himself - the nonchalance with which he strolls through a line of armed men, the raging tempest in his eyes - that tells us this guy is cut from a totally different cloth.As with most lone samurai films, this one is both influenced by, and influential toward, the gun-slinging American western genre. In this case, Sergio Leone borrowed liberally from the plot for 1964's A Fistful of Dollars, sparking a legal struggle that delayed the spaghetti western's American release for years. Kurosawa often referenced the work of John Ford as a heavy personal influence, and the roots of this film are actually seeded in an American novel from the 1930s, so the lawsuit seems contradictory, but hey, that's how it went down. Either way, Yojimbo is a great one. Easy to watch, appreciate, and get wrapped up inside. I'd recommend it to anyone.",

Kurosawa started deviating from realistic depiction of samurai to more stylized story that's comical at times since he made this movie. The ronin in this movie is also named Sanjuro, but there is no indication that the two are one and the same person.A ronin (Toshiro Mifune) shows up in town where only thriving business seems to be the coffin maker. There are two rival gangs vying for power, and the ronin plays on both of them so they wipe each other out.The acting and setting of the story is very artificial. There is no way people of that period behaved in the manner shown in this movie. But that's Kurosawa's style. You can also see this in his later works such as \"Ran\".There are many funny moments in this movie, and this was the attraction for people going to movies when this movie first came out. It was the golden age of Samurai movies in Japan at the time this movie was made, and many samurai movies from that era were highly stylized and shot gorgeously. Most of them have never been shown outside of Japan (such as ones starring Hashizo Ookawa - another super star from that era). This movie is part of that culture. Only few years after this movie was made that era would come to an abrupt end with people shifting their entertainment to TV, and many movie studios that thrived on making samurai movies will go out of business. Kurosawa himself will find it difficult to make movies.The story borders on preposterous, but Mifune plays the good - bad guy so well that we just can't help enjoying the situation.It's not a movie for everyone, but an interesting movie to watch if you like Kurosawa, or like samurai period pieces.",

            "content": "Considering Kurosawa's incredible filmography, the fact that Yojimbo is generally considered as one of his best is an incredible compliment, and that opinion is very well justified. It is both an extremely entertaining battle of wits with great swordsplay sequences and fantastic dialogue and it also has some moral ambiguity.Ofcourse Toshiro Mifune steals the show once again in a Kurosawa film with his 'cool' charismatic attitude and his indifference to violence, yet also being an individual of some morals even though he seems to only care about gold at the start of the film. However, due to a certain selfless act in the later part of the movie where he saves a certain person it proves he is indeed an individual of some moral value. He is Sanjuro, which is an alias he gives, but nevertheless he is a ronin ( masterless samurai ) who wanders into a town divided by two rival gangs, so he decides to play them against eachother in order to make some gold in the progress since he seems to be penniless when he can't pay for his food at the restaurant. The movie combines Japan's three greatest actors together in one film with Toshiro, Tatsuya Nakadai & Takashi Shimura. After Nakadai's breakthrough in the first two parts of the incredible 'The Human Condition' trilogy in which he plays an idealistic good guy, he decided to play the villain in Yojimbo and in this shows his incredible range as an actor. Always keeping the evil fiendish smile on his face, his screen presence after Mifune has to be one of the strongest in cinematic history. Unfortunately Shimura ( Who had his greatest role in Ikiru (1952) ) has a relatively smart role, but still a crucial one to the plot.As usual Kurosawa uses his trademark tools movement and weather extremely well this film. It uses a lot of widescreen shots and excellent camera angles in which you never seem to miss a thing, they are always set up just right. Combined with the beautiful black and white cinematography there are some of cinema's greatest and most beautiful shots in this movie, especially during the epic final standoff which is one of the greatest scene's ever made. As stated before, Kurosawa also made use of weather once again to create the film's mood. It starts off bright and sunny, and as the violence escalates it starts raining, when finally in the climax there is a very hard wind blowing loads of epic looking dust on the screen. Kurosawa was a master of making loads of things happen in one single shot, and it is also the case here. A lot of shots have interesting things happen in the background, foreground and anywhere else in between. This movie created a couple of remakes such as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) by Sergio Leone which, while being a great film, still does not quite live up to the quality of Yojimbo and Last Man Standing (1996) by Walter Hill, which is a very poor film. It goes to show how influential this movie also is to western directors since Kurosawa is also known for combining Japanese and western elements into his films, and you can see a bit of John Ford-like camera work in Yojimbo.Everything summed up this means Yojimbo is an incredibly vibrant, clever, in many cases beautiful motion picture created by the master Kurosawa himself.",

            "content": "A year before Yojimbo, Kurosawa made a film called The Bad Sleep Well. A savage indictment of corporate and governmental corruption, it was a disappointment to audiences because of its downbeat (yet realistic) ending, and a disappointment to Kurosawa because he couldn't safely go as far as he wanted to in his critique. With Yojimbo, he solved both problems by doing a lose remake in a period setting.The world of Yojimbo is as full of corruption, betrayal and heartlessness as any Film Noir. The two merchants Tokuemon and Tazaemon are powerful yet decadent and, as their names suggest, there is little to choose between them. The town guard is a weak, toadying little man, and the government inspector grows rich from bribes. The hired killers of Seibei and Ushi-Tora represent the gangsters of modern Japan \u0096 a common target of Kurosawa's, but here the link between them and the establishment is made explicit. However, because it was staged as a Samurai action flick, Kurosawa was able to have this rogues gallery of bad guys wiped out by an invincible hero, giving the audience the satisfaction they would be denied in a straight, contemporary drama.But the allegory wasn't the only item on Kurosawa's agenda. As in his previous Samurai films, he was always looking to reinvent the Japanese period film, in particular to move away from the rigid moralism and ritual of the feudal setting. However, if Seven Samurai only pushed the conventions of the genre, Yojimbo leaves them in tatters. Once again, the hero is a masterless Samurai, the lowest of the low in feudal Japan \u0096 but Sanjuro doesn't care, and isn't interested in regaining his honour. He's content to be a drifter and a mercenary. He is to the typical Samurai hero what Sam Spade (from The Maltese Falcon) is to Sherlock Holmes.In the Bad Sleep Well, a kind of satirical cartoonishness was starting to creep into Kurosawa's work. In Yojimbo this is exaggerated even further, with Kurosawa picking the most grotesque and freakish looking character actors to play the mobsters and bloated authority figures. Unosuke, played by Tatsuya Nakadai (who was to become a Kurosawa regular, and would eventually replace Toshiro Mifune as his lead man), makes a brilliantly psychotic arch villain. For the most part though, the bad guys are simply made to look ridiculous, and Yojimbo does have elements of comedy about it. Sanjuro on the other hand, is calm, collected and somewhat aloof, a role Mifune (now a mature actor in his 40's) was ideally suited to. Kurosawa has him as a passive, silent observer through most of the picture. However, as is revealed in the scene where he watches the two opposing from the top of the watchtower, he is really the puppet master of the story.Kurosawa's direction is tight as ever. This was his best use of the 'scope aspect ratio yet. He organises some brilliant shots of the two opposing gangs, showing them as almost identical. There's also some self-reference of the short, wide aspect ratio, with Sanjuro peering through narrow window slits, further reinforcing the idea that he is an observer. There's a great use of percussive noises \u0096 the guard bashing his sticks together, gunshots, not to mention the music \u0096 which give the whole film a tense kind of rhythm.One of my favourite things about Yojimbo is the way the scenario gradually builds up and becomes more intense as the film progresses. There's an eerie calm at the beginning, and when we first see the gangs face each other they are reluctant to fight and just make gestures and threats. Then, as Sanjuro and Unosuke become involved everything becomes more and more chaotic, with killings, double crossings and eventually huge massacres taking place. When Sanjuro returns for the final showdown with the Ushi-Tora gang the tension is incredible. Every shot and every edit at this point is perfect, and I'd say it's one of the best scenes Kurosawa ever directed.Also worth a brief mention is the rain. Kurosawa was famous for his use of rain, but not only did he use it a lot, he also uses it very differently to the average director. Whereas the rain device is often employed rather obviously for a sad moment or pivotal scene, Kurosawa uses it much subtly and Yojimbo is one of the best examples. When the inspector visits, everyone stops fighting and it begins to rain. Because of the weather, it reminds me more than anything of a stoppage of play during a sports match, or kids having to play indoors on a rainy day \u0096 very suitable for the tone of the film at this point.In mixing his social allegory with tense action and pure fun, Kurosawa came up with a winning formula, and this is among his strongest and most enjoyable films.",

Attracted by the violent and lawless circumstances, the samurai hires himself out as bodyguard to both sides, curious as to what will develop ...This is one of Kurosawa's best and most accessible films, a great mix of adventure yarn, action mythology, gangster intrigue and cynical comedy. I just love this story; the idea of the tough guy deliberately playing piggy-in-the-middle in an explosive situation - it's the basis for lots of movies I like (The Glass Key, Miller's Crossing, etc) - mostly because it pits an intelligent, amoral protagonist against none-too-bright hoodlums, a device which has endless dramatic/comic potential. Yojimbo is cleverer and deadlier than anybody, but sometimes his smarts get him in over his head, or reveal the altruistic side to his nature which he seeks to conceal. He's a terrific antihero, prefiguring much of the work of stars like Clint Eastwood or Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his mysterious origins and motives are endlessly fascinating to ponder. Mifune is outstanding in the lead, all sly glances and knowing grins, his body language often saying more than the (minimal) dialogue, whilst Nakadai is electrifying as the gunfighter Unosuke, constantly suspicious and on alert, his cat-like eyes ever-searching for tricks or traps. Equally fabulous is Kurosawa's cinematic treatment, a widescreen eastern/western, full of blowing dust, elegant composition, great off-guard moments (the dog at the start, the arm-slicing scene George Lucas recreated in Star Wars, the fencing teacher's cheery wave goodbye, the goon who unwittingly helps Yojimbo escape in the coffin, many others), a great cacophonous score by Masaru Sato which is somehow grim and funny at the same time, and pitch perfect editing throughout. If possible, try to see the high quality British Film Institute DVD release in the original aspect ratio. I'm never entirely sure just why I like this movie so much; it's clearly very well made and highly influential, but it's the plot which keeps drawing me back. In the end, all films need a good story and this one is a cracker. Brilliantly written by Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima, and stunningly well directed. Followed by a loose and enjoyable sequel, Sanjuro, in 1962, and remade (with equally impressive results) by Sergio Leone in 1964 as Per Un Pugno Di Dollari / A Fistful Of Dollars.",

Story takes place in Japan in the 1860's and a lone samurai warrior is wandering about with no place to go. Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) comes to a fork in the road and decides which way to go by the way a stick is pointed. He ends up in a town where a dog has a human hand in his mouth and this perks Sanjuro's interest and he decides to hang around. He goes to a local tavern and meets the owner Gonji (Eijiro Tono) who feeds him sake and rice and he tells him of the troubles that the town has. He explains that Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka) and Seibei (Seizaburo Kawazu) once were business partners but had a terrible falling out and now both head gangs and want to take over the town. Sanjuro is amused by this and he heads into the street where he encounters some thugs from Ushitora's side and he kills most of them. The word spreads quickly that a strong samurai is in the area and both want to pay him to be their bodyguard. Sanjuro uses his wits to get paid by both of them and set up events where members of each gang get killed and blame each other.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Ushitora has a brother Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai) that owns a gun and he figures out that Sanjuro has been playing everyone for fools so he manages to get his sword away from him and they take him back to their lair where Sanjuro is badly beaten. He manages to escape and with the help of Gonji he hides out near a cemetery until he gets strong enough to seek revenge.Yojimbo is a classic all by itself and it has inspired many other films most notably \"A Fistful of Dollars\" with Clint Eastwood. So many things make this a unique film and how can you forget the shot of the dog with the hand in his mouth? Sanjuro was looking for a place where maybe he could find trouble brewing and one look at what that dog was carrying was a clear signal that he was in the right spot. The cinematographer is Kazuo Miyagawa who has worked with Akira Kurosawa many times and this is a terrific film to look at. There are many scenes where characters are standing in the street and the wind is blowing dirt and sand and these shots add so much life to the screen even when the characters are silent. Mifune once again is magnificent and one of the great things about his character are the human flaws that ultimately almost get him killed. At first Sanjuro is brash and confident but after helping a couple and their child he leaves himself vulnerable. Sanjuro is horribly beaten and Mifune shows every ounce of pain that his character is experiencing and its in stark contrast from earlier in the film where Sanjuro's movements seemed lackadaisical from confidence. Mifune had an incredible screen presence and watching him in certain scenes late in the film I was reminded of Robert DeNiro in \"Raging Bull\" where these characters were alone and had to ponder how they ever got into their situation. This part of the story gives the film a zone of realism that the audience can identify with and this makes Sanjuro more human. Kurosawa always had great set designs and the town that this story is suppose to take place in resembles something from a western and its probably not a coincidence since Kurosawa loved American films. This is easily a must see for everyone and I believe its one of Mifune's greatest performances.",

He observes, even as he is momentarily pushed out of frame - he adjusts his shoulders, scratches his head, and continues on in his worn out clothes, clearly signalling that the time of the samurai is coming to an end. The violin is foreboding and in mourning. Some versions will insert ugly English captions over this sequence, but Kurosawa is not one of those directors that needs this sort of aide. Slowly and surely, we begin to understand this r\u014dnin, this master-less warrior, the lonely wanderer of the western. He continues this facade as he enters the town. As he first encounters Ushitora's band of mercenaries, he is surrounded and buffeted by both background and foreground, and the mass of bodies and that gigantic hammer dwarfs him. Later, as he effortlessly cuts down three of them and establishes his ability, they eye each other on equal grounding. He makes a quip towards the casket maker that rivals Harmonica's about horses. He then walks with the same walk as he opened with, but which now carries an air of dominance and dismissiveness that he rides for much of the film. And the two sides react appropriately; they slobber over him, shower him with gifts and offers in hope of his allegiance. Kurosawa makes the two sides distinct. The town is conveniently aligned much like the prototype western settlement, with a runway down the middle for those dramatic confrontations. To the side, innocents peep out from behind shutters and bars, too frightened and held hostage by the warring factions in their little village. There are some immaculately detailed shots that layer several perspectives in their deep focus; the worrying father, the conceding mother, Sanjuro musing. There is a genius segment in the inn, where Sanjuro observes the conflict from all perspectives. First he physically separates the two sides of the frame from the centre, as Inochicki goads the casket maker and he thinks on his approach. Then, he tracks and follows the band of thugs through the windows, and then finally unveils both sides and their various allegiances. Gonji, the inn owner, provides running commentary, but it is the power of Kurosawa's images and compositions that stand on their own. He cackles from high above on the bell tower, as the two sides inch towards each other and struggle to commit the opening blow. The other character who is unafraid of action and bloodshed is the snake-eyed Unosuke, in one of Tatsuya Nakadai's finest performances (perhaps second only to his gaunt King Lear in Ran). His eyes are bottomless pits of black that gleam with anticipation of violence, matching his devilish smile. He brandishes the deadliest weapon in the film, a little metal gun that signifies the coming age and the death of the sword, and unleashes it without hesitation. In the finale, Sanjuro seems to recognise this defeat even within his victory, and offers a surrender to a gun that may or may not be loaded. Opposing these pure moments of drama are the scenes that seem to make up the dark comedy aspect of Yojimbo. These meld less seamlessly than Kurosawa might have liked. There is the oafish, heavy-set Inochicki with the monobrow and not an ounce of brains who hurries from fight to fight. The constable Hansuke giggles and scurries like a scared little rat, if only to further the illusion of a town in chaos and disorder. And in one peculiar moment, a weak Sanjuro makes his escape in a casket, but then insists on being let down in order watch the Seibei house be burnt down because it \"sounds interesting\".But what comes after that is so magnificent. A hanging corpse in the foreground forces the eyes to the stumbling, beaten figure that stands in the midst of billowing smoke and ash (so powerful that Leone would later mirror this same exact shot, among others). One man versus a gang, slowly shuffling towards each other as the cymbals and hi-hat provide an eerie rhythmic tension that would not be out of place in a Morricone score. There is no longer the sense of swagger and otherworldly strength that Sanjuro and the samurai of the old possessed, even as he dispatches the group...but there is a message for the fleeing trembling boy, that seems to echo a sentiment from the beginning of the film. The age of heroics is over, the gun is here...and those who cannot bear to take part in the coming massacres best run home to mommy.",

            "content": "By chance a wandering samurai enters a small village where gambling and gangs have replaced the tenants of normal village life. Gang-lords Ushi-Tora and Seibei occupy either end of the community, each with a small army of hired fighters. The bitter standoff that exists as a result has turned the village into a desolate place - well, except for the undertaker, for whom business is very good indeed. After a short time observing these things, the samurai decides on the best way to use his skills at killing to remove the two gangs and return the village to normality.It is really too easy to get home in the evenings and play a film that requires no attention and very little work and, as a result, there are several subtitled films that I have recorded and/or bought that sit unwatched long after purchase. However recently I have been using my LoveFilm to make more of an effort to watch films that really I should be more familiar with and at the moment that is meaning catching up on some key films from Akira Kurosawa. I make this sound like work but actually it is good for me to focus wholly on any film but also the quality thus far has been high.Yojimbo, like Seven Samurai, will be familiar to many viewers without even watching it simply because of the amount of references and remakes it has since influenced. The remakes range from the good to the terrible (and those that think that Last Man Standing is the worst remake ever should watch Van Damme's Coyote Moon or (even worse) Albert Pyun's Omega Doom), but without a doubt Yojimbo itself manages to stand at the head of the crowded pack. There is still a misconception though that somehow because it is \"foreign\" and \"black and white\" that it will be a heavier film without the action or entertainment value of remakes such as Fistful of Dollars, but, as stated, this is a misconception. On the contrary, Yojimbo feels slick and fresh 40+ years later and provides the viewer with much to enjoy and few weaknesses as it goes.Clearly influenced himself by American westerns, Kurosawa delivers a film that is cool, funny and dramatic - with all parts working well together and none dominating the others. He shoots it with such a good eye (with cinematographer Miyagawa) and very little visual clutter (either things or style) that the viewer cannot help feel impressed by how striking the samurai looks in the middle of the film but he never lets this style take away anything. With the exaggerated villains and side characters, the film is much more comic than I expected and it is more enjoyable for it as it also then helps us be in the mindset of the samurai (to a point) by seeing it as a bit of a game - an aspect that the dry and serious tone of Last Man Standing did not have and cost it dearly as a film. It is not anything to have you rolling with laughter but it is funny. Importantly though it doesn't detract from it as an engaging game of a story and it does have plenty of action and drama as the samurai plays out his plan.In the middle of all this it would be deeply unfair not to credit the importance of Mifune in the film's success. That the character looks easy is down to him because his presence and air of cool scheming compliments and is complimented by the overall style of the film. He delivers his lines with a certain amount of cockiness, but not ever enough to be arrogant, and his body language and screen presence make him instantly engaging. He is well supported though by plenty of actors doing good work to be comic characters but also still be useful as dramatic devices (ie the villains still offer a threat even if they are quite funny); Sazanka, Kawazu, Tono, Sawamura, Watanabe etc are all good even if they do stand in the shadow of Mifune. Nakadai's Unosuke (the gunslinger) doesn't get enough credit in my opinion. To me he was important because he conveys a cool sense of menace similar to the samurai's but yet also ensures it is always mean rather than clever, brash rather than precise and based on the gun he carries rather than anything about him as a man (which is how Mifune comes across).Yojimbo has countless remakes out there for you to check out - some good, some bad, but the original stands up strong in the pack. Without any real weakness the film is almost effortless in being cool, funny, engaging and entertaining. It is worth noting that everything looks easy - the performances, the blend of comedy/drama/style, the story, they all work together so naturally that one assumes that it just happened whereas of course it is down to those involved in the making and delivery. This is a great film that is fresh, cool and entertaining and deserves to be seen by anyone who has ever seen a remake or a film which it has influenced (which is a lot of people!).",

            "content": "Rating-5/10Yojimbo, A samurai action movie created by the legendary director and writer Akira Kurosawa. This movie is considered the stuff of movie legend, but for me, it is far from it. It's not that it's a bad movie, not even that poor, I just didn't feel it is special and wound up for me an average movie. So why do people love this so much?, well to be perfectly honest I have no idea, it is smart no doubt but just too dull to be fully enjoyed, the kind of movie only some can fully appreciate.Now don't get me wrong, the movie is pretty much built up of well done things, but just not well enough. Toshiro Mifune is very good as the samurai who makes up his name, he seems to act at a much higher level than everyone else in this cast, top stuff. As the acting goes though, it is not good and even though Mifune is on form, the rest of the cast drag the acting score so low I can't give it credit. The problem is it is just so over the top, it isn't believable and the characters seem like from a comedy at times. Kurosawa directs and co writes well enough for this, it isn't maybe what I expect from a movie held in such high regard, but nevertheless you can see his skill at times. The movie I felt is not paced all that well, it has a very slow beginning and very little action actually, the ending is the opposite with lots going on and more action than before, it needed for me to be more evenly spread. I think yet again the case with the cinematography and the editing is the same as the others before, done well not just not very well. I felt the editing could be a little sloppy, the cinematography makes sure that the technical side does it well with a nice approach and some pretty nice shots too. One thing I really disliked in the movie, maybe the most is the score, now some people who have seen it may read this part and disagree which is fine, but for me it is horrible, doesn't fit in the picture and makes ordinary scenes going slowly seem like there meant to be massive epic shots.I think sometimes it is easy to criticise an older movie because it doesn't have the same things we have today, but this movie does have some positives. The ending is at moments thrilling and as mentioned the action stepped up, the fighting is a little poorly choreographed but I feel it only looks that way because of the editing to make it look less violent. That said this movie is not all that gory and horrible, the odd death and arm cut off, but not in a disgusting way, the movie is more sensible than to horrify the viewer.I think by the end, you either could watch this with great praise or great displeasure, but even if you pick one way or the other, most should admit this is a smart plot. Of course Sergio Leone's \"Man With no Name\" series must be inspired by this, and that being a spaghetti western just goes to show how far this movie can reach and also inspire around the world. I do feel this is a kind of plot that works better like say in a western, a good story but points in it just not good enough for me, Kurosawa doesn't waste his time, he just doesn't make it enjoyable enough.",

            "content": "To watch this, wait for an evening when there'll be no interruptions, silence the phone, turn the lights down, then sit and watch the movie from beginning to end with a hot drink in your hand. You'll later rediscover it cold, having forgotten to drink it.The movie is ace. The story of a wandering Japanese samurai who happens upon a small town plagued by two warring clans. He makes it his personal job to craftily manipulate the two sides, getting them to destroy each other so that the town can be at peace again. Actually, his motive is unclear, as he seems to be doing this as a way of amusing himself as much as anything.There's a lot of production back story. The lead actor, Tishiro Mufune, was profoundly affected by the part he played, and continued to play similar roles for the rest of his career. It was also a turning point for the already accomplished director, Akira Kurosawa. There's a cute little scene where the only remaining dignified samurai in the town sneaks off over a fence rather than hang around for the action, giving Mufune a cheeky grin before strolling off into the distance. This actor was one of Kurosawa's old stalwarts - the director was signaling that the old school needed to make way for the new.Thankfully black-and-white, otherwise there would be a lot of red paint about. There is occasional chopping off of limbs and sword fights, but its down so theatrically that I don't see the movies as bloodthirsty in any way - no more than Star Wars or countless shoot-em-and-they-fall- down westerns.The only criticism I could have is to ask whether it is solely a guy's flick? My wife finds zero interest in it. There are female characters, and some key moments are when the macho tone is suddenly broken by realization that there are families trying to live lives in the shattered community. These pieces are short though, and the movie soon returns to its main themes.I could drawl on, but just wish to say that this is a good as it can get. Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' is equally excellent, but at well over three hours long can try the patience of the average movie enthusiast.",

The characters all have fun and larger-than-life personalities, the plot is straightforward, and it's even got the right amount of seriousness to it to maintain a sense of realism. The acting was all good and believable, and the protagonist's eccentric personality often kept me guessing what he had planned next.There isn't a lot I have to complain about with Yojimbo. I could probably criticize the movie's usage of stereotypical Japanese personalities, but this is a samurai movie after all, so if anything it helps to form the basis for traditional Japanese culture and ideals. Probably my biggest complaint would be, that there isn't much action in the movie - and that's really the only thing stopping me from giving the movie a '10'. Of course, you have to take into consideration that this isn't a movie about groups of samurai warriors fighting each other, it's a movie about a witty wondering samurai who meets someone nearly as cunning and witty as he.For anyone that's a fan of samurai films, Japanese culture, proverbs and fables...or even classic American films set in the wild west - then this movie will not disappoint.",

            "content": "(some spoilers) 'Yojimbo' marks the fourth Kurosawa film that I've seen, and so far, I'd have to say it's the weakest compared to the previous viewings ('The Hidden Fortress, 'Seven Samura' and 'Throne ofBlood')! Though, saying that, it's still pretty good, and worth checking out, but it is harder to get into and isn't that compelling until the second half. Also, I thought, besides Mifune's character in the Bodyguard, there wasn't really an array of interesting characters in this movie. In fact, the main and most interesting villain, a pistol-loving Unosoke (Tatsuya Nakadai) does appear until the second half and he isn't really given that much depth.The story of 'Yojimbo' revolves around a wandering Samurai (Toshiro Mifune) who enters a town run by two gangs. Basically, he plays them against each other and pits his services to the highest bidder, and he sneakily undermines whoever his current employer is. Mifune is excellent, and his screen presence is undeniable. The stark black and white cinematography adds to this sometimes very tense face off as well as the build up to it, and its eventual ultimate dramatic conclusion. You can definitely see this film being remade into a Western, and although I haven't seen the remake in 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'Yojimbo' does have a kind of Western feel to it- especially with the showdown at the end, as well as the main villain is carrying his beloved pistol. The climax of this film, and the events leading towards it, really won me over with this movie, but the pacing in the beginning can be a tad slow. It'll be interesting to see what Leone did with the remake. Another great thing about 'Yojimbo' is the soundtrack, and some of the humour. Now, I need to see 'Sanjuro'! 'Yojimbo' is essential Kurosawa,and I still need to see more of this talented filmmaker's movies. While, I don't think it's the best of the ones I've seen, it's definitely worth a look if you're into Japanese cinema. Though, if you haven't seen 'Seven Samurai', I recommend that before 'Yojimbo'. However, if you starting out like me with Kurosawa and have seen 'Seven Samurai', then 'Yojimbo' is an essential flick to see from his resume!***\u00bd out of *****!",

I first saw \"A Fistful of Dollars\", so I couldn't help but compare the two while watching.\nIn terms of stories, following Yojimbo, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" almost beats every beat. The key difference is the attitude of each movie. Fistful of Dollars is more human: you are more sympathetic to the law-abiding Baxter family. But at Yojimbo, both parties are as corrupt as the other, so you can't help but agree with the samurai: calm down, no doubt, they are both dead, the situation will be better.\nThe samurai himself is also a charming character. Unless violence is involved, he seems to be uninterested in almost everything. I especially liked the early scenes, where he put both tribes on the brink of battle, and he just sat down to watch!\nIn a sense, the proceedings are completely different, so that I began to appreciate Yojimbo itself. I feel like I have settled in the urban environment. This fact further helps.\nOverall, this is a wonderful story that keeps the barbarian community balanced",

This mysterious Samurai walks into this town and decides to make a profit out of this by cleaning out the crime in this town, all the time, receiving money.Yojimbo is easily one of the most influential movies ever made with Sergio Leone, 3 years later, making a Spaghetti Western of the same movie called 'A Fistful of Dollars' The movie is just so likable and simply so entertaining to watch despite having to read subtitles the whole time. The movie has amazing music, perhaps some of the most epic I've ever heard, entertainingly and well written dialogue which has to be amazing since I was reading subtitles, by the look of it, great acting, an amazing story and such great characters.The action scenes in the movie didn't bother me.

To be honest the plot is very similar to most Western movies about cowboys, all the story taking place in town and the hero is going to help it free from outlaws. The action scenes aged terribly, in other Samurai films they make smart camera cuts, but here you just see them swaying swords and killing each other without any blood or injuries.\nThis film is definitely watchable, but it could have been better.",

            "content": "This is one of those movies that even today gets recommended among the youngsters, even though the movie is from two plus generations back.Yojimbo is a story of a ronin from the fifteenth century who comes to a town that's torn between two local gangs. The ronin decides to clean the place up by attempting to set the gangs against each other as much as possible.The story is not always prefect and there are a few \"yeah, right, like that would ever happen\" moments in the plot, but it's rather interesting that things don't go just the way the viewer expects. The main character, for one, isn't given all the extreme luck and super abilities that spaghetti heroes like him often receive from the makers.The movie is somewhat comical, with the accent put on the silliness of the criminal element. A fair classification would be a comical Western...Excuse me, \"Eastern\" would be a more correct term.The characters are all slightly exaggerated. The evil smart man has an evil smile and an advantage; the stupid man has the unibrow and the arrogance; the cowards are pacing and have a scared look on their face. This all, however, makes the movie all that more colorful and doesn't feel as cheesy as in other movies with similar exaggeration.Camera work is close to perfect. Positions are very well chosen and nothing feels out of place (unless you do not feel the intention of the director). There are a few hidden meanings and interesting decisions. As one could expect, this movie isn't a special effects galore. However, where gore or destruction comes, it looks realistic yet not over the top. The music is well synchronized with the action and is mostly of a comic tune.The final verdict is that Yojimbo is a movie that's very interesting to watch. It owes this to the story, the actors, the music and just plain good movie directing.",

'Yojimbo' is a film that is imitated (or remade) many times, but never as cleverly. It is not simple samurai action piece, but it actually explores much philosophical themes. Toshiro Mifune is a samurai who travels around the country until he reaches into town that is ruled by two rival families. The samurai sees the situation as an easy way to make some money, as he pours more fuel into the fire with doing small deeds to both families. Although we learn that the samurai is not only greedy swordsman, but his real motivations can be interpreted many ways by the end of the film. 'Yojimbo' might not be Kurosawa's best (I guess it can be debated) or deepest, but it's definitely his most entertaining ones.",

If we can categorize this film as action movie, than it is most probably the best action movie ever made, mass copied by the greatest action directors in Hollywood but everywhere else as well. I have to emphasize that best of them are not even close to Yojimbo. Not even close considering anything, so I will just sadly disregard dumb comments posted as Kurosawa Vs Sergio Leone. Is there anyone of you that can say: \"Mozart Vs Moricone\"? Is that comparable? Well, I let that judgment to your gray cells responsible for art value and taste. Toshiro Mifune had represented the whole new movie culture until that time, the film idea of one man against the whole world. Yojimbo is someone who serves that idea originally and never seen until then - in traditional Japanese way. His later decent, Bruce Lee is putting that idea practically in the modern form: English language, western manners and western money. This is why I like to call Toshiro Mifune the spiritual father of modern action film, while Bruce Lee is a hero who was a practical establisher. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest master of action movies of all times. His sense for dramatic directing, smart camera, short and dynamic dialogs and far best usage of music in action films makes him the grandmaster of its kind. He is manipulating with deepest human emotions of the spectator and by that Yojimbo is far from just action movie which makes it number one. What is the miraculous about this film is that it maintains your attention every single second on the highest level, involving you every single second deeper and deeper. There are no such movies any more. Considering the values of the votes on this site, I give Yojimbo 100 out of 10.",

We learn, but do not exercise, much less self-critical to reflect on what shows daily existence. Technology advances, it becomes science, we have more and more glimpses of the vastness and power of the universe, but about living, about love, solidarity and respect, we still know very little. And if this is little we know, everything else will help very little to our long-awaited happiness. When you see \"Yojimbo,\" a movie filmed in 1961 and set in the nineteenth century, immediately feel that you are recreating life in the most marginalized neighborhoods of today (in microseconds) and the worst- governed countries (in macro). Akira Kurosawa, with his usual vigor and with that singular narrative black and white, reflecting the stories of the past, and he also uses for his known respect to which Japan considers permanent colors, tells a story that is very common among us: Two sides unscrupulous careerists, face one another for domination of a people. One is supported by the manufacturer of silk and the other the brewery. The police chief serves their interests, the coffin maker is hungry for bodies to evacuate its raw material, and among the people hiding fearing each day in the midst of scarcity and constantly fearing for their lives than to anyone matter.But as ever we are definitely alone, a man, a yojimbo (bodyguard), a powerful samurai warrior who feels he must play their part in that fateful battle front, enters the scene to see if he can avoid the shadows. And then, in an accurate reflection of a shameful and eternal reality, many things happen like that usually happen in men more absurd and blind. While these go to his traps, his brutality and obsessive siege, the people's side is no place for friendship, for faith in the other, and the exercise of solidarity, cunning and perseverance. Kurosawa makes us nod. Her film, half comic and half tragic, a western and as much as jeki jidai; remembered aspect, but inevitably present, has the smell of eloquent film, backed by a dense, neat art that deserves our applause and our greatest appreciation.And Toshiro Mifune is confirmed as a powerful actor histrionics, whose international success, and his constant presence in the films of the great Japanese master, was by no means a matter of influence, and yes, the deserved harvest of a committed and professional work as more. \"Yojimbo\" is opening the gap of Eastern cinema that deserves many, many more spaces.",

I say this because, for one thing \"Shichinin no Samurai\" is three and a half hours long, which is a little hard to watch if you have to read the whole thing (not Japanese).  Secondly, the choreography of the fight scenes in \"Yojimbo\" is FAR better than the ones in \"Shichinin no Samurai\".  In \"Yojimbo\" the fight scenes are fast and skilled, while in \"Shichinin\" they were more chaotic and hard to watch.  The 1954 movie was still very well done and exciting to watch, don't get me wrong.Anyway, all comparisons aside, \"Yojimbo\" is great work.  The plot is very interesting, and the script shines with much action and dark humor.  I guess I'm in no place to say how good the acting was (not Japanese), but it's sure as hell better then most of the stuff out these days.Another thing worth mentioning is the fight scenes.  Like old westerns, there aren't many, but when they show up they're super cool.  Toshiro Mifune's character - one of the coolest I've seen - is so skilled with that sword.  Its awesome, especially in the scene where he finishes off six guards...by himself.I'd have to say the one thing that kind of ruined it for me was having seen \"Last Man Standing\" (the stupid Hollywood version) beforehand.  I knew what would happen next, and that sucked.  I advise for anyone wanting to see this movie NOT to watch \"Last Man Standing\" first.So, if you're looking for an epic adventure about bravery...watch \"Shichinin no Samurai\", but if you want a dark, edgy, cool tale, rent \"Yojimbo\", now.8.5/10.",

When Sanjuro comes to the town looking for work, he quickly realizes that he has walked into hell. Being wise and perceptive, he quickly uses the greed and avarice to his advantage. By pitting the two town factions against each other, he not only gives himself purpose, he cleans up a cesspool. This is scene after scene of bitter commentary by the town leaders. They take great joy in persecuting one another, yet they are cowardly, hoping that Sanjuro will take their side. Death is everywhere. One of the most interesting scenes is when the coffin maker leaves because there aren't enough left in the town to pay for his coffins.Mifune became a star in this film. His cold presence and, yes, even his vulnerability (he is seriously injured) make him an interesting hero. One can sense the disgust his character feels toward this awful town.

It's clear from the very beginning what kind of place it is - lonely and violent. One could easily replace it for one of the cities we're used to see in American westerns. A long dirty road with houses, saloons and shops on both sides. An image of post-apocalypse in a civilized world.The main character, best known simply as Samurai, is played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Toshiro Mifune. Here he is a man with certain skills that allow him to be someone both sides would like to have on their side. Someone they're ready to pay a lot of money to have him on their side. He knows it and plans to use it. The trouble comes when a gunslinger comes to town. He is far more suspicious and much more feared than others. The Samurai is not too worried with him at first, as he knows he is a better killer, but he underestimates how things can easily turn out to be completely different from what he expected if only someone would rock the boat a bit. ------- ''''SPOILER'''' ------ And the person who eventually does it turns out to be he him self, his empathy, to be exact.Yojimbo is a very complexed story presented more as an action movie than a historical drama like some other Kurosawa's work including Seven Samurai and even something newer like Kagemusha, Ran etc. However, that does not make it less important or worse. To contrary, it's one of Kurosawa's most entertaining movies with a lot more hiding under the surface. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. Whether you're an average viewer or a movie buff, this is definitely a movie that has the quality to please both.",

We are embarking on an adventure of unknown import and outcome, with nothing fore ordained, but in the company of strength and readiness.There are few matches in the history of cinema to equal the director Kurosawa and the actor Mifune.  They are missed.No one in cinema has bettered Kurosawa in the choreography of action, and so much of what we've seen since is in his debt, but honors him poorly.You would do well to study Kurosawa's work.

Though not as cynical as Leone's remake, \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" \"Yojimbo\" is still a jaded reimagining of the samurai as an irreverant, self-interested mercenary.  The war between the silk and sake factions of the small town is in essence a pathetic comedy of errors, and Sanjuro's systematic annihilation of both sides, though probably largely deserved, is a sort of exaggerated, bloody prank.Of course, Kurosawa's patient, steady-as-a-rock direction helps to create an air of serious drama for the film, which serves to make the satire even more sophisticated.A special film to say the least--\"Yojimbo\" is fun to watch on pretty much every level.",

            "content": "Although it lacks the scope of THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and other more widely known films by the celebrated Akira Kurosawa, the 1961 YOJIMBO (also known as BODYGUARD) is one of the most important films of the second half of the 20th Century--and a film that was deeply influenced by American film. Even so, YOJIMBO stands on its own merits: it's a magnificent piece of cinema that will fascinate even those who normally turn up their noses at \"movies with subtitles.\" In theory, the film is based on the 1929 Dashiell Hammett novel RED HARVEST--but transports the basic story to a period in Japan when the Samurai class has fallen on hard times and must seek employment as common body guards. Sanjuro Kuwabatake (brilliantly played by Toshiro Mifune, who appeared in several Kurosawa films) is such a one, a scruffy looking and aging warrior who finds himself caught between warring factions of a Japanese village and responds by playing the two against each other.One of the film's greatest assets is its visual style. Kurosawa is very clearly influenced by the look of the American western here, and most particularly so, in my opinion, by HIGH NOON. Consequently, YOJIMBO leaps the cultural divide with considerable ease--but Kurosawa uses the images of empty streets and the lone warrior to considerably different effect, presenting him as a dangerous figure who emerges from the dust and the wind to rip wide his foes. But the film does not rely on visual style alone: there is plenty of hard substance here, too. The plot is tightly wound, action-intensive, and laced with a dry and very black humor, and the cast is superlative throughout.As it borrowed from the American movie western, so did it influence American film in return, most obviously in the form of the popular Clint Eastwood \"spaghetti westerns\" of the 1970s--where it was essentially remade as A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS. But frankly Clint Eastwood never had it so good: with Kurosawa at the helm and Mifune as the lead, Eastwood's \"lone stranger\" feels mighty tame in comparison.The Criterion DVD offers the film in original widescreen and in the best possible condition short of a full digital restoration. As noted elsewhere, there are occasional blips and lines--but honestly the film is so driving that you will barely notice them. The subtitles also seem to be a better translation than I've seen in any other version. YOJIMBO was my introduction to Japanese cinema. I urge you to let it be yours as well.Gary F.

The whole theme of \"don't look away\" was good for the action, in my opinion. I feel as if the jerking, oblique and changing camera usage found in most modern action films, takes away from the action, not improving on it. There would be a single-camera throughout a whole fight scene which added to the realness of the action. I also have to say, for the fighting, the western-samurai combination was well used.The cinematography was great; Kurosawa really uses the camera to his advantage. As discussed, cinematography for the fight scenes was great a 'less-is-more' situation for me. I loved the camera angle - for when the two houses slowly approach each other, unwilling to fight - as the Samurai watches like a god from above. The camera was often far away from the subject, which gave me a feeling as if I was more in the film than any other film I've seen before.The Western feel throughout the samurai film was portrayed through its art direction. The art director did an extremely good job with the city and roads, the single-street town with the occasional tumble-weed gave off the old standoff feel. Other western elements would be with the two sides fighting against each other, and the lone-ranger only looking out for himself, and oddly the good of the people.The film has a good story line. Although, the film has a fairly predictable main story with side points that cause some confusion yet a good amount of mystery and a closer look into the main character's morals. The main character is similar to any good action movie character, quiet, strong, and with a sense of justice for the common people.Kurosawa's one of my new favorite directors; directing, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Kagemusha, and Ran. I can't wait to watch them all. I greatly recommend Yojimbo for anyone who is looking for a good action movie and doesn't have too many graphics or gives you a headache from oblique camera shots during fight scenes. Yojimbo was a great film that isn't outdated from its black and white exterior, but greatly appreciated over time for its amazing directing and a great one-of a kind, film.",

            "content": "When I first sat down to watch \"Yojimbo\", I was under the impression that I would end up seeing just another run-of-the-mill unoriginal samurai movie... oh, how naive I was. I sat down with low, low, low low low (I mean, REALLY low) expectations. I left with a smile on my face, realizing I had never been more wrong in my life. \"Yojimbo\" tells the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake... wait, no it doesn't. \"Yojimbo\" shows the conflict between two rival gangs ... no, that's not quite right, either. \"Yojimbo\" is about good vs. evil... no no no.See, no matter how I try to describe \"Yojimbo\", the one-line cannot begin to summarize the film. Here, let me try this: \"Yojimbo\" begins with Sanjuro the Samurai, travelling all by his lonesome, looking to a short wooden stick for a sense of direction. Following the stick's advice, he falls almost directly into a village-wide feud between two rival 'families'. Both families want their counterpart dead; consequently, both families want their hands on the newly arrived Sanjuro. For each of them, he symbolizes definite victory. Sanjuro sees this as an opportunity; not an opportunity to kill, but to make a lot of money. The two families begin to auction for him, and he, of course, plays hard to get. In one of the film's funniest scenes, we watch as the two families meet in the center of town; instead of charging at one another, though, they creep towards the rival army, jabbing, threatening, both far too cowardly to actually attack. Sanjuro sees this too.. he knows at that point that he has them in the palm of his hand.Ah. Even now, after those two paragraphs, I haven't even reached the point of double-triple-quadruple crosses, violence, mercy, action and inaction, captivity, torture, sex, pride -- and lack thereof -- or even retribution. I kid you not, this film has all of them, and more. It is, in it's own beautiful way, a comedy, just as Mifune is, in his own unprecedented way, a comic actor. His performance, full of mischief, mock modesty, and method, is unmatched, even in the most prevailing days of characters like Jack Sparrow.I heard one man call this film a \"classic samurai action pic\", but that is, in the worse way, a terrible generalization. A synonym for 'classic' is 'archetypal', and this film certainly has no archetypes. To say 'samurai action pic' is to give the idea that it is based around heart-pounding sword fights, which it certain is not; that label ignores the film's politics, dark humor, and anti-heroism. I have never seen a movie, and probably never will, quite like \"Yojimbo\", and that includes the Clint Eastwood remake. If you don't like subtitles, or black-and-white cinematography, or physical gags, or scenes that take their time, this is certainly not the film for you. But for me, it was a wonderful 110 minutes well-spent. I feel as if I am rambling now, and perhaps I am. But that's what this movie can do to you, especially if you're not expecting much, and end up with a cinematic gem.",

            "review_title": "The Pure Idea of Peace",
            "content": "There are no 100% originality of men's creation. I mean that every single work of us is just an imitation of other people, so does the movie. The same thing that movie bring is the idea, and this little idea grow fast. Let's think about science-fiction idea, when we enter the world of cinema, we know that \"Metropolis\" is one of the first science- fiction motion pictures. Or, like \"Psycho\", the very first American- great-horror-film. The idea of horror, however, imitated by other movie creator, that they can make people frightened with their movie. And even the idea of the movie is basically from the experience of the creator, which is influenced by other people. With that assumption, I think that \"Yojimbo\" brings brand-new-soul of the movie. As note, this is my first Kurosawa's, so maybe there was another more pure idea than \"Yojimbo\". This new idea is the idea to impart, take sides to the truth, the \"real- truth\", and the deep meaning of peace. I mean the feeling when you are in safe and wealth. The thought that we must not escape the reality and keep fighting until the truth win against falsity. Yes, that idea is in many stories, but the idea to translate such a complex story to a background such as this movie is really brilliant.With one literal story, Kurosawa delivered a big deal of reality of the world explicitly also implicitly. What I always thought is two criminal family refer to two great nations of the world those days. You know, it is actually like Cold-War, when two force have great-amount of power but lack of courage to attack. I mean each side want the other side lose without being blame by another people. It can be seen clearly when two criminal families first meet and try to strike each other, but the result is nobody have guts to attack. However, every side try to rent bodyguard (\"yojimbo\") to defeat the other side. When the first maneuver begins, the protagonist just laugh, like some people laugh about the stupidity of Cold-War.But the idea not end just like that. With the wisdom and intelligence, The Samurai try to end the tyranny of two gangs. He knows that he is alone, I mean with some help of the restaurant owner and coffin maker, but he can seek the weak point of each side. He knows both side need money and will do anything for it, he can take advantage by this weakness. He broke out the winery and storage. Even, in the deep chaos, The Samurai still can feel compassion about other people. This is a kind of surprising idea. In the name of people's peace he sacrifices all his energy. Maybe, that person is what the world looking for. I mean the man who can end the long Cold-War, but that's just idealistic. As conclusion of the inner part of the movie is it brings new experience of crime even before the epic crime movie pops. You know is like \"Batman Begins\", but that movie was released 44 years after \"Yojimbo\". So this is an authentic one. With smart and simple twist that makes the audiences enjoy.I don't have much comment for the \"packaging\". What I always remembered is the suspense of the music. The battle is realistic and not \"hyper- realistic\". It is, in my opinion, very well directed and also critical. With the Japanese background, that you will not find in another culture, this movie is nothing but outstanding. From the purity of peace-idea and the very end of production design, \"Yojimbo\" is really thoughtful, entertaining, but also deep. Fantastic one!",

            "content": "I really struggled to get through this. My roommate described this as \"one of the best Samurai movies of all time.\" This site, which aligns more with my opinion than any other review site, also rates it extremely high. For the life of me, I can't figure out why. My best guess is that because it is iconic and has been copied so much, everyone reviewing it wants to feel in the loop.There is very little action in this movie. I think Yojimbo does less than 30 seconds of fighting the whole movie. Also hard to view him as the protagonist when he clearly exploits everyone for his own gain the whole time. I didn't feel that him letting a few people go at the end justified the havoc he wrought on the whole town.The pace is SO slow that I kept \"waiting for it to start.\" The acting is so over the top from everyone except the main character. You know when you're watching a great movie but then some side character pulls you back to reality with some horrible delivery? That was most of this movie. The dialogue was some of the worst I've seen too.I'm going to have to watch this again because I'm convinced I've missed some genius here but...it was such a struggle the first time, I don't know if I could make it through again.\nIt did have some unique shots, decent music, and an unusual storyline which I know is what put it on the map in the first place. It's just that the actual content was so subpar, I couldn't invest myself in the film. Maybe when this movie was made, it was groundbreaking. But since then we've substantially raised the bar on movie quality and this one doesn't stand the test of time.I'll revisit this review after a second watch.

From dialogs to acting, production to direction and very unusual for Kurosawa movie music is spot on in fact very good.

            "content": "Set in 19th century Japan, Yojimbo tells the tale of a wandering samurai who arrives at a rural town that's been torn apart by daily massacres carried out by the two criminal gangs living on opposite sides. Sensing an opportunity to make some money as well as to free the town from daily oppression, he decides to play one side off against the other while the two rival bosses try to hire him as their bodyguard but his plan is soon complicated by the arrival of one of the gangsters' son, who wields a revolver.Directed by the legendary filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa, Yojimbo still hasn't aged a day & remains one of the most influential treasures of world cinema. Kurosawa's direction is absolutely top-notch, cinematography captures the plot events in sharp focus, editing paces the story excellently but it's Toshir\u00f4 Mifune's bravura performance that makes this film such an emotionally-charged ride. There are also moments of well-timed humour plus the music makes its presence felt at the right moments too.On an overall scale, Yojimbo is a wonderfully crafted period drama that further elevates the craftsmanship of a master storyteller & benefits greatly from a strong, disciplined & impressive lead performance. It being still able to amaze & entertain even after having been imitated so many times is a testament to its greatness & ageless appeal and for the fine balance it presents over its drama, action & entertainment, Yojimbo is a must for cinema lovers around the world.",

I read that \"Y\u00f4jinb\u00f4\" inspired many westerns and one was inspired by them and that is true - the plot is very similar here to many westerns, especially with Clint Eastwood famous \"Dollars\" trilogy. Overall, \"Y\u00f4jinb\u00f4\" can be safely called a classic, it's truly is, because even seeing this film first time in 2015 one can admire its craftsmanship.

They were also a big inspiration on Westerns, which I also wasn't a big fan of. It can be hard to follow a movie with just subtitles, especially one whose plot I don't know getting into. I'd probably still say \"Rashomon\" is my favorite Akira Kurosawa movie. This is still a great movie in itself.Actually, I think I was actually introduced to the plot of this movie by an episode of \"Pok\u00e9mon\"! It was \"Showdown At Dark City\" which featured these two gangs in a city trying to get help from Ash. You have to give the anime credit for referencing something so highbrow. Anyway, the basic plot is that this guy named Sanjuro (not Yojimbo) goes to this corrupt village where two rival gangs both want him to work for him. As you might have guessed, he ends up playing both of them. There are few sympathetic characters at first.We do see some nice villagers who just want everybody to stop fighting. Sanjuro is shown to have no allies in this film prior to the story. It's a great way of seeing how a single character can play off of everyone else. There's even some really nice social and technological commentary. One guy has a gun which is an odd place for a samurai film. I also felt that the length of this film was just perfect. ****",

Or maybe it's reminiscent of a good western, choreographed in the unusual setting of a soon-to-be extinct feudal society.One thing for sure is Toshiro Mifune who plays the ronin or samurai without a master has a role with little opportunity for character development. He is simply a \"tough guy\" maverick who decides to play off one gang against the other in order to bring peace to the town (hardly out of altruism but simply for his desire for a little \"peace and quiet\").In that respect, there is an undercurrent of black comedy to the whole affair highlighted by a group of surly impulsive characters who you will have little sympathy for.The two crime bosses are Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka) and Seibei (Seizaburo Kawazuv) who vie for control of the town's illicit gambling trade.Ushitora used to be Seibei's right hand man but broke with him after Seibei appointed his ineffectual son Yoichiro (Hiroshi Tachikawa) as his successor.The silk trade merchant Tazaemon is allied with Seibei and the owner of the successful sake brewery Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura) is proclaimed mayor by his patron, Ushitora.The samurai who calls himself Kuwabatake Sanjuro (which stands for 30 year old Mulberry Field) kills three of Ushitora's men to prove his mettle as a swordfighter and then offers his services as a bodyguard to Seibei.When Sanjuro overhears Seibei's over aggressive wife order her son Yoichiro to kill Sanjuro and keep the money he was paid by the father, Sanjuro decides to wait it out while the gangs kill each other in a planned confrontation.A government official arrives for some meaningless inspections which gives each side an opportunity to call a truce.What comes next which involves Sanjuro playing the gangs against one another is way too complicated to describe here. Some may describe it as ingenious plotting but it's really one harried scene after another with little suspense as the focus is lost on the main character.Things pick up when Sanjuro is captured by Ushitora's brother Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai) who happens to have an advantage owning a pistol.Sanjuro's escape is perhaps the most exciting part of the film. The climax however is a let-down. Seibel and family are hacked to death by Ushitora's gang who in turn are dispatched singlehandedly by Sanjuro.The town businessmen are also not impervious to the violence. Tazaemon bizarrely emerges dressed as a samurai, beats a prayer drum and insanely slaughters business rival Tokuemon.Only Gonji (Eijiro Tono), the tavern owner, proves to be the most loyal and is rewarded by Sanjuro who frees him from the clutches of Ushistora.All the gratuitous violence tends to diminish the comic tone of the piece. Masaru Sato's score with its anachronistic instrumentation reduces Yohimbo even further to what looks like a low level early 60's American TV western.There's better Kurosawa out there. Look elsewhere.",

Mifune's character is so badass and efficient at swordplay that it just doesn't allow for extended action sequences, which is kind of funny when you think about it. Nakadai is also fantastic as a guy who ends up being the main villain in a film with a town full of them.Some of the plot details are a little hard to keep track of, but you always have a handle on the core premise, which is the main thing. Overall, it's an exceptionally well directed film with two very good lead performances and a fun premise. Certainly lives up to its reputation.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's most purely fun film, Yojimbo is the work of a master simply out to give his audience a good time. With a light and playful tone that gives way to an earned feeling of peril, Kurosawa's seemingly frothy ronin tale ends up one of the most thoroughly entertaining films of his entire career. Anchored by a wonderful score by Masaru Sato and a pitch-perfect central performance by Kurosawa's main star Toshiro Mifune, Yojimbo is a pure delight.A masterless samurai who calls himself Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Mifune), which means \"Thirty-year old Mulberry Field\" (\"though I'm nearly 40 now,\" he informs someone) wanders randomly into a town torn apart by conflict between two warring factions of gamblers, thieves, and brutes. He survey's the situation, receiving key background from Gonji (Eijiro Tono), the owner of a tavern. When the local boss Seibei (Seizaburo Kawazu) decided to grant ownership of the organization to his son Yoichiro (Hiroshi Tachikawa) instead of his righthand man Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka). Ushitora was so enraged, he took half of Yoichiro's men, and the two have been recruiting drifters and criminals ever since in an endless war of attrition over control of the silk manufacturing town. Out of either a sense of justice or just to entertain himself, Sanjuro decides that he's going to destroy both factions, but how? After thinking it over with some sake, he goes over to Ushitora's men, kills three of them with his sword effortlessly, and then walks right over to Seibei's to demand payment for his services as bodyguard. The idea is to get the two factions at a fever pitch as quickly as possible so they slaughter each other with Seibei using the opportunity of Sanjuro's presence and earned reputation as a killer to strike while the iron is hot.He uses the scheming of Seibei's wife Orin (Isuzu Yamada) to kill Sanjuro right after the battle as an excuse to return the thirty ryo they paid him to work for Seibei and sit out the fight, climbing a tower in the middle of town to gleefully watch the slaughter happen, having reached a pitch that almost nothing could temper. Well, except the visit of a Shogun inspector from Edo. His arrival prompts a ten-day period of an uncomfortable peace where everything must look normal while Sanjuro hangs out in the tavern, wondering when and which side will offer him money first to come and work for them. They both show up, represented by Orin on one side and Ushitora's halfwit younger brother Inokichi (Daisuke Kato).Things begin to go in the wrong direction when a magistrate dozens of miles away gets murdered, forcing the inspector to leave. The peace is going to continue for a time, though, with an important silk festival coming up, they need the town clean in order to bring in more money. Sanjuro won't allow this, allowing them to restrengthen themselves, so when he overhears the grumbling of two Ushitora men about how they risked their lives for seemingly nothing, Sanjuro knows that it was them who killed the magistrate, and he sets a new plan into immediate action, capturing them and giving them to Seibei. With the prospect of destroying Ushitora completely, the idea of peace falls away from Seibei and the scheming begins anew.Another complication arises with the arrival of Ushitora's other brother Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai), a psychopath who has somehow managed to pick up a revolver on his year long travels. It's a way to up the stakes, threat, and tension as Sanjuro has to adapt quickly. Mifune really is one of the joys of the film, but he's helped a lot by the fact that the character he's playing is so well written. He's smart, inventive, and adaptive while Mifune provides him a marvelously dismissive attitude to it all. When a barrier comes up in his plan, he figures a way around it. When the knowledge of the taken lackeys reaches Ushitora, a pair of kidnappings happen in quick order. This gives us a late introduction to a pair of characters, and I immediately felt a bit annoyed. Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura) is a figurehead mayor put in place by Ushitora, and he stole Nui (Yoko Tsukasa), the wife of Kohei (Yoshio Tsuchiya) when he couldn't pay back gambling debts. They also have a son. Upon its introduction, this feels like it's going to drive the narrative for a while, and the late introduction irked me. However, as it played out the decision made more sense.Up until this point, Sanjuro has been a disconnected troll, essentially. He's just been driving the two to destroy each other for opaque motives, and the sudden investment in actual people caught in the crossfire adds a new dimension to his character. It's about him, not them. His efforts to free them show that his motive is more altruistic than they might have been, but they also form the basis of his dramatic downturn when Unosuke (no dummy himself), figures out that it was Sanjuro who helped them escape, not Seibei's men like Sanjuro insisted. This brings Sanjuro into real peril and sets up the final, nearly apocalyptic conflict.What's interesting to me about the movement of the plot is how it goes from playful and almost irreverent to serious in terms of its sense of danger around out main character. Sanjuro might be my favorite Mifune character. As previously stated, it's both how he's written and performed. Mifune brings a subtle wit to the character in addition to the intelligence of how he's written. It's a surprisingly subtle and almost comic performance from the man, and I think it shows how much he'd grown as an actor in the decade or so since he had started working with Kurosawa. He really was a movie star in the fullest sense of the word, and he takes a strong script and helps to elevate it.Kurosawa himself brings his A-game again as well, filming in beautiful Tohoscope and filling each frame fully and intelligently. Compositions are fantastic from beginning to end, completely taking advantage of the large outdoor set and the placement of his actors to make wonderful looking frames from beginning to end, all while managing the whole cast, helping to give this light story surprising emotional heft and impact.Yojimbo is primo entertainment, up with Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's body of work. It's also an hour and a half shorter, which makes for easier watching.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is easily one of the greatest storytellers of the twentieth century. His influence can be spotted in dozens of other films, often his scripts were taken lock, stock and barrel into another genre. This particular film, \"The Bodyguard\", was remade into a film that made Clint Eastwood a star - A Fistful of Dollars. But to be honest, I think Kurosawa's film was better, and here's why. Unlike his maniacal role in Seven Samurai, in this film Toshiro Mifune's character is calm, wry, cynical and scheming. As a solitary Samurai swordsman wandering into a village he manages to manipulate both groups of criminals against each other while taking money (and sometimes returning it) from each in turn. But in the end, it's a matter of sword against .44, old against new. Sergio Leone never managed to copy that element into his remake of a few years later.But if Kurosawa had any skill as good as his cinematography, it was his casting. The characters in his films aren't just cardboard cut-outs like many of those we see these days; they had pathos and gravitas where necessary, and despite being set in what to most westerners is an alien culture, you can see that there's always a human element to any character, something you can identify with. The town guard is an absolute treasure, as is the sceming boss's wife (ie the one who really had the brains), and Ushi-Tora's eager but dim brother. The innkeeper gets more and more annoyed and rattled as Sanjuro (Mifune) plans his next move to create havoc between the two factions. And watching them face off against each other after the fencing teacher has run for it and Sanjuro hands his money back and sits off to one side to watch is just priceless.",

Do not get bothered about that this is a black/white movie, this actually gives it the right flare and impression. This movie does not need colors, or let me put it this way: the black and white colors simply fit to the storyline. Well, the storyline: Classic and awesome.

He arrives to a town divided by two gangs, one produces Silk, the other produces Sake. The Town is divided between them, both are they fighting for the being the one gang in charge, the fight has lasted long and has killed almost all business in town, except the one making coffins for all the corpses the war produces. Sanjuro wants to help, offers to help both of them depending on who will pay him the highest fee. But his real intention is to play the gangs against each other to free the town from them.My long awaited first Kurosawa experience, and i do admit, there is no doubt he is a rare genius. This story is just so well told, perfectly balanced the movie never fails to be interesting, all the way through it kept me interested, wanting to see the progress. Pure perfection. It's one of those movies where i thought afterwards how perfectly paced it was, every second is there for a reason, there isn't a second to much, or a second to little, fantastic. Also the movie, despite being very old, is actually still today very watchable, although it hasn't aged as well as some other old movies i have seen. I can still see where many modern movies have gotten the inspiration from, the amount of scenario you can recognize here is absolutely admirable, and there has also been much talk about the storyline directly have inspired a great director like Sergio Leone, to make his western triumph \"A Fistful of Dollars\".Kurosawa is the genius in this movie, in a movie that is so well construction you can tell this movie was made by a creative genius, but also a man who constantly seeked for perfection, every thing in the movie seem to be thought so well through, every little sequence. One great piece in the movie directing wise is the stunning use of the a confusing touch to the movie, the windy, cold, dirty roads of the town, it's just so well portrayed.I haven't seen many old Japanese movies, but the acting here is brilliant, i love the passion that exists in the Japanese language. Toshiro Mifune is quite fantastic in the leading role, but i think all of the cast gives a very good performance, and there isn't a flaw to put on any of them. Especially the wife to Seibei i thought was fantastic in portraying the cold, evil and brutal women, that she played.To up it up. This movie is almost a perfect construction. Furthermore the movie has inspired decades of movies, truly admirable. I was very surprised to see how well such an old movie manages to keep my interest up nearly all the way through, it's really a well balanced movie that never manages to get boring at all. But even though i have a lot of praise for the movie, it didn't get all the way through me, i wasn't stunned afterwards, i didn't want to become a samurai and a Japanese, that is what makes me not giving it a top grade. But i still found it a very good movie that portrayed many sides of the human mind, greed, anger, fear, evil, but most important we also got to see how Sanjuro, the fearsome Samurai, also had a heart of gold with his intention of helping the innocent in people in the village.8/10",

Ever since i heard that this was the film that inspired Sergio Leone to make A Fistful of Dollars i had to see what was the catalyst for not only a great series of Westerns but the careers of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone.A dishevelled wandering samurai reaches a crossroads. Picking up a stick, he tosses it in the air. He then follows the direction the stick points. Thus we are introduced to the hero of this film, and at the same time shown that he is a ronin, a masterless samurai with no ties. Arriving in a nearby village, he discovers the place to be desolate and windswept, with no obvious signs of life. But in fact there are two rival gangs, led by Seibei and his former lieutenant Ushi-Tora, trying to monopolise the local trades. Seibei has the silk and sex trades parcelled up, while Ushi-Tora controls the sake. After demonstrating his strength as a samurai, both sides want to hire him as a yojimbo (bodyguard) so that they can finish off the other gang and have everything to themselves. The samurai, whom we learn is Sanjuro Kuwabatak\u00e9 (though that is undoubtedly not his real name), has other plans for the village. He proceeds to play one side off against the other in an attempt to destroy both. Nobody made films like Akira Kurosawa. Only having recently been introduced to his movies i must say they have had a big affect on me. Because they have influenced so many great film makers it has led me on to see some classic movies otherwise which i may have never had seen. I watched and reviewed The Seven Samurai and Ikiru recently but without doubt Yojimbo is my favourite. This film is dark yet humorous and you cant help but love the characters on show. The narrative is easy to follow and the acting is superb and as usual in all Akira Kurosawa's films , the protagonists on show are just that little bit mad! . But the best thing about Yojimbo is it's simplicity. Toshir\u00f4 Mifune is fantastic as the scheming samurai and i also loved the performance of Daisuke Kat\u00f4 who played the cowardly brother of Ushitora. To be fair this does not resemble a Fistful of Dollars very much at all yet you can see how American westerns influenced the way Kurosawa made his movies . Yojimbo is fun to watch on every level and if you love movies and have not seen this before , you must! 9 out of 10",

But something very different is going on in his mind. What is it? Well, you'll have to see the film. The performances are top notch. The direction is superb.

You may find this hard to believe but this movie influenced Sergio Leone's A Fistfull of Dollars. The Man with no Name who has becomes the world's most famous cardboard character was based on Yojimbo's lead role.Once again, Toshiro Mifune stars. Set in the late 1800's, he plays a wandering Ronin (a samurai for hire, rather than in the service of a monarch) who stumbles upon a seemingly peaceful village after a long day of walking a dusty road. He soon discovers that the village is a battleground for two rival mobs. Both are eager to have our hero on their side, once they learn that he is a skilled warrior. He gets cleaver and turns this feud into a game, playing both side against each other with repetitious double crossing.Of course, there is a reason why Yojimbo is my favourite Kurosawa. It feels lighter and chirpier than the others. He adds a slight dose of dry humor to the premise, which keeps it from being too dark. He may be a slow story teller, but Kurosawa is no dud, he is a master craftsman. If you have patience and true cinematic appreciation, you will not question films like Yojimbo for a moment.",

            "content": "In a way, Clint Eastwood may owe the success of his career (or at least the moment of success in his career) not to director Sergio Leone and a movie called \"A Fistful of Dollars\", but rather to a Japanese movie called \"Yojimbo\" and a man named Akira Kurosawa. For those not familiar with the tale of copyright controversy, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" is really an unauthorized remake of \"Yojimbo\", which led Kurosawa to successfully sue Leone for copying his film. Now the heat has since calmed down and Kurosawa admitted he enjoyed \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and considered it a worthy remake. However, comparing the two films, it is obvious: the original is the best.We usually associate the plot of a sneering gun for hire playing the two crime bosses of a town against each other with \"A Fistful of Dollars\", but it started with \"Yojimbo.\" The only difference is, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" is set in 18th century America, \"Yojimbo\" is post-civil war Japan and the squinting protagonist is a samurai, not a gunfighter. So here we have a ronin (Toshiro Mifune) who wanders into a negligent town that is run by two gangs constantly at war with each other. Seeing a window for opportunity, the samurai who never gives his true name, starts to swap loyalty between the two sides and play them against each other to save the town\u0085and put some weight in his pockets.This is a classic samurai tale and one of Akira Kurosawa's best. Clint Eastwood may have immortalized the idea of a man without a name, but Toshiro Mifune as the samurai depicts a textbook example of the character. Mifune is playing the exact opposite of the goofy, deliberately comical character he played in \"Seven Samurai\" and gives a performance that is regularly regarded as one of the best of all time by any actor. In addition, Kurosawa's film is also a milestone for the influence it had not on other Japanese films, but in the Americas and in the Western genre. Many elements that we find commonplace in the Western idiom started here.And the ultimate reason why \"Yojimbo\" works and why it is so influential and popular is because it is two hours of sheer excitement. Kurosawa may have ended his career depicting violence as horrible and gut-wrenching in films such as \"Kagemusha\" (1980) and more notable, \"Ran\" (1985), but here he showed it as being wild and not so harrowing. To some people's dismay, this film may be the one that started the chain of movies that glorified violence, but Kurosawa does it with restraint so that an impression of killing and being killed being scary does make its point toward the end, but only after the nameless ronin has sliced up several people with his katana.\"Yojimbo\" is a very well-made action picture that rests somewhere between the extremes of being lighthearted and being dark and poignant. It is a shame that it does not receive so much praise in the West, because after all, half the action pictures of today and a significant number of the Western movies do borrow or homage it in some way.Rating: 4/4",

            "content": "The beginning of this tale, when our hero tosses a stick into the air to see which way it lands to choose his path, is just one of the many elements which makes this such an amazing story and one my favorites of Kurosawa's many masterpieces. What the bodyguard chooses to do first with his newfound independence is quite surprising and ambitious, like piecing together an amazingly complex jigsaw puzzle made of human nature, or staging a performance of an epic masterpiece with no previous management, production, or directing skills. But I guess he may as well tackle a mountain, since there is not much use starting small with his skills and personality. As he orchestrates the deception, our hero is much like a master puppeteer with exquisite timing and talent to incite the mayhem to achieve his goal. While the basic theme of this story is not unique - the result of greed, manipulation of others, and the changing of the world (tradition vs. progression) - many factors add an interesting and unusual charm to this film. There are plots within plots, surprising deception, perfectly paced mounting tension, unpredictable plot twists, stories within stories, distinctive and amusing characters (the big guy with his huge mallet is a lot of fun), the seemingly never-ending face offs, backstabbing, character flaws; and our hero continually placed in the perfect position to observe, listen, and evaluate. Also, the bodyguard's impeccable timing in manipulation of both sides is nice, fulfilling our expectations and keeping the story moving along. What if bodyguards were really like this? (mischievous, brilliant, manipulative) The famous people of the world would be in terrible trouble.The humor in this story is wonderful, even the macabre humor of the dog carrying the human hand in its mouth while trotting along to fairly spunky music. I also love the funnier fight sequences, which seem to come right out of clown school and resemble football skirmishes instead of battles. In several of the scenes, it appears that the swordsmen are miming roasting marshmallows instead of fighting with their weapons. Nice addition of lightness to a serious tale. Our hero sticking around after he has discontinued his services purely for \"the entertainment\" also accentuates the humor aspect of this movie.The mix of character types is also interesting including a dominatrix, a prodigal son, a damsel in distress, several amusing drunks, and many bumbling idiots. The ease in which our hero is able to manipulate these human beings is extremely unbelievable; however, many aspects of this film fall into that category and it is still a wonderful story. This is one of those rare instances in which certain trite, far-fetched, and predictable elements are actually good and serve to enhance the story. The nature symbolism is a nice addition to this film including the cleansing rain allowing us to shift gears from Act I to Act II, and the dust storm, which precedes the more unpredictable part of the story serving to unsettle and disorient us.Finally, the shadowy, light dancing, night fires scene is amazing, intensifying the town's debauchery and our hero finally stepping up to get involved in the action before ultimately getting caught in his own web. This scene is perfect, like an expertly lighted stage drawing us into Act III.",

            "review_title": "This Town Ain't Big Enough",
            "content": "You've just sat down to watch a film by Akira Kurosawa. Make sure you're not squeamish by the sight of decapitated limbs and swords smashing into samurais. Kurosawa is the original master of the violent Japanese samurai flick. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino gets down on his knees and prays to him by his bedside at night. This genre of film that he created is based upon the period of \"Jidaigeki\", which has its origins in Kabuki theater. It's the music of the swords. It's the story of brave samurais fighting in honor of their families and towns. It might sound foreign to you, but it's really not. \"Jidaigeki\" genre movies supplied many concepts and ideas that inspired what we all know as the Spaghetti Western. Well, you should know, it was a little too inspired, but that's a story to get into another day. Kurosawa's films have an amazing shelf life to cinephiles across the globe, and none more important than \"Rashoman\". But I have just watched, what I feel to be the best example of Kurosawa's influence on the western genre, and what I feel to be an especially compelling and entertaining piece of work, \"Yujimbo\". \"Yojimbo\" has a story, not that complicated, and told so many times, you'd think you've sat down to watch some clich\u00e9d schlock. As I've stated before, it's about the lone hero, or in this case, the lone samurai, who somewhere along his travels comes upon a village that has been split between two rival gangs. In the town are the struggling families and business owners that are victimized day in and day out by the constant robberies and assaults from the gangs, as well the insufferable and corrupt police officer that gleefully capitulates to the two rival gangs. They ravage throughout the town, and out of sympathy for the townspeople, or perhaps just for the hell of it, the lone samurai decides to pit the two against each other in order for them to fight to death. It is out of his virtue to save the town from the hands of crime, and he's well aware of it very early on in the film, as he notices a dog carrying a severed human hand around the town. This is the Wild West, or shall we say, the wild east. In this little town, the lone samurai helps cause chaos and showdowns abound as the rival gangs fight for territory. It's almost comedic how much manipulation he has over them. I loved how it didn't always work out. For instance, the lone samurai is seen overhearing a conversation of the hotel owners planning to kill him in order to not pay for his stay. It seems like he's been causing a lot of trouble, much to the chagrin of the town's people. I really enjoyed the balance between action, story and humor. Unlike \"Rashoman\" that captivates with a rigid, dramatic story with a lot of unsightly, gruesome characters trying to eat each other alive, this is a fun little western. It's a classic in the genre as it gets. The lone samurai even bears a strange resemblance his American counterpart, Clint Eastwood, complete with his squinty eyes and scowl. The man in question is Toshiro Mifune, and he has a spectacular track record with Akira Kurosawa. Every time he collaborates with him, you're going to get an unbelievable performance. In \"Rashoman\" he was the insane, giggling bandit, and here, he's the silent, master of the sword, who could cut your arm off with a single blow. He's the original badass movie star. Even when he goes down, he goes down hard. When the lone samurai gets captured towards the end of the film, he is seen slowly and painfully making his mistake. This probably was my favorite scene, for it demonstrates Mifune's range as an actor, and his willingness to discomfort himself for the benefit of the story. The picture also has a really unique soundtrack. I overheard someone in the audience chuckling about it, for it sounded a little similar to \"Big Band\". The music fits the attitude of the picture splendidly. It's a big, loud soundtrack to a big story. The cinematography was also very ambitious for it's time, and Kurosawa's main cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, noticeably builds upon his great talent of the image since Rashoman. The battle sequences are sweeping and detailed with all the blood and guts intact. The spectacular scene in which the lone samurai is escaping is staged and shot beautifully. Miyagawa holds an exceptional gift of bringing the Edo Japanese era vibrantly to life. \"Yojimbo\" is a violent epic, and one of Kurosawa's most startlingly good achievements. It's entertaining, thrilling and a credit to the history of Japanese cinema.",

            "content": "I am truly satisfied with this Kurosawa's masterpiece.I saw Magnificent seven week early on, and I have to say I found this eastern much more appealing. I mean Magnificent seven is quite the film as well, but this film's story was just more eye-catching and simply worked for me better.Another thing I really liked were swipe transitions between the shots. In comparison to dissolve transitions in western, we can actually see how can such a detail change the whole dynamics of the movie. Firstly I mistakenly named it as a wipe transitions, but there's slight the difference between the two. Although I was lost in context sometimes during the film, thanks to threads between the actions I jumped back into a wave of amazing fabula and sujet.I also liked a lot the game of light and shadow. Kurosawa certainly knew how to utilize black'n'white kind of a movie. As our main protagonist abuses the villagers for money and sics both sides against the other, he constantly stays in shadow, but as soon as he learns his lesson he comes to light. So it has also noir-genre elements.What I found interesting was the idea of Samurai sword being better choice than gun. Therefore we could also see interesting promotion of Japanese culture, not just through mentioned idea, but also through aspects such as clothing, food, currency, calendar elements and so on, that had appeared in the movie.I also know about the reality that Sergio Leone's film A fistful of dollars starring Clint Eastwood, was massively inspired by this movie, so we can surely say they liked a lot the motive of the film in America as well. (something like in case of Seven samurai and Magnificent seven)As we can tell, this film is one of a kind. It had massive impact at the time, but still has as it lives on. This film is spot on. So indulge in some real movie magic. I highly recommend.",

Much like Scorsese and de Niro years later, Kurosawa teams up again with Toshiro Mifune to give us Sanjuro, a cynical ronin who has no qualms about using other people for his own selfish goals.The movie begins with Sanjuro wandering the countryside without purpose. By chance, he walks into a town being torn apart because of two warring criminal clans trying to wipe each other out. Demonstrating his skill at swordmansship, both attempt to hire Sanjuro in their war. But, Sanjuro has his own plans...Mifune's performance is a complete 180 in relation to his role in Seven Samurai. No longer the bumbling buffoon, Mifune displays a cunning and cold-hearted nature which goes a long ways to getting what he wants. The anti-hero portrayal will influence movie characters like Eastwood's The Man with No Name, Han Solo and Snake Plissken for years to come. Hearing the main musical theme and watching the opening shot where the camera follows him from behind makes one realize he is not a man to be trifled with.Yojimbo is a great start to get familiar with Kurosawa.

            "content": "Yojimbo is a classic film from the genius mind of Akira Kurosawa. It was influenced by many of the American spaghetti western films coming out in this time period, and was the influence of A Fistful of Dollars (1964), one of Clint Eastwood's breakout roles. Yojimbo tells the story of a wise and mysterious samurai named Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) who arrives in a small village in the wake of destruction because of two rival gangs. Sanjuro decides that to save the innocent commoners of the village, he will play the gangs against each other to the point of demise. His plan comes with ups and downs and an exciting story unravels with gripping action and compelling characters.Akira Kurosawa was a genius at what he did, and this shows through the level of delicate intricacy woven into the plot and visual aesthetic of Yojimbo. Every shot is flawless. He was a master of long drawn out shots that allow the actors to act and the story to unfold more like a stage play than a film. Yojimbo is a beautiful film in it's own slow and delicate way. What Kurosawa is able to achieve with such limited technology, and upon such a simple backdrop is truly phenomenal. The entirety of the film is a visual joy to watch.Kurosawa was also a master of compelling storytelling. Yojimbo plays out as a fun and exciting adventure story about a likable samurai with all the essential hero qualities, as well as the qualities of the unconventional hero. Sanjuro is very wise and quick on his feet, he is an impressive character to watch and Toshir\u00f4 Mifune's performance keeps you constantly interested in what the character has to say or do. Yojimbo may not seem like it is a groundbreaking film the does the unthinkable and pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling, yet it was for its time. Just like most of Kurosawa's films, the story sets the stage for many films to come in the future. It is these future films that push the limits of what Kurosawa and other older filmmakers established. They have to, or else they are forgotten in the sea of films with such a similar storyline.Yojimbo is stunning and exciting in every way. It is a classic film on a grand and epic scale. It's archetypes and processes of storytelling have lasted for generations and most likely will last for many more to come. In the back catalog of movies that began a new era of filmmaking and storytelling, Yojimbo is a fantastic example.",

Toshiro Mifune stars in one of his strongest performances as Sanjuro a lone wolf samurai who comes into a small town in Japan in the mid 19th century to rid the town of two rival gangs by pitting them against each other and fighting them on his own, and thus inspired several westerns to follow mainly Sergio Leone's \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964). Akira Kurosawa was to Japanese samurai films what John Ford was to American westerns, and each of them were masters whose movies are still talked about among film lovers everywhere and for good reason and this movie is another masterpiece in the Kurosawa-Mifune collaboration which is one of the all time great actor-director partnerships in all of movie history. The swordfight scenes are excellently choreographed, and what really helps with the movie is how Kurosawa places the music to build the suspense leading up to the final fight in the end which reminds me of the final shootout in \"High Noon\" when Gary Cooper's Marshall Will Kane had to face off against a gang of outlaws on his own. Mifune was one of those actors in Japan who had as big of a screen presence as John Wayne did in America. Everything about this movie just strikes the right notes especially with the intelligent writing, great performances, Kurosawa's masterful direction, excellent cinematography, and an amazing score.

Two rival factions, each owning factories of some description, have hired mercenaries and criminals and are busy attempting to wipe each other out whilst the ordinary villagers are caught in the middle. The Ronin finds this amusing and starts to play both sides against the middle, first demonstrating his skill by killing a number of mercenaries (Cooper...three coffins *pause* *look* maybe four.....) and accepting one rival's bid and then leaving and accepting the other, leaving also a trail of uncertainty and worry in his wake. The Ronin is unshaven, unwashed and very, very skillful - a shark among minnows. He is also sardonic, sarcastic and gives the appearance of caring nothing. But from time to time, a glimmer of honour and belief shines, albeit briefly before being covered up once more. I won't go into more specific detail about this film lest I ruin it for those that have yet to see it. The director is Akira Kurasawa, the main actor Toshiiro Mifune, two of the best reasons for seeing this film. It was subsequently remade by Morricone as \"a fistful of dollars\". His initial claim that he was remaking Fellini's \"a servant of two masters\" held water for precisely two seconds. It has more recently been remade as \"last man standing\" - both films shallow copies of the original. See it - tape it - buy it.Dan",

It was a very nice watch in terms of both plot and style, and of course spectacular direction by Kurosawa and acting by Mifune. I also enjoyed the way this movie really seemed like a Western, as this movie was both influenced by past Westerns and influenced future Westerns. Very nice flow to the film.

            "content": "In the world, there are people who should not comment on anything. Especially those who call things 'boring', or 'a bore', or 'long and drawn out, couldn't stay awake... put it off after ten minutes (this is the @#$@# most stupid comment of them all'...) these people should avoid all commentary, because such comments do not make for a valid statement, are very far from any critical process, and should be thrown out to the street and stepped on, like the own egos who created them. Who could ever find such opinions useful? But of course, this world is far from ideal, far from intelligent, full of idiocy, 'there is no hope for fools' as Mifune once acted. It is true, people are fools. We all are most of the times, but most are always. Thus, we get fools commenting, usually at their most foolish point, writing their own minute visions of 'art' haphazardly, (it's a wonder how they can be so reckless with such simplistic concepts roaming their heads) repeating words like 'junk', and 'waste of my time'... exactly, life is a waste of their time. That's for sure. 'So... you don't mind if I kill you now?' (As Mifune once acted). This movie is a wonderful, universal film. Not at all perfect... (which encumbers a whole nother set of nauseating remarks such as 'perfect film... flawless...unbeatable plot...'). But who wants perfect!? Universal is key and most important here, forget all those people who mistook Kurosawa in Japan... Japan is like all societies, full of idiots, full of close-minded people looking for an ideal, trying to be their own geniuses. Don't need none of that. Done need 'isolationism', 'nationalism', 'my word is right' 'the dogma' 'follow the tradition to the bone or you are a traitor'... And by saying all this, I am basically trying to show what this movie is about. The weakness of all opinion, the fall of all sides without perspective. Only the genius, he who is capable of abstraction, who can analyze behind all notions of bad and good, will withstand time, will survive. None of the rest matters. All of the rest destroys itself, annihilates itself, and could is better off dead... the sooner the better, in fact. Whoever thinks that Kurosawa wrote about the honor of the samurai as a historical institution, is missing the fact that many of his films play on the samurai who to survive must deviate from all known feeling of honor, especially in a film like this, whose premise and character, Sanjuro, represents the 'decadence' of the samurai tradition... A most important aspect - perhaps the only underlying aspect - of the film, stated even before the first dialog appears. This is not a movie about good and evil, about honor and shame... universality goes far beyond this. He who sees the big picture has the gift of immortality, of being universal. This is a movie that, in a very humble, concise and attractive way, exemplifies such artistic ideals, giving an unrealistic power to a man who is more than man. The most beautiful and harrowing aspect of Sanjuro for the townspeople, is that he is his own bodyguard. He is endowed with this poetic perfection, which nobody else has... he almost doesn't exist for them (he is absent during all revenges), because this is unfathomable to everyone in the town. He is God. He is just, brings justice, above all notions of justice. This movie defeats all people who find it boring, and all who could possibly revere it to death, me included. It exists alone. It is it's own nomad. It walks behind us all. Behind anything we could muster up saying about it to describe it. I'm also a fool for writing this comment. The only thing not foolish is watching the film, arriving at that town the way Kurosawa intended us to, without any previous knowledge or prejudice, where there is no good or evil, just people doing what they usually do, think they and only they are right, where things aren't anything that they seem, but at the same time, are only what they appear to be... ruins. To be able to do this, to see it in this way as a viewer, is already a feat. Don't get bored just yet, don't cry out it's genius. Try to be a viewer, make that effort. It's an ideal, I know... it may be forever impossible. But I guess it could also make for a better person in you.",

            "review_title": "Ronin puts things in order or the everyday life of a Japanese village",
            "content": "Adventure. A picture of the famous, iconic and outstanding Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, whom I finally got my hands on. This path was long and thorny, especially the choice of his paintings, but after much deliberation, I chose three pictures, and in the near future there will be reviews on them, and this adventure movie comes first, which became the cause of many inspirations and even a scandal between the masters of that time - Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone, but you know this story without me, so I see no reason to retell it here, because it will be a purely painting. And here's my brief opinion - Ronin is putting things in order. I want to state right away that I did not notice the minuses in the film, although there is a small remark, which I will say separately, but for now, let me focus your attention on the advantages of this adventure from the master of Japanese cinema.\nSo, here they are:\n1. Scenario - the picture tells about the adventures of a wandering ronin, who ends up in a small village, whose inhabitants languish from endless bloodshed, for two strong criminals share power over it. Ronin decides to play on this and it becomes the beginning of a series of events, both fun and not so, fights and the like. The scenario skeleton from this picture was played many times in world cinema, both before this work of Kurosawa (which he himself admitted to) and after (the story with Sergio Leone and beyond), and this is not bad. Akira himself was in charge of the script, and he did a great job with it. I literally could not take my eyes off the screen, because every detail, every movement of the characters and so on, every spoken word clung to me. The ending was known to me, because I watched \"For a Fistful of Dollars\", and it is not only correct, but also effectively filmed. If you love Japanese themes, a good script - then you simply must see this picture!\n2. Atmosphere - Japan of the shogunate era, with its familiar attributes - houses, samurai, clothes, characteristic hairstyles, everyday life, and so on. The atmosphere literally captures the viewer from the first frame, and does not let go until the last, and the black and white picture does not interfere with this in any way (especially since black and white cinema saves vision). And lovers of historical cinema will get their portion of pleasure.\n3. Humor - I was even surprised at this. He is unassuming here, because almost everything boils down to the stupid behavior of the characters or antics on camera, which turns serious and dramatic scenes into a natural farce, and you feel ashamed of the heroes who do it. Some of the jokes were successful, and I had a lot of fun with them. I could put humor in the minus of the picture until I understood the director's move - Akira deliberately made the heroes like that, therefore - no complaints.\n4. Fights - today they look like a fight between drunken Tolkienists, to be frank, because they are absolutely no spectacle. I give credit to the directors and actors who moved in the frame very convincingly and played very naturally. I give a discount for the release time, because this is one thousand nine hundred and sixty-first, ladies and gentlemen and comrades!\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Ronin performed by Toshiro Mifune is a wandering warrior who, by the will of fate, arrived in the village, where it is urgently necessary to restore order. A cunning fellow and a professional fighter who turns a clever plan. Absolutely not a superhero, but a man with his own mistakes. Laconic and with a pinch of humor - this is how Toshiro's hero turned out, and I liked him. Bravo Toshiro!\n2. Daisuke Kato's Inokichi is the brother of one of the village's crime bosses. Cheerful and memorable hero, although it plays a negative role. His antics were very amusing throughout the whole picture. Daisuke clearly coped with the role. Well done!\n3. Gonji performed by Eijiro Tohno - owner of the tavern where the ronin is staying. At first, he hates this stranger, but gradually he is imbued with sympathy, and even becomes a friend, since only the ronin is able to end the bloody chaos in the village. Eijiro superbly played the role of a gloomy and eccentric old man. Bravo!\nAs for the remark, there is one object in the picture that spoils the atmosphere and asks Akira uncomfortable questions, but I will not dwell on this. It's just that this object is in sight and flickers before your eyes all the time. Either this is Akira's jamb, or the creators' flaw, I don't know here.\nWell, the next picture of Kurosawa will be the legendary \"Seven Samurai\".\nAs a result, we have an excellent adventure movie by Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent script, great atmosphere, pleasant and unexpected humor and great acting.",

By chance I saw the two back to back (first the western, then the original), not knowing that one was a remake of the other, and I have to say: The original is better.The lighting, scenery and camera-work is very nice - right from the opening shot. Some scenes will be immediately recognizable by all movie aficionados - especially the 'Mos Eisley cantina scene' (I almost fell out of my chair, laughing). The movie emphasizes much more the characters and the plots/intrigues going on. It's all about whose plan will be successful in the end. Kurosawa even forgoes some action sequences like a big sword fight with two huge rivaling gangs, just showing the aftermath of a street strewn with bodies. If he'd wanted he could have easily turned this into an action packed blood-fest a la 'Kill Bill' right there, but he didn't - and I have to give him high praise for this. Not that 'Kill Bill' is a bad movie (quite the opposite). Just that such slaughter would not have fit the overall flow of Kurosawas work. When he shows action there is a point to it. It is to demonstrate how superior his hero is at sword fighting or how underhanded the bad guys are - not to show gory scenes of senseless violence for the pure spectacle of it (as \"For a Fistfull of Dollars\" would do 3 years later)This is one of his greatest films, and I can see why it has earned such high praise.

He approaches one of the two factions vying for control of the town and, when they brag about how dangerous they are, he asks, \"So you won't mind if I kill all of you?\" \"WHAT?\" one of the startled bandits cries: \"Kill me if you can!\" \"It'll hurt,\" Mifune advises him.

To do show he uses his wits and great sword skills to create chaos. In general Kurosawa here shows us the samurai as bullies and a-holes who are in charge only because are better armed. As for our protagonist though he is the good guy he uses quit the unhonourable tactics to achieve his goal to free the village from its tyrants, which wasn't the norm for the samurai ,who there whole ideology ,the Bushido, was focused in honor and service, but as the era of the Samurai is over so to for that code and our ronin gives zero f***s about honor and he has a much more practical approach of the type \"the ends justify the means\".Also the setting was nicely made and you will find yet an other inspiration of an other film ,from a Galaxy Far Far Away ,but you have to look closely to find it.Over all I enjoy it and I respect its impact in film culture even though it was done through plagiarism.",

Ironically, Yojimbo is said to be Kurosawa's tribute to the Western genre. The film is pure Kurosawa - spectacular action, artistry, and dark humor combined. Apart from The Hidden Fortress, and Seven Samurai, this is one of the most entertaining of Kurosawa's films.Toshiro Mifune, the leading man in almost a dozen Kurosawa films, gives a vivid performance as an unemployed samurai who decides to act as a 'law enforcer' in a town under siege by gangs. Yojimbo starts memorably with a dog scampering across the street with a dislocated human hand between its teeth, a jolting sequence that prepares viewers for the onslaught of violence seen later in the film. Filmed in beautiful black-and-white, Yojimbo outstandingly recaptures a bygone era - nostalgic Japanese setting with western stylistic hues.There some parts (especially in the middle) that drags for quite long, which if edited cleverly would have made Yojimbo feel tighter, and consequently, more engrossing. But this minor flaw is eclipsed by Kurosawa's astute direction and his revered ability with the camera (which is always moving, and covering different angles). Yojimbo is an example of timeless Japanese cinema, something that will continue to entertain generations after generations. It's not Kurosawa's best effort, but there's no denying the fact that it's a visual delight.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

The music is also delightful.Want proof this film is great, Sergio Leone, a genius in his own right, made an almost shot for shot remake of it he enjoyed it so much! If like me you are trying to broaden your film knowledge then exploring the films of Kurosawa is an excellent place to start, he also wrote a very interesting book but that is beside the point.A master at work, partnered with the brilliant Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, of course this film was going to be good.

Chanbara (swordfight film) and Yakuza Eiga was the big deal in the 60's in Japan and this movie have all the elements. Kurosawa hate the Yakzua, it's the reason why he never made a Yakuza Eiga (to be a little bit harsh, i will say that's why critics know nothing about Yakzua Eiga, because Kurosawa never made this kind of genre altough it was one of the most popular genre in Japan). A lot of Jidai-geki with yakuza was made til 1910. But in this movie, they are ridicule and kill by Mifune.Like i said before, i dont think it's the better Kurosawa (i prefer High And Low or Rashomon) but it was funny. But i prefer Sanjuro, the sequel.The fact this movie have all this influence (people who disagree are blind) it's because it's one of the only chanbara we saw in occident. Chanbara was a genre very popular in japan, a very cool genre. But it's was one of the only of this kind. 7 Samurai or Rashomon was not chanbara, just jidai-geki.What my point? I think if another chanbara was show to us at this time, the people was enjoy it too. And maybe more. because in term of fun and quality, a lot of chanbara can be name. The Zatoichi serie or Nemury Kyoshiro (The first 3 films was a little bit boring for many people, but watch til the 4 episode.. it was very disturbing) or some Okamoto movies like Samurai Assassin with Mifune. And many directore like Kenji Misumi made a good technic work. and if you want deep drama and chanbara, i suggest Harakiri by Kobayashi.Yojimbo it's a fair movie to me, but not the greatest masterpiece of all time... It's my opinion.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is probably the most famous Japanese director of all time. Even a person that doesn't study cinema, she probably have watched a Kurosawa flick or at least heard of him. But this doesn't happen just for any reason. In his career, there are all-time classics, such as 'Ran', 'Dreams', 'Rashomon', 'Kagemusha' and many others. Most of his movies, specially his early ones, such as 1957's 'Seven Samurai', introduced many concepts that are used in Hollywood nowadays, specially in action movies. Another picture quite important for Kurosawa's career and the movie industry in general is 'Yojimbo', from 1961. This movie is widely considered as one of Kurosawa's best pictures. If not his best.'Yojimbo's story is set in the late-19th century. It tells the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), a samurai without a master, that drifts without any specific destination. He arrives in a small village, dominated by two lords: Seibei (Seizabur\u00f4 Kawazu), who produces silk, and Ushitora (Ky\u00fb Sazanka), who produces sake. Those two lords are always fighting each other, but they are both and his men to coward to make one real fight, so they just threat each other. Upon his arrival, the samurai realizes this, so he offer the services of bodyguard to both of them (thus the title, Yojimbo, which means bodyguard in Japanese). But all Sanjuro really wants is to make the fight come to an end and finally bring peace to the small town. The movie's screenplay was wrote by Kurosawa himself, with the help of Ry\u00fbz\u00f4 Kikushima. It is loosely based on several stories, such as the novel 'Red harvest'. 'Yojimbo's plot may seem somewhat familiar, and that's because this story was revisited by many other directors over the years. But the screenplay is just the one problem I have with 'Yojimbo'. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and the story, just though it could be better developed, specially on the character's department. It would be nice to know some of the background story of how the town reached that situation. This would help to explain the actions of some characters, that seem somewhat shallow. But the screenplay also manages to deal with excellent subjects in a subtle way, such as the generation conflicts, innocence, cowardly, etc. Another thing that worked very well is that you really don't know what happened to Sanjuro before the events depicted on the movie. The picture already starts with him wandering in a deserted road. This happens to increase the mysteries around his character, which are never really explained. In a nutshell, a very well-written screenplay.Guess who's the leading actor in 'Yojimbo'? If you guessed Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, then you are absolutely right. After all, it would be the obvious answer, because Mifune made nothing less than sixteen movies along with Akira Kurosawa. and this movie marks the twelfth collaboration between the two. And one of the best, not only because of the movie itself, which is great, but specially for Mifune's work. He had already delivered excellent performances in other Kurosawa's pictures, such as 'Seven Samurai' or 'Rashomon', but his job in 'Yojimbo' really stands out. Mifune was perfect in his role as Sanjuro. He understood the part do well that you actually believes he is the samurai. And in the scene where he is drunk is like an interpretation class for new actors. Amazing. The rest of the cast was nice also. Of course no one reached Mifune's greatness, but there wasn't one bad actor in the main or in the supporting cast.Normally in my reviews here on IMDb, this is the paragraph where I say what I tough about the direction of the movie. But there isn't much to comment on Kurosawa's directing job in 'Yojimbo'. That's because it's Kurosawa, what can I say? Everyone knows that Kurosawa is a master, the best of the best, the guy who created all the concepts we use in action movies, so I'm gonna restrict to saying this: as always, Kurosawa makes a perfect job. His direction was so great that only three years after the release of 'Yojimbo', in 1964, one of the best Italian directors of all time, Sergio Leone, made a shot-by-shot remake of the movie. But Leone's picture was set in the American Wild West, and was starred by no one less then Clint Eastwood. Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars' is a movie as good as 'Yojimbo', and all thanks to Kurosawa. Another thing that I though it was great in 'Yojimbo' is the Soundtrack. A brilliant work by Masaru Sat\u00f4. Aside from the Soundtrack, other aspect in 'Yojimbo' that really stands out is the cinematography. A beautiful work in black-and- white tones by Kazuo Miyagawa. Overral, 'Yojimbo' is one of those movies that come close to perfection. The only complain I have with it is the script, that could have been better developed in the characters' department. But this doesn't remove the glow of the movie, that has a perfect direction and an excellent acting, specially by Toshiro Mifune, in his twelfth collaboration with Akira Kurosawa, that made Yojimbo one of his best pictures. If not the best.10/10",

It's no \"Rashomon\" and I think a little too much has been made of some of the individual performances, which are workmanlike at best--particularly Toshiro Mifune's as the title character. Essentially Dashiell Hammett's \"Red Harvest\" set in nineteenth-century Japan (with elements of two other Hammett novels, \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"The Glass Key,\" thrown in for good measure), \"Yojimbo\" functions as a whole rather than as a series of parts. Even Tatsuya Nakadai's celebrated turn as the pistol-toting punk is something that really only works in the context of the movie; I wouldn't point to it as one of the most brilliant cinematic performances of all time. (Nakadai's finest moment under Kurosawa's direction was in \"Kagemusha.\")I don't mean to say that \"Yojimbo\" isn't interesting or entertaining. There are some things I really like about it: Masaru Sato's perversely jaunty score, the uneasy atmosphere of physical and moral decay (accentuated by the stark late autumn setting), Mifune's world-weary ronin being profoundly embarrassed by his own decision to do a good deed. But this is a very, VERY talky film; Kurosawa could have shaved a good half-hour off the dialogue without any loss of effect or coherence. All the physical action--every sword slice, severed arm and spurt of blood--adds up to perhaps sixty seconds, which is odd for a movie based on the rip-roaringly violent \"Red Harvest.\" It's a good film, but it could have been a great one.",

For example, although Marlow is very humorous, he is often slightly bitter. It can be seen in the inner depression.In contrast, the samurai in Kurosawa 's film are more optimistic and open-minded, like Tsubakiro 's tongue spit out when he hears the conspiracy of the boss lady, or he still does n't forget his idea to guilty of hail when he dies Heroic.

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film YOJIMBO is a Japanese period drama where wily strategy is worth just as much as prowess with a sword. In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune). Once they get a taste of his swordsmanship, both sides want to hire him, but he decides to play them off against each other and free the innocent citizens from this evil.In past films Kurosawa had taken advantage of Mifune's ability to produce exaggerated facial expressions of laughter and fear. Here, however, the nameless samurai is completely unflappable, while it is the criminal bosses and corrupt officials who play the clowns. Ikio Sawamura is a town constable constantly toadying to the gangsters, for example, while Isuzu Yamada gives a memorably sassy performance as the madame of a brothel. In what would become a convention of the Japanese period drama, the numerous henchmen in the gangs were apparently chosen from the most grotesque men that Kurosawa could find (each furthermore has distinctively ratty attire), and one thug is played by an actor suffering from gigantism.That darkly comedic drama between the characters coexists with brutal violence. Yet, while audiences may have been shocked in 1961 by the samurai dispatching his opponents with realistic slashing sound effects and a hacked off limb, there are only a handful of fights here, and they are all over in a flash. (Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Mifune's acting is his speed in executing the sword moves.) While Kurosawa delights in gangsters getting their comeuppance, he doesn't revel in gore.Much has been said about how this Japanese film would inspire Westerns made in America and Europe (Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was a straight-up remake). However, the film is also interesting for how it draws so much on influences from the West. Kurosawa's inspiration was an American crime caper by Dashiell Hammett, the samurai's walk down the main street is drawn from the Westerns of John Ford et al., the soundtrack mixes Japanese music with Western instruments such as harpsichord, and Tatsuya Nakadai's pretty-boy looks are clearly modeled on Hollywood.All in all, I was very impressed by this film. Everything here \u2013 from the script and aspect to little things like the wind and dust and the little decorations on the set \u2013 seems the result of great effort and talent, all coming together to impress the viewer. And like Kurosawa's RASHOMON, it stays fresh even as its elements have been repeatedly reused by other film and television productions for half a century now.Note that Kurosawa would go on to use Mifune's character again the next year in the film SANJURO, and the two films are often considered together.",

            "content": "By the time Kurosawa decided to embark upon YOJIMBO (in 1960/1), he had already established himself as a legendary filmmaker in the West and decided to pay homage to one of the West's more notoriously famous film genres: The Western. While this film is actually regarded as homage to the Western, the careful observer will see that the film also sporadically pokes fun at the genre; another example of Kurosawa'a brilliance.The film itself is wonderfully done; it represents Kurosawa in his element: storytelling, and there is no shortage of plot twists here for the avid viewer to enjoy. The direction and screenplay are excellent, as is the acting, as Toshiro Mifune (think of him as such: De Niro is to Scorsese as Mifune is to Kurosawa) produces perhaps his finest role on film, perhaps because he is the central character and not part of an ensemble. Mifune's character is the personification of cool; the anti-heroic mercenary who never seems to be fazed. His portrayal in this Motion Picture even ranks among (and some may argue higher) Clint Eastwood's best. Tatsuya Nakadai is also impressive as Mifune's most significant 'villain'.The music itself is also amazing, perhaps the best in any Kurosawa film, especially the mood-setting opening piece. Notably though, Ennio Morricone's score for the remake PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI was a bit better. The final verdict here is that there is plenty to enjoy and appreciate in this masterpiece by the master storyteller.It is also worth noting that this film, while an homage to Westerns, was the inspiration behind Sergio Leone's PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI, which helped sparked the spaghetti Western revolution. As such, it is difficult to imagine what the Western would be like today were it not for YOJIMBO. On a side note, this film also served as a reference for LAST MAN STANDING, but the less said about that film, the better...So here comes the inevitable question: Where does YOJIMBO stand in Kurosawa's collection? While not as grand or epic in scope as SHICHININ NO SAMURAI, or as intellectually stimulating or thought-provoking as RASHOMON, it is easy to see why many viewers will regard YOJIMBO as Kurosawa's best, due to its wider appeal (for instance, it is not nearly as long as SHICHININ NO SAMURAI, not as puzzling as RASHOMON, plus it has a strong comedic element to it). I personally rank it as Kurosawa'a third best, behind the aforementioned.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should enter my Top 150 at about 138 or so. Strongly recommended.",

            "content": "A friend of mine had been hyping up this movie to me for several months, so I finally sat down to watch it tonight.  Overall, I'd have to say that it lived up to its reputation.  Even though I wasn't really in the mood for it at the start, it drew me in and kept me glued to the TV screen for two full hours.I think enough people have already commented on the plot of the movie (and how cool they think Toshiro Mifune is), so I won't waste your time with more such drivel here...Instead, what interested me most about this movie tonight was how many elements of it I'd already seen before.  For instance, close to the beginning of the film, Mifune's character kills a couple of henchmen and then lops off the arm of another--and then you see the poor guy's dismembered arm, lying on the ground, still holding on to his katana. It's impossible to watch this shot and not immediately think of the bloody arm that Obi-Wan has dismembered in the cantina scene in the first Star Wars movie.Elements of Star Wars are all over this film, in fact: from the moment Mifune pops out a couple of floorboards to leave his hiding place (think of Han and Luke on the Millennium Falcon) to the sweeping, horizontal wipe transitions you see between each scene.  Like Obi-Wan, Mifune's \"Man with No Name\" is a wandering, mystic warrior--one of the last of his kind.  And the mercenary element of a character like Han Solo is lived out large here, too, by Mifune's character.But that's just it.  As someone has already pointed out here, this movie began the 1960s/1970s \"deconstruction of the Western\"--the good/bad distinction disappears, and there's just Mifune's Yojimbo to play two despicable rich men (and their cronies) off of each other.  When Mifune actually does something decent for another human being in the film, it comes as kind of a shock.  But at the end of the movie--when he comes back to fight the \"bad\" guys--he's not fighting them for any noble purpose, or to help out the poor, old townspeople.  He just wants payback.This is the kind of nihilistic, beyond-good-and-evil stuff that we've seen so often (and loved so much) in action films ever since.  It's not about the triumph of principle over chaos--it's about the triumph of the individual over the masses.  We've seen this thing so many times by now that I think it's difficult for us to appreciate in a film that's seen so many years go by (and been copied as often) as Yojimbo.  In fact, those who are looking for lots of melodramatic action sequences and overly drawn out fight scenes will probably be disappointed by this \"action\" movie--its violence is too curt to be really satisfying.What strikes me now, though, is that one of the reasons movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones and everything else that came out of the Lucas/Spielberg era were so successful is because they injected the old good vs. evil theme back into the Western-style movie.  They just had to transfer their settings to places far away from the American West.  It's like--after Kurosawa and Leone and Eastwood and Don Siegel had had their say--we had to go somewhere else besides the Old West to get what we were really looking for.There's no such triumph of good over evil here.  Just one badass dude making the best of a bad situation.  Check it out if that's the sort of thing you want to see.",

            "content": "'Yo, Jimbo! Get back here with my arm!' Yes, this is the famous story set in the Chinese version of Hick America. Based on some Shakespeare book it is also black and white and in a strange language. I want to go to the movies and see stuff blow up, and watch people get shot in FULL COLOURS. I mean, how realistic can black and white be. I understand that people were poor in the olden days, well then they should have just waited until they invented colour before making films because these are just too unbelievable. I find it difficult to relate to people when they are speaking funny words I don't be understanding, and especially when they're a different colour. I don't mean that in a racistphobe way, I just can't take anything seriously when it comes from a grey mouth. But, alas I was forced to watch this my girlfriend as she said it was Clint Eastwood's favourite film so it might be okay.The film is set in some sort of shanty town where dogs eat each other's arms and everyone lives in boxes. There are two different Kings and they hate each other. The each own half the village, but each want to take over completely. For the people caught in between, all they see is fighting and death and just want to be at peace. We see brothers fighting each others, families and neighbours, and friendships torn apart by this separation. This is of course a major them of every Shakespeare book- dualisticism. Where there is a man, there is a similar but different woman etc. Of course we know from school that Shakespeare lived through the British Civil War and saw his own family split up (Romeo and Julius is based on his childhood romance with the girl next door and most of his other books are affected by this). Pretty boring so far. Into this mix comes a mysterious stranger with no name called Jimbo. He sees this as a good chance to make some monies and get some free sake and a bit of a kip, so he pretends to joining both sides and make them fight more. Eventually he gets bored and kills everyone except the coffin maker who becomes a millionaire. He walks off into the night leaving the ghosts to mourn their foolish mistakes and realise they should have looked after each other and worried about this immigrant instead. This leaves us with many questions- was he really God? Was he really a devil? Was he just a mental? Why did that woman keep smiling? For all the people that were killed it's all a bit rubbish and we don't see any blood and the whole thing lacks excitements. Perhaps if someone was to remake this film with colour and lots of action and fights it would be good. All the issues like morals and foreigners wrecking the place, and war and jealousy are all the more important nowadays. This may be Clint's favourite movie, but just imagine if he had been in a remake of it, with guns instead of swords. That would have been great.Best Scene: When Jimbo is hiding from all the townspeople and he crawls underneath the boardwalk and the people's house so they don't see him. He hides under one bedroom and sees a young women stripping and getting washed. He watches every slip of clothing fall off slowly, sees the nubile young thing step into the steaming tub and all the moisture drip over her aching body. We then see her step out, pad herself softly with a silky cloth and get into bed, naked and sleep. This was the beginning of a new genre of Asian movies- good ones!",

Everything in it, from the quirky characters to the zany atmosphere without forgetting the bombastic soundtrack or the trademark action scenes, goes into creating a very entertaining movie. There is nothing cult-like about it, instead there is highly competent production that is truly gripping. The Western movie vibes draw attention a particular Japanese point of view without making it difficult to be enjoyed by a broader audience.In being so immediate in the way even a casual viewer can apprehend it 'Yojimbo' runs the risk of not being appreciated for the innovative movie it was. I watched a documentary with some of the people involved in making it and it was delightful to see how enthusiastic they still were decades after. It also showed how the techniques that went into filming and the sound effects were so ground breaking at the time. Kuorosawa also built an entire town down to the most minute of details and went to great lengths to achieve the dust blowing in the wind effect.The result is a movie that aged beautifully and that pointed in the direction that would be followed by so many. This timeless appeal is one of the reasons why 'Yojimbo' is such an overall hit on all fronts. Gripping and just fun. It is always wonderful to be entertained by a movie that is genuinely well done, beautifully crafted and to simply relax to something that is not a guilty pleasure.",

Also, made in black and white picture also gives you that certain charm modern films don't have anymore. Plenty of symbols there as well, the traditional Japanese ex Samurai, now a Ronin, and the local villain with the revolver, a new revolutionary weapon in their world, start of an Industrial age that will slowly change Japan in years to come /years later idea completely stolen for the basic plot of the movie about the only survivor of the Hollywood mental and physical genocide of Japanese warriors- The Last Samurai/Tom Cruise/ Jojimbo A must see picture!Cheers, Byxl, Sarajevo",

The film has a plethora of characters who all perform adequately for this movie to be impeccable. Barring a few moments where the acting of some can be labeled cheesy, the movie is top notch.

Ultimately, Sanjuro bids himself off to each clan and learns their motivations then turns on them to display their greed and shallow view. It all catches up to him as he is captured by one of the clans and pummeled to an inch of his life by a Richard Kiel clone.Still, if Yojimbo teaches us anything it is that your wits can do far more than any katana or other implements of destruction. After eliminating the gangs Sanjuro walks into the sunset, not unlike your heroic cowboy that finally restored order after some well-fought battles.",

It takes place in this small town, and it kind of dumps the entire backstory in one scene and I wish it would've been spread out more, although I understand that would've caused a longer runtime. The movie did start to drag a little probably around 3/4ths of the way through before it quickly picks back up for the last 10 minutes or so. As for the positives, the film has incredible cinematography and choreography (Kurosawa does a great job at making sure the movement of the actors creates an interesting frame). It's not as action packed as Seven Samurai, but the film is very entertaining for the majority of the runtime. This is in part due to the great sense of humor thrown in there. The protagonist of the story is a ronin who is very clever throughout the movie and is acted very well by Toshiro Mifune. If you're wondering about the plot, the film focuses on this samurai (whose name is only said once throughout the entire thing, he's mostly referred to by a nickname or just \"the samurai\") and this small town that has a lot of issues. It's small scale, but there are plenty of stakes and tension throughout. The plot was well crafted, it was very well directed, and everybody was well written. I'd give Yojimbo an 8/10.",

He gets interested in the situation when he finds two gang groups are confronting each other.The film is entirely focused on entertainment. The center is of course the swordsman, played by Toshiro Mifune, later randomly naming himself 'Kuwabatake Sanjuro'. I love how he strolls the deserted street, drawing his hands into his kimono, blown in the wind. That's cool! The surrounding people are cautiously staring at him from a distance, wondering what he is going to do. He seems to even enjoy the limelight.Sanjuro goes in a bar, where he learns the situation from the old owner Gonji, the almost only person who remains sensible in the town that is infested with violence. I'm impressed by how Sanjuro talks to Gonji as if he was an old friend of Gonji's. While being simple and blunt, I think Sanjuro's true nature is friendliness.As one of the two groups, Seibei's family is desperate in an attempt to overcome the disadvantage, only to be easily manipulated by Sanjuro. On the other hand, my favorite among Ushitora's gang is Inokichi, the retard who likes fighting like a kid. He smiles goofily when flattered about his strength. Not only Inokichi, but all the gangs are mostly stupid, and no one compares with Sanjuro in cleverness. It seemed to be easy for Sanjuro to exploit them, but the mood changes when the psychopathic Unosuke returns.The situation changes one after another as the plot goes on at a brisk tempo. Unexpected thing happens at every turn. All in the film is just a gang war, and there is nothing deep. But you will be compelled all along with the film, because of the characters and direction. Camera movement works as the director's eloquent language. Characters are arranged from near to far, fully utilizing the space, sometimes with the effective use of window fences. The percussion soundtrack makes scenes either thrilling or humorous.",

Comedy was an important part in playing this story by showing the enemy's actual weaknesses and it's hilarious. Kurosawa's theory of movement in film plays well as it shows the audience that there is movement on screen and it's important for visual storytelling. Having Mifune scratch his shoulders with his head to help the audience understand that it's the main character or using dust flying across the screen are a few examples of powerful movement in film. This classic was later created into a spaghetti western movie, \"Fistful of Dollars\" which became the first of the three films that Clint Eastwood starred in and if this film didn't exist, then the greatest western film of all time wouldn't exist either.",

A \"Nameless Man\" wanders into town, a town split by two gangs, and since he is a man with certain talents for fighting, both gangs want to hire him.  I did find some hiccups in the translation from Japanese to English; the gangs were referred to as \"gamblers\" and the coffin-maker was called a \"cooper\"--a barrel maker. I don't know if this is the original translation or if it was changed when they remastered the film.  The film rolls along at a good clip, without much lagging.  It isn't constant action, it does take time to set up some characterization.  Which is good: I hate films that treats all the actors like props.  \"A Fist Full Of Dollars\" is almost a direct copy of this movie, except for one thing: \"Yojimbo\" has a sense of humor.  There are plenty of lighter scenes that either make you laugh out loud, or at least chuckle. There is one picky point: I wish someone would have taken the tag out of \"Nameless Man's\" costume.

            "content": "In Scientific American (Feb. 1998) John R. Hale wrote: \"Plato may have denied the existence of ideal forms in this world, but Plato never saw a Viking ship.\" In fact, Plato had several disadvantages: he saw the Parthenon, of course; but he never listened to JS Bach, and he never tasted Islay whisky; most relevant here is that Plato never saw a Japanese sword.If there is a better way to appreciate the Japanese sword than to see this movie, I don't know it. The choreography of the sword-fights might not be the best, and the black+white photography is a drawback in the action scenes; but no other movie builds tension more effectively, and without tension, no action scene can be fully appreciated.When I first saw this movie, I had already seen two other samurai movies by Kurosawa. That gave me a superficial familiarity with medieval Japan (as seen by Kurosawa), so that I could focus on the plot, the characters, and the action, without having to worry about the unfamiliar setting. Now I have seen this movie often enough to follow it without subtitles, enjoy the sound of the Japanese dialog (without understanding it), and still know from memory what is going on.The highlights of this movie are the three sword-fights, with Sanjuro, alone, facing overwhelming odds. When the third sword-fight comes, you'll know right away that it's going to be the last. It is a classic western-style showdown, with Sanjuro and the bad guys facing each other on a dusty, wind-swept main street in a Japanese village. When I first saw the set-up, I could not help giggling to myself in eager anticipation; and I was not disappointed. Yet the first sword-fight is perhaps the most impressive, for its explosive violence and the terror that suddenly strikes the heart of Sanjuro's enemies.Having said that, it would be very wrong to conclude that the movie is just an excuse for a few action scenes: the other major theme is the Machiavellian plot to clean up the village. Sanjuro explains this plot early on to the innkeeper: he cannot eliminate all the gangsters single-handed, so he'll set them against each other. The success of this plan depends crucially on persuading the gang leaders that Sanjuro is only interested in the money: if they realized that his goal is to clean up the town, the plot would collapse.This movie was somewhat more enjoyable than The Seven Samurai for me: partly because I saw The Seven Samurai when I was not yet comfortable with the setting in medieval Japan; partly because in this movie the interludes between action scenes are shorter, and the action scenes generally better. However, there cannot be a real comparison, because The Seven Samurai is mostly a study of the title characters, while Yojimbo is more about plot than character development. The seven samurai hardly ever interact with the bad guys, except by violence; Yojimbo lives amongst the bad guys. Ultimately, both movies are masterpieces in different ways.",

Both disctinctly Japanese but deeply connected to world cinema, especially by American filmmakers. Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu's movies are influenced by Buddhist insights; Kurosawa's, on the contrary, are action films on bit sets with swordplay and violence. Toshiro Mifune is his main actor. Rash\u00f4mon (1950) and The Seven Samurai (1954) were finantial and internationally successes. Y\u00f4jimbo(1961) (El mercenario) is sometimes considered ashis best film. It was small but greater and best considered in Japan. Unlike the massive undertaking, years of work , huge cast and budget, of the Seven Samurais, J\u00f4jimbo was a simple, quick, and cheap film. Influenced by American films it influenced also greatly them. Kurosawa admired John Ford. He said \"My Darling Clementine is a model of what cinema shoud be\" . Also a cosmopolitan men, several of mis films were based on Shakespeare\u00b4s plays. Russian literature (Dostoyevsky) and crime fiction (Dashiell Hammet)\nYojimbo (El mercenario), is based on Dashiell Hammet\u00b4s novels \"The Glass Key\" and \"Red Harvest\". John Ford\u00b4s influence is evident throughout the movie. The Ronin tradition is the Japanese root. Detective fiction, American western and Japanese Samutay tradition.\nThe story is secondary to the visual part and the acting. Plot: In 1860 a nameless Ronin runs into a village taken by two rival gangs at war. The villager ares paralized by fear. The ronin, hired by the Seibei clan finds out that they intend to stab him in the back after the fight is over. He decides to have some dark fun and set both gangs to kill each other. They are beyond redemption in the eyes of the viewer. The inkeeper says it to the ronin, who, despite his appearance has a moral side. One gang has kidnapped a farmer\u00b4s wife, and he frees her using a trick; but is exposed by a thankyou note from the woman. Beaten up, he escapes with the help of the inkeeper, who then is kidnaped. Time to kill everybody. Spectacular action scenes like in a John Ford western: the wide empty main street; wind and dust; the gangs walking towards each other from opposite sides; even with pistols. The bad guys are killed. But unlike John Ford\u00b4s westerns, the hero doesn\u00b4t glow. He\u00b4s ragged, unshaven, unkempt, silent, smirking, sees everything with ironic detachment. He gets the gangs to kill each other: nothing noble. So he is an antihero. His final lines: \"It\u00b4ll be quiet in this town now\". Then frees the inkeeper with a slash and walks away with a \"Seeyah!\" leaving a town strewn with the bad guys corpses.\nThis changed movies. \"Sanjuro \"(1962) was a sequel.

            "content": "Well, I can definitely see why this movie caused a huge cultural influence in America. Yojimbo is nothing short of an incredible action movie that never gets boring and never lets up. Some of the parts of this movie compare so well to modern action films that I actually thought this movie ranks in my top 10 action movies of all time.Like \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\" Yojimbo is an opera of cheesiness. The acting is good in a loud way, and there are certain characters that have no place in reality, but a welcome home in the world of movies. (That huge, ugly bastard.) Toshiro Mifune has consistently been a commanding prescence on the screen in every Kurosawa film that I have seen, and each performance I watch makes me love him more and more. In this film, he plays a gruffy old samurai, but with a different edge than that of Sanjuro. In Sanjuro, the lead character is more of an unconventional leader, using cleverness as his main weapon, and the sword only when necessary. This is still the same sort of character that he plays in Yojimbo, however, in this film he has a much more brutal air about him. Sanjuro left you feeling like he was a restrained individual. Yojimbo left you feeling a little awed by the sheer power that he could unleash.As far as the plot goes, this movie is about as perfect as you can get to suit my needs. Basically, a man who calls himself Sanjuro comes into town for a few days. When he leaves, everyone is dead. What's not to love? But seriously... This movie is about a town that is torn by two rival gangs. When the no-named Samurai comes in, he manages to use his skillful swordplay to manipulate the two sides so they destroy each other. And in the end, everyone dies!! Glee! Glee!This film was so thoroughly fun and funny that I was laughing the entire length of the movie. The final showdown was so incredible and different from any sort of action climax I have seen that it made a serious mark in my brain. When I was watching it, I got a vibe that I had seen this level of bad assness in another movie before, but I couldn't really remember where. What made it so good was the entire development of all the characters. I love that feeling where the bad guys are set up so much that you just love to watch them get their asses kicked.Toshirio Mifune's character of \"the man with no name\" is definitely the best part of the film. He has the dark humor and stage prescence to really pull this role off and make it work to a maximum. I also found the way that he gets his \"name\" to be a wonderful touch to the movie as well. He says his name is \"Sanjuro,\" which means he is 30 years old. He then looks out into the distance and sees a mulberry field. \"Sanjuro Kuwabatake,\" he says. Kuwabatake means mulberry field in Japanese.There are so many great little touches to this movie that are so classic in and of themselves. In the beginning of the film, Sanjuro throws a stick into the air. The stick points a direction, so, Sanjuro walks that direction. Truly a man with no purpose for living. This, among many other moments, make the movie so fun and fresh that you never get bored while watching.The GOODS: Fun, inventive, and downright ass-kicking. I am definitely taking a shine to black and white movies. Since I was raised with color, I used to prefer movies that are in color. After seeing Kurosawa use the black and white as an entirely different medium of putting film onto the screen, utilizing the actual lack of color, I have been gaining an entirely different respect for black and white. Yojimbo is a black and white film, which drains the color from the film and replaces it with a dusty feeling, like a western. I think Yojimbo would not have been the same movie if it had been in color.The BADS: Yojimbo, much like \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,\" is filled with cheese. It is a fantastic film in the sense that it is borderline fantasy. I do not really look at this to be a bad thing, but there are cerain audiences who don't enjoy watching cheese on film.The overall story pretty much stands: If you like a good adventure story, and you like to be entertained, go see Yojimbo. I found it to be engaging and never boring. This movie zoomed to my alltime favorites list, being a perfectly crafted, fast paced, fun adventure that will only leave you feeling giddy and wishing that YOU were a nameless samurai. Hands down 4 stars.",

This is another Kurasawa/Mifune collaboration, Mifune has acted in Kurasawa movies like Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and Rashomon.The movie's star is Sanjuro (Mifune), he is a sword for hire. His loyalty lies where the money lies. He is willing to kill to show his worth. Mifune does o wonderful job portraying this character. He is calm, funny and of course Badass.I love the black & white cinematography. There is something really appealing about black & white movies. The contrasts between night and day, foreground and background, action and reaction are quite clear. You can often see it in a single shot.This movie inspired the unofficial remake: Fistful of Dollars. I love Fistful and Yojimbo, but i think that Yojimbo is better. There are definitely things that Fistful does better, most notably the music. However I believe that Yojimbo will resonate with me longer.Awesome movie, see it.",

            "content": "I love this movie so much, and why not when there's so much to love about it. For one you have a great director and a great actor in top form and in perfect sync. Kurosawa opens with a long shot following Mifune's back as he walks purposefully along the road before reaching a crossroads where he decides which direction to go by throwing a stick up in the air and seeing where it lands. There is a huge amount of raw humanity in this film along with a good dose of humour, which is important when your dealing with quite a dark plot executed with some well choreographed violence. It's Mifune's show and he dominates the screen, completely believable as this force of nature that rolls into town and decides to sort out the towns' gang rivalry problem by destroying both of the gangs. Famously remade as A Fistful of Dollars (and less famously as the Bruce Willis vehicle Last Man Standing) the influence of the American Western genre on Kurosawa is obvious although he makes it all his own, partly with the help of a great soundtrack by. Masaru Sato. If you're a fan of film-making, this is a must-see.",

            "review_title": "Yojimbo Stands Alone",
            "content": "Yojimbo translates into English as Bodyguard, such as the protagonist in the film, Sanjuro Kuwabatake, the samurai. He finds his way to a town that is torn apart by two gangs who both believe they are entitled to run the town. The boss of each of the clans attempts to employ the samurai as a bodyguard and as the missing piece to take over the town. However, Kuwabatake has plans of his own. When Kuwabatake arrives to the town he proclaims, \"I get paid for killing and this town is full of men who are better off dead.\" The line sent shivers down my spine, and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Akira Kurosawa shows why he is regarded as one of the best writers and directors to ever step on a movie set. The story unfolds beautifully in the rundown Japanese town in which it is set. Every element of the story worked together flawlessly to create another masterpiece by Kurosawa. Kurosawa's other movies include classics such as Rashomon, Ran, The Hidden Fortress, Throne of Blood, one of my all-time favorites The Seven Samurai.Yojimbo also influenced filmmakers from Sergio Leone to George Lucas. Leone remade Yojibo as A Fistful of Dollars, the first movie that featured Clint Eastwood as \"The Man with No Name,\" which later provided the sequels, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, another of my all-time favorites. George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars, my All-Time favorite, and Indiana Jones movie franchises also pays homage to Kurosawa in his films. Most notably is the identical scene of Kuwabatake cutting off a man's arm, and Obi-Wan Kenobi mimicking his actions in Star Wars. Yojimbo has everything needed to be a great movie, a superior story, a legendary director, good action, and some comedy. The film may be over 40 years old, but it still stands tall as a classic.",

            "review_title": "Modern action movies could learn something from Yojimbo...",
            "content": "Okay, okay, so obviously modern action films would never take influence from Yojimbo, because in this age they really only serve to hold the attention of thoughtless viewers hoping to melt their brains with some fast paced action for a few hours. But even franchises that I have a lot of respect for, like the MCU, could learn a lot from how Yojimbo approaches action. Kurosawa masters the art of the rush. The actual sword swinging is few and far between, so that when the katana swinging really starts it gives you a genuine feeling of excitement and passion; this is something I've never experienced to this extent in a film.Sanjuro, the main character, is also done flawlessly. There is no lack of quiet, confident, and \"unbeatable\" characters in modern media. But Sanjuro is developed differently. He is known to be the most powerful character, but the audience and characters have only developed this idea because of a 20 second brawl at the beginning of the film. Sanjuro, who knows that even he has limits, uses his strong composure to convey his power to the two rival gangs. In time, even the audience begins to doubt his abilities. In his weakest moment, it appears that he was not as strong as we all thought after all. But still, when he is as weak as he is, Sanjuro maintains his confidence. We see him practicing with a throwing knife (I don't know if it has a better name) in the shed while he recovers. We have no reason to believe this is significant. However, in the film's final battle, it is revealed that he had been practicing in order to take out the one man with a gun, the one man he couldn't beat with the swing of a sword. The audience's faith is rekindled, and we realize that we were wrong to ever doubt Sanjuro, not because he was as strong as he made himself out to be, but because he was far more clever than we thought.Beyond these brilliant aspect of Yojimbo, the film is absolutely flawless in its atmosphere. The side characters are hilarious and perfectly cast, and the sets are perfect as well. The film only lacks in its relative simplicity. In more ways than one, Yojimbo' as simplicity is what makes it so great, but it's also hard to compare to anything we would consider a \"modern day classic\", due to its lethargic pace and straightforward conflicts. Nonetheless, Yojimbo is a great pick and one of the best of its kind.",

            "content": "\"Good Artists copy, great artists steal\". This quote, often attributed to Picasso is apt for Yojimbo whose scene by scene, lift off of \"A fistful of dollars\" spawned a whole genre of Westerns. So perhaps some would regard Sergio Leone as a \"great artist\" whose \"cheat\" have inspired so many movies that any random Hollywood Western movie buff must have watched the formula scenes when a lone cowboy walks in a deserted town, sharp shoots his way into the audiences heart then finally triumphs in the one- on-one duel with the villain. But for serious audiences wondering about the derivation of the formula, have to watch amongst other Samurai movies by Kurosawa, Yojimbo- definitely amongst the most entertaining of the lot. Audiences who enjoyed the samurai sword play in \"Kill Bill\" should get their teeth into Yojimbo. Kurosawa, incidentally belonged to the family of Samurai. The fight scenes are few and far between, but so vividly picturised that they deliver immense impact without being grotesque or should I say Tarantinoesque. Camera work is of course the forte of Kurosawa who started out as a painter just as one of his other illustrious Asian contemporary Satyajit Ray. No wonder his scenes seems to spring out as a flipping of a series of sketches- with Japanese musical instruments enhanced music, electrifying the visual delight.\nI wish I could compare Yojimbo with Maula Jutt and give a critical comment on the influence of Japanese Samurai movies on Punjabi \"western\" cult movie, but I am afraid I have not watched the latter yet. Wonder what \" Maula ko maula na maare to maule nahin murda\" in Japanese would sound like.",
