            "content": "I've been watching Breathless for the first time in many years on the Sundance Channel. Jean-Luc Godard's cinema changing film about a young tough in love with American movies and an American girl changed European cinema.I don't know if it was for the better or worse. My only real memory of watching the film from my film class days was the sense that one could see how it was copied by other filmmakers of the period. I retained very little of the plot. Actually I retained very little of anything concerning the film after each of the two or three times I've seen it. Watching it again for the first time in probably five or six years I'm struck by how silly it all is. Once the height of fashion and hip coolness I was not so quietly giggling to myself. The film has not aged very well and has become almost a parody of itself. I could feel the pretensions flooding off the screen. This isn't to say the film isn't good, it is on some level, however I think its better if viewed in the context of when it came out, instead of what it is today. Forgive me if I offend with this position, but watching Jean Seberg struggle with her French and Jean-Paul Belmondo attempt to be cool, is almost too funny for words. (Belmondo reminded me of a cousin who always tried to be hip and cool and tough, but instead came off as silly). Worth a look if you're interested in milestones of the cinema, however I think you may be hard pressed to make it to the end with a straight face.",

            "content": "So says the novelist in response to Patricia's question, \"What do you hope to attain out of life?\" That response is the philosophy of the film and of every character in the film. All want to be in control of their destiny. All want to be something that they are not. None are able to do any of these things. They are all contradictions. How can you die as an immortal? How can Patricia be free and independent is so many other things determine what she can do? How can this film transcend the screen while existing on the screen? This is an amazing film to watch. Goddard fills every scene with ingenuity and energy. He puts his actors in a beautiful environment and lets them do their thing. And they do it extremely well. The actors are beautiful. Not just cosmetically, but spiritually and psychologically. I am not sure that I liked either of the two main characters. I am sure I could not keep my eyes off them. I could not take my eyes off the screen. Techniques that novices today use for no substantial purpose are utilized by Goddard to amazing effect. The greatest filmmakers are the great editors. Goddard makes the editing a character itself. It is the nervous narrator hurrying the film along. It breathlessly awaits the next scene, and leads us to do the same. I like the way Goddard spends prodigious time simply watching his characters. The conversation scene at the center of the film is amazingly long and drawn out, yet I did not find it boring. I found it fascinating. People are fascinating. Everyone is trying to be something. It takes tremendous talent to indulge in the minutiae of existence. A great film.",

            "review_title": "More fun to discuss than to watch",
            "content": "Watching Jean-Luc Godard's massively influential, unintentional-classic Breathless and discussing Jean-Luc Godard's massively influential, unintentional-classic Breathless are two totally different things. For one, the latter is more fun the other and, two, discussing the film almost instantly allows for quality, intelligent discussion of cinema to ring. There are certain cinephiles that take Godard himself more seriously than they take any other director who has ever lived. Just when you thought Stanley Kubrick-fanatical elitism was out of control, spend about ten minutes, as an exercise, scouring the internet for French New Wave forums and in-depth analysis of the Godardian methods and you may be surprised at what you find.I'm only stating this because around a year and a half ago, I began my sporadic voyage into the depths of Godard with his most recent picture, at the time, Film Socialisme, which I found to be an assault on every conceivable sense and not in a particularly good way. The film was choppy, disjointed, messy, just about as incomprehensible as it could be, and trying to find justifications or analyses online proved ineffective. All and all, it's a film I just want to forget and I didn't care to dive into Godard much after that endeavor. I now realize that a decent part of the blame is on me for choosing perhaps the wrong film to begin my Godardian journey with. I emerge from seeing Breathless (known by its French title as \u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9) with a more of a positive reaction. This is a bravely-structured and maturely handled annihilation to every cinematic convention prior to its 1960 release down with class and impenetrable style on part of Godard.The story - even though it is relatively the least of our concerns - follows Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who is trying to emulate the characteristics possessed by Humphrey Bogart during the particular 40s/50s era of menacing American crime dramas that billed him as the lead actor. One day, feeling intimidated and a perhaps a little adventurous, Michel shoots a police officer who has been tailing him and now must deal with being broke and on the run from the cops. His only companion is Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American journalist getting by in life by selling newspapers in downtown Paris. The two desperately skim through their options trying to hide from the police, one of which is skipping town and going all the way to Italy as fugitives.I say the story is the least of our concerns because there is simply not much to it. After all, Breathless is an aesthetic breakthrough rather than a narrative one. Godard employs dangerously subversive jump cuts - where the camera cuts to another shot within the same frame creating a breach in continuity - along with rapid-fire, quick shots and lengthy dialog scenes. All of this broke French cinema convention, which, prior to this, was consistently polished and very elegant. Godard invited in a rebellious messiness to the picture, almost like the guy coming into a neatly-organized room and rustling all the papers and files to not only create a stir but to do something different, something completely new.It's almost shortchanging to simply say that I have immense respect for Godard seeing as in 1960, a time when social change and civil unrest amongst adolescents and twentysomethings seemed to be so prevalent in many different places, he ushered in a new way of doing things cinematically and created a stylistically bold film because of it. He even threw in the element of using a hand-held camera, an unheard of practice during this particular time. I think I would also be in line to compare Breathless to Bonnie and Clyde, a film that would enter the picture seven years later in American studios that would simultaneous shock and stimulate audiences everywhere.Godard's films have a unique power after you watch them. For example, it has been about four days since I sat down to watch Breathless and since watching it - and now writing a medium-length analysis of it - I have a strong, biting urge to watch more of Godard's films. His films have the kind of impact where you just want to talk about them and talk about their impact in great length; which, once more, brings me to the point that watching the films is actually the weaker part compared to discussing them.Starring: Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. Directed by: Jean-Luc Godard.",

            "review_title": "Imprisoned In Its Era",
            "content": "When critics or viewers praise a film only because it was technically innovative when it was made ... beware. It may mean that the film has either minimal entertainment value or minimal thematic content. Such is indeed the case with \"Breathless\", a film noted for the director's willingness to break rules of traditional cinema. This film is far more improvised, more off-the-cuff, then \"staged\" films made in years prior to 1960.The story, about an unlikeable cad who romances a young woman in Paris, is dull as dishwater. It has no thematic depth. The script treatment, written by Francois Truffaut a year or two before Jean-Luc Godard filmed the movie, is used more or less as the basis for the plot and the dialogue, sans screenplay. And it shows!Characters are not well thought out. Our cad is a killer and a petty thief who smokes a lot. He's also obnoxious. At one point he looks directly into the camera and tells viewers: \"If you don't like ... then get stuffed!\" The young woman is unremarkable in every way, apart from her unisex hairdo, which may have been chic in 1960; today it looks atrocious.Likewise, the film's improvised dialogue is horrible. At one point the cad asks the young woman: \"Why are you looking at me?\" Her response: \"Because I'm looking at you\". And then later, the woman says \"Well, I don't know yet whether I love you\". The cad asks: \"When will you know?\" She responds: \"Soon\". He asks: \"What does soon mean? In a month, a year?\" She answers \"Soon means soon\". Submit a screenplay to a studio these days with dialogue like that, and see what happens.Casting and acting are mediocre and bland. The two main roles are not demanding. The film's production design conveys the impression that Godard was trying to appeal to an audience of haughty sophisticates. Thus, we get an artist's studio, convertible sports cars, and lots of cigarette smoking. The background music is mostly light jazz, and when combined with the costumes, production design, and hairstyles makes the film seem very dated.Maybe \"Breathless\" was Godard's way of breaking through as a major film director in 1960, specifically by thumbing his nose at Hollywood film directors from previous decades. And there's some merit to that. But I'm viewing this film in 2009, not 1960; and I'm a viewer, not a film director. A film that has nothing to offer but innovation, invisible to the viewer, runs the risk of being time bound, imprisoned in its own era.And I have no doubt that \"Breathless\" was technically innovative. As such, it's a film that deserves to be read about in film history books, and seen by film historians and film students. But as entertainment for a general audience decades after it was made, and in its overall thematic content, it has little or nothing to offer.",

            "review_title": "To those who \"don't understand\"",
            "content": "I don't blame those who state that they do not \"understand\" the superlatives surrounding Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 masterpiece, Breathless. It's primarily because to appreciate Breathless, one has to view the movie from a historical context, which also requires studying of not only the French New Wave, but film theories as a whole, and the lives of those apart of the New Wave. Breathless accomplished many things unprecedented prior (many completely unprecedented, but some things are not-so-much).Roger Ebert put it best when he said that just as film fanatics may now stand outside a movie theatre waiting for the next Quentin Tarantino movie to be released, film enthusiasts were doing so for Godard in the 1960s. He was a revolutionary, which is why MovieMaker magazine called him the 4th most influential director of ALL-TIME (only behind Welles, Griffith, and Hitchcock)! What did Godard do different? Breathless is all style, simple as that. The story line is interesting, yes, but is Godard's aesthetics, production modes, subject matters, and storytelling methods that are key. First of all, the whole movie was shot on a hand-held camera, just like most all New Wave pictures. It was, however, only shot by two people (Godard and his cinematographer, Rouald) on a budget that did not top $50,000, a mere fraction of what most pictures cost at the time (another facet of the New Wave). It was shot completely on location in Paris, and utilized new film-making techniques that would be used by film-making students for decades to come (such as putting the camera in a mail cart on the Champs Elysees and following Belmondo and Seberg). Note Godard's use of American cinema influence, and how the montage art of the 1950s impacted this aesthetic.(A brief New Wave lesson: Most New Wave directors were displeased with the \"tradition of quality,\" or the older generation directors who, as Truffaut put it, made the \"twelve or so\" pictures per year that represented France at Venice and Cannes. Most of these pictures classic or modern literary adaptations, completely stagnant in artistic quality with rehashed subject matters based on historical periods. New Wave directors supported NEW tales of modern Parisian life, primarily, and were sick of the themes found in the tradition of quality films.) The storytelling methods in Breathless are perhaps the most fascinating part of the film. The jump cuts may seem lame, but one must again view them from a historical context: it had never been done before. This is exactly why Breathless is important -- practically every technique was revolutionary. They are so submerged into film-making practices now that Breathless seems typical. Yet at the time, it was, as I said prior, unprecedented.",

            "content": "I finally did it. I finished watching \u00c0 bout de souffle. I kept putting it off because I usually have problem when everybody tells me that such and such film is the epitome of its era or it breaks all the rules, starts the revolution, and reinvents the cinema. That's why, probably, I cannot like Citizen Kane - try to watch the arguably best film ever made - you will be under a lot of pressure. Well, \u00c0 bout de souffle does not put you under the pressure, it takes you for a ride, and you follow for 90 minutes its incredibly young characters, common crook (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his American free-spirited girlfriend (Jean Seberg) on their journey on the streets of 1960-th Paris along with Raoul Coutard's legendary camera. I am not going to tell here how great the camera work was, how fantastic the music score and the views of Paris were - the fans of the film know that already. They also know about the beginning of French New Wave, and how it influenced the future cinema. I just want to say that the movie was made over forty years ago - the smoking was cool back then, and Belmondo made smoking look very sexy. Belmondo fascinates me in this film. I've seen him in a lot of later movies - he's always been good (I recommend Le Magnifique, 1973 and Le Professionnel,1981 ) - but in \u00c0 bout de souffle he is not just good - he is embodiment of cool, his face changes its expression every moment, you can not take your eyes off him. Is it me or he does remind the very young Mick Jagger - not commonly handsome but irresistible and sexy? He and young (she was 21 at the time) Jean Seaborg made one of the best screen couples ever. My favorite scenes: Michel drives the stolen car in the beginning of the film, and he starts to talk to us, the audience. The day is nice, the sun is shining, and the life is beautiful... Michel and Patricia drive in the convertible. The wind plays with her short hair. We only see the back of her head and her neck. Michel tells her that he loves the girl with a beautiful neck, wrists, knees, but she is a chicken... Patricia comes to the hotel to find Michel in her bed. They start talking about nothing and about very serious things. They smoke, she tries to find a good place for her new poster, and he wants to sleep with her. In the end of the scene, his face, he looks at her - there is love in that look...\nThere is more - I am sure everyone who saw it has his/her favorite scenes.",

            "review_title": "Too cool for (film) school",
            "content": "Together with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\" (one of my favorites), Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\" is considered the defining, instigating film of the French New Wave. It's more ironic and detached, less emotionally accessible than \"The 400 Blows,\" and its technical innovations like jump cuts are perhaps even more surprising. For these reasons, I found \"Breathless\" easier to admire than to love\u0097though by the end I grew to enjoy its too-cool- for-(film)-school tone.Ironically, the pace of this movie isn't \"breathless\" at all. It begins abruptly and takes a while to get going: Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), a character we barely know, drives a stolen car around, talks at the camera, and shoots a police officer who has tried to pull him over. Then he goes to Paris and tries to borrow money from some friends, while the police-shooting plot goes undeveloped. I only became fully engaged with the introduction of Patricia (Jean Seberg), a young American who sells newspapers on the Champs-Elysees. The relationship between Michel and Patricia is the heart of the film, especially a 25-minute-long scene in Patricia's apartment where the characters smoke, flirt, and laze around in bed, though nothing really happens. That's where I really started to admire \"Breathless,\" because I was so captivated by a scene that, on paper, doesn't sound all that captivating.Eventually the police catch onto Michel and launch a manhunt, but this doesn't really ratchet up the suspense. Instead, Michel is (or at least, Michel acts) aimless and nonchalant about the whole thing\u0097this is not a typical \"man on the run\" movie. The cool jazz score adds to the hip, laid-back tone.Since I didn't care for the movie too much until the scenes between Michel and Patricia, I believe a lot of the credit for the film's success has to go to the charismatic performances of Belmondo and Seberg. Belmondo, with a perpetual cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, is the archetypal cocky criminal who models himself after Humphrey Bogart (there's a great scene where he sees some Bogart photos and gets a vulnerable look in his eyes, as though saying \"I'll never be as cool as this\"). Seberg plays Patricia as a confused girl who is delighted by the attention she gets as an American in France.It's easy to see why \"Breathless\" was so influential\u0097the jump cuts, the ragged style perfectly match this story about amoral, aimless youth. Definitely a movie that expanded the range of stories the cinema can tell, and perhaps a major precursor to youth-oriented '60s culture. Nearly fifty years later, it still seems \"hip,\" and still challenges our expectations of how movies should behave.",

            "content": "Jean-Luc Godard's, A Bout de Souffle is possibly the brightest star to shine from the French New Wave. The 'Nouvelle Vague' came about from a group of like minded film critics writing for the Cahiers du Cinema.With his knowledge of classic film narrative and style Godard went out to create his own film in homage to, and also complete contradiction to, classic Hollywood film.The plot reads almost like a crime thriller typical of the 1930-40's. A criminal on the run from the police; the distraction of a beautiful woman; the escape and eventually someones death. But it is in Godard's approach to film style and use of new technologies that the typical crime thriller was turned on its head.In a break from classic Hollywood narrative the film opens with little equilibrium. Our protagonist's motives are unclear as he tears off to Paris leaving a woman and a dead cop in his trail. This in turn makes the ending somewhat open ended. With no sense of equilibrium to start with how can there be closure on what has happened throughout the film.Another twist on the classic storytelling in film is the progression of plot. It is naturally assumed in classic Hollywood film, that everything the spectator sees they see for a reason. With Michel's constantly pointless phone calls to retrieve owed money the plot is not pushed along at all. The inclusion of a 25 minute digression from the plot stands to emphasise the spectators reliance on narrative structure in the watching of films. Although watching the film closely is, as always, important in following the story A Bout de Souffle requires that little bit extra to define where the plot is being progressed and where Michel or Patricia are just flattering their egos or each other.All in all I personally think that A Bout de Souffle brought about a sense of realism not seen in Hollywood cinema before 1959 and even now. The fact that life isn't full of clues that will help us progress in say our relationships or escape from authority, but is infact full of digression; self exploration; and the confusions of love, ego and aspirations.",

            "review_title": "One of the most overrated films ever",
            "content": "The fact that an artist writes boringly to convey boredom, or childishly to convey puerility, has no effect on the resultant work not being boring nor puerile. Self-awareness of a flaw does not alleviate the flaw. For this to not be true intent in art would have to matter, meaning that all art would necessarily have to be accompanied by a detailed explanation of itself and its conception by the artists, which would therefore render the idea of the art as its own best explanation worthless. Naturally, this would rent the very essence of the artwork.Yet, in recent decades there has been the reflexive notion, usually tossed about by bad artists, that intent is almost all in art, or even that it supersedes actual accomplishment. This results in defenses of bad works of art that inevitably rely on defending the art's intent, not its success in following through on that intent. This has been championed by the 'first thought, best thought' Beatniks of the 1950s, modern Postmodernist thought, and in the 1960s New Wave of French cinema. One of the leading lights of that 'movement' was Jean-Luc Godard, whose first film, Breathless (A Bout de Souffl\u00e9- literally, The End Of Breath- 1960), made him a directing superstar. While one cannot dispute the historic import of such a film, historic import has never been equivalent to artistic excellence, and Breathless is a horribly dated film. Yet, even were it not so dated, it would still be a bad film because it is so self-conscious, so poorly written, and so poorly acted, that I thought I was watching a Roger Corman cheapo horror film. Let me state, however, that there is more 'art' in your typical Corman piece from that era, say The Last Woman On Earth, because its commentary on the state of film-making and art was more subtle, if often unintentional. Godard, by contrast, is so garishly dying to show his audience how hip and intellectual he is that he somehow forgot to put any of that, nor substance, into his film.He attempts to capture 'reality' on film without realizing that anything filmed becomes unreal, or irreal, as opposed to surreal. Thus, the art of film, or any art, can NEVER be real, and to convey reality most aptly, it needs to be most affected. Godard, by shooting his film with hand-held camera, as Parisians gawk at the filming in process, thus makes the most artificial of films, even as he tries to show the most boring aspects of life, glossing over crimes and 'deep' moments that other films contain, to show the dull times. He thus gets the two worst aspects of film- the 'artificiality' of cinema verit\u00e9 and the reality of dull life, rather than the two best: the 'reality' of film as artifice and the artifice of poetically chosen reality.What little story the tale has starts abruptly. It is an odd start, but not unlike many bad 1950s kids' television shows, nor contemporaneous B horror films like Carnival Of Souls. A hood named Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) steals a car in Marseilles and drives to Paris. On his way there, he is stopped for speeding and shoots a policeman. This goes by so quickly and without explanation that the viewer cannot empathize with him. Once in Paris, he needs to get money from a friend and flirts with an American female student named Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg) he has had an affair with. They wax in and out of fancy with one another, and on it goes\u0085. Across the pond, in America, at the time Breathless was being filmed, John Cassavetes was also making his feature film debut as a director, with Shadows, and although there is an amateurish quality to some aspects of that film, and it was not nearly praised as highly as Breathless, it was much less amateurish than this film, and holds up far better today, as a 'realist' piece of film-making. Breathless, by contrast, can only be defended as a historical curio, not artistically on its own merits, which is exactly what virtually all online essays that defend it do. Cassavetes' first film, by contrast, stands alone, and his usage of overlapping and realistic dialogue, not culled nor self-consciously quoted from Hollywood film dialogue, is far better than Godard's, which was stillborn when fellow auteur Francois Truffaut abandoned the screenplay to Godard. Godard captured none of the film noir joie de vivre that he hoped to, while Cassavetes brought American real life dialogue to the screen at the same time. Godard's characters never utter a believable line of dialogue. It is all a put on, for Michel is no more a gangster type than Belmondo- the actor who plays him, is, nor even Humphrey Bogart- the actor Michel imitates throughout the film. This is seen by apologists, however, as the film's style, although this so-called style is really stylelessness, and that is no more artistic than claiming formless Dave Eggersian puerility as a writing style\u0085.Later filmmakers went leagues beyond Godard, and actually demanded their innovations serve the film's tale, rather than merely being a piece of self-indulgence a haphazard and wan tale is draped over. With no good execution, no real depth, nor character development, what was intended as satire becomes, instead, awkward and obvious imitation, not witty enough for comedy, and more resembling something like film noir lite.John Cassavetes was doing similar things in America, but doing them much better, for his filmic improvisations never came across as 'improvisations', but 'reality'. In short, for all the claims to the contrary, this film, at least, does not reveal a unique innovator in his art form, but an old Romantic masquing as a hipster, and wildly cobbling together a Frankensteinian mess. In America we call that person a poseur. In France they apparently call them geniuses\u0085.just like, um, Jerry Lewis.",

            "content": "When he is pulled over for speeding, small time car thief Michel Poiccard shoots and kills a motorcycle police officer. Abandoning his stolen car and fleeing across the countryside he arrives back home in Paris penniless and needing somewhere to lie low. He turns to his American girlfriend Patricia for help and she takes him in. The pair spend the next few days making love, talking and stealing cars to get enough money to get to Italy; however as the police close in on Michel he gets increasingly desperate and fed up.Having gone to the cinema earlier and suffered the American version of Taxi, I decided to try and purge the badness from my system by watching a classic or two over the next few days \u0096 one of these classics was this film, which I do believe everyone who loves the cinema should try and see this at least once if only to be able to understand the wider origins and influences on the people who are currently influencing the next generation. Regardless of why you watch this, it is likely that modern audiences will not be won over by it as much as they really should be \u0096 certainly people I have talked to about the film seem to wonder what all the fuss is about (one even going so far as to lament the absence of Richard Gere!). I was of course impressed by the use of the much name-dropped technique of jump-cuts but seeing them now it is easy to forget that this was new then. Away from its place in the formation of modern cinema and its influence on many modern directors, this is a great film in its own right even if the rather laid back (typically French?) telling may annoy some audiences.For me the film relies on dialogue and characters and both of these are well delivered. The film seems to have a lot of talking between the two lead characters but this work as long as you can buy into the very cool and laid back philosophising about love, literature and life. I think that in the context of Paris as it is presented here that it works very well but then I had also been in stitches over the funny short film 'J'Aime John Wayne' which spoofs the 'Gallic cool' portrayed in this film. The lead characters work well because of the dialogue but they are also very well presented by the two leads. If someone played like Belmondo today I would be the first to deride him but here he is setting the reasons why nobody can do it again by becoming an iconic figure in modern cinema. He is not so much carefree and just very ambivalent about everything \u0096 America has its Rebels Without A Cause but to me Belmondo was very much a French version of a cultural rebel.Seberg is very good and makes her dialogue feel natural and convincing even though it could have been pretentious and annoying. Together they have not only chemistry but also a confidence within their own characters. Of course the direction still feels fresh today \u0096 freely moving around city streets and country roads but also coming in for close ups on the actors faces. Godard continues the feel of his short films and it much better than if it had been constrained by sets on soundstages.Overall this is a great film that you should see if only so that you can say you have seen it. It may be hard to see what all the fuss is about now, because we are looking back on technical things that are now the norm, but the film is still strong on the 'normal' basis of story, directing, acting etc. The film is full of iconic images as well as a very French sense of detached cool that is very much of its time but it is also an interesting character piece with good dialogue and good performances from Seberg and Belmondo, who can't have been aware of what they were taking part in.",

Leading the charge was Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, whose semi-autobiographical movie \"The 400 Blows\" shocked people with its intensity. But another major player was Jean-Luc Godard, whose \"\u00c0 bout de souffle\" (\"Breathless\" in English) was a new kind of crime drama. Jean-Paul Belmondo's suave crook comes across as a nice guy but will stop at nothing to get what he wants, while Jean Seberg's naive journalist just wants to do what she thinks is the right thing.I understand that the movie is a tribute to some US movies that Godard liked. Apparently, he and Truffaut felt that a number of French movies were pleasing to the eye but otherwise empty (Truffaut later interviewed Alfred Hitchcock, whose clever storytelling techniques he admired; while writing for Cahiers du Cinema, Godard praised Otto Preminger's works). Just as important as \"Breathless\"'s plot is the soundtrack. The smooth jazz drives the movie as Michel goes from place to place, with or without Patricia. The jump cuts are distracting at times, but they don't subtract from the movie. Everything about this movie bears analyzing; you should see it at least once. Outstanding.",

            "content": "Breathless was a film I did not warm up to easily the first time I saw it, as it was my first film I had seen from Jean-Luc Godard, and thought it was (un-fairly) too \"French\". On top of that, I felt displeased with Jean-Paul Belmondo's performance. After seeing the film again, and then a third time, I still find it to not be my absolute favorite Godard, but it is a lot better film than I first remembered. Much better. In fact, it is what pretty much anyone who has praise for the movie says it is: It's one of the benchmarks of post-modernist film-making (what Godard said was accidental in \"jump-cuts\", evident in the fast pace of when Michel is in the car at the beginning of the film), and it is quite a good deal of fun even when it slows down and we get those long hand-held shots by Raoul Cotard. The music is catchy (I find myself whistling the theme music and some of the other music in the film), Belmondo is interesting even when he's acting like a ironic rebel (and, upon repeated viewings, Belmondo grew on me even more as I realized my initial reaction was to the punk-like quality of the character, which is of course the point), and Godard seems to be relishing in his Jazzy usage and control of the camera. It is exhilarating and I look forward to re-watching it again and again; bottom line, A Bout de souffl\u00e9 was appropriately Godard's breakthrough, and on a first viewing it may turn off some more than others who aren't prepared - or, indeed, may be prepared but are too used to what Godard had already broken through with some almost 50 years ago. It does deserve a second viewing, or more, to understand it or perhaps be enthralled or whatever by it.",

Use of hand-held cameras and jump-cuts (where the director cuts from one angle to a shot of the same angle two seconds later, a stylistic effect that can show freneticism or boredom) were revolutionary at the time, yet can still surprise and delight today.Jean Seaberg is excellent, with the nicest accent you'll ever hear, as are the supporting cast, all rounded stereotypes. But the leading man outshines all the others. A virtuoso display from Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel Poiccard makes the viewer swoon and scorn in equal measures. He doesn't make it easy for us to empathize with him, yet we still do, and in doing, we feel we have earned something.Revolutionary. Brilliant. Oh so pretty.",

While trying to raise money to get out of town he also tries to talk an American girl (Jean Seberg) into leaving with him. I've read a lot of filmmakers say this is a film that inspired them but outside the visual style I found very little here to enjoy. The look of the film is the only thing that really kept me interesting. The strange, fast edits certainly had an impact on someone like Scorsese and the dark and shadows was a nice throwback to the film noirs of the 1940s. The two leads are also good in their roles but the screenplay, or lack of one, really kills this thing. I don't mind movies about nothing but this film takes that a little too far. The worst moment in the film and the one that really made me lose interest was when Michel went into the girlfriend's hotel and we stay there listening to them talk for a good fifteen minutes or more. The constant \"I want to sleep with you\" stuff got tiresome and nothing they said really kept me interested and it had very little to do with anything that followed (or came before).",

The fact that the average person may find the whole thing unfunny and bland is due to their just not being smart enough to understand and appreciate this masterpiece.While this is not a terrible film, part of me wishes this film had never been made. After all, this was the \"granddaddy\" of all French New Wave films and it ushered in many, many self-indulgent films that were proclaimed \"art\" despite the fact that they often deliberately used shoddy production values and were disliked by the ordinary person because they \"just didn't get it\"--yeah, right. This elitism was really just an excuse to make lousy films that, on occasion, really, really made no sense. While the movie's writer, Truffaut, went on to far better things--actually making some very good New Wave films, the success of this film encouraged Jean-Luc Godard to make worse films--such as ALPHAVILLE, PIERRE LE FOU, A WOMAN IS A WOMAN and FIRST NAME: CARMEN. All these films shared common denominators in that they made very little sense, had rotten camera-work and featured people that the average sane person could care less about as their stories unfolded. Oddly enough, Truffaut and Godard got their show business start as film critics who hated traditional French movies. They began making films that deliberately violated conventions and, at times, sensibilities.My biggest problem with BREATHLESS in particular is that I truly hated the central character. Once again, Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a real self-centered jerk (what I actually want to call his character is a lot less pleasant, but kids also read these reviews). There is NOTHING redeemable about the man--he steals car after car, murders a cop and lies almost every time he opens his mouth. Plus, he just seems cocky and unlikable. How Jean Seberg's character can even stand to be around him makes absolutely no sense.A second problem, and it was deliberately done by Godard, is the annoying edits he sometimes made. He deliberately made some scenes choppy and wanted the scene to appear very choppy. Well, if bad camera-work was his goal, why didn't he just film the movie in a coal mine or put his hand over the lens! These would make about as much sense and annoy the public just as well.The third problem is that the film is very, very, very talky and dull. For a major portion of the film, the central characters lie in bed and talk and talk about pretty much nothing. Yes, I know that IS the point of FRENCH NEW WAVE in many cases, but it makes for a terrible film.The only good thing about the film was a reference to \"Bob the gambler\". I assume this is a reference to the 1955 French Film Noir film BOB LE FLAMBEUR--especially since they also say that Bob is now in jail (that's how the movie BOB LE FLAMBEUR ended). This is a cute \"inside joke\" to an exceptional French film.By the way, I actually saw the film twice. Once, years ago and just yesterday because I thought it MUST have been better than I remembered it. Considering how I have trashed most Godard films I have reviewed (there are some exceptions), I felt an obligation to see it again just to give it a fair chance. I did and it STILL stank.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.This highly influential film is regarded because the director was a writer with interesting ideas and he could self-promote. As a result, a few theorists and all their legions of followers have designated this an `important film' and specifically for the reasons that Godard thought it was: reality vs documentary (portrait vs person) with a few filigrees of resulting unusual cinematography, editing and performance. It is amazing that these rather slight ideas had such power and influence forty years ago. Perhaps the slightness is an illusion because the ideas had such power they transformed our entire background.Here's another reading, one which presumes a complement to what Godard THOUGHT was the point: you can either be a thinker or an artist. If you are a thinker making a film, the film can only be as deep as your thoughts, which usually aren't. But if you are an artist, you tap into a knowing intuition, a state of communicative grace from something deeper than any maker or consumer of the artifact. So lets suppose Godard wasn't just a strong willed writer making statements like Ayn Rand writes. Lets say that this is a collection of forces that Godard responded to unknowingly and just dive into those forces. The French are obsessed with being important (or appearing to be so), especially in the arts and most especially in film. So when the overwhelming wave of (vulgar-by-definition) American influence so transforms the media away from your control, you need to strike back with matters of style. `New Wave' is to film as Perrier is to water - there's a real style here, but it is of a relatively synthetic nature.Michel Is French, trying to live as an American film star: this fact is pounded in a manner so bluntly it defaces the rest of the art. Patricia is an American trying to be French, working at several levels, sexual and intellectual. The French authorities (here conflated with the film intelligentsia) are feverously searching for Michel to eliminate creeping Americanism. Eventually, they succeed, aided by Particia. At the end Michel makes his film (the faces) and in a supreme irony, uses an American film posture to demean the `American' film experience. The American is flummoxed, in a double tragedy.My own belief is that in the grand scheme of things, this is a relatively trivial project. Godard WOULD go on to do some much more interesting, challenging and worthwhile work. I recommend `King Lear.' See that instead, unless you are a student in which case, Godard's writing will force you to see this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

This film pretty much made Jean-Paul Belmondo, who muscles his way through life, finding pleasure, while he is being pursued. His bad boy charm attracts the young female and she becomes embroiled in his impulsiveness. There is a love story here but there can be nothing but pain. Live fast, die young, leave a beautiful memory was created here. One could say that D. W. Griffith films are not as good as modern films on the same themes because they were silent and not in color. Even though the jump cuts and other fundamentals of filmmaking were introduced (or at least enhanced) in the French New Wave, there are those who criticize this film for being uninspired and repetitive.

It's insulting to women--note at least the scene where lead female Jean Seberg is conducting a high level interview and when she gets to ask a question, the man being interviewed makes a play for her, and she likes it, and that's that. She doesn't even write down the answer. And yet \"Breathless\" is a kind of worship of Seberg, incomparably sharp and stunning in director Jean-Luc Godard's take.But Godard is such a darling of the intellectual anti-Hollywood, Hollywood worshipping French New Wave, everyone looks the other way. In fact, the movie, its history and reception then and now, is a contradictory affair. It begs for patience, and yet it sucks you in whether you like it or not. There is a Bonnie and Clyde kind of outlaw aspect to it all, and an identification with the counter-culture, anti-hero aspects above all. It lurches and has awkward cuts, sometimes on purpose, and yet it seems so utterly intentional and forceful anyway, you have to pay attention.The low-budget, homemade look to the movie is off-putting to many viewers, except those looking for an answer to the slickness of Hollywood. And that's exactly what this is. In a way, while other French New Wave films were bowing to the great 1940s and 50s masterpieces, this one pushes its raw edges far enough to announce its independence from that influence, and hence it has something of a legendary status. But to really watch it is to see that it's close to the art films of the time, like the short \"Pull My Daisy,\" filled with joyful, youthful indifference to polish and tradition. You are to ignore the flaws. In fact, flaws, like the drips on an Ab-Ex painting or the squawks of a sax, are part of the effect, necessary.There are wonderful cinematic moments, some filming in classic (if improvised) beauty (elevator scenes, a pan from one bathroom door to another, driving at night in a convertible, the two leads under the sheets in the apartment). It has a simple jazz score, the camera-work is hand-held and the sound dubbed in later (quite obviously), and the plot is actually a bit improbable, despite the realism enforced technically. There are layers of meaning, sitting in a theater and hearing the dialog there, or echoing themes of love and meaning in the interview where it is least likely, but you don't mind (or aren't supposed to mind) in what is so overtly a work of art.That is the huge point, in the end. This isn't a Hollywood \"product\" in any sense, but a private \"auteur\" effort that happened to succeed financially. This attests to both the innate feeling the film creates in a viewer, and the cultural need out there for something genuine in the theater. By 1960, traditional Hollywood seemed to many, even for films made in 1959 (or especially those, just look at a list of them), dull and out of touch. Here was a real alternative.I found it alternately frustrating and magical. Take your pick, but don't miss it. The last few minutes are as transcendent and affected as almost anything in film.",

Such masterpieces live up to the hype and time, even though they're not as technically impressive as they were 40 years ago, and they're still powerful thanks to what great films consist of: passion.

Godard was truly a visionary and an incredibly talented, passionate \"auteur\".\"Breathless\" plot is rather simple: Michel Poiccard/Laszlo Kovacs (Jean-Paul Belmondo), our anti-hero, is a young criminal on the run from the police, after stealing a car and killing a cop. He has an affair with a beautiful young American, Patricia (Jean Seberg), an aspiring journalist who sells the New York Herald Tribune in the middle of the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es (her first scene here was paid a tribute by Eva Green in Bertolucci's \"The Dreamers\"), and is also expecting Michel's baby. Patricia helps Michel to dodge the police, while they steal cars together in order to raise money for a trip to Rome. But when you want to \"vivre dangereusement jusqu'au bout\" - or, live dangerously till the end, things may end up not so well.When you see Belmondo touching his lips, trying to imitate Humphrey Bogart's trade mark, Seberg walking on the \u00c9lys\u00e9es as lovely as a girl can be, the unforgettable final moments...you don't worry about theories on why this is a classic. \"\u00c0 Bout de Souffl\u00e9\" is Cinema.",

Still,the movie is not an anecdote,but has many features of,as I said,an \"aesthetic ideal\" of life. Belmondo and Jean Seberg are tackling a form of sadism that will finally crack one of them. He is a disabused bum,but she is a false ing\u00e9nue,an irresponsible girl inebriated with \"dangerously living\",the substance of all nihilism.Belmondo has already rolled the dices;he is a murderer,a deranged outlaw. Jean Seberg's amorality is also turning into hideousness,so that the two fail side by side.\"A bout ...\" proves that,even if he was not a great director,Godard was an intelligent,inventive and playful one. After all,this is a movie about cinema,not about life.Its freshness and freedom make it one of the most sympathetic French shows.It is so funny and unconventional,so nuanced and intelligent,so veined and powerful,so robust and enjoyable.The youngish Belmondo is an apotheosis of the cool,and here really at his most cool,and with a easiness that belongs to the most endowed only;his most cool,not in spoofing the American look,but in his exploits and getting out of ruck.\"Poiccard\" is the bum himself,the quintessence of the rogue.A word about \"\u00c0 bout De Souffl\u00e9\"'s remake:the Gere film (Breathless (1983),directed by Jim McBride) is made within a very different set of parameters,an low-brow adventure movie,and practically unrelated to Godard's movie;it offers perhaps Gere's best role,and it is a very good movie.",

After having seen \"The 400 Blows,\" \"The Woman Next Door\" (I believe is the translation) and \"Tirez sur le Pianiste\" I have to say that Truffaut's films are more interesting (in general). There's no doubt Godard was a huge influence with the French New Wave that stormed America in the '60s but as one other reviewer notes, it's an acquired taste. Personally I feel some of the '60s French cinema is just a bit too cold and experimental to really find fascinating -- one of the reasons Truffaut's films work so well is that they find a good human balance to rely on. (Tirez sur le Pianiste - Shoot the Pianist - is a brilliant satire of '30s/'40s/'50s gangster movies with interesting characters.)\"A bout de souffl\u00e9\" (a.k.a. \"Breathless\") is an essential film to view if you are a film buff and French cinema enthusiasts will adore it, however I can't help but think of it as a piece of history rather than a motion picture that has stood the test of time. I'm tempted to say it's just not entertaining enough although that might sound dense.In short it just doesn't hold up as well to some of the \"killers on the run\"-style stories that have been made recently (and no, I was not a fan of \"True Romance\").Still, some good performances and its famous stature in film history guarantees this is a \"must-see,\" even if you feel a bit disappointed after seeing it.",

Whether it was his intention or not isn't the point, the point is this; he did. Jean-Luc Godard, and Francois Truffuat are the undisputed fathers of the French New Wave. Some cinephiles or historians may feel like pointing elsewhere, to Jean Renoir for example, protesting that he is truly the father of the French New Wave, I disagree entirely. The French New Wave was a product of the kindred spirits and talents of Godard and Truffaut. And no other film represents the French New Wave more coherently than Jean-Luc Godard's dazzling 1960 picture, 'Breathless'. Unorthodox and uninhibited. Raw and experimental. Godard broke every rule in the book, disavowed the laws of cinema, and scribed a new rule book, one where the pages are blank, and possibilities are endless. The story is so simple I can summarize the entire film in half of a sentence, but I refuse to give you or Godard the satisfaction. What counts in Breathless is not the story, but how the story is told. The very definition of 'cool', the film is robust in creativity, and exuberant in its flaws, and passionate about its reckless behavior. Self aware and rebellious. If there was no breathless, there would have been no Tarantino, if there was no French New Wave, the streak of genius that ran through the nineties and 2000s wouldn't have existed. Before Breathless, it was believed that films took money, that you had to find yourself in a place of authority to make a film. Breathless broke this misconception. Breathless makes you want to run outside and make the film of your life. Breathless made that possible, Breathless made the amateur the auteur, Breathless reinvented the face of the cinema, and made you believe that could too. All you need is a girl and gun.",

With the story of a man on the run calling himself Laszlo Kovacs (a cinematographer of the time), Jean-Luc Godard arrived in the movies (well, on the production end, at least). This also more than his typical film essay. The story by Francois Truffaut makes for a terrific Godard script (the Truffaut stamp makes it comparable to SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER). Jean-Paul Belmondo does well in the Kovacs role, humanizing our bad-guy hero right up to the slam-bang finish. Jean Seberg is his conflicted lover who must... well, just watch. A landmark of the French New Wave, which is one of the most important movements in cinema. Vastly superior to the 1983 BREATHLESS with Richard Geer and Fassinder's homage THE AMERICAN SOLDIER. This is guaranteed to be like few movies you've seen before (unless, of course, you're a fan of the New Wave). BREATHLESS is also very memorable for its music and unusual photography.

So we see some physically stunning actors acting in a very counterculture manner, and are treated to the viewing a real film accomplishment - successfully delivering a product with \"Risk\" written all over it.How anyone cannot accept that this was and is a film classic is beyond me. Great film is separated from the not so great and the poor by a few factors.  They might be handsome stars, great lines, over the top \"special moments\" - how many Caddies and TBirds were in Paris in 1960 - small touches like Belmondo's use of a cigarette like Bogart could not have matched or nice musical touches or the neat use of the camera or two people idly chatting in bed as young people do about nothing and everything.

The End.\" Black Adder, quite rightly, deems it \"completely and utterly awful.\"  Now imagine if the intellectuals of the day heralded Baldrick's manuscript as one of the best novels ever written, and it appeared constantly on critics' All-Time-Top-Ten lists.  This is very close to the situation that has actually occurred with Breathless.  It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and I'm a regular viewer of MST3K), and it is lauded by critics and famous film makers alike as a true masterpiece, up there with Citizen Kane, The Searchers, and Modern Times.

Godard, like the rest of his colleagues wanted to transform the way movies were seen. In fact, most of the directors of the New Wave movement felt that style and presentation were more important than the traditional narrative that was widely used up to that point.Godard, brought the camera into the streets of Paris, something that was imitated by everyone. His characters are secondary to the mood he created. The story, with its many detours of the main idea, shows more of the atmosphere Mr. Godard created around the characters of Michel and Patricia. It's hard to imagine the attraction of the young American for this tough guy, but maybe because of the aura he projects, attracted her to what might be perceived as a dangerous involvement.Michel Poiccard is a petty criminal with a long history of wrong doing. For him Patricia represents a fruit he hasn't tasted and once he has a bite out of it, he is hooked. When Patricia tells him she suspects she is pregnant, he takes the news with apparent surprise, even though it appears he is the only man in her life. Deep down, the cool Michel is a desperate man. Michel seems to be impressed by the American movie stars of the times, especially Humphrey Bogart, whose picture he examines on one of the movie houses where he passes. In spite of his coolness, Michel knows his good luck could end at any given moment. That is why he clings to Patricia because he feels secure with her.\"Breathless\" was filmed in the streets of Paris. Raoul Coutard, the cinematographer, used a hand held camera for most shots. The film was shot in daylight, as Godard detested lighting what he was going to shoot thus making everything look natural and unprepared. The jazzy score is by Martial Solal.Jean-Paul Belmondo was not a handsome man by movie star standards, and yet, he has such a presence that he is hard to dismiss as the most important element that holds the film together. Jean Seberg, on the other hand, cast a youthful and wholesome aura on her Patricia that she appears to be the right actress for playing the part. Other uncredited cameos include the director, himself, Philippe DeBroca, and Jean-Pierre Melville, among others.\"Breathless\" influence can be traced to a score of other movies that came behind it.

            "content": "\"\u00c0 bout de souffle\" or \"Breathless\" (much more compact title) is a French mostly French-language movie from 1960, so this one is almost 60 years old now and it is a collaboration between two French all-time-great filmmakers. That would be director Jean-Luc Godard and writer Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and for both it is probably among their more, maybe even most, known career efforts now way over half a century later. This also has to do with the two protagonists. Jean-Paul Belmondo is definitely among France's most famous actors, maybe ever, and he is in his mid-80s now and Jean Seberg is also above-average famous for a European actress from many decades ago, which certainly may have to do with her stunning looks, but also her tragic untimely death. Anyway, this one here is a black-and-white movie which is not a given for 1960, but not unusual either. And at pretty much exactly 90 minutes, it is a fairly short film. The names Godard and also Truffaut are of course inevitably linked to old black-and-white (short) films, so the creation of this one here is not too much of a surprise. I just wish I could have liked it more than I eventually did. Belmondo did really little for me, which may have to do with how unlikable his character is, but really I also did not find him particularly interesting honestly. And also not very relevant as he does not stand symbolic for a certain part of society or for a certain time as far as I am concerned. Seberg feels more like a supporting character who could be gone quickly again as the film progresses, but no she is there to stay, which becomes inevitably clear during the really long sequence in the middle part of the film that does not take place outside for once. As all over the place as the film is when it comes to editing and jumping from one location to the next, there is a bit of a clean structure before and after this long sequence inside that I just mentioned. First we have the protagonist commit his crime, then head for Paris and this is where Seberg kicks in and afterwards the two are split again occasionally, even if what finally results in the end of the movie and the protagonist is inevitably linked again to her. The dialogues are sometimes not bad, sometimes pretentious. Like what was up with the grumpy police officer, he was strange when talking to Seberg's character and it wasn't the actor's fault at all. A bit underwhelmed by Truffaut here. What else? Oh yeah, in general the dialogues weren't the film's greatest fortitude I'd say. At times, they are quick and witty, but taking a closer look at them I did not really feel as if this is how people actually talk. Still obviously, unless French is your mother tongue you may probably need subtitles for this one as they are essential to everything, especially understanding the weird relationship between the two central characters. I think it's only fair to see Seberg's as such too because without her the story would have been completely different and he probably never would have even come to Paris. Who knows, even if obviously she is not as much in the center of it all as Belmondo's. Finally, one more reason why I did not enjoy the watch here too much and give it a negative recommendation all in all. This would be the crime genre. As in terms of the crimes depicted on screen and the police work this film never had me in awe at the edge of my seat and this is especially disappointing because otherwise I quite like, even love the genre. However, it could not win me over from that perspective. The acting, with the exception of Seberg occasionally, also felt underwhelming all in all. You should watch something else instead. I give this one a thumbs-down and I'm happy it ran for not even 100 minutes. I'll probably never watch it again. I like (old) French films most of the time, not on this occasion.",

Mostly foreign films, along the lines of something like Amelie, or something from the ilk of Pedro Almodovar or Wong Kar Wai, and one of the more common films often given the top honor on such pretentious lists is the French New Wave classic, Jean Luc Godard's Breathless.This film is often given a great deal of credit for its \"innovative\" use of the jump cut, inspiring the likes of Martin Scorsese in the next generation of filmmakers. Whether the film is \"innovative\" or not, it's sad to say that the story is nothing special.The film is a gangster movie, clearly drawing inspiration from Hollywood's own film noirs. A gangster is being pursued by the police for murdering a cop and he must get out of Paris, but before he leaves he tries to convince an American newspaper saleswoman to join him as he flees to Italy. Ultimately, the story falls flat, never having any emotional connection and is a lot of the times being edgy simply to be, not because the edginess was needed to make the film more intriguing.As can be gathered, I'm not the biggest fan of this film. The story never really intrigued me all that much, and at many times there were these long scenes of dialogue that ultimately built character, but had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and I was just sitting there looking at the time on my phone wondering when the film would move on to something more intriguing.As for all of the \"innovative\" aspects of the film, such as the bazillion jump cuts and whatnot within, yes, the film did manage to inspire countless other filmmakers with its way of telling story in such a jumpy way, but in a great many ways, I believe that those weren't originally intended. While it ended up working in Godard's favor, you look, this was his first film he'd ever directed, whether it be feature length or a short. I mean, honestly there must have been mistakes (I had five million in the first film I ever made, and that is why it still has never seen the light of day), so perhaps what most consider to be the most brilliant aspect of Breathless in actuality was perhaps just a happy mistake, but then again the only person who knows the truth is Godard, and he's not telling.At the end of the day, Breathless is not the best presentation of the French New Wave, you want that watch The 400 Blows. While Breathless is often cited as a classic, I believe it is merely a classic because it inspired countless filmmakers and that the film itself is not a really fantastic film. But then again, perhaps I'm just not pretentious enough to enjoy it? I don't know.I give Breathless a 4 out of 10!",

This truly visceral rush of a movie goes unmistakably on one of those fingers you'd count on one hand in the last group. Godard committed the film to the cut-rate gangster B pictures that this somewhat satirical urban drama was bringing into play and completely aping. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Michel, a petty thief who kills a highway cop. Although in retreat to Rome, he stops in Paris and hooks up with his sometime girlfriend Patricia, a sexy American tomboy whose glamour is her detached flightiness. As they talk, make love and unenthusiastically evade the police, Godard reveals them to be the sort of young people that the movies had never before portrayed, bustling in the here and now, unmindful of traditional ethics, desperate to affect views and approaches to life like a fashion style. Theirs is an inborn existentialism, and Godard's leading actors make it just about hopelessly relatable.Lean and physical, Belmondo became an international star by seizing Michel's disarming fusion of weakness and bandit bluster. Godard at one time had the same enthusiasm, but he's not over-romantic about it. As played by Jean Seberg, Patricia is a star-spangled cat, a memorable intermingling of idol and priss, a fitting image for the next generation's possibilities and duplicity. Truffaut wrote the basic plot line and hardly gets sufficient recognition for its neat, sly effortlessness.But what makes this 87-minute generation-maker ground-breaking comes not from dense cerebral matters but from Godard's off-hand impulsiveness, a carefree attitude of winging it that cheerfully foils what's exhausted in previous movies. While Godard knew that fugitive outlaw flicks could no longer be played square, he knew that the dominant notions of qualified craftsmanship, formal visual compositions, basic editing, had become a confinement, a manner of blinding us to the possibilities of capturing the world. Cinema was the slave children in the Temple of Doom, and Godard was Indiana Jones. Truffaut was Short Round, at heart at least.The movie's most outrageous practice at the time is its abundant use of jump cuts, a consciously raucous cutting technique that Godard uses to induce urban life's dashing, shuddering pulse. Georges Melies is credited as the minister of the jump cut on account of having done it accidentally, only then using it as sleight-of-hand. This, I think, could be why Godard would use such a technique, because it feels and seems so purely accidental that it gives the work that blunt boost of candidness. Captivated by the modern city as it's truly lived in, he hurls Raoul Coutard's inimitable camera through dumpy, practically closet-size apartments and swarming streets, engulfing us in the disorderly spin of a modern world where everything ultimately rear-ends: Michel and Patricia's pseudo-melodrama bursts into a presidential procession on the Champs Elysees, and movie posters toss out an sardonic interpretation of the romance-famished souls of those passing them by.No other director had ever before harmonized Godard's sense of the indefinable grain of the modern, particularly his incisive recognition that many of our key experiences now came through the media. While this is unmistakably the situation with Patricia, who interviews novelists, cites from Faulkner and even vends the New York Herald Tribune, it's more critically true of Michel, whose code of honor comes directly from B-movies. There may be no more revealing moment in any '60s movie than Michel gazing at a picture of Humphrey Bogart and insecurely running his thumb across his lips just like Bogey, or how contagious this gesture becomes. Even outside of the film, shortly after it initially emerged, not only were millions imitating Belmondo's own gestures but filmmakers started to emulate Godard. His tracks are noticed in everything from Bonnie and Clyde to Scorsese and Coppola to today's somewhat deluded music videos and TV commercials.After this witty, deadpan milestone, Godard created a stream of movies that may be the greatest epoch of uninterrupted deconstructive innovation in movie history, whether I like them all or not. Nonetheless, the knack of this rhythmic, affecting masterwork seizes the cadences and mercilessness of city life, the trouble-free corruption of youthful impulsiveness, the despondent blind alley of male-female dealings, the fated idealism of those raised on old movies. Arguably the most mutinous of innovative films, Breathless is also the most crisp.",

            "content": "My introduction to the work of the French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard happened a little more than two years ago when I bought and saw the Criterion DVD (the very first Criterion DVD that I bought) of his Bande \u00e0 part (aka: Band of Outsiders). I was immensely excited and Godard didn't disappoint me, of course I was ready to see more of his films. Until this year the only Godard film available on R4 DVD was, if I'm not wrong, one of his most recent ones (the 2004 Notre musique)...the fact that I saw my second Godard film (certainly it was his Breathless) just 4 nights ago has to deal in a way with how hard and how expensive is to get your DVDs of Godard's films in my city. Just in a way because I do own Notre musique since well at least a year ago and well of course you can always go after the illegal copies or have some luck and find some Godard to rent at a Blockbuster! But anyway, about a month ago I realized about the fact that finally a R4 DVD Godard collection is available, I was very glad and for a decent price I was able to get first Made in U.S.A. and later Alphaville. However before I had the time to watch those two films I stop by at my local Blockbuster only to find that they were selling real gems, used yet practically new R1 DVDs that you usually find for about $30 in just $3 and $5. I bought that day Wim Wenders'The American Friend (the Anchor Bay DVD), Takashi Miike's The Bird People in China, Nagisa Oshima's Ai no borei (which I also own together with other three films, including Ai no corrida, as part of a VHS collection of erotic films) and Godard's Breathless (not the Criterion but the Fox Lorber DVD). Breathless goes extremely fast and begins with the main character, Jean-Paul Belmondo's character Michel, doing what he does: doing crimes. We see him stealing a car and soon after killing a cop. During these first minutes of the film you get the feeling of it, the music is fantastic. Soon Michel is in Paris and in a way the whole crime film is forgotten, I say in a way because of course for us is present that Michel is seeking for money and that the police is after him but as the film goes on and with Jean Seberg's character Patricia already in the film we go in a completely different way. I loved how the film forgets about everything and just gets talky with its two main characters...that whole section that happens in Patricia's apartment is a sort of perfect example to point out why I loved Breathless: we have a conversation pretty much about nothing yet we don't really care, we are following closely the characters, their dialog flows and we don't want to stop it. Other highlights are a great cameo of Jean-Pierre Melville as a writer (it's a really good scene...\"two things are important in life: for men, women, for women, money\"), the final decision of Patricia. And of course the performances of Belmondo and Seberg are extremely memorable, being Belmondo very cool as a fan of Humphrey Bogart (always smoking. in the film Blue in the Face, I have seen only bits of it, master Jim Jarmusch says that he thinks that a lot of people start smoking because is glamorized in movies and also that \"the f***** up thing is you go to Hollywood now, they got us hocked on cigarettes and now you can't smoke anywhere...they come over, I'm sorry Sir smoking is prohibited by law\"; Breathless is a film that can give any young man desires to light a cigarette) and Seberg extremely lovely as a beginner in the world of journalism. Few times 86 minutes went as fast as with Jean-Luc Godard's first feature film. 10 out of 10",

            "content": "Raymond Chandler once said of Alan Ladd (for whom he wrote the classic screenplay 'The Blue Dahlia') that Ladd was a small boy's idea of a tough guy. In the same way and paraphrasing Chandler to some extent Jean-Luc Godard is a young pseud's idea of a film director. As someone who loses no opportunity to slate this inept semi-amateur director I decided in the interests of fair play to take a look at the piece of cheese that made his name, 'Breathless', which was shown at the Cine Lumiere last week (in its wisdom or, more likely, as a prelude to its closing for a month as it does every August) the Cine Lumiere is hosting a Godard season this month and if the turnout for Breathless (about half a dozen deadbeats and most of them only sheltering from the rain) is anything to go by they have one eye on a tax break for next April. So, how does this klutz screw it up? Let me count the ways. It's no secret that French film makers have long been enamoured of American Directors and clearly Godard is no exception. He even dedicates this drek to Monogram Pictures - for the non-cognoscenti Monogram was a Poverty Row outfit where anything over 75 minutes was considered an epic but compared to Breathless the worst piece of crap ever put out by Monogram was Citizen Kane. In 1958 Welle's great 'Touch Of Evil' hit the stands and soon its opening tracking shot became a cause celebre and had the Gilbert Adair set creaming in their pants. Welles, of course, had a point for that famous tracking shot but, clearly having seen it, Godard couldn't resist tracking us to death. Belmondo walks down a street and we walk with him; he walks, and so do we, he keeps on walking, and so do we, he walks some more, and so do we. Where? Oh, well, now that you ask, nowhere, but don't you think it's kinda cute and all? THEN, wait for it, a masterstroke. Belmondo walks TOWARDS us, and we move backwards, he walks towards us some more, and we back away, he keeps on walking, and we keep backing away. Why? Search me, pal. There are probably less than fifty shots in the whole megillah. The reason he does this, of course, is simple. He can't cut. He doesn't know thing one about Editing, wouldn't know a pic-synch or a movieola if it bit him in the ass. So that when he DOES try a cut, it's a JUMP cut, does nothing but draw the attention to this Amateur Night farrago. More? You want MORE. Okay, there's more. What's the test of a good, not even GREAT, just good movie, book, play. It's this. The CHARACTERS seem REAL, the situations seem REAL, you have the feeling when you close the book, leave the theatre or the cinema that you're leaving REAL PEOPLE behind and that if you could somehow sneak back in at three in the morning you'd find those characters still there, still getting on with their lives. Try telling that to Godard, or fellow pseud Truffaut, so dismissive of REAL film makers, who had a hand in what is laffingly called the screenplay. There is not a SINGLE character from the first frame to the last in Breathless who we can care about, who we can BELIEVE. It's Fantasy Island, folks, in spades. If you're a disciple of the Marquis de Sade then run, don't walk to this merde.You'll love it. -10",

            "content": "Breathless is an over hyped French movie with some good dialogs and some good camera work. The plot is almost non-existent \u2013 a car thief kills a cop and then spends the rest of the film persuading the girl he loves to have sex with him and run away with him to Rome. Both have some cute and some rather irritating conversations It looked like the kind of film which pseudo intellectuals will discuss, just cause someone told him or her it is important. It could have been important considering it has some thousand jump cuts, poor synchronization of Audio and Visual, not to mention actions cut in the middle and scenes which start and stop out of nowhere.Godard makes basic syntactical errors with his film-making and accidentally (to my mind) discovers jump cuts and so the film becomes important. He sure is lucky!!Its like reading a book with wrong English and then saying how poetic. The problem with breathless is that even the mistakes committed by Godard do not actually make it easy to watch. Had that been the case we could have called it art but the bottom-line is that the mistakes look like they are mistakes and nothing more, It gave me a headache to watch this , why ?? because incessant editing do not a good movie make. Just because somebody did for the first time that too unintentionally does not an iconic movie make. I read somewhere on one of the posts in the boards that Godard did this to give the viewer a sense that it is a film and that he is there to change it I refuse to buy that theory. If that was the case almost every next scene wouldn't skip and jump and only some relevant scenes would have been jump cutted as per the shot setting. Art does not mean that you cut the scene before it ended and leave it a loose end. As a matter of fact it is a must watch for film school types as an example of how not to make mistakes of the basic rules of connecting shots while editing.Other stuff in the film is also not up to the mark. The action of the characters in the film seem rather whimsical and the end comes across as confused. The acting of some rather stylish actors appear rather sad thanks to the half cut scenes. The initial sounding befitting background music is used so much that you get bored of it by the end. After watching Breatheless. I realized that a good population of film freaks act on the power of suggestion rather than looking at how unreal a possibility is. To sum it in some two words. Over-Hyped. Pseudo Intellectual.

The main character is an absolutely boring, outrageously stupid sleazebag who couldn't display charisma if given a death threat. The editing is choppy and unrealistic, even by MTV standards, which is a comparison drawn by many \"obviously smarter and open-minded\" reviewers who drink vinaigrette by the barrel while delivering unrelenting praise to the latest Terence Malick endeavour. There was no soundtrack to speak of, at least none I could notice over the banal, uninteresting dialogue and slower than molasses narrative. The only half-decent thing in the flick was Jean Seberg, and even she was as enthusiastic as Valium can make you. Blech!

            "content": "I was filled with anxiety before beginning Breathless. As someone who is firmly entrenched in the Truffaut camp, #TruffautisLife after all, I was terrified that I would see what is often regarded as the director with whom Truffaut shared an open and intense parting of ways with and see the masterpiece I've always been told it was. Obviously, I know that appreciating a Godard film will do nothing to diminish my love for all things Truffaut, I'm just a loyalist and was worried how I'd feel enjoying a Godard film. Little did I know, I had nothing to worry about. I actively disliked Breathless, I may have even hated it. Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film was important, I suppose, to the burgeoning French New Wave. I'm sure to subject myself to more Godard films in the future as my journey through cinema goes on, but Breathless did not live up to its reputation, for me.This is where the plot would go if there was one. Just kidding, sort of, there are happenings in Breathless but it is clear that there were not many rehearsals with a script taking place. I've read that Godard was rewriting the script each day, removing nearly all of the influence of Truffaut, who had given the film's story to Godard. Godard would then feed the lines to the actors from offset resulting in very little familiarity between the words of the script and the actors speaking them. Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) a self-absorbed narcissistic sociopath, surely modeled after Jean-Luc Godard, steals a car then murders the police officer who chases after him. Needing a distraction and a place to hide out, Michel renews his relationship with Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg) an American in Paris studying journalism whom he met a few weeks prior. Despite their relationship being new and unestablished, Michel expects Patricia to accompany him on his getaway to Italy. Like a true narcissist, Michel is oblivious to the fact that his face is in all the papers and the police are closing in on him as he goes about his way collecting his money and planning his getaway. Focusing his attention on the American films that interest him and his American love interest, Michel ignores the fact that his very life is at stake.During the opening minutes of the film, Jean-Paul Belmondo breaks the fourth wall by looking at and speaking directly to the camera which is a device that almost always works for me. I thought that meant that I may be in for something good, but almost immediately after this scene ended, I nearly ran out of things to enjoy. The jump cuts were amazing and served the story well. I don't give Godard credit for inventing those cuts, as many do, however. An idol, Sergei Eisenstein used jump cuts in film--most memorably in depicting an explosion in The Battleship Potemkin. Georges Melies, whose work I have memorialized on my body also used jump cuts through most of his career in silent cinema. Despite the fact that Godard often gets credit for inventing the jump cut which he surely did not, I can't argue the fact that he used the technique effectively cementing certain aspects of The French New Wave. The music was phenomenal, so kudos to Godard for that. From his first film, however, one can see my biggest criticism of Godard. Godard has no problem excluding his audience. Just listening to Godard speak in interviews, it's clear to discern that he only expects the highest brow of intellectuals to enjoy his films. If an audience member doesn't fit into that category, he doesn't really care. He created terribly unlikeable characters engaging in a plot and a romance that no one could possibly care about, all the while carrying on pseudo-intellectual conversations grating on the last bit of patience I could muster. Obviously, Breathless works for almost everyone except me, but after seeing his debut feature, there's not much encouraging me to try more Godard films.",

            "content": "It really is an interesting film. It's certainly an exercise in style over substance, as the real 'meat' of the story is expressed through the camera work and the images. The narrative itself is pretty much second to the visual aspect. That's not to say there isn't a solid story, because there is, but the film's not about that at all. If one were to ignore all the technical and artistic aspects and just focus on the plot and characters, they probably wouldn't like it very much. The story is meandering and doesn't seem to fit all together; the characters are mostly unlikeable; the ending is certainly weak. Yet I loved the film.At once both a homage to and a mockery of film-noir, the film requires of its audience a certain cinematic knowledge. For instance, Michel's idolization of Bogart would be lost on someone completely unfamiliar with Bogart or his films. The exaggerated quirks (such as the lip rubbing) that the actor Belmondo adds to his character may seem irrelevant or annoying to an ignorant viewer, but it is essential to the film. The genre conventions are there, but twisted and revised and updated; everything from the femme fatale to the dark ending is intact. The jazzy score only adds to this feeling. For a lover of film-noir, this is a must-see.When it comes to the direction of a film, this is as good as it gets. Godard's famous use of jump cuts is perfectly utilized, energizing scenes that would otherwise be static. The alternation between quick, flashy editing and steady long takes is effective at reflecting the main character's actions and nature. There are no boring scenes in this film, as one can just admire the camera work when the dialogue becomes meaningless. And there are many instances when the dialogue does nothing to further the story, but the direction makes up for that.As a newcomer to the French New Wave, I have no idea what the majority of films in this movement are like. If they are half as stylish, innovative, energetic, goofy, and wild as this film, I'm sure I will enjoy them all. As it stands now, this is a terrific piece of art film and a landmark in post-modern cinema.",

This is just a very amateurish first attempt at filmmaking for Goddard.That Jean-Paul Belmondo's character would murder a cop and then stick around Paris to get nabbed is unreal. Not even a DUMB criminal is DUMB enough to do that, especially since this guy has the means to flee the country and he is portrayed as a career criminal type with street savvy.Jean Seberg's character is portrayed as an upscale, educated aspiring American journalist who is trying to make it in Paris, yet hooks up with an obvious low life like Jean-Paul's character? SORRY, but I just don't buy it. That she sticks around with Jean-Paul's character even after discovering his criminal nature is even more unbelievable.OK, Jean's character finally smartens up at the end and turns in Jean-Paul's character to the cops. But then what does she do? She goes back to this low life thug and tells him what she did !!!! Either this gal has a latent suicidal wish or she is unbelievably STUPID. Why would any rational person go back to tell a fugitive on the run from a cop killer charge that she just ratted him out? Especially, since it puts her alone in in an apartment with this guy. UNREAL !!!! Then there's the final scene where jean's character is running down the street toward Jean-Paul's character's bullet riddled body is lying face down in the street. I mean, she actually still cares for this cold blooded cop killer even after he's righteously dead? GIVE ME A BREAK !!!! This film is just a love story from outer space, in my opinion. This film isn't about romance, it's about two DUMB people, just acting DUMB.I mean I've seen a number of Absurdist / Avant Garde films that I thought were great because the unreal / absurd elements in the film had some sort of symbolic or interpretive meaning in the context of the whole film. Breathless, however, is a film with a basically unbelievable, not well thought out storyline that just has no symbolic or interpretive meaning at all, at least for me.Although Goddard went on to make many great films, his initial effort here was a BIG FLOP as far as I'm concerned and the acclaim that Breathless got in its time was due to Goddard's already gotten fame as a film critic for a very influential Parisian film review and nothing more. That's the only sense that I can make of why such a MEDIOCRE film would get such high ratings.{{{This review is also posted at \"Forum For Film Reviews And Discussions\" at groups.google.com.}}",

            "content": "Hailed among the films that started the French New Wave, Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\" is a choppy, anarchic film as commanding as it is carefree. A riff on the American crime/gangster films of the two decades that preceded it, \"Breathless\" has aspects of both imitation and transcendence, but mostly a liberated spirit that no doubt constituted a change in French filmmaking.Embodying that spirit is star Jean-Paul Belmondo as car thief Michel Poiccard, a man who lives by the whim of his desire, even when it means grinding his ever-thrumming internal engine to a halt for the sake of a woman, specifically Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American in Paris hawking newspapers as she aspires to be a journalist. Although Belmondo's performance sets the tone and guides the film (as does Michel's shooting of a police officer, inciting the action), in so many ways it revolves around Seberg's driven, liberated feminine energy.Godard's use of jump cuts (a film technique born out of a need to cut down the runtime while avoiding chopping entire scenes) suggests he's something of a rebel filmmaker, but there are lengthy takes too as time seems to stop in Patricia's apartment as they each feel out how they feel about each other. Michel's relentless libido seems to dominate this section in a rather distracting way, but operating in minimal space, Godard shows his sure-handedness and awareness of the classic cinematic techniques that surely inspired him.With the exception of when Belmondo and Seberg share screen time, the storytelling isn't nearly as compelling as the energy and style of the film. The way that the romance and the crime story cross paths in the end turns out to be a saving grace of the narrative and make a good case for the film as an intellectual accomplishment, but if the film is indeed a triumph, it's because of the visuals, the pacing, the repetition of the jazz piano score culminating in a wholly unique cinematic experience.Above all else, \"Breathless\" embodies this feverish, burning passion of cinema as art form, evident purely in its playfulness and recklessness. It stands today as a window into a laboratory of new filmmaking ideas; Godard tried to balance the classic mise en scene with a new approach to stitching scenes together, all while staying relevant to the culture and philosophy of its era. Perhaps this is how all great cinematic turning points are made; a true cinefile in his or her day borrows from his or her inspiration while striving to tell a familiar story in a way that may push boundaries, but will certainly speak more to emerging tastes and attitudes.Without historical context, \"Breathless\" is no masterpiece identified as powerfully influential, but in this case, context is nearly everything.",

Here you can almost hear him perpetually yelling at behind the camera, well life is boring but not when you rev it up with a Mitchell at 24 frames a second. That said, I am grateful to something like Breathless. There has still been no movie quite like it. Its innocence is really astonishing. Not sure if anyone here ever mentioned (while allowing for the tremendous influence of the film) if Bonnie and Clyde would ever have remotely looked or sounded like it did without this precursor. And Bonnie and Clyde is another movie that I am extremely ambivalent about, another guilty pleasure, feeling both movies fall very short of greatness. But both really are a lot of fun.If any part of Breathless bothers me more than the rest it is the last, the scene where Patricia starts practically yodeling to herself about why she turned Michel in. And then almost everything after that. Here Godard tries to finally give reasons for these lunkheads actions and betrays the film. Still.Right.Glad he made the thing. Just don't get too involved in the philosophy which is ridiculous, mostly. Very great look at Paris though. And maybe the best home movie ever made.",

The story was simple and what I didn't like was the editing pattern. The story revolves around a man who has just killed a Policeman and is on the run. The story is sometimes confusing, too obvious and a little amazing behavior is shown in the characters at other times. The man wants to take the girl with him to someplace quiet. Whether he loved her genuinely or not is still unclear to me.PROS: The starting scenes and the acting of the lead member were good.CONS: The film fails in giving a nice story which would have otherwise hidden the unusual editing. For the entire film I was confused about what they wanted to convey.Verdict: \"Watch for experiments in filmmaking.\"",

            "content": "An important milestone for the popularization of the New Wave, Godard's first film is his best. Roger Ebert said that the revolutionary feature formed an entire generation of filmmakers based on the proposed jump cuts and script twist. Jean-Paul Belmondo gives life to Michel Poiccard, a criminal , kinda rightist anarchist who does not think much of his actions. After stealing a car and killing a police officer, he rushes off to take refuge in Patricia Franchini's (Jean Seberg) house, who takes time to realize the problems his beloved is in. The sporadic use of intertitles and some breaks of the fourth wall convention mark the style that would be perfected in the following films, Vivre Sa Vie, Weekend, Contempt, Alphaville, Pierrot le fou. The script for this movie was very curiously written out of improvisation: Godard, based on a Truffaut idea, wrote the scenes while he had breakfast and then passed them on to his actors only at the time of filming. The result was excellent, as the protagonists improvised a lot and gave the story a lot of authenticity. The result surprised actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, who at first considered that he improvised so much that the film would never be released with those scenes. The technique of jump cuts was for the first time used here. But in the final edition Godard noted that his film was not \"aesthetically appealing\" as some scenes were too slow. He then decided to cut the fragments that should not be needed for the final understanding of the story , and bet on a good reception from the public, which indeed happened.",

            "content": "I can see how one can be bored and irritated by Breathless. Do we accept that young people can be pretentious or that they try to be cool or struggle with love in superficial ways, I think it all boils down to this. If not, Breathless is a film to hate.This was like a monk's vow to me, never to see a Godard film. I knew I would eventually (or rather had to, because I want to be able to criticize my dislikes) but I wasn't keen on it. It wasn't the New Wave that bothered me (the Nuberu Bagu I adore) but Godard himself, everything I read by or about him annoyed me, \"intellectually counterfeit money\" in Herzog's words, radicalism that advertises itself as a fashion item, and none of the films sounded interesting. Probably very appropriate for the film I saw, I saw it because of the most superficial reason imaginable. My girlfriend wants to cut her hair short and the image of Jean Seberg walking down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es immediately came to mind, I showed her pictures and she practically made me watch it with her. Women! So, Breathless.. I lament the fact that it has been selected to be a film school movie for 18 year olds to begin to learn something about important cinema, it's a film that has 20k votes when it should have a quarter of that. Naturally this visibility attracts viewers who have little business watching this kind of film in the first place and a lot of the criticism I read about it is terribly short-sighted and reactionary. It's easy to react to Breathless but I decided I wouldn't play into it, even a film by my nemesis deserves better.First thing I noticed and prepared myself to dislike is that Breathless doesn't feel important things, it says them. It's a film of outward appearances. But Belmondo doesn't just look into a photo of Humphrey Bogart, he looks into a mirror and hopes to see a reflection of himself, and Jean Seberg doesn't just look like Rita Hayworth in The Lady from Shangai, she behaves like a movie star, they both do and the movie behaves like a movie. This not just the skewed reflection of a Monogram potboiler, it's the image that wants to look into the mirror of Hollywood but not see the reflection. It wants another one for itself, Godard creates this. What perfunctory gangster plot there is to the film is a meaningless boyhood fantasy.This is okay for me but there were films aware of themselves before Breathless just like there was New Wave before Godard. What intrigues me here is the breach with visual narrative, how the Eiffel tower is not established, it's seen passingly through the glass of a moving car. And more, that the film seems to gradually become aware that a certain kind of story is being played out in it and begins to spot the anomaly. Flashing signs in the street tell us that Michel Poiccard's arrest is imminent and the protagonists read about it from the newspaper. It's like the movie is pointing out to itself the presence of story while it's preoccupied with something entirely different.But I'm not sure the film is even about that, if Godard is aware of the meta-narrative. As some of the myopic criticism of the film I read points out, Breathless is silly, pretentious, about nothing. A couple of instances of dialogue made me groan, but what I take from it is that Breathless is a youth film that does not address youth after the fact, it's made by them, in their image. Michel and Patricia are silly because they're young, they pretend, rebel or conform, make sweeping judgements on love and death, they make faces or look under skirts, and whether Godard means it or not, he expresses himself as a young artist. There's pretension in that but it's the time to be pretentious. I'm still wary of how Godard would go on to grow up or whether he styled himself in that image and refused to, but this wasn't as bad I feared. As for hope, I didn't have any for it, so I'm not sorry I saw it.",

There are parts where it becomes difficult to sit through as the conversation becomes longish or pointless but if you've watched a few films by Goddard you get used to getting bored in parts. The whole movie is a police-convict chase and nothing much happens through out the movie. There are just interesting dialogs and a good narration. Psychology of a criminal and his girlfriend is portrayed effectively by Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg The most notable aspect of this film is the detailing of each and every scene. The outside traffic noise inside an apartment, lights of moving object filtering in through windows, police chase etc looks real and interesting. 'Breathless' is also one of the initial 'New Wave' films which started the whole MTV style i.e. jump cuts, fractured sound thing. It's so weird that when you look at it you wonder what's great about the film as these things are now done by amateur film makers. It's like listening to Chuck Berry and wondering why is he is respect over Keith Richards. The reason is simple- improvisation is easier than invention for example Thakur's family massacre scene in 'Sholay' or Suneel Dutts helicopter chase scene in 'Shaan' are better than their original scenes from 'Once upon a time in the west' and 'North by Northwest' respectively because it's easier to reproduce a finished product with extra ingredients but creating a product from the scratch is difficult. 'Breathless' is an invention and will remain in the history of cinema as a path breaking invention. A must watch for a person who loves cinema as an art.",

You can say all you want about director Jean-Luc Godard's New Wave breakthrough that occurred with this film, but today, watching it is an exercise in extreme patience if not outright futility.

I can only marvel.I would have spent more time on this review if I had the initiative, but after reading the comments posted by 'Lechuguilla', (on the IMDb main page for this film as I write this), I would direct you to those observations because they pretty much echo my own feelings about the picture. I know, it's a cheap way out, but Godard just wore on me.

A few years later, Godard shot in 1959 \"\u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9\", a motion picture that had a strong impact on me: I did not know what was going on, with so many new elements before my eyes, like the jump cuts during a car ride, the long sequence with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg in a hotel room, or the last tracking shot when Belmondo is running for his life and Seberg acquires his gestures. Now I know that it was a groundbreaking film, that Godard was revolutionizing the art of editing, but for me it was an introduction to a Brechtian approach in narrating events.

            "content": "Jean-Luc Godard is one of the French New Wave directors who, as critics in the 1950s, had been regular contributors to the influential publication \"Cahiers Du Cinema\". As a group, they were disenchanted with the output of the French film industry at that time and believed that by putting the director at the centre of the creative process and dispensing with traditional narrative conventions, a far more imaginative style of filmmaking could be achieved. In his first film, Godard sought to achieve this by a variety of means which included, borrowing from some earlier cinematic styles that he admired.In \"Breathless\" (\"A Bout De Souffl\u00e9\"), a simple film noir plot is presented in a style that owes much to the influence of the Italian Neo-Realists (e.g. filming on location, use of hand-held cameras and improvised dialogue). Additionally, by using unorthodox techniques such as \"jump cuts\" and getting characters to look directly into the camera and then injecting the action with great pace, the result is a movie that looks vibrant, spontaneous and highly energetic.At the time of its release, few could have imagined the impact that \"Breathless\" would have on filmmaking in general or the profound influence it would subsequently have on numerous directors such as John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is a small-time criminal who after stealing a car in Marseilles and killing a motorcycle cop, makes his way to Paris to collect some money that he's owed and reunite with one of his girlfriends called Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg). Patricia's an American student who has aspirations to become a journalist and earns some money by selling the \"New York Herald-Tribune\" on the Champs Elysees. Michel wants to escape to Italy as soon as he can collect his money and wants Patricia to go with him but she tells him that she can't leave Paris for financial reasons.Michel spends his time in Paris sharing Patricia's hotel room and the couple talk a great deal about life and love whilst Michel also tries relentlessly to seduce her. Despite the seriousness of his crimes, Michel seems very unconcerned about the situation he's in and if he does feel desperate, certainly hides it well beneath a fa\u00e7ade of being super-cool. He's totally amoral and an inveterate thief but is also very preoccupied with trying to emulate the mannerisms of his hero, Humphrey Bogart.Patricia is a cold character who's fascinated by Michel's lifestyle but always remains emotionally detached even when they seem to be at their closest. Things get increasingly complicated for Michel as the police manhunt intensifies but eventually matters are brought to a head by a simple action that's incredibly casual, uncaring and self-serving.French New Wave directors Francois Truffaut, Claude Chabrol and Jean-Pierre Melville all contributed in different ways to the making of this movie and Alain Resnais' \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" (1959) is just one of a whole collection of other films and filmmakers that are referenced. Amusingly, Michel's alias in the movie is Laszlo Kovacs and he also uses some of Humphrey Bogart's photos outside a cinema that's showing \"The Harder They Fall\" (1956) to perfect his attempt to look and act as much like Bogey as possible.In retrospect, it's no exaggeration to describe \"Breathless\" as a masterpiece because its exhilarating combination of originality, freshness and sheer enthusiasm was genuinely revolutionary when it was made and it became an incredibly rich source of inspiration to other filmmakers in the years that followed.",

            "content": "My Belmondo cure this week concludes with 'A bout de souffle', Godard's 1960 film, a film I love so much that I unhesitatingly gave it a very rare 10/10 on IMDB. Why do I really like this movie? In my opinion, it is the essence of everything that brought the New French Wave good in the history of the film. The joy of exploring and discovering new ways of cinematic expression. The skill of doing it in a way that serves the audience and doesn't seem dry and theoretical, although director Godard and screenwriter Truffaut were both experts of film culture. The vibration of a love story as Truffaut knew how to write so well, supported by a perfect selection of the actors who combine youth and talent. Reverence for American cinema and assimilation of what the directors of the 'wave' loved in it. Fantastic soundtrack (original music by Martial Solal, but also free jazz and Mozart). A generational film (Chabrol as a co-writer and 'advisor', Melville in a delicious supporting role). Paris. Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg.The film begins as a light-hearted story with a petty gangster fascinated by the heroes of American movies, a guy who avoids complications by taking life as a joke, but whose life is complicated first by a murder, and then by a love story with an American student and journalist. Much of the film consists of dialogues between the two - in bed, in stolen cars, or on the streets of Paris. It's a love story that we know from the beginning that it can't end well, that oscillates between teenage games and absurd-existentialist dialogues. Love, as in many of the screenplays written by Truffaut (who also benefited from Chabrol's help here), is not an alternative to the violent world around and no salvation opportunity for the characters, on the contrary, it is rather a dangerous game that can prove fatal.Belmondo creates here his first big role, a first appearance for a type of character that will accompany his career for a long time and not only his. Jean Seberg creates one of those roles of the-American-girl-in-Paris, a role loaded with a dose of fascination and mystery. The film is full of anthological scenes, quotes and bows to the filmmakers who preceded the directors, innovations and firsts in artistic expression. Some of them may not be so obvious today because in the more than 60 years since the film was made, they have entered the repertoire of cinema of all genres and styles. But what is striking today is the naturalness with which the elements of style are incorporated into the narrative and build a bridge between heroes and spectators. I can't help but reflect on the fact that Godard himself, after some formidable films at the beginning of his career, including this one, continued on the path of experimentation both when needed and when it wasn't needed. When experiences respond to a creative need, when they are designed to communicate and create emotions in souls and interest in the minds of viewers, the results are excellent. Experiences for the sake of experience, however, can give results contrary to expectations, can be annoying and boring, and viewers vote with their feet. Any wave, including La Nouvelle Vague, had its peak or peaks after which leveling is inevitable. 'A bout de souffle' was the peak of that wave.",

It does chronicle a stage in the life of a chaotic young Parisian, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo, as he goes off the rails. Always talking and smiling and seemingly divorced from reality, he does represent, to an extreme, a really that we have all seen in young people, particularly young males.The young woman he chases, Jean Seberg, keeps him at a distance but also teases him which encourages his outlandish behaviour.

This film, about troubled lives of two young people, is morally freed, erotically charged and emotionally irritated.The main protagonist is a youthful criminal, thug and a specialist in car theft. After stealing a car, he shoots and kills a policeman who has followed him onto a country road. He is hiding from the police and waits to pick up the money from an acquaintance. In the meantime, he turns to an American love interest, a student who sells newspapers on streets. She is ambivalent in terms of their relationship. He plans their escape to Italy. The police are getting closer...This is a very successful experiment with a common theme and eccentric styles of shooting. The film begins as a \u0084wild\" thriller and becomes a nervous drama. Scenery has reflected in authentic locations and streets in Paris. Mr. Godard has managed to blend street life and the daily turnover in film plots. The tension, which was accompanied by good jazz, enormously grows at the end of the film.The story is, of course, non-linear and frames are pretty quick. Mr. Godard has tried to confuse us. Therefore, some sequences are not entirely clear. The atmosphere is filled with some anxiety and uncertainty. The protagonists are very interesting, but they do not have the necessary depth.Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel Poiccard is an arrogant, resourceful and amoral urban idler. His character was not faced with any problem in a serious way. He lives for a moment or rather one breath. I am sure that each of us knows at least one person with that kind of behavior. Jean Seberg as Patricia Franchini is a pretty, a little stupid and completely undefined young woman. She is an insensitive and somewhat lonely character. However, a chemistry between them is almost unreal. Two immature and childish young people, who awkwardly run away from reality, are maybe in love. Their conclusions and dialogues are somewhat meaningless.

Any serious film fan knows of the French New Wave, the movement in the 1950s and 1960s that sparked the American film movement in the 1960s and inspired our own New Wave in the 1970s. Of that period, perhaps the most well-known director is Jean-Luc Godard, and his best known work is Breathless.A rather interesting title, because that is exactly what this movie is. Of course there is a twenty-some minute scene in a hotel room that brings the narrative to a screeching halt, but that as well was revolutionary and daring for any film in that day. The new and exciting techniques and attitude of Breathless are what create its reputation and why it is considered so important in the history of film. However, it can also be approached simply as the story of a wanna-be gangster who wants the girl he longs for to run away with him but has the law on his tail as well.Of course, could Breathless be as it is without the fascinating performances of its leads, in particular Jean Seberg as Patricia? Jean-Paul Belmondo plays it straight and we need that to take us through the story, but Seberg always detracts from the audience and that is part of the intrigue. What does she really think of Michel, and what will she do with him? Their scene in the hotel room is absorbing not only because of how Godard shot it with available light, overhead angles and those famous jump cuts, but also the dialogue. What are these people talking about and why? The subject in discussion changes hands frequently, but they both have the same goal in mind the whole time: Michel to sleep with Patricia and Patricia to find out about Michel.The opening is unique in that we get no back story; just plunge right into this world and the surroundings that come with it. Speaking of which, is there a better backdrop then Paris? Perhaps not, and that is only part of what makes this an unforgettable experience. Certainly, it needs to be seen multiple times, but I get the feeling that many will get its message the first time. The true message Godard was trying to relate was: the world is changing, and that includes the cinema.",

A friend back then found it a bit ridiculous, even amateurish. I liked it then and parts lodged in my brain and I ached to see it again and prove my friend wrong.As part of the Jean Luc Goddard collection, it whistled through its 90 minutes runtime in what seemed like half that \u2013 its freshness and that 'amateurishness' that my friend had harped on about was then, a new approach to filmmaking \u2013 cut editing, which adds dynamism and vigour. The absolutely audacious lead crosses Bonnie & Clyde with Malcolm Mc Dowell in A Clockwork Orange \u2013 I can only see Mr Mc D being any sort of alternative actor that could have pulled it off. As the flash harry Michel, Jean-Paul Belmondo is utterly superb and convincing. Jean Seberg as his American, flight attendant date that he sets out to impress. I read a reviewer (amateur) who moaned that the hotel bedroom scene was boring and wishy-washy where nothing happened. But that's the point and beauty of it and makes it the best part. Anyone who's spent aimless afternoons in the semi AND intimate company of a potential or actual lover, just knows that inane and meaningless chatter that goes on and that being was so brilliantly written and naturally acted. He just occasionally says 'get your top off' whilst she organises his life, her life and everyone's life around him \u2013 he just lies in bed smoking \u2013 she goes about and does 'things', possibly useful, or otherwise.....The gritty underbelly of the world's most Romantic city with petty crime and petty characters and the audacious thriller scenes remind of the original British Scarface (set in Brighton) and of course, the French heist movies of this time, pioneered by such as Bob de Flambeur from Jean Pierre Melville (who actually has a small part in this). Back then, fifty years ago and so singularly French (& since much replicated by/in Hollywood). All in all, an absolute cutting-edged, scathingly scorching social thriller of refreshing naturalness. I can see a Scorsese-ness coming out of those brooding, angry and powerful scenes and characters.Think you've seen all the best and most influential films? Not without this one, you haven't!",

The film is, in fact, deeply morally ambivalent, with Belmondo as the 'cool' hero with no apparent loyalty or obligation to anyone but himself, but like Antonioni's L'Avventura it seems to usher in a new kind of world, a world of complexity, uncertainty and, in the case of Bout de Souffle, a world dominated by the young. It would not be too far from the truth to see most pop videos of today as direct descendants of this film. Seberg's performance is strangely melancholic, presaging the later tragedies of her own life, and the image of her wandering the streets of Paris as a young girl selling copies of The International Herald Tribune is for some reason the one that I remember most clearly from this film.",

Don't know what it is about this gal. She was great in \"Bonjour Tristesse\" and \"Saint Joan\" (maybe she needed to work exclusively with Preminger). But whenever she's on screen, with her flat, passive, Iowa vibe, I feel immediately dragged down from the heights of Belmondo's performance, which is so good it actually makes me like a vicious cop killer and petty thief, and the energy and verve of Godard's direction with its sudden cuts, circle fade outs and magnificent tracking shots of Michel walking around Paris, Gaulois firmly implanted in mouth and newspaper crocked in elbow, or staggering to his death down a Left Bank, cobblestoned street.

It's also fun to note that three titans of the French New Wave, Melville, Truffuat, and Godard, were all involved in some capacity in this film.\"Breathless\" was shot on a hand-held camera by Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard. There were no other crew involved in principal shooting for the film. With that taken into account, \"Breathless\" is a fine-looking film, with editing that still has the intended effect today, a good musical score, and acting that remains striking in 2008. It's an admirable low-budget effort, a love letter to cinema which regardless of your personal feelings on the film at least tries to do something interesting.\"Breathless\" is far from Godard's best film, and I doubt that many who have seen more than a few films by him would say that it is. It's not as purely entertaining or involving as \"Band of Outsiders\" and it lacks the intellectual and philosophical bent of many of his other movies, but as pure cinema it works.8/10",

Even after half a century it seems remarkably fresh, with its fluid hand-held camera work.

The stylistic novelties--jump cuts, long tracking shots, natural lighting, ironic score, hand held cameras, grainy black and white--now seem pass\u00e9.I have sometimes wondered what my reaction to this would have been had I come to it with no foreknowledge. I think there are few who have had that experience since opinions and reviews hit the presses early on, almost a year before this wave came to the shores of the U.S. The mythology surrounding a film such as this becomes as important as the film itself.The story revolves around Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and Patrica (Jean Seberg). While the amoral Michel steals cars, murders a policeman, and robs people, Patrica tries to figure out if she loves him. The film alternates between realism, like a long scene in a hotel suite where the two talk and talk and talk, and stylistic cinematic flurries that call attention to themselves. Neither Michel nor Patricia seems to care much about anything. Even when Michel knows the police are closing in on him he does not attempt flight, complaining that he is tired.Since the story is not much and the characters are not terribly appealing, appreciation must come mainly from the presentation. There is no mystery to Michel, he is aimless and shallow, trying desperately to effect coolness. Micel's affectations of rubbing his thumb across his lips and making a sequence of faces bugged me the first time he did them and by the time he had done these things several more times I was ready to hurl a frying pan at him. Goddard films Seberg in a way to give her a commanding presence and at least she retains some element of mystery. It is hard to see why Patricia, an American expatriate and student at the Sorbonne, had such a hard time figuring out whether she loved Michel. All of the stylistic innovations mentioned above kept my interest, but the prevailing mood of anomie rubbed off.",

Not all the films on my imaginary list would be that good, but all would have a role in forming the cinema that we know and enjoy today.For example, 1930's horror taught the industry a lot of tension and cinematography tricks that you see today in mainstream productions. Today's thrillers such as Se7en and Silence of the Lambs (to use two obvious names from thousands) have more to do with The Bride of Frankenstein than, say, Kiss Me Deadly.Another example would be the way that the James Bond series gave heroes the right to casually kill those that opposed him. Starting first with Doctor No. The French \"New Wave\" introduced naturalism, honesty and sexual tension to the screen. The subtitles allowing them to get away with things that no Hollywood films would allow at the time.(However don't think I am blindly championing it - it produced just as much dross as Hollywood.)Goddard is not actually my favourite French New Wave director because he is too self-indulgent, but he has a lot of courage and he is his own man. If something intrigues him, he holds it in frame until his curiosity is spent. For him the thing is personal and if you say you don't like it his answer would be \"well go and make your own film then.\"The problem with some people reviewing this film is that they seem to believe that because there are tricks for foreshortening scenes they should have been employed. This is a not a chase film per se, but a look at people under a stressful situation. It is easy to say that this is a cheap film. However the real Paris is a wonderful set and I prefer it to any of the Warner Brothers cardboard and plywood versions.The dialogue seems fresh and interesting, but my French isn't good enough to do without the subtitles. The lovers seem questioning of their relationship (they started without the aid of a full script) and Jean Seberg's character is hard to work out from the evidence presented here.(Obviously a liker of bad boys, but I don't really have enough evidence to make any strong statements about her. Her look is more memorable than her acting which remains hold-it-all-in.)Belmondo does a good job of portraying the kind of criminal that is under represented on the screen and over represented in real life: Young, stupid and reckless.This film opened up a new way of making and enjoying films that went against the Hollywood rules - especially to do with sex and sexuality.

            "content": "Breathless is often referred to as one of the most influential motion pictures of all time. It is seen as a breakthrough in cinema history. The reason for this is in the editing: Breathless is what introduced jump cutting. The use of jump cuts was groundbreaking back in the early 1960s. It's a style that is still used and has been ever-popularized by MTV. However, in Breathless the jump cuts are not non-stop. The reason the technique works in Breathless is because it is only used occasionally and when it is put into use, it isn't overkill. Jump-cutting and flashy edits don't make a movie, all they can add style to it if it's appropriate. The edits made in Breathless go along with the stylistic neo-noir style. Following the noir style, there is the woman that ultimately gets our hero (or in this particular case, anti-hero) in trouble. Although the woman in the film, Patricia, leads to the Michel's downfall, it would not be right to call her a femme fatale. There isn't a hint of immediate danger with her. Neither is there a sense of innocence with her. She appears to have good qualities as well as bad qualities. In other words, she appears human. This is important because she doesn't come across as one-dimensional villain at the end of the picture. By the time the final twist is revealed, Patricia has been developed as a character with depth. She is shown as a woman with strong feelings and reasons behind what she does. It is important to note that she isn't afraid to turn Michel in. Had Michel lived, he may have been proud of Patricia in an odd way for showing such courage as he had said earlier: \"being afraid is the worst fault there is.\" Michel's opinion of fear being a fault is interesting when taken into account that the main reason for a criminal to be on the run is fear of getting caught and punished for his actions. Whether acknowledged by Michel or not, fear does serve as a factor for his running. There is no way that Michel does not feel fear at any point during his journey. Perhaps it is the fear of getting caught that persuades Michel to comment on other peoples' fears such as when he remarks he hates taxi drivers that are afraid of getting the paint on the car scratched. This demonstrates one of Michel's many faults. Michel is a phony. He is not the strong, smooth criminal that he pretends to be. He is a liar and a cheat, not the most sympathetic of characters. However, that is one of the strengths of Breathless. The characters are not the squeaky clean, sympathetic types that are all too common in the Hollywood productions of today. It is because of Michel's aforementioned anti-hero status that Breathless will remain timeless.",

One of the early films of the French New Wave, it has a powerful sense of youth and was a conscious break from the traditional, more conservative method of film-making. It shattered the mold, broke all the rules, and became an inspiration to new film-makers for decades to come. The story is relatively simple, about a murder suspect, Michel, evading the law in Paris, seemingly without a care in the world, while hanging out with his American girlfriend, Patricia, who establishes herself as an interesting and powerful character in her own right. Michel seems more interested in getting laid than getting away, and at times is resigned to spending his life in jail. But in the end he wouldn't go quietly, free until his last breath. The film has a constantly moving camera, which leaves the audience breathless as well, and cinema was forever changed.",

Breathless still can be recognized as an innovative, fresh, and even fun film about a tragic and complicated love. All the while watching Breathless, I couldn't help but think of Bonnie and Clyde every minute that passed. Though, not the same plot, the two films click with many of the same strengths.The direction and cinematography allows for some beautiful shots, I particularly enjoyed the scenes that featured smoke exiting the actor's mouths. With the black and white film stock, it captures something poetic and rich about the story. Breathless is most famous for the unusual editing: the controversial jump cuts. I think the style meshed well with the rapid pace of the plot itself. The editing strips down the necessities of the story and that's what we get in the final film.The jump cuts highlighting the important moments of the plot say something profound about the relationship of the lead couple. There's a rather long scene in the middle section of the film, that features the two actors just talking. They develop this romance as the heart of the picture. It's not the typical Hollywood gushing love story, but breaks free from the expected. As human beings, we're all different, therefore when we connect with another, it will b different. Each relationship will be rare and its own. The romance here is atypical, but so thrilling to see was broadcast for the world to see.There feels like a layer of cinematography was cut in Breathless. It knows that's its a film, but it acts more personal than how other movies are shown to us. Another layer that's cut is the wall between the movie world and the real world with the references of Hollywood. I quite enjoyed the performances from Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, they embody characters who don't conform to society morally or ethically. They can easily steal a car and it's no big deal. These actions aren't segmented to feel weird, they feel natural to the characters, therefore they feel natural to us.Rating: 10Grade: A",

This romantic-ironic thriller about a charming (but murderous) Parisian hood and his lovely (but treacherous) American girlfriend has withstood the ravages of time, and is now as much a classic French thriller as Becker's TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI or Carne's QUAI DES BRUMES. Particularly poignant are the performances of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, so youthful, delightful and enticing: it's hard to realize that Belmondo would use the popularity this film gave him to embark on a steadily declining career as a box-office fixture, and that Seberg would have such a tragically embattled life. But seeing them in A BOUT DE Souffl\u00e9, you're seeing them at their best.",

            "content": "\"Breathless\", Jean-Luc Godard's debut, IS a very interesting movie and I can see why it's considered a classic and a landmark. But influential doesn't mean great \u0085 as new approach to film-making doesn't mean masterpiece \u0085 I felt there was something very experimental, like a movie from a student who intentionally uses the most innovative techniques just to impress (to trick ?) the audience with something new. Well it did work on that level, but all style and no script don't make a movie work: it needs to have more substance, a solid narrative structure, a story, something that engages me or makes me feel for a character.If a movie dares to challenge my intelligence with something new, and please me visually, it doesn't prevent it from providing a little emotion, a heart in the story or something to make you 'enjoy' what you're watching. In other words, a movie has to 'entertain' too : to thrill, to scare, to make you cry, think, laugh, escape etc, even the most intelligent, stylish and complex directors made entertaining movies : Huston, Hitchcock, Clouzot, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Leone, Lumet etc.OK, I got it, \"Breathless\" paved the way for a new kind of cinema, the New Wave but I think it worked better with American directors because they never forgot to have a solid script and add an entertainment value to their movies. Look at New Hollywood movies like \"Bonnie and Clyde\", \"The Wild Bunch\",\" Five Easy Pieces\", \"Badlands\", \"Mean Streets\", \"Midnight Cowboy\" ... : as deep and stylish as they were, they never failed to entertain their audience and were very popular On the other hand, Nouvelle Vague French movies were more elitist, more appealing to a bourgeois youth movement rejecting anything 'old', anything from their parent's generation. They even called it with the pompous name of Cinema d'Auteur ... what did that ever mean anyway ? Nouvelle Vague was a fresh air for French Cinema, but was it really better than popular movies like \"Diaboliques\",\" Wages of Fear\" or than traditional movies from Jean-Pierre Melville ... who ironically, had a memorable cameo in \"Breathless\"? I guess we should put this into historical perspective, I'm not calling bourgeois all the fans of \"Breathless\" but the New Wave fans were mostly the baby-boom generation, they weren't all bourgeois, but it was the most spoiled generation, which for instance, bashed a masterpiece like \"Army of Shadows\" from Jean-Pierre Melville, because it glorified a figure like De Gaulle and was about traditional themes, like honor and loyalty. And what about \"Wages of Fear\" ? old guard too? What about other French masterpieces like \"Forbidden Games\", or\"The Trip Across Paris\" ? And let's get back to the newness, two years before \"Breathless\", there was \"Shadows\": the directorial debut of John Cassavetes. A cool, detached, modern movie with an incredible realistic feeling, jump cuts, improvised dialog, jazzy music etc. This movie isn't famous enough to be considered as a landmark ... but in my book, it is. I loved it, and Godard's movie just didn't leave me with the same feeling. Maybe because I didn't really care for the main character, too cynical and detached, whereas \"Shadows\" made me more empathic towards the main protagonists, maybe \u0085 I think the New Wave saved Hollywood by inspiring the greatest generation of directors and actors, and the best decade for American movies from 1967 to 1977, but I'm not sure it stood the test of time as well for French Cinema. I respect every director's work ... I just don't think that for the sake of Art, every single element of a movie should be distant from a so-called 'old guard', you can do something fresh with old stuff, as you can make a very complex, intriguing , stylish and intelligent movie with very entertaining material.I don't hate \"Breathless\", I just take it like the main character, yes he's flamboyant, has a sort of magnetic charisma, but his acts aren't driven by strong motives, it's just a succession of disjointed talking and actions that are supposed to grab us every minute with this \"Wooow, this is new\" feeling. I got it, it's new, but after 20 minutes, the new wave drowned me already ...",

            "content": "At the forefront of the French New Wave along with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (\"The 400 Blows\"), Alain Resnais (\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\"), and Louis Malle (\"Elevator to the Gallows\"), Jean-Luc Godard broke all the rules in his 1960 directorial debut with a story borne out of American B-movie conventions but revitalized by his free-form narrative, hand-held camera-work (by Raoul Coutard) and jazz-infused editing style. On the surface, it seems like a standard young couple-on-the-run adventure, but Godard upends the predictability of the situation with a fresh, documentary-style perspective that emphasizes youthful impulses over morality lessons. Some of its fresh, brazen novelty has worn off over the years, but there is no denying its propulsive energy.The plot is deceptively simple. Michel Poiccard is a young, small-time criminal with a Bogart fixation, living for the moment and taking what he needs with no consideration for the possible consequences. His one obsession is Patricia Franchini, a pixyish New Yorker who lives in Paris and works part-time for the New York Herald Tribune. Michel steals a car in Marseilles and drives to Paris to see her again. On the way, however, he shoots a motorcycle cop with a gun found in the glove compartment of the stolen car. As the police close in on Michel, he holes up in Patricia's apartment and tries to convince her to run away with him to Rome. Godard wrote the script based on a story by Truffaut, and the plot emphasis is placed squarely on the dynamic between Michel and Patricia, especially in a lengthy dialogue scene in her apartment. The thriller aspects seem secondary until the last half-hour and the memorably bitter ending.In his breakthrough role, Jean-Paul Belmondo captures Michel's surly, amoral nature with a certain magnetic quality that announces his arrival. As the fashionably enigmatic Patricia, Jean Seberg was just 21 but had already been burned by Hollywood thanks to her mechanical performances in two Otto Preminger films, \"Saint Joan\" and \"Bonjour Tristesse\". She still strikes me a blank slate here, but it seems to work for the story because the viewer is left wondering what motivates her devotion to him and her final act of absolution. The two-disc 2007 Criterion Collection DVD set is as impressive as expected for the film's aficionados. Beyond a fairly pristine print of the movie, Disc One includes the original French trailer and 27-minutes worth of vintage interviews with Godard, Belmondo, Seberg, and director Jean-Pierre Melville (he has a memorable cameo as a pretentious author. Surprisingly, there is no commentary track from a film scholar, the usual supplement for special Criterion releases.Disc Two has the lion's share of the extras. There are recent interviews with Coutard and assistant director Pierre Rissient, as well as a ten-minute interview with documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker and his brief experience working with Godard. Seberg gets special attention in an eighteen-minute film essay that covers her tragic life and career, and another essay, \"Breathless as Criticism\" has Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum explaining the significance of the film for a new generation. There is a 78-minute documentary from 1993, \"Chambre 12, Hotel de Suede\" that traces the original film locales. Interviews with Belmondo, Coutard, and technical adviser Claude Chabrol are also included. Finally, there is a twelve-minute comedy short from 1959, \"Charlotte et son Jules\" co-starring Godard and Belmondo. A comprehensive eighty-page booklet accompanies the set.",

This movie deserves to be in the top 10. But if you look at ratings, it's basically either 10 or 1. I am not going to describe why this movie is so good, I wouldn't be able to anyway. But I think the effect of it lies in Michel's character (kind of crazy, cynical, with an incredible distant and happy attitude and self confidence that gives him some particular charm. Belmondo's performance to act this especially complex and subtle character is outstanding), and the overall realization that gets you like some abstract paintings sometimes do. Surely lots of people wrote tons of technical stuffs to explain all this. Now why so many of so-called movie enthusiast in the IMDb hated it? I understood from reading the reviews that many of them are from students who \"had\" to watch it for their class. I guess it's not the best way to appreciate it. As there is no way anyone could appreciate the Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum, looking at it at 10 m in a crowd. A word that comes a lot is \"boring\". I guess some people don't see in movies anything else than a technique used as a support for a storyline. It's like saying food is just fuel to walk. I guess they're the same who put all these blockbusters in the top 250. Not that I don't like Hollywood big productions but they don't go at all beyond entertainment, which is good but not enough. And finally, there might be some cultural misunderstanding. A reviewer wrote that he hated Michel because he kept stealing cars...I was just puzzled by such stupidity. This is definitely not a movie to be watched if you have been formatted by TV and Hollywood blockbusters since you were born, like apparently a growing majority of IMDb members.",

Seberg grew up in small-town Iowa but lived in France after her two earlier films as a teenager with Otto Preminger bombed. She was still only 20 years old when she made \"Breathless.\"Godard's style of film making (using only hand-held cameras) gives the film a very intimate feel as Michel keeps buying newspapers to see if the police are closing in and chases another hood who owes him money, while Patricia waffles on whether to stay in a relationship with Michel. Seberg is an actress with a beautiful face that you can't quite tell what is happening behind the surface.The film's ending is memorable as Michel is shot.

            "content": "It's amazing how a film with such a simple premise turns out to have a whole lot of things underneath. The same goes for the two main characters that have a lot of depth, especially Patricia, whose impressive character arc shows that it's actually a fully-realized and fully-developed character.Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg are absolutely charming as the two leads. They have a remarkable dynamic that had me completely absorbed and engrossed throughout the film's fleeting runtime of 90 minutes.Although I think the relationship between Michel and Patricia is one of, if not the film's best merits, the dialogue becomes a bit dull and monotonous at the very end of its second act.Surprisingly, I wasn't interested in the whole \"murder\" thing for the whole of the first two acts. Fortunately, when this storyline intertwined with Michel/Patricia's relationship, and became front and center, I found it quite intriguing and captivating till the end.Speaking of the end, this is easily one of the most powerful and hard-hitting endings I've seen in a while. With the final scene in this movie and The 400 Blows's, it's safe to assume that French filmmakers pull no punches when it comes to ending their films! It's Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut who wrote the screenplay of this movie, so this also makes sense!Nevertheless, a specific character's motivations has been explained by this very character; the thing that I found to be unnecessary. I think Godard should have trusted the audience's minds a bit more.Returning to the positives, I think that the editing technique of jagged cutting serves the movie quite a lot; it gave it a classic and retro vibe, it reflected the recklessness of the protagonist and his misadventures, and it also made the film so vibrant, breezy and airy, and hence cheerful to watch.I can say that I really liked \u00c0 Bout de Souffle! Whilst it's my first Godard, I can say why it's arguably his most accessible, considering he's known as one of the greatest art-house film directors.(8/10)",

            "review_title": "Godard's audacious debut - An interesting genre-bender.",
            "content": "Jean-Luc Godard's audacious debut is one of the films that started the French New Wave, and it has most of the directors from the New Wave associated with it - with the script written by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette appearing in a cameo as the dead man on the street. Even director Jean-Pierre Melville, whose reporting style and use of real locations had a big influence on the New Wave, appears in a short scene where he's an author being interviewed by Patricia and other reporters.Though not his best, Godard's 'Breathless' is his most famous and discussed film. Even after 50 years, it hasn't lost its vitality; it's interpreted in so many different ways. We all know that most of these New Wave directors (formerly critics at 'Cahiers du Cinema') wanted to shift away from the style and rules of Classic Hollywood, which most of the mainstream French films had adapted over the years. Godard tries to break these conventions and tries experimenting with various aspects of the film. Firstly, he casts Jean-Paul Belmondo, with his punched nose and unconventional looks (though quite charming), and Jean Seberg in a boy-cut tomboyish role, introducing her wearing a T-shirt and selling newspapers on the street (an intriguing and memorable intro). With regard to Patricia's character, though intended or not, the film did have quite a feminist undertone (much different from the female characters portrayed at the time). Other than this, the film mainly comprises of random conversations and a meandering plot. All these elements went on to reinvent Modern Cinema. Godard believed that most of the mainstream films tried to seduce people with their fictional reality, tried to entertain them and make them forget the worries of their daily life; he said that's how capitalist systems kept their people happy and content. He wanted to defy establishment and authority, both in terms of film and politics; though this film is not as Marxist as his later films, it's certainly quite anarchist in nature and his contempt for capitalism is clearly visible. Just like Patricia wonders, \"I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm not free, or if I'm not free because I'm unhappy.\" With random jump-cuts in a single scene or characters looking/talking to the camera, Godard constantly reminds the viewer that they're watching a work of fiction, thus making us watch the film in a different light, evoking a higher level of consciousness and compelling us to interpret the film's intended meaning. He wanted to stress that none of it was real, and that the director has complete control of what's being shown on screen. The film circles-in twice (in the style of film noir), once pointing to almost nothing conspicuous (to draw the attention outside of the film), and the next time when Godard himself appears in a cameo as the informer, thus ingeniously highlighting the fact that it's Godard (the director) who's controlling the plot from within and outside of the film. Even when Michel shoots the policeman, the scene is shown in such a haphazard and unusual way; the scene is as detached from the event as the protagonist, highlighting the moral jumps he takes in the situation. Though the New Wave directors were tired of the rigid style of Classic Hollywood, they were big admirers of Film Noir. Even in this film, Godard pays homage to it in various ways, whether it's the way Michel's admires and imitates Humphrey Bogart or the random circle-ins. Michel informs his identity with the tough-guy persona of Bogart's films, and the tragedy is that even when he decides/tries to escape such a life and identity, he's still pushed along the tragic fate of characters in such crime thrillers; he's stuck within it, there's no escape. And if we analyse both our characters, we realize they have none of the usual characteristics of a film hero or anti-hero; they are quite self-obsessed, amoral, aimless, so absorbed in the world of art (Michel in cinema, Patricia in literature), yet so oblivious to the world around them. Godard tries to highlight the absurdity of life without a political, philosophical or moral commitment. The final scene is as alluring and mysterious as the rest of the film. Whether it's the statement that's said or the gesture of tracing the lips - both being carried forward and reinterpreted by different members in its chain of action. Overall, let me state that 'Breathless' isn't a great film by itself; it's not even close to the brilliance and emotional resonance of Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\" or Resnais' \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", New Wave works which released the previous year. Other than a few captivating scenes and dialogues, most of the film is dull and boring; I wonder how dragging the original two-and-a-half-hour runtime might have been like. But the film is important for two reasons - the way it experimented with the format opened up new possibilities in cinematic storytelling, and it's the kind of film which offers such interesting interpretations and opportunities for discussion with other cinephiles.",

The other is that, at the same time, the film still tells a compelling story. Disrespectful methods, such as location shooting, casting unknown actors, and handheld camera, meaningfully and miraculously enhance the simple story of a Paris lowlife. Editing, which makes a dynamic contrast between long takes and piles of fragmented shots (with Godard's signature jump cut), effectively presents the relativity of time, while it harshly reminds the audience that the world they are watching is fictitious. Music, which includes Classical (Jean Seberg playing the record of Mozart Clarinet Concerto) and the original score with a European Jazz taste, indicates the layer of diverse values that are imbedded in the film. Belmondo running to death in the emotionally intense last scene parallels Godard's fearless determination in his radical filmmaking.",

However, this is the work of an auteur at the very top of his game. Jean-Luc Goddard's direction is brilliant and he fills the film completely with a sheer, overwhelming energy that shatters cinematic conventions. The main character is unlikable but always compelling and Breathless, both in aesthetic and narrative terms, is a glorious example of rebellion and breaking free. It's a seriously cool movie and a genuinely hypnotic experience. Unfortunately, it's not quite a 5 star movie. The film sags in the middle during a drawn-out sequence in a hotel room with the 2 main characters talking endlessly about whether or not they're going to have sex, but after that the film picks up again.

            "review_title": "A mediocrity masquerading as an innovative revolution",
            "content": "As one of the most famous entries brought forward by French cinema's so called 'New Wave', Breathless has been met with critical acclaim by critics and is ranked #13 of all time in a 2012 Sight & Sound poll. Of course, all of these awards and statusses mean very little, and it is quite obvious that everyone involved in making it have this 'iconic' status is biased and affected by the simple notion of 'uniqueness' in cinema, or are suffering from a plain form of pseudo intellectuality.To properly place a verdict on this film, one has to take into consideration some of director Jean Luc Godard's visions on cinema. Being a communist, he despised the traditional forms of cinema, and preferred innovation and change above craft and expertise. What this really means, of course, is simply that Godard is a really poor director who was unable to tell conventional stories in a succesful fashion. Breathless is an experiment, and nothing more. It is a film suffering from an incoherent plot ( If there is one ), horrible editing, mediocre sound & horrendous dialogue. The only impressive factor in this 'experiment' are some well choreographed long takes, featuring many changes of directions and requiring a lot of precise timing. However, this is all undone by the terrible jump cut technique Godard implemented here. Apparently, this was caused by Godard being forced to cut a lot of footage, which resulted in a lot of jump cuts being used so he could shorten them out while still using parts of the footage, making sure the audience is even more alienated to whatever is happening on screen.There is no plot in Breathless. A man starts driving in his car and starts mumbling some of the most random dialogue imaginable during this drive. It also features a horrible fourth wall break, and leads to him getting pulled over by a cop and subsequently killing this cop for no apparent reason. This leads to our main character running away and spending the rest of the film with his American girlfriend while seemingly not caring a bit about whether he gets caught or not. This continues throughout the film, as neither him or his girlfriend show a little bit of emotional importance to their situation, leaving the viewer with little reason to care about what happens to both of them. Of course, our main character is also unsympathetic, moronic, childish and just plain unlikeable. The 'romance' between both main characters has zero charisma whatsoever, and these people simply do not behave as real people. A lot of the dialogue was improvised, and it seems that these two were not very good at that, as nearly all dialogue is either out of place, devoid of intelligence, or pretentious.So, apart from the fact that there's nothing to like about Breathless, it's obvious technical and creative shortcomings such as a lack of narrative structure or fleshed out characters also make sure there's nearly nothing to appreciate about it either. To put it plainly; Breathless is a mess. It has been overhyped horrendously by pretentious self proclaimed 'cinephiles' because it favors a 'changing of the guards' and because they think it makes them look smart. This is why defenders of this film can generally only counterargument skeptics with the lowly argument of 'You didn't get it' or 'You're too dumb'. The truth is, there is nothing to understand about Breathless. It does not have depth, it does not have intellect. The sole reason for its acclaim is based on the fact that it dared to break a lot of unwritten rules of conventional cinema, and this is something that in no way relates to it actually having some quality.Breathless has terrible improvised dialogue, horrendous editing in the form of jump cutting, mediocre acting, no story, no character development, no cinematic drama or emotional power and is in the end a poorly executed experiment instead of a film, and truly exposes Godard for the mediocrity that he is.",

            "content": "Here's the deal: this movie's famous. Very famous. So famous, in fact, that it took me forever to get around to seeing it because I heard, read, and talked so much about it before seeing it that it felt like I had already seen it. So many clips abound in so many movies, so many seminars, and so many allusions in other media, that in a sense I had actually seen the whole thing, just not strung together in the way it's strung together, which is to say that I recognized all though it was a new experience. This movie is both over-rated and yet precisely rated so. It lives off of its own self-reflexivity the way its fame lives off itself. So let's get into it: \"A bout de souffl\u00e9\" is about a guy who starts out saying \"I'm a bad person\" though he uses a bit harsher term than that. This man Michel, who wants to be Humphrey Bogart but is only a two-bit petty criminal, ends up killing a cop to escape him and then runs to his lover, Patricia, in order to spend time with her and escape while a city-wide search for him goes out. The theme is the aspects of relationships and the new gender roles in a modern age. The form is highly experimental. The idea is the New Wave, a way of looking at cinema beyond the level of narrative construction to the new construction of a synthesis of sound, image, and editing.Now, not all the cuts in here are genius, and not all of them work. When regarding experimental cinema, always remember that just because it's experimental doesn't mean it works, and that's very true of this movie. Some scenes, like the interview with Patricia, are pure genius. Others, like cuts while people are getting in and out of cars, are pretty useless and serve nothing but to remind us that we're not watching a narratively-structured movie. Some cuts have something to say about the internal logic of the characters, others are just a means of getting from one end of the room to the other faster to save film stock on a tight budget. Some cuts create a real sense of desire to see a new logic on what is going on, others are simply distracting.This behemoth of a movie, however, will always be famous for the poetics it is whether you like it or not. Comparisons to MTV don't count--these jump cuts are way more jarring and sudden, and especially aren't mean to be hyper-kinetic to distract you from the fact that the music you're listening to is horrible. It's a great movie to watch as a student of film to learn how to think about film-making differently, but learning about film should never stop or resolve there--there are other craft techniques, different approaches to narration, stories to be told. An experiment is successful when it's built upon, not the apex. Build upon this. Appreciate it for its moment in time and the way it's disrupted our cinematic experiences, but move on as well.That is all.--PolarisDiB",

Watchable with somewhat shaky non-stop motion that truly makes the film \"Breathless\" this film by Jean-Luc Godard is one of the standouts and one of the foremost representatives of the French New Wave. An ugly and extroverted criminal wanted for the murder of a police officer hooks up with a foreign girlfriend. Together they make up for lost time by roaming the streets, establishments and the bedroom as their relationship builds up to a complicated tangle that ends in justice and the absurd. Snappy dialogues and endless motion keep the viewer interested despite the mundane plot and scenarios. The chemistry between the lead characters is flawless as Jean-Paul Belmondo's sympathetic gooniness serves as the perfect foil to Jean Seberg's comely smarts. The film is also a neat view of post-war Paris as the City of Light serves as chic backdrop. While not of Hollywood standards \"Breathless\" is a good cinematic portrait of a time and place and one of the pivotal transitions of film into the modern age.",

            "content": "It's hopeless at this point to try saying anything new about Godard's Breathless, and yet of all films it still feels like the one that might most be written about, or rather responded to, whether in words or celluloid or gestures or dreams, still in possession of a space all its own, where established orders of classical cinema and post-war American exceptionalism and gender relations and social correctness are in their different ways teetering or fraying or morphing, to be abandoned or appropriated depending on their adaptability. One could rhapsodize over every moment, but the dying run of Jean-Paul Belmondo's Michel is as worth singling out as any - a defiantly absurd cinematic flourish, but with real life (or \"real life\") all too obviously continuing on each side of the street, people going about their business apparently oblivious to, or unmoved by, the gorgeous history-making charade taking place within feet of them, and yet preserved for posterity whether they know it or not, a moment of their life rendered transcendent even as they looked the other way. One could speak of so much of the movie in similar terms - it shimmers with a constant sense of delighted experimentation, of trying poses and attitudes on for size, of relishing the sound of new words and the look of new faces, of creating and immediately fully occupying fresh cinematic space, of happy accidents (the resonances attaching to Jean Seberg prime among them). One almost feels protective of her and the movie, knowing that Godard would so quickly move on - for all Michel's immense charisma (and Belmondo here is one of the all-time great alluring screen presences, and he and Seberg one of cinema's all-time fascinating couples), he expresses himself worn out by the film's end, ready to yield if circumstances would have allowed (if a friend hadn't thrown him a gun), a capitulation that seems like Godard's own acknowledgement of territory already defined and conquered.",

            "content": "Much of the time, if you profess to not like Breathless, a few New Wave devotees kind of sniff and intimate that, obviously, you didn't understand it.The hell I didn't. I was a teenager when the New Wave (Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, Resnais, et. al) erupted. I saw ALL the key films when they came out. I tried very hard to be impressed, to string along with the huge number of critics who oohed with delight about cinema verit\u00e9, hand-held cameras and improvised dialogue. But I couldn't do it then, and I still can't.I've watched Breathless twice completely and half a dozen times incompletely, over the past 50+ years. Yes, I understand it's a milestone. Yes, the film was a radical departure from standard studio-produced fare. Yes, it broke many so-called 'rules' of feature film-making.But sorry. All that doesn't make for a movie that's good. It bores. It rambles. It irritates by its ineptness. The images are very uneven in quality. The sound is pretty bad. In truth, one is expected, even urged, to admire it for its defects.Jean-Luc Godard (who is Swiss, though considered one of the pillars of the French New Wave) still makes movies today in 2018, at 87 years of age. Still does the festival circuit. And his movies are much improved technically. Almost all have a few pretty good scenes. But by and large, they're not meant to entertain. They're supposed to make you think. To react and reflect on the images and ideas he's throwing out at you.Now, back to Breathless (which a poor translation of the original French title 'A bout de souffle' that really means 'out of steam, out of energy, near the end of the line'.)If you've never seen it, by all means do so, simply for its reputation. And if like me, you were lucky enough to visit Paris in the 1950s and early 1960s, you'll be rewarded by once again seeing the city as it really was. Complete with a girl (the late, beloved Jean Seberg) on foot, hawking the late, beloved International Herald Tribune to American tourists. Just for those delights, my rating is 4/10 - about two points higher than it might otherwise receive from soft-hearted me.PS: If you find New Wave really hard to get through, stick with Truffaut. He rarely bores the way Godard and Resnais do. And how he evolved, year by year, into a master film craftsman is a story in itself.",

            "content": "Still fresh as ever four viewings later, this debut feature from Jean- Luc Godard shows the acclaimed French director at his most experimental while still spinning a half decent story (the same cannot be said of all of his subsequent efforts). A key piece of dialogue crops up around halfway through as lead actress Jean Seberg tells the car thief protagonist played by Jean-Paul Belmondo that she cannot see anything beneath his face, no matter how hard she looks. Belmondo is a man who has modeled himself on the heroes of film noir (twisting his face to match Bogart's face in a photo at one point) and has lost his true identity in a near fantasy existence; Godard's inclusion of gun sound effects as Belmondo imagines firing his gun from his moving car hint at an overactive imagination. Godard's use of jump cuts is also indicative of fragmented thinking. Fascinating as this all may be, '\u00c0 Bout de Souffl\u00e9' misses the mark for a top tier Godard effort. It is not even of his five best films as it does not spin as tight a narrative as something such as 'Contempt'. The scenes in Seberg's hotel room run too long and as appealing as Belmondo's non-urgency in fleeing the country may be, the film misses the opportunity for thrills and suspense. It also debatable how much sense Seberg's decision near the end makes. There is, however, no flawing the film's music, a mix of different moody styles for a mixed up world in which Belmondo feels many different emotions, and the way we get inside the mind of the film noir-influenced protagonist is superb. Godard's cameo is lots of fun too.",

This is right up there with Citizen Kane and Star Wars as one of the most influential films ever made. It is the definite film of one of the definitive\u00a0movements\u00a0in cinema.France is the birthplace of cinemas. Many of the artform's oldest customs and traditions were developed there, but after a couple decades, the center of innovation shifted over to America, to the Cecil B. DeMille's and the D.W. Griffith's. Cinema was transformed into a form of high art. It could be analyzed and scrutinized. It could change lives and influence people.World War II changed this dynamic, as\u00a0world-shattering events tend to do. Hollywood, of course, didn't disappear, but its Golden Age, which had already been in decline, disappeared completely. America had a crisis of identity in its film industry that didn't really resolve itself until the 60's and 70's. There were a lot of great films made in the 50's, but an overwhelming percentage of them came from out of the States. We had a few classics,\u00a0a good deal\u00a0of them either about Hollywood or by Alfred Hitchcock, but overall, the industry lacked both the glitz of the early days and the depth of recent times.When you think about the era of nostalgia, you probably either think about today or the 80's, but the 50's were like that too. Many of the biggest films took place in the 20's. We were relatively relaxed as a country. We had won a war, and we were in an unprecedented\u00a0era of economic prosperity. We could afford to look backwards. France, however, could not.In case you slept through history in school, France was taken over by the Nazis in WWII, and it became one of the key theatres during the later part of the war. Hundreds of thousands of French died, and their country was in ruin. They had to rebuild their country. They could afford to be creative and innovative. In fact, they had to be.From that environment came the New Wave, an exciting, breezy, flippant\u00a0new attitude toward filmmaking. The camera could travel freely. Jump cuts were used to clip through a scene. The traditional structure vanished, replaced with rambling conversations that were the direct precursors to Woody Allen movies. Films got more atmospheric and at the same time more sensual. There was a sense of highbrow swagger to them. It was as though film before the\u00a0New Wave was a housewife, and film after the New Wave was an alluring mistress from a foreign land with a mysterious ill-gotten fortune.This style, of course, eventually made its way over to my country and became something else entirely, getting a lot darker in the process. But that's beside the point. Even if you're not a film historian, this is a breezy, energetic, clever, exceedingly entertaining flick. The acting is superb. The editing is sharp. The camera-work is exciting. The writing is thoroughly captivating. And yes, it is one of the Frenchiest films I have ever seen- a cultural icon, I could call it.So if you need a burst of roguish, revolutionary excitement in your life, check out Breathless.",

Well, to be short: this movie is absolutely stunning, fantastic, sublime, smashing, et cetera. This is film just like film should be: not a stupid story told in a boring matter - like most movies do - but downright art, excuse me, ART. There is a wonderful co-operation between director, photography, actors, and the scenery of France, Paris in particular. Jean-Paul Belmondo has never been a truly great actor; after playing in some early Godards he appeared mainly in quite bad Hollywood-style French thrillers. But somehow he seems to be the right man in the right place. Jean Seberg is not only unbelievably beautiful but also the absolute star of the movie (at least on the screen). She is just perfect in her role. And last but not least: the soundtrack by French jazz star Martial Solal is completely spot on. There is clear synergy between the restless photography, the restless music and of course the restless characters of the protagonists.This movie cannot be missed. It belongs in a league with for example Bertolucci's Il Conformista, Bunuel's Belle de Jour, Godard's own Le M\u00e9pris (completely different by the way).

It was an important early work in the French new wave and served as an indication of things to come. As for the story, it involves a roguish car thief (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who tries to convince his girlfriend (Jean Seberg) to run off to Italy with him after he kills a police officer.The story is almost secondary here. There are plenty of long conversations with little impact on the actual plot. There is an unmistakeably existentialist slant to the film, which would have appealed to me less had Godard not infused the film with such frenetic energy with his bold visuals and innovative cutting.The cast is pretty good with Belmondo & Seberg convincingly infusing their characters with vivid life. Michel is either a lovable scoundrel or an incorrigible bastard, I can't quite decide which. It makes for an entertaining performance but in the end the character's fate didn't mean much to me. The same goes for Seberg's character, whose crisis might as well have not been introduced in the first place.Ultimately, while I appreciate the film's impact on film-making I prefer the results of its influence found in later films. Moreover, I am of the opinion that its exalted status is due more to its historical significance than its intrinsic quality.

The famous 'honesty' of this film must stem from the fact that both lovers speak a good deal about how uncertain they are about whether they love each other, though they do. It's not really a crime drama, because there's very little dash and bravado and nothing to gain. In place of these elements there is only charm. Quite a lot of charm. But this charm is peculiar because it's so ambivalent. At the end Patricia turns her lover Michel in to the police, to see if she really loves him. If she loves him such an act would be so \"m\u00e9chant\" (wicked, spiteful), and so the test is proof. Michel disdains escape\u0096-he's tired, he says, and wants to sleep, though perhaps not to die, which is what he does.

Regarded as one of the most important and influential films in history, it has its fame well achieved. In the same year that William Wyler shot Ben-Hur, Jean-Luc Godard invented modern cinema with ingenious angles, hand-held camera, jump cuts, natural dialogue and an emphasis in the relationships between the characters more than in the actual plot.Godard takes a typical film noir plot to criticize both the amorality of his generation and the obsession of many young people to be like their heroes of the screen. Although the film is a landmark and a symbol of French cinema, the theme of the couple escaping from justice is now seen as a clich\u00e9 of American cinema. Actually, the whole film has some American feel to it, and that's the proof of its gigantic influence.Aside of all of its artistic genius, the film is also surprisingly entertaining and appealing to a conventional audience. There is a sequence that lasts for thirty five minutes in which they're basically talking in bed, and this scene plays of with engaging and natural dialogue and overall feels like just ten minutes have passed, and by looking at the ending and all the dialogues in the film it seems to me highly improbable that this film was made without and actual written script (as the legend says).The performances, especially from Jean Seberg, are excellent and she is both adorable and despicable, while Jean-Paul Belmondo gives his most iconic character a true and realistic feel.\u00c0 Bout De Souffl\u00e9 is a relationship-based film noir with groundbreaking direction and editing, fascinating dialogues, highly influential performances both in and outside the film and it is a masterpiece from Jean-Luc Godard.Rating: 5/5.",

But that's about it.It's a little like, and was no doubt an inspiration for, 'The Harder They Come', the much better low-budget Jamaican film of 1973. Both tell the story of a sociopathic, narcissistic ne'er-do-well who does what he wants regardless of the consequences, and who apparently should be considered some sort of anti-establishment icon, like a John Dillinger.'The Harder They Come' had the benefit of a killer soundtrack, a charismatic lead, and a competent editor. 'A Bout De Souffle' has the benefit of Jean Seberg, who is probably still a fashion icon 59 years later, and a few cool cars. Belmondo comes over as a complete fool, 'Breathless''s soundtrack is rubbish jazz, and the editor appears to have had Parkinson's disease. Not his fault, probably.An inept mess; new wave in the way that most 'punk' music of the late 70's was an inept mess. Refreshing at the time, perhaps, but its shelf-life is long past.",

There is another great scene, in the very beginning of the film, where the couple is chatting, and in my opinion that scene is perhaps the best of the film. It is a nightmare for those who are lovers of the traditional edited film, and a masterpiece for those who have an open mind and real taste for cinema.The story itself is simple, there is a lot of symbolisms and subtle meanings, commentaries about society...is very interesting.

            "review_title": "Unreal Illusions",
            "content": "Sometimes the strange thing whenever we watch a movie, depending on how much we truly like or love it we tend to always imagine or daydream that were in that same world and either were involved with the essential characters or are that character from the film. For imaginative people like myself it's perfectly natural much like breathing; however, the thing is we also know the fine line of some things being real and some things being illusions. That's just simply how it is that's life, but that just gives our dreams all the more value to aspire the best we can to making them reality. But there are some people that don't have or want to see that line, and when that happens, we can't truly make our dreams come true.This is one of my favorite neo noirs/crime films, though strangely the film at the same time is sort of an anti noir/crime movie which makes it even more interesting. Jean Luc Goddard isn't one of my favorite movie directors, nor am I a big fan of his but I do like some of his work and out of them this one is my favorite one, it was his first and still one of his best. It's truly an interesting kind of film as it's one of those where you might have to rewatch again just to uncover more or watch the whole thing and then think about what you've just seen. This is the kind of film you probably might have seen in a film class or club and at the end left up to everyone's own analysis and discussion which is part of the purpose of this film.This film was considered one of the starts of a trend in the 60's call \"French New Wave\" and it's not hard to see why. The cinematography and scenery in the film is just beautiful, I really like how the film utilizes the present decade it was made from the cars and everything going on at the time. The use of the cinematography how the camera follows both characters, the things they see and the things around them. But I also just love the use of the black and white cinematography coloring which give the film a very dream like quality, which ironically reflects both characters states of mind throughout the whole film.But other than the beautiful cinematography and scenery, the film does have a strong story. The story isn't really a traditional noir/crime film, in a way the whole film is similar to a Bret Easton Ellis tale because like in those stories it's on deceptive narratives and people whom aren't who they seem living on their own narratives; Both Patricia and Michel are those people. These are characters that are acting out as charactures without being real characters if you catch my drift.It's true in the film we never really know who each of these characters are but that's the point as both characters are so caught up in their own illusions and little world that they've constructed for themselves; to the point that we and probably both character's themselves don't know if anything expresses was real or not. Heck we're not even sure they know who they are themselves or if Patricia and Michel are even their real names. It's the character arcatype they constructed for themselves and the other person they fell in love with and not really each other.One of the things about both characters are that their terribly vain their almost the living definition of Vanity, as we see both look at themselves in the mirror a lot. The mirror in the film really is a big part of the film. The thing is whenever both are looking in the mirror they're not really looking at themselves but are looking at their own appearances, both really want so bad for their appearances to be their real face.Once scene we see Michel is looking at the mirror but as he is, he's constantly looking at a mirror, but he is also looking at a picture of his idol Humphrey Bogart. This isn't just admiration but as he looks at it and he looks again at his face he really feels he is that actor.Another scene with a mirror that's interesting is when both Patricia and Michel are in bed together and she is looking at the mirror but at a miniature painting of a couple and she asks Michelle a question, \"Why can't we be more like \"Romeo and Juliet?\" Answers to her question are one, you don't want to be because they die at the end and two, both characters aren't real. I really like that scene because it really tells you a lot of things, from mindset that the woman wants romance but not one that real as her eyes in that scene went to that photo of a fictional couple but not looking at both herself and Michel. In fact, it also sums up their whole relationship as we not just see both characters we never see in the mirror together but also in Michelle's pad there is never one picture of both of them as a loving couple.Though you could say this could be a little commentary on how we watch films, as all when we're seeing the screen were not seeing ourselves but other people. But sometimes whenever we watch a film, we sometimes pretend were that other person or even imagine ourselves playing as that character. This is just harmless part of imagination but however these two we see are trying to do it for real.Another thing about both characters is their both are hypocrites/contradictory, their also the living embodiment of the definitions; both do it so much to each other and themselves throughout the film.For Michel he is constantly trying to become a Philip Marlowe, or any other character Humphrey Bogart plays which are always the hero in noir. However, this guy has two huge problems, he's a blowhole and he's extremely petty which are two things the character Humphrey's characters aren't.Like for example he does for a moment do the right thing and saves a lovely woman's purse from being snatch only to pick pocket it for money; yeah, real smooth doushebag. We even see him try to imitate Bogart and put on some of the same charm/charisma but isn't good at any of it at all, even a novice impersonator can do better than him.Patricia is trying to become the romantic heroine or feme fatale like in any romance film. Despite having the lovely good looks (yeah she really does look good, definitely wears those black and white striped t-shirt and dress well) that could land her in a noir or romance film, she's really not a person I could fall in love with because there is nothing to love as there is nothing underneath that lovely surface.This I feel is a fact of life, how sometimes there can be those people that look absolute gorgeous and beautiful, but then once you talk to them, they turn out to be dull as a brick. Also she doesn't exhibit any of those qualities as the romantic characters she holds in high regard, she really has no real compassion or empathy for anyone else, and even when she expresses it you can easily tell it's phony. She doesn't even know what love really is, except probably for the image she projects, but even that's not real.There is one interesting scene where Patricia asks a question toward this celebrity who is played by a famous movie director at the time. This is a question she asks twice about what he's ambition is; the celeb doesn't respond the first time but on the second he says the memorable quote from the film \"To be immortal and die.\" This scene really sums up basically the ambition of not just both leads but also shallow people in general.However in that scene the celeb didn't answer that simple but deep personal question the first time; for people that are truly ambitious and dreamers that would be easy to answer, but he really was struggling to think about it; that moment to me shows that people that are shallow have no real ambition and dreams. Even Patricia and Michel they don't once communicate as to what more they want in life or even what their going to do even when the runaway to Italy together.But the last thing about both characters are both have no sense of reality, both obviously are people that have seen lots of movies but unfortunately haven't really left the theater. Despite all the bad things both have done and are persona wise, both don't call themselves out on it.As Michelle still sees himself as the noir protagonist that is not just trying to make a big break but also trying to set things right but is making things worse for himself. There is even an really strange scene where he goes to a caf\u00e9 to order eggs for breakfast, he gets the eggs but just simply leaves not eating. To me this is only one of two things: one, because he's on a power trip and felt like being a doushebag to the cook, but mainly I fell it's number three that he changes his mind thinking he really a character in a movie and doesn't have to eat.While Patricia still sees herself as a romantic heroine or feme fatale that is engaged with the noir protagonist's adventure or trying to find a clever way out of a relationship with the wrong man but is just wasting her time as she gets neither romance nor thrills.Reality of course dictates that both are neither of those things and the fact that the noir genre has just faded out sometime in the 50's which is why most of what their doing now, seems out of place because it's the 60's. As both leads do some stupid things to both each other and they, it's not long till reality crashes down on both leads hard. It all comes down to a conclusion that is a strange sense of relief as its reality calling both characters out on who they really are.If the film I feel has a message it's on why we shouldn't live our lives based on illusion, pretending to be someone were not. Be yourself and make a life that's real for yourself because no one can ever live in a fools paradise, for it's not real.Rating: 4 stars",

            "content": "\"I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm not free, or if I'm not free because I'm unhappy.\" - PatriciaJean-Luc Godard's debut film, Breathless, became a cause celebre of the French New Wave in the early 60s. Dedicated to Monogram, the studio that churned out endless grade-B films in the \u009140s, its raison d'etre seemed to be to work against everything that Hollywood stood for. Using jump cuts, hand-held camerawork, improvisational jazz, and natural settings, Breathless stood conventional cinema on its ear, and Godard instantly became the champion of radical, independent filmmaking. The style of the film, flashy with a nervously amoral edge, cleared the path for the directors of our day to employ avant-garde techniques to elevate movies about questionable characters into the realm of art. Breathless still feels revolutionary 42 years later but the question is -- does the preoccupation with style make us immune to the content?The film opens in Marseilles where charismatic thief, Michel Poiccard (Jean-Paul Belmondo) steals a car en route to Paris. When pursued by a cop, he finds a gun in the glove compartment and murders the policeman in the Cote d'Azur. In Paris, he steals money to court Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American who sells newspapers on the Champs-Elysees and take her to Rome. A French version of Bonnie and Clyde, they profess love, engage in banter about popular culture, tell lies, do their best to avoid intimacy, and ultimately betray each other. Both devious and self-serving, they are oblivious to the consequences of their actions, concerned only with immediate satisfaction. In the film's most discussed scene, Patricia and Michel talk extemporaneously for 23 minutes in bed while chain smoking cigarettes. Seberg quotes from Faulkner (\"between grief and nothing, I will take grief\") and hangs a poster of a Renoir painting. He professes his love for everything American, its culture, cars, movies, and women. None of this forwards the story in any way but allows us ample insight into the characters. I can't say if films like Breathless merely reflected the trend in society toward casual violence or helped to create it; however, I feel that subsequent films that glamorize criminals can at least partially trace their antecedents to Breathless. Godard has called Michel an \"Anarchist hero\". Does that mean that stealing cars and committing murder makes you a hero if you are charming enough and fancy yourself to be Bogart? I think part of the reason I found this film to be objectionable is that I could not identify with the characters and their lack of self-awareness. Yes, there is some sense of resignation at the end, but they do not appear to take responsibility for the questionable acts they performed. Both Belmondo and Seberg looked like they had fun making the film. I wish I could say the same for myself watching it.",

            "content": "I suppose, for all its bravado and reputation within the department of revolutionising a genre; a movement; a generation; etc. - Godard's \"Breathless\" is often as involving as it is out of its central relationship between a man and a woman \u2013 something you might say is as old as anything else in cinema. That said, it isn't difficult to see the influence littered throughout the film. From subtle moments involving characters and props to distinct, visual flourishes via the editing and such, the film is almost certainly an experience in a historical context. Looking beyond this, and the reputation that precedes it, the film is an involving tale of a young hood and his girl, of which the relationship is refreshingly built on an unrequited fondness more-so a romantic one, who strives to escape the country on account of being a wanted criminal. Had the approach and aesthetic applied not been as historically significant, therein remains a healthy idea about a character on the run whose tale mostly remains engaging. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Michel, a young criminally minded loner whose fondness for cars and self-confession that he sees himself as a bit of an unlikeable renegade does not immediately invite us to like him upon entrance to his world. When we ride with him in a car that he's hotwired, Godard knowingly places us into the automobile itself as we're riding along with him \u2013 it's a position we're uncomfortable with as he dictates his thoughts to us during the cruise. Michel is a man with a plan \u2013 a man with money and a woman on the mind \u2013 initially needing to find someone from whom he may attain a large amount of money owed so as to start a new life, and then that woman with whom he desires to start said new life. To an extent, Michel is representative of the braver, more dynamic French cinema people such as Godard induced through complaints via their writings for so long. Here is a man, and a national movement, that are confrontative; a duo who are both very different and yet are being asked for audience backing. They are more outgoing, more carefree and explorative who perhaps don't necessarily care what you think of them: anything to break the monotony. There is an amusing instance when Michel quite literally squares up to a photograph of Humphrey Bogart outside a cinema, this idea of a French street punk played by somebody you've probably not heard of matching a Hollywood icon's expression, as if they were equal in stature, epitomises this. After there is a snag in the attaining of the money, that woman Michel said he was going after rears up in the form of Patricia (Seberg), an American who sells newspapers on the streets of Paris. Disaster strikes when, en route to meet these errands, he is stopped by a police officer over the stolen car \u2013 Michel ends up gunning him down and fleeing. Finding Patricia, we are perhaps surprised at her resisting the advances \u2013 a lesser film may have had her agree somewhat quickly before depicting their leaving for where Michel wants to flee. When Michel remains, therefore, stuck in Paris there boils a sense of frustration out of our lead and the film itself being unable to 'advance' \u2013 a veering away from populist means when cause and effect may have kicked in and we'd be on the road already.We come to wonder how it was either of them ever got together. We discover Patricia's fondness for being very precise in the number of nights they spent together; we sense it meant something to her whereas for Michel, the man is unable to recall why it was a previous marriage even ended. An informed, philosophical girl \u2013 she earns what she earns through her modest newspaper job where the sly criminal Michel is to be on the brink of what appears to be a large cash sum in spite of his essentially evil nature. In spite of its revolutionary aura and attitude, the bare-boned story is an exercise in terrific drama and platonic fondness anyway. We observe Michel desire Patricia, Patricia come to reject Michel \u2013 a man who often gets what he wants, often able to take what he wants, this dynamic of lust for another woman combined with the pride in potentially having her conflicts throughout with the inherent danger he's in on account of being wanted for a murder. The film's inspiration is unparalleled, a meagre example one can offer might be in the form of a scene in Guy Ritchie's 2000 film \"Snatch\", wherein Jason Statham's character lists to his accomplice the means of Hare coursing across a series of cuts, each of them set about half a mile apart in three very different locations. What should have taken barely sixty seconds to explain has been stretched across a handful of jump cuts using the two-shot as a means to induce the 'jump' cut. Godard's film is energetic, involving and well-paced as the elements close in and Michel cannot sort his priorities out; one could recommend it as a piece of drama just as easily as one could a cinematic footnote.",

            "content": "Some films are simply famous without necessarily being influential, or at least not widely so. Then there are films that are not merely well known, but a significant advancement that alters cinema forever. Some of these films are artifacts that are really only worthwhile as a piece of history. Examples of this would include something like \"Voyage to the Moon\", which meant a lot to film history, but as a film, is so primitive as to be laughable. Then there are those works that function both as great films and significant steps in cinema. A number of silent films fall under this category, such as \"Metropolis\", \"Cabinet of Dr Caligari\", and \"Nosferatu\". \"Breathless\" falls into the later category, not only being one of the most influential films ever made, but also a truly great film.The plot, thin as it is, revolves around Michel (who takes on the look and mannerisms of Humphry Boggart) who is chased down by a cop he ends up shooting. The police are after him. We see a few scenes of the police questioning people and hunting him down, but it's not the focus of the film. Michel instead steals some money, gets together with a woman named Patricia, trying to sleep with her, then run away from her, and get the money he's owed.Much in the way Godard broke and played with the rules of cinema, so Michel makes his own rules, dictating his own pace. He knows the police are after him, and he does try to avoid them, yet he refuses to be inconvenienced. He does whatever he feels like doing at the time. Make no mistake, Michel is far from a saint. Yet it is this determination to do what means the most to him, however random it seems, or however shallow it seems, that gives \"Breathless\" real humanity beneath the detached way the characters act. We're watching someone who, knowing his demise could come at any moment, will make as much as he can of the time he has. Knowing that, nothing he does in this film is meaningless. Even the tiniest of things, such as him stopping to admire the humphry boggart poster, means so much more.Make no mistake, though, there's plenty else to admire about the film. The cinematography is fantastic. Using a hand-held camera and a wheelchair instead of a dolly for moving shots, we have a movie that rarely feels still. The camera is often intimately close, using only a few far away shots (often simply to establish distance between characters). The jump cuts this film is famous for are used stylistically. Even when indoors,it feels like things are in constant motion, ensuring that the film never feels slow, and even after all these years, the visual style of the film feels unique unto itself, even among the rest of Godard's filmography.Something also must be said of the dialogue. It's fast, it's snappy, topics change constantly, characters contradict themselves, make references, etc. It's certainly stylized dialogue, delivered so naturally, but this dialogue gives the film sheer entertainment value. There's just something about watching the conversations unfold that is hypnotic, almost a thing of poetry. The apartment scene in particular I rate as one of the greatest scenes in cinema.As a piece of history, \"Breathless\" is equally fascinating. While an argument could be made about what the best french new wave film is (there's certainly steep competition in that department, \"The 400 Blows\" and \"Pickpocket\" as two examples), \"Breathless\" is the defining one. The film, more than any other, that gave a sense of freedom to film makers everywhere, showing they didn't have to limit themselves to a rigid narrative structure. The jump cuts also, of course, were a huge innovation and have been used to the point of almost tedium throughout cinema ever since. There's certainly more to say on the historical side, but I don't want this to get too long.The casual viewer will likely have a tough time with this one. Unlike relatively straightforward french new wave like the before mentioned \"400 Blows\", \"Breathless\" is abstract and likely to leave the unprepared viewer bored, confused and dismissive. I warn you do not go into this movie expecting a thriller, or a film that is in anyway conventional. This is a film where characters waste time,conversations go nowhere and last a long time, and the plot is the least relevant thing occurring for 95% of the movie.I know, that sounds awful, and in the hands of someone else, \"Breathless\" would be a worthless train wreck of a movie on par with the works of Uli Lommel. Yet in the hands of \"Godard\", it is a mesmerizing film experience.",

The bedroom sequence, with its verbal-physical exchanges between Seberg and Belmondo, is riveting: mesmerizing, painfully true and witty, though nothing for lunk-headed semi-literates, for whom thought is a chore. The scene is real and to the point, so follow the argument. Get involved.One theme is the impact of American society and culture (huh?) on France. A plump, bourgeois American officer and his plump, bourgeois wife have their American car stolen by a slim, ultra-cool, Italo-Frenchman, who loves France, but wants to make it in Cinecitta. He lives a vicarious life, with imported celluloid values. Finding that Americans always, naturally, keep handguns in their car glove compartments, he decides to use the one he's handed. The American Dream becomes reality, anxiety-ridden and finally exhausting. Belmondo identifies with his cinematic other-life, to the full. It tells him how to live and die.

Breathless(1959) is about the alienation of youth and the desire to live fast and die young.  Its about a young man who's on the run after accidently killing a Police officer.  He meets an American girl and falls in love with her.\nBreathless(1959) is a tragic fable of a doomed relationship that ends in betrayal.  Plays tribute to Humphrey Bogart, Fritz Lang, Film Noir, Sam Fueller, and Jean Pierre Melville.  The film is very knowledgable when it comes to early cinema history and art history.  Jean Paul Belmondo is cool as the fatalistic Michel.  Its way better then the remake starring Richard Gere.\nThemes presented in Breathless(1959) would reappear in other Godard films as in My Life to Live(1962), Band of Outsiders(1964), Pierrot Le Fou(1965), and La Chinoise(1967).  Throughout this movie are many references to different great works of art, cinema, literature, and music.  The late Jean Seberg does splendidly in her debut as the American girl who falls in love with Michel.  This film has been disowned by Godard after he went into his Maoist period.  I think that Jean Luc Godard disowns Breathless(1959) because its more a Truffaut type of film then it is Godard.\nBreathless is based on a story by Godard's then close friend and fellow film maker, Francois Truffaut.  Michel Poiccard seems to be a little like Truffaut and some parts of the film are a little autobiographical.  Godard hero, Jean Pierre Melville has a major role as a Policeman. Breathless(1959) is a big influence of Melville's masterful, Le Samourai(1967).  Claude Chabrol is another French New Waver who got involved on this movie by doing Production Design.",

But, it's not really America we're talking about, but it's what the author knows of America (Bogart, Thunderbirds, Cadillacs, Westerns, Eisenhower, etc.).  I believe that if all the American references had been made to things French (Jean Gabin, Citroen, Charles de Gaulle for instance), and if the Jean Seberg role had been played by a French actress, the movie would have been extremely banal and would have never gotten the notice that it got.  Much like if the title role in \"Chocolat\" had been played by Courteney Cox.",

A director would pay attention to matters of pacing, tone, and characterization when shooting a picture.  Godard is too busy making `cinema' to do any of these mundane things.  The result is this excruciatingly boring arthouse favorite, which has a reputation for being more influential than it really merits, unless those little jump cuts in the editing count.  Back in the old revival house days, we usually attributed hops and skips like these to the worn out print the theater was showing. The middle 30 minutes or so are devoted to Seberg and Belmondo lolling about in a small hotel room mouthing vacuous, pseudo-intellectual banalities, which they seem to be saying more to themselves than to each other.  (E.g., Seberg: `I don't know if I'm unhappy because I'm free, or if I'm not free because I'm unhappy.'  Honey, if you don't know, I sure can't help you!) Seberg also participates in another time-wasting sequence: a press conference with smug-windbag real-life director Jean-Pierre Melville, who is given to such pronouncements as a desire `to become immortal, and then to die.'  Belmondo plays a thoroughly obnoxious thug who likes to make faces in the mirror like Bogart.  When he's not out robbing people or stealing their cars, he casually shoots a policeman who is pursuing him.  You could care less when he's eventually killed, since Godard seems to be more interested in arcane references to old movies than in telling a story.  He's dedicated `Breathless' to the old Monogram studios, which made ultra-low-budget quickies during the 30's and 40's.  Sitting through one of them would be infinitely more entertaining than suffering through this overrated dud.",

This term refers to a disparate group of film-makers whose main connection was the fact that they were all French and that they set out to challenge established cinematic conventions. One of the most well-known members of this group was Godard, and \"Breathless\", his debut feature, is often considered his most successful work.Whether this is his most successful work or not, it is certainly his most iconic. It features a roguishly charismatic Jean-Paul Belmondo, who is involved in an increasingly frenetic attempt to evade the law. This is due to his becoming involved in a series of petty crimes, which eventually culminate in murder. It also features the inscrutable and adorable Jean Seberg: the nouvelle vague equivalent of the femme fatale. Her uniquely short hair and striped top almost instantly making her a style icon of the era.The film is stylish and enigmatic. At times it is fast-paced using pioneering editing techniques, particularly the jump cut which removes all extraneous content and focuses directly on the action. This aspect of the editing means the film exudes a sense of self-awareness in the way it alerts the audience to its construction, something film-makers at the time were supposed to avoid. But Godard's innovative style brings a sense of freshness and vitality to his work and showed how cinema could expand beyond its previous confines.Breathless is iconic in the way it embraces a changing Parisian landscape at the beginning of the decade and in the way that it brazenly attempts to reinvent an art-form. The theme of rebellion is the film's driving force, it dares to challenge the established order and helps to define the era in which it was made.",

As well as that, the film, just like Hong Kong's hue-saturated auteur Kar-Wai's masterfully structured, humane, moving-Impressionist-portraits, is one few that purely encapsulates, if detachedly fractures, a whole romance within a short hour-or-so. The two protagonists, two lovers, might as well be real--they tease, laugh, learn, talk, live, love, hate, betray...they are both universal and forcible--they don't spew quirky one-liners and haul, even heave their alienating, stereotypical personalities and petty, melodramatic social-cum-crisis; something that sadly cannot be said for films today. Main character Patricia Franchini said it best: \"Informers inform, burglars burgle, murderers murder, and lovers love.\"The premise renders simple at first greeting; Michel, a man running from the law after killing a policeman, runs off to be with his beautiful girlfriend, Patricia. It's a smidgen-bit tawdry, kitschy way to craft something belonging to such a medium known for such great artistry, and it has been seen many times before here and there.And then they talk to each other.Their deep arguments of hate, happiness, unhappiness, freedom and love is a sweeping one. Their nature is sophisticated; they are disenchanted freelancers in a caustically desolate atmosphere that feels terrifying, quite simply unfair--but life assuring. Every second of the film gains an increasingly cosmic breath and life, and the relationships grow more and more in dynamic intimacy. By the closing minutes, everything is romantically vigorous, fizzing with verve, and leaves you--and I say this truthfully, not as a referential pun to the title name; breathless, but alas, this ravishing, self-reflexive, self-devouring mood mix abruptly ends with a great bang.With the ending, which I won't spoil, a quasi-comedy ends in full-on-tragedy in one of the most iconic, penetrating, devastating and embodying scenes in cinema--to make a great romance is pure magic today, and people must realize that budgets, stars, black and white are all superfluous and overestimated for the outcome of the film--sometimes, all you need is a bit of love and a lot of thinking.",

One of those Roger Ebert \"Great Films.\" I was delighted to spot the use of jump cuts here. I can see how influencial it might be, \"modern movies begin here,\" according to Ebert, but as beautiful as it looked (the filming and editing process employed in that regard was great, the lighting, etc) it did feel a little empty to me (story wise). For example an enourmous amount of the movie, probably not as much as I thought though, concerned a bedroom conversation, or series of conversations snipped together, which in some ways felt like best bits pinched from a fly on the wall capture, with minimal narrative development - felt very natural, but caused me to wonder away somewhat. I suppose it offered a glimpse into the lives at the foundation of all this.I felt a little flat towards it's ending, and how it came to pass, left me a bit baffled really, the police element was also a bit crap - the police seeming a little \"Carry On\" in some ways, without being funny, just naff. In addition I didn't much like the americanised translation, which in some ways heavily leaned on American Noir style dialogue of a somewhat earlier era (anything involving criminal behaviour and police anyway), rather than letting it be it's own thing. Maybe I should just learn French, which may make it feel a little different - though I suppose my own internal translation may be a bit off too, compensating in such a way. There were some great lines of dialogue though, some contemplative moments. I started off with 7/10 in mind, before I started writing this. The more I think about it I am however swerving towards an 8/10, subject to the vast majority (excluding the police bits) feeling very natural indeed - then again I can't speak French. To a French person this might all seem wooden, but to me it felt very natural and real.",

            "content": "A character study about Michel ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ), a young criminal who acts tough and tries to be like Bogart, and Patricia (Jean Seberg), an American who sells the New York Herald- Tribune. Patricia's involvement with him seems to be purely because of her curiosity towards his affection and his strange, comical behavior almost identical to the one which is shown again in \"Pierrot le Fou\". Jean Seberg's acting is ridiculously dull and her expressions throughout the film are almost as uneventful as the plot of the film itself. Jean- Paul Belmondo's acting on the other hand, although full of style is still unconvincing. You cant really blame him though, his character's persona is just not in any way believable. The level of detachment and obliviousness is simply too extreme. The Film's music is also absolutely horrendous, I doubt I could recall a movie that has a genuinely worse soundtrack.However, the truly disgusting thing about this movie, is the amount of jump cuts Godard forcibly tries to stuff down our throat, it makes me wonder whether the films last lines were really referring to Godard himself.Out of boredom ( due to the films basically non-existent plot ) I couldn't help but resort to wondering whether these extremely disturbing 'jumpcuts' were necessary. The answer, which is also the answer to most French New Wave films is yes and no. If the film did not contain these 'jump cuts', many of them purposely used in the most unconventional way possible, the film would not have its historical importance and status of being revolutionary. The jumps cuts in this Film have no real purpose other than to rebel against cinema norms at the time and attract attention as a result. In other words there was no 'message', 'deeper meaning' or even aesthetic purpose behind them. Its only purpose was to distinguish this film, which without all its pretentious bull would be no more than a boring, poorly written and poorly acted character study, from all the other boring, poorly written and poorly acted character studies. The Film instead is a NEW, DIFFERENT and MODERN boring, poorly written and poorly acted character study. These days the film is met with enthusiasm, mainly because without objective standards, style is valued over substance and originality is valued over genuine merit. Although you cannot deny the historical importance of this film as a cinematic landmark, you can definitely question it. There's no harm in rebelling against norms to create effect but never at the expense of overall enjoyment. Breathless however, simply rebels for shock value and to standout as something new, different and as most New Wave fans would put it 'Bold.'",

I do not normally do this with films, because it may scar my overall feeling of the film by hearing how the director had gas throughout the production, so I stay clear. The director of this film, Jean-Luc Godard is considered the Godfather of the French \"New Wave\" movement. I had to see a film by this man. I had to see what a film made back in 1959 has brought to modern cinema. While I was impressed with the style in which this movie was filmed, I was not impressed by the actors in the film. This was one of those movies that I could have watched without the sound. While the director uses film techniques that are now the standard in Hollywood, the actors that participated in this film left more to be desired. I know that I have used that phrase several times in this review, but it is my general feeling of this film. I went in expecting WAY too much, and came out with the feeling of sand falling through my fingers.The shots of the actors talking to the camera, the quick camera shots, and the cryptic story are amazing to see, but you can sincerely tell that he was experimenting with this film. The actors talking into the camera you can tell are reading their lines, forcing French words out of their mouth, while trying to bring the audience into the picture, into the world that these two main characters are trying to create. Then there was the quick camera shots which made me feel as if Godard was having a heart attack instead of bring artwork to the silver screen. Finally, there was the cryptic story. So many times you find yourself trying to keep up with what these characters are doing, what they are talking about, or who they are interacting with. I felt that sometimes their interactions were too minimal, while others were too long and in-depth. This film WAS interesting to watch because you can see traces of Scorsese, Tarrantino, and even Stone in this film, and where these 21st century directors learned their techniques. I would bargain to say that without this film perhaps there wouldn't be any of these three directors making amazing movies today. BUT that still does not mean, by any means, that this was a great movie. I actually hated this movie. I hated the characters the most. I could live with the story ... I could live with the new film techniques being used, but I could not ... and should not ... have to live with the characters. The actor and actress that carried the main parts in this story were, to be honest, horrible actors. I could not get into any of them. In Michel's final scene, I was looking at my clock wondering how long Godard would leave the camera on him, or if it would just be over with so I could get to my next film. Patricia was unbelievable and confused. While this film is trying to build a love story, you instead get bombarded with philosophy and art instead of love. I think Godard was trying to build a love story using these elements, but it never happened. Therefore, when Michel's climactic scene arrives, we feel nothing for him. Perhaps this was what Godard wanted us to feel, but then it does not go with the rest of the film.Overall, I do not suggest watching this film. I have read other reviews that talk about how film students need to watch this film to fully respect the field, but I would have to say \"I can't\". I would give up on film if this was the best-of-the-best. Grade: * out of *****",

            "content": "The part that Jean Luc-Godard played in The French New Wave was tremendous. This film, with its innovative jump-cuts, catapulted Godard into international fame. His film, Breathless, as well as collaborator Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows, put the New Wave on the map for good. Breathless, like Truffaut's masterpiece, is a mysteriously beautiful film. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Michel Poiccard, alias Laszlo Kovacs, a french criminal running from the police. He meets with his lover, Patricia Franchini, played by Jean Seberg, in Paris, where she works for a newspaper. The film focuses on the dynamics of their relationship, or rather, their lack of a relationship. One of the most famous lines in the film explains it best: \"When we talked, I talked about me, you talked about you, when we should have talked about each other.\" Considering that this is Michel saying this to Patricia adds so much more to the revelation. Michel is a small, somewhat odd-looking fellow who despises fear and loves sex and movies. In one scene, Michel stands in front of a poster of Humphrey Bogart, from The Harder They Fall. This is just one example of the methods Godard uses of foreshadowing Michel's fate. Patricia is an intellectual, interested in art, music, and literature. She is the more mature one of the two, contemplating the deeper meanings of life and love, while Michel is only concerned about sex and money. Belmondo and Seberg have an interesting chemistry together, very much like Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde (1967). The dialog is brilliantly witty and Martial Solal's moody, jazzy theme is somewhat reminiscent of a Thelonious Monk recording. The jump-cuts brought a new technique to the screen, but I can't say that they are done particularly well here. Granted, Godard, practically hacked away at his film with a pair of scissors to shorten the length of the film, thus happening upon what would become a new technique. Overall, Breathless is an enjoyable romantic crime drama, with the style of a film noir, and a twist at the end that leaves its audience Breathless!",

Even the great Hitchcock working in America at well-financed studios produces his masterpieces with great deliberation and finesse creating a plastic art. So Godard mixes improvisation, street scenes shot from within a box on a wheelchair and captures Parisians as they really are in their banality, in their recognizable humanity, and therefore, the thrill of humankind in recognition.The Belmondo character smokes his fat Chesterfields exactly like Bogart, his gangster screen mentor. So the director interjects his admiring eye on American film actors within the storyline. Belmondo impersonates Bogart, his many personal screen quirks, but then the stoic Bogey is exaggerated, a modern stalking horse for future punkdom. You could almost see the coming swinging 60's five years in advance as Belmondo and doll-like Jean Seberg prance about Paris, breaking the stodgy rules of their 1940's,1950's parents, making love on a whim, making banal, pseudo-intellectual references, outlandish statements \u0096 I've had lovers, many, anyone I see, blahhh blah, I'm pregnant \u0096 so what \u0096 let's get under the sheets, banality under amazing visual setups in a plain room for thirty minutes. Then there's the cuts from moment to moment, a two or three minute cut to the same shot with the car driving through Paris \u0096 a parade of diplomats \u0096 a policeman on the trail of Belmondo interwoven, so we have the effect, especially in black and white, of a documentary spliced together by an amateur.These are all very original ideas, which I think along with One Life to Live make Godard a heavy weight in the pentathlon of great directors.",

I suppose I have to take a lot of peoples word on that since it came out almost 60 years ago. It is the stuff of film history as it ushered in the French New Wave (an oversimplification I am sure) and gave birth to an era of lightweight cameras and sensitive film stocks that made film making a more accessible art form than it had previously been.Compared to the films that would build upon it, the jump cuts, audio sampling, and guerrilla style exterior shooting is almost unnoticeable today unless you are told it is there, mostly because of the prevalence of a similar sort of style of editing we see in online videos all the time today.That is a bit of a problem for this film. Not because the film doesn't do it well but because what was revolutionary in its day is old hat to us. That leaves the film with only its story to stand on and, frankly, I just don't think that it is there.The story is two main story lines Intersecting. One is a romance and the other a crime thriller.In the crime thriller we have Michel who goes by an alias at times, trying to get by in Paris. He isn't exactly a successful criminal as he never seems to have cash and, since at the very start of the film he kills a police officer, it doesn't seem like he is all that great at dodging the police who are trying to hunt him down.In the Romance we have Michel trying to woo and American girl Pat, into running away with him. They have been together a few times but leaving her studies and join his life of crime might be too far for her.The main issue with the film for me is that I just don't find Michel to be a likable character and the two of them, as they talk at length about love, seem to know nothing about love at all. Watching them woo each other, kiss, and lounge about lazily together is about as romantic as watching two monkeys have sex.I was really disappointed by this film. It gets thrown around with \"8 1/2\" and \"The 400 Blows\" but I honestly felt that it was my least favorite of the films that many would put on their Movie Mount Rushmore. The Teddy Roosevelt that stands on the side of the mountain but is in no way on the same level as Washington or Lincoln.",

            "content": "Breathless is a film by Jean-Luc Goddard, a French realist who jumpstarted the New Wave French Movement (a topic of which I am ignorant but am aware of its poignant impact on cinema in general). French society has spawned some of the greatest artists, and quite frankly, look around. The dazzling coffee shops, the architecture of Paris, the salient Eiffel Tower, and the picturesque scenery are all examples that reflect the artistry that is driven by these people. Breathless, a film made at the start of exploitation in 1960, effectively makes a statement about the ever changing world and about French artistry at its finest.The film's story was conceived by Francois Truffaut who directed Les Quatre cents coups. Truffaut has a talent for realism behind the silky black & white; Breathless is a successful experimentation of that. It is edited and directed in a contemporary quick-cut style that inevitably reminded me of David Fincher and Martin Scorsese. And while cinema has progressed in precision, Breathless yields a distinctive filmmaking style that is totally endearing.The film is borderline style over substance, but I'm thankful that the collaboration between Truffaut and Goddard found a solid equilibrium. It follows an impetuous scoundrel named Michel Poiccard. Michel is a self-described \"A-hole\". This argument gives him reason to exude little to no remorse for the people around him. It also permits him to take life as easily as possible. He's a ramshackle character who steals francs and cars like he's switching cigarettes. The accessories may always change, but not Michel. Goddard makes a vivid point early in the film where Michel stumbles outside of an American cinema, mumbling \"Bogie's\" name as he lights a cigarette and fumbles at his lips, as if in a reverie. These idiosyncrasies are not innate but influenced by Western cinema. Michel has seen one too many movies as he dodges the cops, crassly handles women and carelessly occupies the lives of others.One such life is a young multilingual journalist named Patricia. Michel tantalizes and lusts after her. Maybe it's because she's fluent in different languages. Maybe it's because she's pretty, but Patricia denies this cosmetic cause, citing Michel to have lusted after dozens of prettier women. I think it's because she's an American. The unscrupulous cad tries cross-culturing Patricia with his frank cynicism and constant swindles. Patricia is wooed, but only so slightly. Her knowledge of French culture is limited to a learned education of Chevalier and Lafayette. Maybe it's Michel's outlandishness that attracts her. She remains on the defensive for the duration of the film, often succumbing to his riley charms before making a detrimental decision in the end. (By the way, that scene elapses in a photography studio. Can the French get any more artistic?). The lovers are unusually paired, but effective in this case. The male is a Westernized Frenchman, the woman is a French-influenced American. They are from opposite spectrums of their own cultures but uniformly alike when they are together. For that, I commend the writing.Breathless is a mural of jazz, sex and crime, served with an artistic twist and finished with a photogenic ambiance. As the Criterion release put it, \"There is before Breathless and after Breathless.\" The movie has the power to move cinema\u2014since 1960 it has taken our breath away.",

            "content": "I saw this film when I was sixteen and remember thinking how cool and hip it was at time. French New Wave they called it. And what did I think of 'Breathless' fifty years on after viewing the anniversary DVD. Well, I'm not sure which I found funnier, reading the other comments eulogising over Jean-Luc Godard or the movie itself. This exaggerated snapshot of Parisian sub-culture circa 1959 simply does qualify as a 'Great Film'. Great films are like great music. You would not say Tchaikovsky's Pathetique was a great symphony for 1893: it is a great symphony this or any other year. Gone with the Wind and All Quiet on the Western Front are great films because they are as watchable now as they were when first produced. I have watched both 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg' and 'Un Homme et une Femme' in the last six months.Both films are of the same decade as Breathless but survive much better. Suffice to say that Breathless may have wooed them in 1960 but it wouldn't today.Each generation has produced films which seemed chic and fashionable on opening but which quickly become nothing more than clich\u00e9s for the period in which they were produced. They became nostalgic and amusing reminders of a seemingly more innocent age. It is however worth watching this film for no other reason than seeing Jean Seberg. She is mesmerising.I remember falling in love with that beautiful face and she even made bobbysocks seem cool! How tragic it is that she died so young. Yes, this film is a collector's item but I'm not sure it's necessarily for the right reasons. I can't profess to being a Godard devotee. In my opinion he's over-hyped but people continue to go into intellectual overdrive to express their admiration of his style. Anyone though who can produce a blockbuster on a shoestring budget does deserve some respect. He would seem to be a director that is above criticism and that is is ridiculous.

            "content": "In Paris, he needs to collect some money from a friend and meet an American girl who he seems to like. One third of the movie is shot in Patricia's hotel room, while Michel tries to convince her to sleep with him and to run away with him to Italy. He convinces her of the former, but when the latter becomes a definite possibility, she turns him in to the police. Instead of running away, he decides to wait for the police and go to prison. However, when the police arrives, a friend of Michel's throws him a gun in a last attempt to save him. The police panics and shoots him. The film is shot in black and white with a hand held camera.There are four interrelated facts about Godard and his film that make a new historical outlook ideal. First, Godard was extremely aware of his medium's connection to other modes of expression, especially literature, philosophy and painting; and his style included a conscious attempt to demonstrate this interconnectedness. \"The cinema is not a craft. It is an art . . . One is always alone on the set as before the blank page.\" Godard saw himself as an author and wanted to integrate his literary influences into his film. Furthermore, in wanting to break away from the rules of film making, he made his connection with literature as obvious as possible: Breathless is filled with direct quotes from authors like Faulkner, Dylan Thomas and Rainer Maria Rilke, among others. Probably the most striking feature of Breathless is its cinematographic style. The lives and thoughts of the characters are echoed by the camera movements and editing innovations Godard has made. Of these, the most important are the jump cut and the quick cut. Godard invented the technique of cutting out a few feet of film in seemingly random places. This \"jump cut\" produces a rhythmic, unsettling pulse in certain scenes. Michel is seen lying in Patricia's bed, and in the next he is walking out of the bathroom.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Breathless is the way the story line and the filming style come together to make a coherent philosophical statement. The primary question is, why is it that although Michel is an unambitious, untalented, immoral punk, the audience is able to ignore these traits and sympathize with him? The answer lies in the fact that everything Michel does is done with an extraordinary style. He is open, flamboyant, and cheerful and his actions, however meaningless or amoral, reflect this attitude. \"You must never break,\" Michel says to the audience while driving his stolen car in the opening scenes of the film. In another scene, there is a poster which says, \"live life dangerously to the end.\" This reminds one of Nietzsche's advice as given in the Gay Science, This style possessed by Michel would not be enough if Godard hadn't shown everyone else in the film as lacking even this. There are basically three types of people in the film: the masses, who are like apathetic, unaware zombies (for example, a man is hit by a car, and people hardly notice; Michel runs down the street after being shot, and hardly a head turns.); there is one attractive hard working character, and Michel takes advantage of her by stealing her money, and there are two serious and committed characters, the police, and they are made to look absolutely ridiculous.Godard shows us a world that is immoral, senseless and empty. Everything lacks a reason. \"Why do you want to make love to me?\" asks Patricia in the bedroom scene. \"Because you're beautiful\" \"but I'm not beautiful\" \"OK, then because you're ugly\" Michel is the only character who is able to recognize and take advantage of the situation by being amoral and uncommitted with passion and cheerfulness. He is sensitive to his environment. He likes the sun, he likes France, and he is depressed by ugly architecture. Of course he is egotistical, but according to the Nietzschean view of a meaningless world, this is a good thing. Michel takes advantage of the lack of dictated meaning to create his own meaning and \"create poetry from nothingness.\" He invents his life and his past as he goes along. He claims that his grandfather drove a Rolls, he says he can only stay at the Claridge (a very expensive hotel), he says his father was a clarinetist, among other stories. Michel isn't caught up in the seriousness of searching for meaning. Furthermore, he is unafraid of the ultimate nothingness: death. The omnipresent end of life just makes his present actions more poignant and intense. And since all has equal seriousness, all is permitted! The next question is why is Michel so attracted to Patricia. She represents a negative version of himself. However, unlike Michel, she is unable to throw herself into the nothingness. She falls in love with him at the moment she learns he's a murderer, for only then does the impossibility of permanence become evident, and when the escape to Italy seems plausible, she turns him in to the police. Breathless is an attempt to show life as it is when one has repudiated a false morality and succeeded in living cheerfully without ultimate reason.Today, fortunately or not, we are less easily shocked by the message of present day films with similar immoral themes (Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction come to mind). Who knows, maybe Nietzsche was right. . .",

He not only ignored The Rules of filmmaking; he thumbed his nose at them. This may be enough to endear him to immature film students because of the rebellious nature of youth. This sentiment is usually reinforced when they learn that he is a life-long Communist, which is like, so cool! (No traditional bourgeois filmmaking principles like \"Telling a Story\" for Godard. How liberating!) Unfortunately, it is also the folly of youth to believe that New & Different is somehow synonymous with Innovative & Better - a notion has clouded the judgement of many seemingly rational people old enough to know better when it comes to their assessment of what constitutes Art. Watching early works of Godard like \"\u00c0 Bout de Souffl\u00e9\" and \"Pierrot le Fou\" reminds me of a child exclaiming, Mommy, Daddy - look at me! Look at what I'm doing.\" Nonetheless there are actually two good reasons why you should bite the bullet (or take a stiff drink) and watch \"Breathless.\" The first is the very 50s-ish jazzy score by Martial Solal, which totally fits the film and captures the atmosphere in the disjointed and somewhat crazy scenario (such as it is.) The second reason is the incomparable Jean Seberg. You will become captivated by her as soon as she appears on the screen, but then you will fall hopelessly in love with this utterly charming gamin Am\u00e9ricaine when you see her slowly walking on the Champs-Elysees calling out, \"New York Herald Tribune\" with newspapers that she is trying to sell bundled in her arm.Godard famously said, \"All that you need to make a good film is a girl and a gun.\" At least he was half right.",

            "content": "Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\" has all the hallmarks of ground-breaking Nouvelle Vague cinema and definitely was not what people were used to in the early Sixties. Which was the point. Fed up with \"tradition of quality\", of studios producing the same established, reliable, money-making pictures over and over again, Godard as one of the rebells against the establishment makes a film with broad strokes that resolutely goes against the tide. As the director's very first feature it's a distinctive exclamation mark of a new beginning era, shakes things up, in every way fresh and different. Part of Godard's revolutionary crime drama are also Nouvelle Vague combatants like Truffaut (story), Coutard (cinematography), Melville (director in acting role) and Chabrol (as technical adviser). The cast was no less audacious: while one of the leads was up and coming (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the other one had only experienced failures in the US (Jean Seberg) and the whole thing could only be shot on a shoestring. Nevertheless or because of all that the movie stands solid as a rock in its defiance of conventions, is bold and innovative, raw and experimental. The film strikes new paths how to depict the unhinged protagonists' way of lives, embeds a criminal and his insecure girlfriend in an overtly realistic scenario with mundane situations, peppered by sharp dialog and the famous jump cut editing. With all these parameters \"Breathless\" feels loose, cool and very French. It lives from its contradictions, by exploring the space in between: It's a noir that is not a noir, a love story that cannot decide if it wants to be one, an exercise in unprecedented style at any rate, a film with a new feel to it. Not everything works, as would be the case in subsequent Godard films, but in this case the picture's very distinct artistic character makes up for it.",

            "review_title": "An aesthetic and stylish avant-garde masterpiece",
            "content": "\u00c0 bout de souffle is an extremely complicated film. We could tackle its analysis form different points of view, although I think the most interesting is that of the aesthetic evolutions of Godard's cinema.We will begin however by talking about the story and characters of the film. Truffaut collaborated with Godard writing an everyday story about a sexy scrounger and criminal played by Belmondo that turns out to be the story of his last days. In this story is strongly implicated an American girl, the object of Michel Poiccard' s passion and an important key for the development of the story, as well as some other side characters that act as a background. The story of Poiccard's chase and death is just an excuse to put a dramatic end to a series of situations in which the main character finds himself and in which Truffaut's script twists and turns and aesthetic art by Godard find their way. I do not find any specially interesting characteristic of the story, except maybe for the context in which it takes place: Paris in the late 50s, and the bohemian and charming life of an American student and a French rogue together. Characters are a step ahead. Although they star in a common story, they are amazingly complex and rich, and so is the relationship between them. Michel and Patricia are the only two main characters and their relationship is the real core of the film. I would say there is a lot of surrealism in the way they act, talk and react. Both of them, but specially Michel, act like children, their humor go up and down and sprinkle incoherent and confused comments. The long 27-minute take in Patricia's bedroom shows us a dazzling conversation in which both characters change positions, play around (covering themselves with the blankets, , for example), talk about trivialities (the posters, the ashtrays) or really deep things (Faulkner thoughts) and  pull faces and do body language (the lips gestures or the mocking faces in the mirror). This, together with the action expression by Godard about which we will talk later, make this scene quite interesting. Although it is so long, it is not boring. As we have said before in the scene they talk about many different things, but action spins around a core topic: sex. Michel desires Patricia and turns around her like an animal, but a charming one. I like how sex is treated with ambiguity: let us remember the first scene in which Michel visits the script girl: they have most probably had a relationship before and she is getting changed in front him, a sexually-appealing scene when she is backwards. However, nothing happens, Godard only wants to insinuate. Another beautiful and sensual image is that in Patricia's room: when she just arrives, Michel is lying on the bed, looking at her, and she opens the window and we can see her silhouette against the light from the street. Godard goes on with ambiguous scenes, and he shows us the first kiss between Michel and Patricia, but we do not know if it has been a real kiss or not, it is kind of unreal. We will later realize that they  have had sex. Thus, we have Michel, a machist but charming man obsessed with Patricia, and we have Patricia, the American girl, extremely beautiful and tempting, she is independent but also weak. She is more complicated as a character than Michel is. She is not sure: she makes out with the American journalist, shows resistance to Michel but finally yields, however, she does not know if she loves him. And when she feels a little bit pressured by the police, she gives him away.  There is another character I liked: the writer that is interviewed in the airport: he states controversial opinions about love, women and life which I cannot help connecting with Michel's way of life. Maybe we could take this writer as an intellectual alter ego of him? In fact, Patricia seems very interested in him.What I most enjoyed in the film was the vanguard treatment that Godard gives to action. I firstly thought of a kind of audiovisual cubism. Cubism in painting shows reality deconstructed in many different sights of a same object. In his film, Godard breaks up space a temporal continuity to show us what he wants us to see. This has amazing aesthetic effects. He uses it in the car trips: Michel's car and the taxi, to give a sensation of movement, of travel. At the end, there is a moment when Michel interrupts her talking, and the continuity is also interrupted, giving a very vivid effect. Finally, camera movements are as excellent as those of Godard's comrade in the New Wave, Truffaut. Particularly amazing is a 720 degree turn of the camera in the scene where the French policeman first talks to Patricia in the store.",

It is, simply, the first attempt to show the dichotomy of modern life through film.It depicts a life where philosophers and thus in turn common thinkers, have attained a level of such balanced morality that while right and wrong form a large gray area, good and evil are very clear cut and such is the very definition of modern times.The fact that Kovacs (the main character) is a criminal, that is, the fact that he steals to survive comfortably in this world, is never portrayed as an evil characteristic. However, when he kills it is. This may seem like a contradiction, but if you think like an existentialist it is not. Stealing is in one way or another, \"earning a living,\" and in fact many people who maintain \"legal\" professions are guilty of it as well, yet it is overlooked by our government and society. So the fact that the film remains playful when Kovacs plots to, and actually commits the act of stealing should come as no surprise, simply because society has evolved to accept these types of criminals as human. However, once you become a murderer, you become something else other than just a human. You have tasted death, without being subjected to death.What makes the movie even more interesting is the fact that the main character is in love. Nothing could be more human than love, and that forces the viewer to forget his sins and take pity on him, for he is struggling to be loved back. This is the genius of the films story because this scenario raises the question of fate. Do one's actions effect something called \"karma\" to the point where you can be doomed to eternal damnation or blessed with eternal bliss? Of course the films objective is not to answer these questions, because who could prove the answer one way or another: we do not see the actions of an almighty hand, if such a thing even exists. It's objective is to simply pose the question so that debate will ensue, and what ever decision one makes based on that debate will in turn determine the fate of the world. It is important to note that the films rhetoric does not dismiss, or even question, the existence of fate, just that we create our own fate through our own actions. Which is of course one of the ultimate existential questions.Although the film seems to provide an answer, it denies a conclusive interpretation of that question because we never know if Kovacs was in fact redeemed in life or death, by capturing the heart of his female counterpart.All this makes the film the first post-modern story on the movie screen, and this fact is of course reinforced by the technical aspects of the film. The jump cuts, never before seen on screen, completely hand-held cinematography, renegade low-budget production, all contributions to this film's qualification as the original post0modern classic.This film is simply the most important indie film and the number one must-see for all critics, autuers and aspiring autuers of indie film. No question.It is also noteworthy that all of Jean-Luc Goddard's films are variations upon the same theme, each beautifully and differently played out.",

I had a couple issues with it, but overall, it was a pretty impressive film, and I'm glad I watched it.After a small time car thief named Michel Poiccard shoots and kills a policeman, he reunites with a love interest named Patricia Franchini as he attempts to convince her to run away with him to Italy, all while trying to avoid the cops.This is arguably one of, if not the most influential movie of all time. It has made many contributions to cinema that have been used again and again in other movies. When it was originally shot, the filmmakers attempted to film it differently than how most films were shot. They used real locations instead of man-made sets and it was filmed in mostly natural lighting. Raoul Coutard, the cinematographer of the film, said \"When we were shooting Breathless, we tried to film it the way news reports were shot, i.e., with a hand-held camera and natural lighting. In other words, for me it was very much like filming in the heat of battle.\" Also, since the cameras they used were very loud, Jean-Luc said the lines to them as he filmed it, and he edited their voices into the film later. These differences made it stand out from other films.However, what this film is perhaps mostly known for is its use of jump-cuts or discontinuity editing. Jean-Luc got the idea for this in director Jean Rouch's 1958 film: \"Moi, un Noir\". Jean-Luc was a huge fan of that film, and it's credited as a major influence for this film. However, Jean-Luc gave his own interesting twist to this concept. Instead of jumping from one scene to another, he would cut short clips out of the middle of scenes to shorten the films running time to 90 minutes instead of just removing entire scenes altogether. This caused some of the scenes to skip from moment to moment. This gave some of the scenes in the film a jagged and fast-paced feel. Essentially, what Godard did was take an already existing cinematic technique and add his own, unique style to it to spice it up or to change it around in an appealing way.Also, since Jean-Luc didn't have that big of a budget, being that this was his first film, he had to make use of what he had and try to find clever ways to cut down on cost. Godard had to film in locations that he already had access to, use cameras that he already had access to (the entire film was shot by using hand-held cameras), and he hired people he knew to help work on the film. Often, he would film on the streets of Paris without any permits. At some parts, cinematographer Raoul Coutard would film scenes while sitting in a wheelchair as he was pushed along by crew members.I've spent a lot of time discussing its influence, but now I'm going to talk a bit about what I think of its story.I thought that it was really interesting how Michel was slowly able to gain Patricia's trust as the film went on. At the same time, Patricia had to decide whether or not she should stay with him or inform the cops that she knows where they can find him. As the 2 made their way through Paris, there was always a slight amount of tension since Michel's face is everywhere in papers. Also, people often happened to be reading them when he would be going by. There are also a few scenes in which people recognized him, and he had to escape the area quickly.However, there are 2 flaws (mostly minor ones) that I had with its story.The first one is a minor complaint towards its intro. I felt like it rushed the entire intro scene when he steals the car, murders the policeman, and meets up with Patricia. It seemed very fast-paced to a point where I could hardly keep up with it. I wished for it to slow down a bit to an enjoyable pace. I was a bit worried that the entire film would be like that. Fortunately, it wasn't, but my complaint here does not vanish despite this.My second issue with the film is not as minor as the first one, but it bugged me a little bit more. This complaint is about the predictability of the films ending. After Patricia informed Michel that she did tell the cops where he lived, and that they were coming for him, it became clear to me what was going to happen next, and I was instantly able to figure out how it would end. It became obvious which direction the movie was going to head in next. I wished that they revealed it in a less obvious way than that. For example, they could've revealed it right when they were about to drive away, and the cops could show up right after that revelation. My issue might still exist in a few remnants, but it wouldn't be nearly as glaring.In conclusion, I really liked this film, and I can respect it for its huge influence on cinema history. It did many things different from most other films, and it showed that you don't have to follow any rules when writing films. I did have a couple issues with its intro and outro, but other than that, I liked everything else about the film. I can understand why it would be brought up on \"best movies ever made\" lists and I'd probably add it too if I made one. It has had a huge impact on cinema history, and I can respect it for what it's done.",

            "content": "Godard's breakout bombastic \"Breathless\" is a true middle finger to 1960's french film state, inscrutable with its emotional direction and utterly enchanting with the overall execution. The story follows a small city thief experiencing a head on encounter and carnage with a french policeman, being the cool cat role that early 30's Jean-Paul Belmondo was born to play, he (Michel Poiccard) attempts to convince a hip journalist to engage in an epic odyssey with him.\"Breathless\" (and or Godard himself) was highly essential for the momentum of french new wave, the kind of saturation the wave was lacking, re-introducing a rough assembly feeling to wonderful effect, feeling continuous but never to\nexcess, perhaps because Godard playfully wrote each days shooting script at dawn.So first, the elephant in the room, Jean Godadard and his frantic hip editing style, this was the film where he truly created his trade mark jump cut, and whatever pretentious symbolism has been attempted to conjure up from this style is totally irrelevant, \"could it be the embodiment of the naive adults carelessness and naivet\u00e9 depicted in the films story\" you say while stubbing your toe on the exposed concrete beams you got installed in that dim glass penthouse you own. truth is, it's just there to contribute to the films overall uber cool tone. Carelessness? Sure, but in a lot less elaborately thesauraused video essay way.Now, the enthralling, and abysmally stupid, never not smokin' a cig characters, truth be told, I think these men and women are masterworks, they juggle the line between \"The Conformist\" and \"The Third Man\" so gracefully it is hard not to be mouths a gape at the wonderful execution of each small stupid little detail. Every decision and personal little moment throw ever stackable heaps of logs into a small raging unending fire of psychological scrutability, Michel wears an uneven fedora with a creased collar and a dark tie drained of its colour by grayscale, he is the kind of kid that makes faces in the mirror, trying desperately to imitate those who he loves from the silver screen, and the femme fatales wear stripy turtle necks and long coats with an absurd amount of pockets, they have laughably short hair, and speak only with their nails kissing distance from their lips. It is small funny and ludicrous details like these that create rich characters.This was an intimate fun little review on a film I enjoy, and hopefully it has provided some insight from a fellow spectator of cinemas opinions, and thank you Godard for disregarding the obligatory french flicks of late 1950's, spawning generations of endless creativity and something truly unique.",

Its strength is the casual way in which it is presented. Whereas most movies give the viewer the impression of watching a movie, \"Breathless\" appears to be a direct glimpse at life itself. The continuously roving camera and the unusual camera angles create a sense of freedom seldom encountered in the movies.\"Breathless\" demonstrates the auteur method of film-making, in which the director is really the star of the picture. The manner in which the film is shot is as noticeable and integral to the final product as the actors and the plot are.Unconventionality is what makes \"Breathless\" distinctive and allows a movie with a sparse plot and a detached treatment of its characters to work as an unusual and ultimately satisfying viewing experience. Intellectual satisfaction.I appreciated \"Breathless\"'s technical innovation and creativity but I didn't ever feel a connection with the two main characters so I would not call \"Breathless\" a complete success. It was long on style and short on substance. A movie that revolves around two characters who are not likable due to callousness and shallowness is courting disaster. The movie lacked FEELING.",

I mean the Tarantinoesque narrative structure and the visuals - especially the jump cuts which Ridley Scott uses ad nauseum are no longer unique. However, here they look and feel fresh.What really makes A bout de Souffl\u00e9 relevant even today is the wonderful no-rules narrative structure. A good example: smack in the middle of the film, a good 20 minutes are spend in a bedroom with Belmondo trying to get Seberg to make love and she doesn't want to. Not because she's a prude. In fact, we never really get to know the reason for her reluctance. His method of trying to entice her is by touching her bottom and her method of rejection is a swift slap on his left cheek! There are dozens of visually arresting moments in this film and at a brisk 90 minutes, its never boring. And the musical score is great too.",

It displays accessible characters through an accessible narrative and on the whole it agrees with the Hollywood conventions of time, space and linearity. However, Goddard employs some original techniques never seen before in Hollywood. Belmondo talks to the camera  freely, which heightens the audience participation, the characters openly converse about sex, which creates a degree of verisimilitude and the protagonist dies, which heightens the tragedy at the film's conclusion.If, like me, you thought Goddard was being crass when he said, \"all you need to make a film is a girl and a gun\" then watch this film and you might be pleasantly surprised.",

            "content": "Although moist of the films that I watch derive from Japan, China, or South Korea, I have decided in recent months that I want to expand the number of movies that I watch from Western countries. While I still have a hard time stomaching a number of American films, I have been watching a few French films that I have enjoyed. I found Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samoura\u00ef to be quite outstanding and I enjoyed Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl. Also, being that my nearby independent DVD rental place carries many of his films, I have rented a few of Godard's films. The first one I watched was Band of Outsiders which I found to be quite enjoyable, but the next two films, Tout va bien and Contempt left me quite cold, the former because I found it to be pretentious schlock and the latter because simply I was not in the mood to watch the film. I did enjoy Masculin f\u00e9minin: 15 faits pr\u00e9cis though although, at first, I thought it was a bit pretentious as well. Another film that I watched was Godard's debut feature length film \u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9 or Breathless.Now, I am far from an expert when it comes to French film, but I understood that Breathless was the film that set off the French New Wave of cinema and that it and Godard also had a major impact on Japanese New Wave directors such as Oshima Nagisa and Imamura Shohei. If this is truly the case or not is not important, what is important though is that this film has had such an impact on not just French film, but it supposedly revolutionized film-making in general. However, while watching the film the first time, all I could think was \"what is the big deal?\" Breathless tells the story of Michel Poiccard, a young car thief who lives day by day engaging in petty crimes and trying to sleep with as many women as possible. One day Poiccard is spotted speeding by a cop on a motorcycle. Being that he is in a stolen car at the time, Poiccard shoots the policeman and hurries off to Paris. Broke, Poiccard tries to get money from his girlfriends who include the twenty-year old American Patricia Franchini who works as a journalist. Poiccard desires Patricia to hurry off to Rome with him, but without money this is nothing more than a pipedream. With the police hot on his trail, how much time does Poiccard have and does Patricia truly want to go with him and, although she is supposedly pregnant with his child, does she truly love him? Supposedly one of the key points of Godard's style of filming was the importance hand-held cameras played in that they were used on location and removed the making of the film from the studio so it lost some of the overly slick look of films made in the studio. Also Godard's use of jump shots is to be noted as well as the film's slick jazz soundtrack. Does all of this equal an enjoyable film? I think it leads to a passable one with some good moments and a film that opened doors for the New Wave of film sweeping France.",

            "content": "As much as I'd like to think that, after two exciting years, I've been well-and-truly inducted into the world of cinema, I'm really still an amateur. I hear the term \"French New Wave\" and immediately become intimidated. What's it all about? Hand-held photography, jarring jump-cuts and pretentious philosophical musings? It was with some trepidation that I approached Jean-Luc Godard's '\u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9 / Breathless (1960),' supposedly the cornerstone of the French movement, though I was somewhat reassured by a brief plot description that sounded uncannily similar to a modern urban thriller: \"a young car thief kills a policeman and tries to persuade a girl to hide in Italy with him.\" In many ways, 'Breathless' is just like a contemporary film. The hand-held camera-work has a gritty, documentary-like immediacy, and a dynamic freshness that wouldn't arrive in Hollywood cinema for another few years {Sidney Lumet's 'The Pawnbroker (1964)' is the earliest example I can think of}. Stylistically, even recent thrillers like 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007)' and 'Michael Clayton (2007)' owe a lot to Godard, as curious as that may sound.Both leads are excellent in their respective roles. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a Humphrey Bogart-wannabe, an out-of-his-depth car thief who speaks tough, but whose brave frontage is immediately transparent. His character works effectively as a semi-affectionate satire of Hollywood's hard-boiled film noir heroes \u0096 ripped from the pages of Hammett, Chandler and Spillane \u0096 who don't actually exist in real life. Jean Seberg, an American actress who only found success after migrating to Europe, is beautiful and sensual as his independent some-time lover, who finds excitement in the notion of a fugitive boyfriend, but has yet to decide if she loves him or not. As far as the romantic subplot is concerned, Godard emphasises the selfishness of his new generation. Love is no longer an intimate and enduring connection between two people, but a succession of lurid and meaningless sexual encounters. Though Michel and Patricia frequently speak their love of each other, their motives are purely egocentric in nature. Each character frequently alludes to their own needs and desires, and Patricia eventually informs on Michel to prove, for her own benefit, that she is indifferent to him.My only previous Godard work, 'Alphaville (1965),' had sufficiently intrigued me with its half-satirical espionage thriller set against a backdrop of science-fiction. However, when the narrative periodically came to a standstill, so too, I found, did my interest in the film. 'Breathless' gave me similar sentiments, albeit to a lesser degree. While never boring, there is a sizable patch in the middle of the film \u0096 in particular, a long scene spent inside Patricia's apartment \u0096 where Michel's status as a wanted man is entirely forgotten. The film's narrative drive comes to a grinding halt, and the two characters are left in limbo. When he's not trying to entice his American companion into bed, Michel raises seemingly arbitrary philosophical questions \u0096 such as, out of nowhere, \"do you ever think about death?\" \u0096 that apparently serve no purpose other than to justify Godard's film as an important \"arthouse\" picture. Much has been said about the pioneering use of jump-cuts, a creative trick to trim down the running-time without losing key scenes, but I found the technique unnecessarily jarring and unpalatable.",

I suppose that in order to meet the \"minimum expectations\" part of the previous suggestion, you might have to quit reading this review, go see the movie, and come back here later.No, seriously, go.OK, still here? Good. Now, I don't have much of a background in the French New Wave - my thought is that many people use \"Breathless\" as an introduction to the French films of the '60s. Fair enough - it's among the more accessible pieces I've seen in my limited exploration, although not as rigorously inventive or well-made as a movie like Godard's \"My Life to Live\" or a couple of others. Some of the film's charm comes from its majestic documentary-style shots of Paris cityscapes, which are wonderful but not entirely so different from a PBS travelogue.What it IS, on the other hand, is one of the more fascinating, nihilistic, romantic films ever made. Michel and Patricia, the doomed semi-couple at the heart of the film, are two of the least appealing human beings ever to take up screen time. Michel, a petty thief who kills a cop at the beginning of the movie, is irritatingly pretentious, manipulative, and amorally violent in a way that the film does not excuse so much as shrug at. Patricia, an American student, is vapid, overly compliant, and completely capricious in her decisions - she seems to spend most of the film demanding attention from Michel while completely avoiding any sort of commitment or meaningful connection. This having been said, these are among the most believable characters I've ever seen, despite their irredeemable awfulness. Part of this is that both actors are extraordinarily, uniquely attractive - Belmondo looks like a French Kennedy, while Jean Seberg is - well, she's Jean Seberg in \"Breathless\". She's like a composite model of cool, cosmopolitan beauty. My point is, though, that the characters make sense as Godard's vision of how some beautiful people act - the sense of entitlement that comes along with having immense surface charm.The movie's piece de resistance, of course, is the 20-minute long conversation that Michel and Patricia have in and out of bed in Patricia's apartment. It's a movie unto itself, a mix of hipster non sequitirs and emotional gamesmanship that takes on a kinetic quality - if there's a more watchable conversation scene outside of a few Woody Allen movies, I guess I haven't seen it.",

Therefore in simple terms: Hollywood is a nursery tale for adults, a traditional narrative structure is essential, as is the notion of hero and villain. Whereas French New Wave investigates humanity and the circumstances of life, it is high art, quite different to the popular culture of America of the time. Godard uses real time as we see Michel walking calmly down a flight of stairs leading to an underpass. The audience watch him blend in with the environment and the camera pans right to patiently wait upon the Arc d'Triomphe for roughly four or five seconds. Before the audience starts wondering about Michel's whereabouts, the camera pans right again to complete about ninety degrees to witness Michels's miraculous arrival on the other side of the road. This amazing piece of camerawork is genuinely astonishing because it demonstrated his perfect choreographic skills down to the split second. Interestingly Truffaut while directing 400 Blows (a reflection on his earlier years) showed a personal touch, which is sad and endearing. A scene at the climax of the film shows him reaching the sea and as he helplessly turns to look at camera, and as the camera closes in on his distraught face we realise he has no where to go, his environment becoming his eternal trap...",

            "content": "Jean Luc Godard apparently 'exploded' onto cinematographic centre stage with 'Breathless', labelled the fore-runner of French cinema new wave. 50 years on its hard to see what the fuss is all about.The film operates in two distinct temporal dimensions: the beginning and end segments are fast paced and furious, sandwiching in between the requisite French moody dwelling on life discourse shared through a fog of cigarette smoke, enigmatic glances and languid stretches on an unmade bed. Which is what the main protags Michel and Patricia seem to do for a fair chunk of the film.The opening sequence sees Michel travel down Goddard's favourite road in France (the exact same one he features prominently later in the Weekend), a tree lined asphalt cut through sun scorched flat plane. Michel attracts the notice of police for a minor traffic violation and decides the best course of action is step on the pedal and play chase. When a cop does eventually catch up with him, Michel pulls out a pistol and shoots him dead. All of this transpires within five or so minutes, and I'm left wondering: but why? Why? Who does this? Why shoot the cop for nothing and bring down the long arm of the law on yourself? Well, my dear, I can hear Godard saying, we've got to start this movie somehow or other, just go with the flow, cherish the 'rebel without a cause' style of Michel.Next up, Michel meets up with American Patricia, whom he's known for three weeks and seems to have fallen for. Patricia stumble-bumbles about in her Twiggy hairdo, bobby socks and long pleated skirt and her poor French accent which we are blessedly spared from overuse, as she tends to be monotonic, mostly saying things such as 'I don't know', or 'Its all the same thing'. A blander non character I've never seen. What Michel sees in her remains a mystery, both to him and frankly to me. Patricia does, however, have some sort of avante-guarde visage for a 1960 film: she seems to be a slut, through and through, which would have been novel for the time. I can't figure out if making her an American slut wasn't a political machination on Godard's part: in order to spare the 'purity' of French girls? In any event, as Patricia reels off various conquests, I'm doing mental calculations; when did the Pill debut? Surely it wasn't around in 1960? How does Patricia get away with it, then? Well, she doesn't, it turns out. She's pregnant. Not entirely sure who the father is, but most likely candidate is Michel. Oh, and puffing on ciggies non stop. Maybe they didn't know back then?....Now follows the bed scene. God, the French love their bed mis en scenes, remember 'My Night at Maude's' here. An hour of rolling around on the bed, chain smoking and trying to be brazen about love, life and everything under the sun. Just as I felt my eyes beginning to glaze over, the gruesome twosome finally decided to get out of bed and hit the Champs Elyzee, which is always a treat to see through out the ages as it were. Michel finds out he is a wanted man by the police, so he decides to run for it: next port of call: Italy. Can Patricia please come with him? No, Patricia can not. She likes all the bad boy antics, but when it comes down to it, she's going to marry some straight and narrow guy, live in a house with a white picket fence and have 2.2 children.All fine and good, but why, oh why does she have to call the police and give Michel away? This seemed an unnecessary tactic. Michel refuses to run because, he says, he is tired. Again, incongruous and out of character for him. He is in his early twenties and has so far displayed a casual devil may care attitude to life. How did he get tired all of a sudden? Is Godard in a rush to wrap things up and so throws everything into a one pot Massala for a grande denouement? Yes, he does. Grande ending ensues within next five minutes with gun shots and Michel prostrate in the 'foothills' of the Eiffel Tower, making funny faces at his beloved. In a rather powerful finale gesture he closes his own eyes pre-mortem and expires on cue for brilliant theatrical effect.Still, what the hell just happened here, apart from a Frenchified homage to Bonnie and Clyde? Godard is so much better later on.",

Overall, I found it an interesting example of history of film and it shows how much modern films have been influenced by French cinema in the 1960's but it wasn't exactly something that made me feel \"greatness\" such as I felt watching, for instance, 2001: A Space Odyssey, another favorite of these polls.

Belmondo delivers a powerful performance which actually generated a new person, a brand new stereotype in cinema, by the device of a certain improvised acting, the image of a fellow, cigarette in mouth, hat on the tip of the head, a cynic character , always answering back with irony and irrefutable lucidity . A direction of a stunning virtuosity of a vivid offhanded, cam on shoulder , sensational and bitter dialogues , nervous and precise editing . Thrilling , \u00c0 BOUT DE SOUFFLE leaves us out of breath .

This is one of the films that started the french new wave movement, with an emphasis on minimalist plot and breaking traditional plot/story techniques. I get that it's had a huge influence on later decades, and that many of the great films of today wouldn't exist without it. That said, this is not a fun movie to watch. I found the dialogue and soap-opera-ish conversation of the two leads to be boring, and their acting did not draw me in. The plot was, as mentioned, pretty thin; it's more like a day in the life of a criminal versus an actual story. The references to other films were interesting, but overall not enough to keep my attention for long. The jump cuts - again, influential on later film - were jarring. The soundtrack/scoring was actually pretty good, probably the best part. Overall, this movie has just made me not want to watch any other new wave movies.",

In \"Breathless\" these are the heroine as an American newspaper reporter interviewing an author of a new book as he compares European and foreign love;the hand wound cameras roll,we see the 1959 tape reels turning: Belmondo as the fugitive doesn't think twice about felling a man in the toilets with a rabbit punch (perhaps fatally) to steal his wallet:he makes off in someone's car with Seeberg and gives a fellow gangster (?) the \"high five\" (long before it ever appeared in the US). A defining moment might be when he pulls himself up as he stares at a poster of Humphrey Bogart advertising \"La plus dure la chute\"----the harder they fall.....as if predictive of his fate.

The scenes between Belmondo and Seberg are beautifully and intimately done. Seberg radiates on the screen and Belmondo as a Bogart fanatic is a brilliant touch as well.

It is OK to watch this film in bed on a small b/w TV. But whether or not you chose such a nostalgic setting, it is definitely OK to watch it a hundred times. The film is about style. It breaks rules and surprises us with fresh editing. It delivers an atmosphere which is hard to beat. Do not make the mistake to believe the protagonists are seducing each other. They are solely seducing you. The naturalness of the famous bedroom talk is a performance. It is,however, a performance which is particularly enticing because of its off-beat naturalness. By the end of the film at the latest it becomes clear who is ultimately addressed: Jean Seberg looks directly into your eyes. The story of the mysterious women is repeated once again but expressed strangely and beautifully by Jean Seberg. Whereas the hard-boiled gangster turns out to be a shallow copy of the romantic hero represented in western cinema, the heartless and mysterious femme fatale embodies the audience par excellence: she does not only watch the hero's actions with detachment, she also repeats his gestures, she constantly asks questions and then finally she turns to you for answers. Thus, ultimately the film is not about gangsters or femmes fatales but about cinema itself. It pays homage to the classic American cinema and provides at the same time the best example of innovative European cinema. It deconstructs former cinematic rules and accelerates breathlessly with innovation.",

            "content": "This classic from the New Wave has aged like a subtle Bordeaux\u2014perhaps a bit brackish at times, but still potent and sublime. It is memorable but not for everyone's taste. A joyride in the country turns into a getaway when Michel, the antihero gangster, turns his gun loose on a cop after a traffic violation. We don't have enough time to question his motives because in the next breath we are in Paris. We see Paris from the point of view of a passenger whose face is pressed against the car's window. In Paris, he finds his former lover (Patricia) selling New York Herald Tribune newspapers on the Champs-Elysees.We sense that Michel knows his days are numbered. He has killed a cop in cold blood, and all of Paris wants him caught. His nonchalance is gripping yet frustrating. The plot (as in other New Wave films) is forgettable. Michel's character is part Humphrey Bogart (a poster of whom Michel stares at in Breathless), part nouveau roman antihero. He's the bad guy we're supposed to like.Michel's character is the spine of this film. He lacks the sort of remorse and softness that characterize movie heroes. That's the point. He is insistent in making love to Patricia. A cigarette is never far from his lip. He apes other people's facial expressions. Those who argue that his character is bad are falling prey to the sort of gut reactions that Godard explores and rejects. Godard introduces a then-revolutionary technique in Breathless: the jump-cut. This method breaks up the action and gives the film an energetic, fresher feel. Godard is a master at playing with the length of each cut, restricting what we can see and leaving the rest ambiguous.The film feels young like the director himself and the characters. Patricia sleeps with a teddy bear and has a tom-boy haircut. Michel is fearless and carefree, like many adolescents. This film is Godard's first feature film (he made at the age of thirty, after a Swiss documentary).The film is also important for its references to American films and cinematography. Godard loved American cinema, and was influenced by Hollywood directors. The references to the Cahiers du Cinema (a film critique magazine) and other films are a noble homage to his influences.Watch this film. It isn't long (about 87 minutes). Criterion Collection's translation is intended for North American audiences, but its re-mastering is top-notch. The film's score is marvelous. It's a classic, but not a tedious one.",

If it weren't for the fascinating disjunctive script, I would think that this was just a series of head shots of these 2 beautiful people.I would also like to know what Seberg's relationship with Godard was. You must see it so you can at least know what references mean in other film reviews.  The guy's a no-noodnik, but he is VERY sexy with no sex scenes atall.

But what should be kept in mind is that those techniques were unheard of at the time of its release, Godard reinvented the art of film-making in ways that can be seen to this very day. As for the plot, \u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9 was almost an homage to the Hollywood flicks of the '40s and '50s, there was particularly a scene with Michel looking at posters of Humphrey Bogart on a movie theater in admiration and longing.The new techniques and influential value are not the only thing that make this a masterpiece, \u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9 has one of the strongest scripts you'll likely to see on the screen. There is one particular scene in the middle with Michel and Patricia talking in a hotel room, no action, nothing happens, even the discussion is nothing more than casual chit-chat, yet it is still highly intriguing that you can't take your eyes off of it. Every utterance, every word is brilliantly placed even if it has no bearing on the events of the film, a quality that mocks the tradition of crime films where everything has to mean something and lead to something. Godard's script is like life, meaningless in most parts, it just goes on and on emphasizing the characters' empty lives and their moral dualities and that is why it is so effective.A special mention has to go to Jean Seberg and especially Jean-Paul Belmondo who is memorable in his portrayal of the wanna-be hip criminal with his cigarette and spot on delivery, he makes Michel interesting with a subtle sense of desperation and unfulfilled ambition. The supporting cast does a solid job in keeping up with the main characters as well.\u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9 is a must viewing for any movie fan. Its influence on cinema is remarkable, and unlike many influential movies that have nothing but new techniques to show for their merit, \u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9 has a solid story and script that makes it worthy of every acclaim it has received.",

I literally cannot believe the comments that i saw from other people. This film is appalling, shocking not even worth reading the title. I shall refrain from bad language, but i shall let you know that is what I'm thinking. The editing to start with is unbelievable, its jumpy, completely irregular and completely inhibits your viewing of the film. I know this film was made in the sixties but thats no excuse. Some great films were made in this time AND THIS FILM Definitely ISN'T ONE OF THEM. The acting is poor and the continuity is non existent. Not so good. lifeistricky",

I've heard so much about this film through the years that I was expecting it to be something that I appreciated but might not necessarily enjoy, that along with my not really enjoying most of my prior Godard film experiences. Much to my surprise then when I found it both thoroughly engaging and entertaining, I was kind of relieved that I enjoyed it as much as I did. Not much progress occurs with the script, I mean the two leads don't provide much forward movement with their dialogue and yet I found their characters very interesting and watchable. The credit here in large part goes to the two leads, especially Belmondo. Of course the film is famous for the handheld camera work, spliced editing, score elements. Some found that these elements hadn't aged well, but for me they held up favorably. Yes, my first viewing of Breathless is here in 2021 and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

            "review_title": "Godard's Classic Contribution to Hollywood Culture",
            "content": "Directed by Jean-Luc Godard and written by Francois Truffaut, Breathless was Godard's first feature-length work, and one of the earliest, most influential of the French New Wave movies. The literal French translation, \u00c0 bout de souffl\u00e9, meaning \"at breath's end\", makes more sense as the film comes to a close. As well as heralding the New Wave genre, Breathless gives a heartfelt nod to American crime movies with Jean-Paul Belmondo as Michel Poiccard, a would-be gangster, pridefully modelling himself on Humphrey Bogart, assuming his mannerisms and adopting a devil-may-care attitude at all times.After shooting a policeman, Michel goes on the run (but not really a desperate run - he's too 'cool' for that ), turning to his American girlfriend, Patricia Franchini, played by Jean Seberg, for intimacy, money, and support in dodging the police. Michel comes across as a somewhat misogynistic, selfish, narcissistic, nihilistic young man who seems to care little for the results of his actions and yet there is a subtle vulnerability and sadness about his bravado and one gets the strong sense that he is still 'searching for himself'; his cutting remarks and cynicism perhaps covering up his basic insecurity. Jean makes an excellent counterpart in that, while appearing to be in love with Michel, wants to foster her own independence and not be 'dependent on a man'. There is much to love about this very 'French' film, including the classic silences after one or other of the lovers has declared something fairly life changing e.g. Patricia telling Michel she is pregnant and him retorting (after a lengthy silence) that he needs to make a phone call, or go see someone. Michel and Jean are in love but, for both, it is sometimes more of a nuisance rather than an exhilaration; Michel's feelings are neatly summed up when he says to a friend \"and to make matters worse I love her\".Jean-Luc Godard's tribute to Hollywood and American culture is groundbreaking and the casual promiscuity and crime risqu\u00e9 for the times. The fun, jazzy soundtrack, quick camera cuts and deliberately unpolished cinematography create a certain sense of urgency as well as 'lightness' as Michel ducks and dives to avoid being caught. Apparently Godard used plenty of improvised script throughout and this 'stream of consciousness' gives it a 'breathless ' feel. Michel's character puts one in mind of an 'angry young man' or a 'rebel without a cause', the end of his crime spree being poignant and pointless. It is the end of the movie that I liked least but I suppose it was inevitable and even cleverly ironic as Michel had voiced his disgust with 'cowards' throughout the film. I would recommend 'Breathless' as it is truly unique, inventive, radical and influential and certainly a grand achievement for a first time Director.",

And then right away he commits a murder.  How perfect is this?  He doesn't stop to think but just does something.  He takes a life and then for the rest of the movie tries to convince his girlfriend to runaway with him.What does the title mean? I realize Breathless is the English translation, but breath is the basis of life and this is what the movie is about: life, love, and the lack of both.  It is thus ironic that the thief chain-smokes, polluting his own breath as he gasps for air, the fuel of his very own existence!And when he finds a gun, the taker of life/breath, he isn't shocked or put off, he just accepts the gun for what it is, rolls down the window, looks at the trees, sees the sun, and shoots it.  Genius.  He is trying to shoot the sun - the essence of life itself, the very provider of his own breath! Genius!See this movie at least twice and pay attention to the groundbreaking editing!  When the thief and his girlfriend are driving, the film cuts to *same* angle shot of the girl,  literally showing the fragmented nature of their relationship.  He is trying to fuse the gaps between them, but does it work?  See this movie!!!",

            "review_title": "Gallic Genius",
            "content": "A couple of facts for you: firstly, the original idea for the plot came from Francois Truffaut. Therefore, Breathless represents a synthesis of the talents of two great directors, which come together to create a near perfect film. Compare it with Truffaut's 'Tirez sur le pianiste', which deals with similar themes bit with much less style; the combination of Godard's stylistics with Truffaut's feel for plot is a winning combination.Secondly, the film represents Godard's (and Truffaut's) obsession with American popular culture, particularly the pulp gangster film. But this is also mediated through a European intellectual tradition that sees the director as auteur and is not afraid of the introduction of philosophical ideas into film. So you get both the homage to 'Bogey' himself (Humphrey Bogart) with art house trappings - a trick Godard also pulls off, almost as successfully, in 'Bande a Part', which uses a plot from a US crime novel. Godard's films never fall to the level of their influences, but incorporate and comment on them. In a word, the success of 'A Bout de Souffle' is synthesis of many different modes of film making and cultural traditions. If I was going to be really pretentious I'd talk about the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin here and his notion of heteroglossia, or the incorporation of different languages and voices into a single work. But I'll leave that for another day.",

But at the beginning of the sixties the dialogue and the action show here was breaking and provocative. Like the movie pretends to be. It was directed by J.L. Godard, written by F.

Instead, it gives it a certain character, that I personally find entertaining.I did puzzle over the stoicism of the main female character. I wondered a few times if maybe she was just a bad actress. Then I just accepted it as a personality trait, and combined it with all the films other oddities.Maybe that's it.
