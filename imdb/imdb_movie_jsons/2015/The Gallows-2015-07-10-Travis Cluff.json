            "content": "Twenty years ago, a student died in a high school play called The Gallows. Now the school is putting on the play again, with a jock who can't act as the male lead. The jock's irritating friend convinces him the play will stink and he will be embarrassed. So, along with another friend, they sneak into the school at night to trash the set so it will be cancelled. But they are discovered in the act by the play's lead actress and then everything goes to hell as the four find themselves trapped in the building with the vengeful ghost of the boy who died in The Gallows.Another found footage movie trying to find a hook in a played out horror subgenre. It has most of the usual found footage problems, including my favorite: characters continuing to film the terrifying goings-on in the movie even when all logic would dictate they should drop the camera. One particularly galling scene is when one character is running for his life and has to climb a ladder to escape the hangman ghost thing (don't ask). The guy holds onto the camera with one hand the entire time he climbs the ladder. I mean, come on, that's beyond stupid and unrealistic. The characters are very annoying in this. The guys are the worst, with Ryan Shoos giving new meaning to the word obnoxious and Reese Mishler having a slack-jawed wide-eyed expression on his face the entire movie. I can only assume he calls that acting. The highlight of the film is when Ryan's character calls Reese's character a bad actor. That the characters also share the names of the actors just made the scene all the more enjoyable. I'm sure Ryan loved getting to say what he was thinking about his fellow actor without breaking character. The two girls, Cassidy Gifford and Pfeifer Brown, are fine but ultimately forgettable. It's not a scary movie in any way. The beginning is very boring but, once it gets going, it at least manages to keep your attention. You probably won't like it much but try to stick with it for the unbelievably corny ending.",

But it's common knowledge nowadays that it's become a clich\u00e9 and a cheap gimmick for studios to save on production costs. Most of the time, there is almost no effort put into the film's storyline, characters, or scares. The Gallows certainly doesn't help its case. Pros:-A few decent performances-Good production design-Has the potential to be scaryCons: -Insufferable main character-Bullshit plot twist that makes no sense-Plot itself is nonsensical-Relies on cheap jump scares-Has a few good ideas, but they're usually screwed up somehow.-Found footage style is given no explanation3/10 (Horrible)",

            "content": "The Gallows (2015) *** (out of 4) During a school production of The Gallows, a prop goes horribly wrong and an actor is killed. Flash forward twenty years and the school is putting the play on again. The night before the show the lead actor and his two friends break into the school to damage the property when they bump into the lead actress. Soon the four are trying to find a way out but realize that they're not alone.THE GALLOWS is a rather strange movie because I started off hating the picture with a passion. I really do mean that I hated this film because I thought the first twenty or so minutes were incredibly annoying. I thought everything about the \"found footage\" film was annoying and especially the character holding the camera most of the time. For the life of me I couldn't help but wish something would happen to him because he annoyed me to the point where I wasn't enjoying the movie.As I said, the first twenty minutes are pretty bad but once the horror elements start and once the characters get locked into the school things really pick up. I really love found footage movies when they're done right and I think THE GALLOWS is extremely well-made and well-acted. As with the best films in the genre, what makes them work is how the camera just floats around and you're mind prepares you for something scary to happen but you just never know when it's going to happen and this just builds up more suspense.For my money there were plenty of very creepy scenes throughout the picture. This here is certainly the most important part but I'm not going to provide any spoilers so I won't go into any details about what exactly happens. I will say that the look of the killer was very creepy and it certainly helped keep you on guard throughout the ending. I also thought the four actors were extremely believable and good in their roles.As I said, I really hated the first portion of this film but a film like THE GALLOWS is made to scare you and I must admit that the film got the best of me and in the end I had fun with it.",

            "content": "Twenty years ago in the small town of Beatrice, there was a terrible accident that took place during a presentation of the play \"The Gallows\" at the High School.Charlie Grimille, who was the understudy, filled in for the lead on opening night, but ended up swinging from the noose on stage during curtain calls.In an attempt to honour the anniversary, Beatrice High School's drama department decides to revive the play in an attempt to put the past to rest.Pfeifer, the star of the show, discovers her co-star, Reese, and a few of his friends, sabotaging the props one night. But when they are locked in the school with no cell service and no way out, they soon discover Charlie isn't at peace.....When I first saw the trailer for this, I was completely blown away. It was terrifying, and straight to the point. Boom!! The Gallows, girl gets noose around neck and gets dragged away. Trailer done..The film is very different, different as its a complete mess, poorly written, poorly acted, and quite incoherent. We basically spend the mercifully short duration watching teens waste their phone Batteries filming pointless walking back and forth down corridors.On the odd occasion there is a figure holding a noose, but what's horrid about it is that it looks like Kane Hodder on occasion, and totally throws you.The characters are wholly unlikable, and it all ends like you'd expect from a film that cannot decide where to go, abruptly.The bit from the trailer is there, and it's still good, but your eyes will be so rolled back in disbelief that you'll probably miss it. Better still, just watch the trailer, you'll save yourself less anger than having to sit through this rubbish.",

            "content": "I knew The Gallows would be bad. I knew that it wasn't going to be my cup of tea but I love the movies that much that this was the only thing left I hadn't seen so in I went. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever laid eyes on but its the worse thing I've seen in the theatres in a very, very long time. I am constantly amazed how these films are still managing to get wide theatrical releases. I absolutely despise the \"found footage\" genre. Please kill this genre!! I mean, the movie is bad enough but add in the stupid concept of \"this is real, this was filmed on iPhones\" or whatever and it is even worse. Actually, if they just filmed this and any other found footage film like a normal movie it would be exponentially better. I've seen movies that had decent enough stories that are literally ruined by the found footage style. Yes it saves money but how many people would see it and enjoy it more. The Gallows though is poorly written, poorly paced with some very moments of terribly bad acting. It feels like it takes forever to get to the point (another usual issue with these movies) because they are dragging out a concept that doesn't have enough to be feature length. The Gallows further suffers by the fact that they try to give it an intellectual plot twist that is ridiculous and eye-rolling.The actors all portray people with their real names...because that makes it more real? They all have their moments where they are decent and are properly portraying their horribly stereotypical high school roles. Ryan Shoos is our main \"popular kid\" bully who films most of the movie. He is appropriately obnoxious and by the time he gets killed off you're actually glad to see him go because he's such a bully but he also gives one of the better performances in the film too. Reese Mishler is the misunderstood jock turned \"theatre geek\" and he is okay and has these big puppy dog eyes but man oh man does he have some moments of really bad acting. It almost seems like they had no script and suddenly he has no idea what to say. Its ironic that part of the film is how bad of an actor he is on stage in this play because his portrayal is equally as bad. Pfeifer Brown plays opposite him as his love interest and fellow theatre geek. She suffers from the same fate where some of her dialogue seems to get lost and she stumbled through not knowing what to say next. They have no chemistry but she does better than some of them. Cassidy Gifford certainly looks the role of the popular cheerleader, the girl is a stunning beauty and actually she gives a decent performance. I would almost consider her the scream queen of the film because her emotional break down is at least believable. She perhaps overplays it just a little but she's still at least decent.Every movie of this type is trying to carbon copy the only great found footage film and that was The Blair Witch Project. And then they attempt to copy the biggest financial success which is the Paranormal Activity franchise (entirely over-rated as well) so you have a blend of these two things and then they are trying to be creative and unique which I am convinced in this genre is literally impossible. Every scene feels the same and while there are a couple of jump-worthy moments and one particularly creepy scene (which has been done before too and better) the movie falls flat. I was bored...it was forgettable and I thought to myself several times that they needed to get on with it and that's a bad sign. The film is squarely aimed at a late teen demographic with the girls showing plenty of cleavage and the characters being so stereotypically \"teen.\" It doesn't surprise me in the least that writing directing team Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing are just making their foray into big screen but my question is HOW?!? How do they get this very very average straight to video fluff released into theatres? And it makes money because it is so cheap to make. Don't waste your theatre cash on this...watch it at home if you must or if you're one of those die hard fans of this awful horror genre. It was forgettable and silly but wasted a couple of hours for me I guess. 5/10",

Twenty years later a theater group at the high school decide to do another production of the play. However, several students take it upon themselves to sabotage said production by sneaking into the school late at night so they can trash the set.This film certainly starts with a jolting bang and concludes on a pleasing dark note. Moreover, writers/directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing do manage to generate a reasonable amount of tension and creepy atmosphere. Alas, the laborious opening third proves to be a real slog to get through. Worse yet, the three kids who sneak into the school to vandalize the set are extremely annoying and unlikeable, with obnoxious wisecracking troublemaker Ryan rating as by far the single most hateful and irritating of the rotten lot. The deliberately sloppy hand-held cinematography doesn't help matters much as well. Fortunately, the game no-name cast all give perfectly acceptable performances and the despicable jerks all bumped off in highly satisfying nasty ways. An okay time-waster, but overall nothing special.",

            "content": "So apparently the plot of this movie is that in 1993 a school is doing a play called the Gallows. The character August played by Charlie Grimille something goes wrong with the props and everyone sees Charlie being hung dying infront of everyone. So in the film 20 years later which would place the film year 2013 the play is revived i am guess as a tribute to charlie. 4 Students break into the school at night and are haunted by a unseen spirit.There is so many things wrong with that i don't know where to being. The acting is decent i will give that to them. But the whole movie lacks really much of a story. Pfeifer tells Ryan your not suppose to say Charlie on stage it is bad luck kinda like a Macbeth thing. Okay fine and well but why is it bad luck? Why can't you say it has the play ever been done after the accident? How did they get the idea to redo the play? When Reese discovers his father was suppose to play August not Charlie question remains why did his father call in sick? Was it truly a accident or what? If one of the students is suppose to be Charlie's kid born after his death wouldn't that put them being 19 or 20 call me dumb but by then you should be out of school. This movie is just so awful really don't waste your time watching it. Don't bother reading the \"Fake positive reviews\" Because shows people don't know true horror movies.I always said a horror movie doesn't always need blood, gore, nudity etc long as it has a great story behind it a story that does not leave more questions then answers. This movie lacks that as you get more questions then you do answers. Found Footage movies should either go away or be made to look better then this bs! So i give this movie a F actually it is so bad it really doesn't deserve a grade",

            "content": "In October of 1993, the students of Beatrice High School in Beatrice, Nebraska put on a play called \"The Gallows.\" A last minute casting switch had an understudy playing the lead role, who's character was hanged before the townspeople at the conclusion of the play. Due to a horrific accident, shortly after the actor, named Charlie Grimille, slipped into the noose, a malfunction sent him through the floor beneath his feet, killing him almost instantly. Twenty years later, to honor the cast and the late Charlie Grimille, the students of Beatrice High School decide to resurrect the show, with a student named Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) directing the play.Former football star turned thespian Reese (Reese Mishler) has decided to take on the lead role this time around, much to the dismay of his father, who wanted him to continue football, and his pal Ryan (Ryan Shoos), who hangs around the set during rehearsals just to ridicule and belittle the castmates. Reese desperately wants to get close to Pfeifer, though his own stage fright and lack of acting abilities prevent him from being much more than just another body on stage in her eyes. In an attempt to win her affection by being there, Ryan hatches a misguided plan of breaking into the school one night through an unlocked door and destroying the set of the play before opening night, presumably resulting in an opportunity for Reese to console Pfeifer. Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) go along with their asinine plan, breaking into the school late at night, but once they wind up meeting Pfeifer at the school, they encounter a barrage of paranormal activity and strange occurrences from what is believed to be Charlie's undead ghost.Such is the premise for \"The Gallows,\" the umpteenth rendition of the found footage genre, which I claimed to be \"uniformly dead\" following the release of 2012's \"The Devil Inside.\" With \"The Gallows,\" a film made on a shoestring budget and released by Blumhouse, a known indie horror company, no new ground is broken but the ground that the film manages to chart is interesting, twisty, and a great deal of fun.I've always found high school/college drama rooms and theaters to be creepy places where one can find just about any old prop or relic. Seeing these locations captured with lowlit, dingy lightning only emphasizes their almost inherent eeriness. With \"The Gallows,\" we don't settle for creaky floorboards and shifty objects, but rather, detailed props and set designs of colonial periods that really intensify a feeling of discomfort. Being that there are only four characters, confined to the spacious setting of a theater-focused high school, there is a lot of room for which to roam and play around, which adds to the fun of the film.The writing/directing team of Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing also have fun toying with the visual possibilities of their setting. Consider the scene where they evoke an effect that almost communicates an optical illusion to the audience, showing a long, narrow hallway in the bowels of the school, captured in almost complete darkness, with the bottom half of the walls painted dark red. The visual effect makes it look like we, along with the characters, are wading through a thick, black sea of sorts, or are encapsulated into nothingness. These visual tricks, whether conscious decisions on part of the filmmaking team or fortunate occurrences, make for a film that is never visually boring, constantly finding ways to invigorate its setting.The videography and editing, while shaky, also works to help the film create this spooky atmosphere. The nauseating effects of found footage films are well known, and this year saw some of the shakiest videography the genre had yet to see in \"Project Almanac,\" which still wound up succeeding in my mind on a plethora of different levels despite its guerrilla filmmaking. The shakiness of \"The Gallows\" is never a real issue, for it continues to add to the suspense and Edd Lukas's cinematography, which is very fixated on the lowlit and the ominous.\"The Gallows\" could've also fallen prey to the faults of \"As Above, So Below,\" last summer's low-budget horror effort, which failed largely in part because of its interchangeability in its execution. \"The Gallows,\" however, keeps things moving not only with a great setting but narrative twists and a persistency to show what other found footage films won't always show. We have multiple different camera perspectives, and once we see a character is doomed from one angle, we will eventually see the event unfold from his or her perspective and not just the one that closes us off from the events. So many found footage films leave us in the dark when it comes to the fate of the film's characters, figuratively and literally, but Cluff and Lofing seem to be sick of being left in the dark and, in turn, give us multiple different perspectives to show us what we wanted to see in the first place.If you're no fan of the found footage genre, \"The Gallows\" certainly won't make you one. It lacks the power of being the subversive piece of horror that the genre really needs now (look to films like Patrick Brice's \"Creep\" for that kind of quality). However, this is a film that does the very bare basics of the genre correctly, and with a budget of approximately $100,000, \"The Gallows\" finds itself stripped to the genre's minimum, forced to focus on narrative and the creepiness of its setting. This is the perfect horror outing that makes audiences active in the mystery and the looming ominousness of the story, rather than passive observers simply anticipating the next jump scare.",

Years later the school revives the play, and strange things happen when 4 students enter the school the night before the play is due to start.Yes, folks, it's another found footage horror film.I'll deliver the good news first \u2013 the high school play setting is novel.Now for the bad news. One, there isn't an ounce of originality here, apart from that setting. Two, the first half is anchored by the most profoundly annoying camera-wielding loudmouthed, A-hole: it's his fault the others are in this fix and \u2013 apologies for spoiler \u2013 thankfully he gets wiped out first, and it's a huge relief when he does. Three, this school has more hidden corridors, hideyholes, odd staircases etc. than your average mediaeval castle. Four, the basic premise of why the four of them are in the school is, let's say, flimsy at best. Five, there is a really lame twist ending. Six, the school decides to have a revival of a play in which one of the students died? Right. Seven, they have had a cast photograph of that ill-fated ensemble in the trophy cabinet ever since? Right. Eight, and one of the lads in the show has never recognised his Dad in that photo? Right.I don't mind it not making that much sense, but the final two thirds is creeping and running around in darkened corridors and spaces by the light of video cameras and mobile phones, with nothing much happening. Which is boring. I find that much more difficult to forgive.",

Some of the acting was laughable to a point where I burst out laughing in the cinema. I was also surprised that the cinema was fairly packed I thought I as the only idiot to go see this film. I see films like this making over $18 million on a $100 thousand pound budget and then more and more of the same film comes out. I understand me watching it is feeding these films being made but nothing unique is coming out in the horror genre. Spend your time and money on other films, like 'It Follows' which came out this year a way better psychological horror or even Insidious 3 where they have much better intense moments. I would give it a 3/10 only because I admire that they tricked so many people to think it would be a good film by the trailer.",

            "content": "\"The Gallows\" documents a conniving high school student who convinces his jock friend \u2014 a bad actor starring in the school play\u2014 to trash the set before opening night in order to sabotage the production; along for the ride is his girlfriend. Things get progressively messy when they are interrupted by the play's female lead who comes to investigate, and they find themselves locked inside the school with the vengeful ghost of a student who died onstage in the same play twenty years before.Where do I even start? As everyone knows, this is a \"found footage\" movie, widely abhorred and widely berated by hardcore genre fans and casual moviegoers alike. Make no mistake, \"The Gallows\" brings zero to the table in terms of innovation in regard to the sub-genre\u2014 but honestly, what more innovation could be had? \"The Blair Witch Project\" essentially set the standard over fifteen years ago, and more or less, every post-millennial found footage horror attempt is toiling in its wake. We know this. Critics know it. And yet, these films are still trending nearly two decades later. Why? Well, because some of them do work the formula well, even if it's absolutely silly. \"The Gallows\" is one of these. The actors do senseless things, the camera is always inexplicably rolling, and yet we're still watching, either shaking our heads or enjoying the ride. Technical presentation aside, what I think I found appealing about the film was its use of setting\u2014 an old high school after dark. A motif that goes back to the 1980s, we have a bunch of teenagers running amok inside a high school (which by virtue is spooky at night), tormented by an attacker\u2014 here, it's a supernatural one. The film is traditional in that sense, and almost plays out like a supernatural slasher flick, and the noose and stage plot devices are definitely different from the norm.The typical use of shadows, noises, and bumps galore are utilized to their full extent here, and were even able to get a couple of jolts out of my jaded genre lover's body. A particularly stunning sequence bathed in red light, which appears on the film's poster and as the staple of its advertising campaign, was one of the most craftily-orchestrated scenes I've seen in a horror film this year. The acting is overall pretty good, especially for a cast of young unknowns. Amateurish at times, but overall very serviceable, particularly the two female leads. The ending of the film is admittedly absurd and follows the found footage formula to a T\u2014 for that I do have to knock it a bit. This could have ended with a bit less fluff and been all the better for it.Overall, \"The Gallows\" is an enjoyable flick. It is not innovative or refreshing in the slightest, but it plays up its best qualities for maximum effect, and it's engaging and at times surprisingly thrilling in spite of filling its found footage shoes. There are some throwback elements as well that recall slasher traditions of the eighties, which may be a major reason that I inexplicably enjoyed the film no matter how silly it was or became. A fun, contrived ninety minutes. 6/10.",

The writing was awful from the start. Besides the found footage technique which wasn't really needed, there is an element of originality with some of the concepts so I'll give it points for that.

When I first saw the teaser trailer for this, I didn't really know what to expect. When the real trailer was released, it looked a lot better. I saw this film yesterday, and I also truly enjoyed it, almost as much as Unfriended. It was short, scary, creepy and to the point. I can't believe it's getting such bad ratings. As long as I feel scared by the atmosphere, the lighting and shadow of the ghost, the jump scares, the tension, and if the ending is good, then I'm happy with it. Just the thought of going to an abandoned dark school at night, being locked in by a supernatural presence, and being stalked and killed is a very scary concept to me. In 1993, the drama class of Beatrice High School is performing a play called 'The Gallows' Near the end of the play, a boy named Charlie is set to be hung at the gallows. A freak accident happens when the door beneath Charlie's feet opens and he falls through with a noose around his neck, killing him and traumatizing the whole school. In 2013, a new group of students are finally going to remake the play the way it was meant to be seen as a tribute to Charlie. The man behind the camera is Ryan, going around the school and filming his friends as they rehearse and prepare for the play the next day. Ryan's friend, Reese is set to play the part Charlie had. Reese has a crush on the girl wanting to redo the play named Pfeifer. Ryan soon comes up with an idea to break into the school at night, and destroy the sets so the play can't go on. They soon realize every school has its spirit when Charlie himself comes back from the dead and begins stalking and killing them all in the dark and deserted school. In conclusion, I really thought this was a decent little horror flick that deserves some more attention. It's miles better than Paranormal Activity. I highly recommend THE GALLOWS!!!",

            "content": "Found footage genre has been stifled with persistent issues, and this one isn't so different. The movie focuses on the production of high school play of the same name. It is the first time after twenty years that it's been produced, since the last one ends up with actual hanging. Soon enough several teens pack their camera and cell phones then decide to prank the production.First problem is the man behind the camera, Ryan. In some found footage films, the cameraman is usually a narrator or protagonist. Ryan is the rare few who are incredibly unlikeable and borderline aggravating. Audience literally spends the first act hearing him berate and undermine other students, even his best friend and girlfriend.I understand the need to portray brash youthful attitude, but that doesn't mean it has to be deliberately irritating to a fault. In some scenes he chooses stupid decisions, the very opposite of logical choice of actions. Other characters are imbalanced as well. Since the movie works on a small main cast, it relies much too heavily on these young characters. Their actions and motives are seemingly glossed over and erratic most of the times.There just isn't enough material to sustain the backstory of this play. It seems petty and rather vague to be identifiable, even the supposed entity isn't that novel, nearly looking like any other villain from slasher flick. Still, the nocturnal running and screaming must go on. For that matter, the movie actually delivers a few good build-ups.It's nothing inventive, but the large stage and myriad of props give it some advantage. A play itself is detached from reality, so at the very least it justifies the strange fantasy horror angle and it could have worked more with it. Furthermore, the backstage and school environments are striking chilling given the right ambiance.Despite the fine set-up, it doesn't deliver any spectacular finale, or any satisfying pay-off at all. In the end the whole thing feels like actual high school play, relatively tolerable if audience is lenience, but honestly rather tedious and shoddy. The Gallows dangles mild eerie atmosphere but eventually choke on its sloppy presentation and overly shallow delivery.",

I hung in there, and I'm glad I did, because it did eventually turn into a decent horror movie. For me, I've never been a fan of the hand held genre. I never found Blair Witch(1999) particularly easy to watch, and recoiled with horror as the genre took off, and I guess its here to stay with us now that everyone has an iPhone. To me it just seems lazy, and also the genre tends to need heightened drama to compensate for a lack of ordinary soundscape. The Gallows is no different. It starts off with all the things a lot of us hate about teen movies. At least two of the teens look to be in their twenties, and in any case their behaviour is far more typical of emotionally charged and grossly immature 14 year olds, not to mention there's a very in-your-face joker in the pack as well. And of course they all go to complete pieces when the chips are down. If you can get past that and somehow get used to the hand held shake and constant tech buffer interference and scrambling shots of feet running, well, there is a decent horror movie under it all, and The Gallows does score points for originality, and there is a fair chance you will enjoy it.",

Perhaps that makes it easier to pin the blame. Title seems to reference the idea of a past wrong not going without consequence. Dimwit plot begins in 1993 during a high school play that ends with someone accidentally being hung. For whatever stupid reason the play is being done again during current day. Four students attempt to sabotage the stage set one evening and end up locked within the school by apparently the spirit of the deceased student. One by one these morons are killed off and hung. Two directors took on this task but the found footage element is so bad it is basically just some idiot running with the camera, occasionally falling allowing the camera to roll about. This gets dizzying and enough to make a person sick. Many loud noises and characters that are about as intelligent as a bag of rocks. The school provides a creepy atmosphere at night but unfortunately the constant found footage dizzy point of view should have theatre staff providing barf bags at each screening to the lucky souls conned into paying for this sh*t thanks to advertizing. As found footage films go, this is one of the lamest attempts. It is lazy and pointless and with a cast that hopefully will be given a chance to act in a real film with ambition thrown in.

On the night before the play begins, a group of three douche-bags break their school at night to sabotage the play for more REASONS and the lead girl one of the boy likes wanders in to join the party for even more REASONS and then they explore the 1,590,000 square foot high school drama theatre because all the doors and exits are locked for, yep, super REASONS.Now, REASON with me on this one. The found footage shtick ran its course with the third movie that was released that way. It's painfully obvious why Hollywood has no creativity with these types of movies, namely horror films: spend $5.00 and make $58 million. But the attempts to make it somewhat realistic are just exhausting after a while. Especially when we have to look at a bunch of teenager's feet or the floor for tension and someone always has to be holding onto the camera when they really should be helping.I digress; the lazy film making technique is one thing. But, the laughable suspense here or the reason we see the kids run around in circles for an hour is actually entertaining, albeit in an unintentionally hilarious way. And though the ending is seen from the beginning, it's still downright laughable.This movie contains no real substance and just relies heavily on all the other dozens of found footage/ghost stories without ever coming up with something fresh or creative. I guess if you can't get enough of the same old, recycled mess as explained above, maybe you can add this to your guilty pleasure list.

So actually in retrospect the low rating is correct just the User reviews don't add up... Luckily I went on a Tuesday at my local theater so it only cost me $2.00 for the ticket...That being said if you are going to see this movie be aware it is a FOUND FOOTAGE FILM. To make myself clear that means the ENTIRE movie is filmed with someone holding a camera pretending as if what they are recording is happening in front of them. Not to say all found footage films are bad just most aren't great. This is one of those films.The film starts off with someone recording a school play. A scene in the play shows someone on \"The Gallows\" about to be hanged. Well as you guessed it the lighting goes dark for a second during the play and someone is actually hanged. Moving forward into the film another set of high-schoolers are doing the same play in the same room as the one with the ghost in it. Some people decide to come back during the night to ruin the set and as you guessed it a ghost causes terror on them.The entire time during the film where the high-schoolers are stuck in the school being terrorized by a ghost the extent of the special effects are that of the camera picture messing up, the screen going dark, and noises being heard. The actual killing I am not going to ruin for you but I can say it has to do with \"The Gallows\". The actual scaring is mostly jump scares/camera going dark and something being there... Not that scary to be honest with you.Overall, the way it was filmed just ruined the movie. It's not that it can't be good just because it is a found footage type of film but the way it was done made the movie feel bad.If I were you I'd skip this film but if you are like me and see it in your local theater and it costs only $2.00 maybe consider watching it if there isn't anything better playing.

I had seen a very bad rating here on IMDb for it and consequently had gone in with very low expectations (perhaps that helped things). While it was far from flawless, it certainly had me on the edge of the seat right until the dying seconds and was a very enjoyable film.The gripes with it seem to be the characters and some unrealistic plot points. The characters in horror movies are frequently a struggle for writers. There simply isn't enough time to build them up properly and being that they're often young teenagers, they're doomed before we even meet them. I admit though that 'The Gallows' didn't have overly likable characters even for a horror film. The plot pieces like a school that is open to get into 24/7 and real gallows being used in school plays are admittedly weak points, but I see no reason why they should ruin the film for people. The fact is that this is a horror movie, not a biopic. The point of it is to scare you and keep you in a very tense state. This did both of those for me in very fine fashion, therefore it was a successful horror film in my books. Don't listen to the negativity around this film, give it a go.",

If indeed one day we find ourselves in communication with a great race equal to our technological advancements let us all hope that these visitors do not find a copy of found footage horror film The Gallows, as their judgements upon mankind may be non-recoverable.A film so daft and downright dumb it's hard to fathom how it came into existence in the first place, The Gallows as directed by duo Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing (seriously it took two people to make this turkey!) is the type of film where you can feel your brain cells disappearing with each passing minute as annoying characters make unintelligible decision upon unintelligible decision and seemingly solvable solutions are ignored in the sake of more shakily handled \"scares\".A new low in the past it's use by date genre of found footage horrors, The Gallows plunges to previously unseen depths of narrative drivel to tell the story of painfully badly acted teenage brats breaking into their seemingly medievally secured school to wreck the set to an upcoming play only to be haunted by an ominous fiend who locks them in the school facility (really there's not a single window that could be smashed to break out of?) to wreck all manner of nasties on them.Watch on in disbelief as these unlikeable creations knock pot plants down, \"dismantle\" sets by taking a piece of wood out of a stage setting and generally fail at their objective only to be bettered or worsened by the fact that their school break in just happens to be in a school that seemingly has forgone any type of security, whether it be guards, cameras, motion detectors or even the locking of a door that would take 1 minute to fix, this school does not care who wonders its grounds come closing time! It's almost as if The Gallows creators Cluff and Lofing decided they were onto narrative gold or perhaps just an easy paycheck and set forth on making their film no matter if anything actually made sense or if logic was totally bypassed, it's almost akin to a home movie production, just far less funny or enjoyable.The Gallows is neither scary or original and nothing about the film feels even remotely believable, even in a genre that's not supposed to be clothed in reality.Taking place around some seriously lax logic and scenarios, The Gallows gets its rating purely based around the fact it's something that needs to be seen to be believed as for those that thought modern day horrors and found footage films had reached their lowest ebbs, The Gallows is here to show us all that the bar has been set even lower.In other words, all copies of this film should be locked away or simply destroyed quick smart\u0085\u0085 before the intergalactic visitors arrive! \u00bd an unsecured school facility out of 5",

Now me not being a big fan of the 'Found Footage' genre I was kind of half & half with this one considering the fact that I've seen loads of other failure found footage films. But lately I've seen some good Found Footage Horror films, which were Grave Encounters & As Above, So Below before that last year.The film is about a group of high school friends who are doing a play called 'The Gallows' just like the title of the film. The play they are doing had a freak accident occur almost 20 years earlier in 1993 on the 29th of October when a boy, Charlie Grim was accidentally hung when the hang man prop malfunctioned. But one night when the friends break into the school & trash the place, strange things begin to happen...This film was pretty good! It was very well done! It was intense, creepy, scary & very nerve shredding!Unlike The Blair Which Project (which sucked) & The Bigfoot Tapes etc. This film actually had action in it! Yes, action! Which I think made this film very good as it was along with the strong tension & jump scares which came with it!The death scenes were intense & the ghost apparitions were creepy! The back story I thought was well done & had a dreary feel to it! The video evidence that filmed the tragedy & made to look realistic was well done. The acting was pretty good also. I quite liked how they suddenly knew they were being hunted down by a supernatural force & that they couldn't get out along with one of the friends discovering that his dad was meant to be the executioner on stage on the fateful evening. The film itself felt dark & eerie with weird things going on!Though the ending wasn't 100% great I still though it was good & decent enough for me to watch it again! Though I won't give away anymore as you should see it for yourself! It was overall a great film with suspense & an unnerving atmosphere. Screw what the critics say as they don't know a good horror film when they see it! It was awesome! Go watch it!9/10",

COMPLETELY sounds like my type of horror film, armed to the teeth with potential for \"heebie jeebiez\" or chills up one's spine. This flick wasted that potential. The shaky cam thing is waaaaaaay to overdone at this point, this film might as well have been shot on a quickly-becoming-obsolete-smart-phone's camera. Give one to each character to justify all the nauseating shakes and movement. This is the worst I have ever seen in the found footage realm, as if nothing had been learned from other found-footage failures. Not a singular fook will be given about these characters by any viewer, and the rational driving this \"shin-dig\"/plot will anger you.

Now a former football player Reese (Reese Mishler) decides to take the same role. His friend Ryan (Ryan Shoos) hangs around the set during rehearsals just to tease his castmates. Reese's only reason for being there is because of a crush he has on one of his castmates, a girl named Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown). When the lead actor starts to have second thoughts, Ryan develops a plan to break into the school the night before the opening night to sabotage the set to possibly create an opportunity for Reese to console Pfeifer. Reese and Ryan are able to convince Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) to go along with their plan but when they run into Pfeifer, the four of them encounter a series of strange paranormal occurrences.There's nothing here that you haven't seen before. I personally though it started off rather slow. This is coincidentally the problem I have with most found-footage horror films. They usually all start off a little boring and then eventually place the main character(s) in any danger. It took a while for this one to really get started as well. I thought the plot was rather predictable and does have some holes but you're too busy being scared to notice (until it's over which was when I did). The acting wasn't that great either. Just a warning, the film is just 81 minutes long and that length did create some problems with me. The film moved with a pretty fast pace which I found unsettling and I wish they could have spent more time explaining certain elements of the plot which were glossed over. I was surprised that this film got an \"R\" rating since what I saw did not deserve it. There was no blood or gore or any real violence, no swearing, or any boobies whatsoever. With that, the film is made up of mostly jump scares where some are hit or miss. There were fewer of those than I would have liked but I enjoyed the suspense and the atmosphere which was at the expense of those scares. This is achieved with the eerie sound. The fact that it is a found-footage film did hurt it at certain times making it hard to follow what was going on. Most with common sense will be able to predict the plot twist coming at the ending which happens to be the worst part of the film. It is incredibly cheesy and served no purpose when compared to the rest of the film. It creates more questions than it answers. This is probably what they deemed the best thing they could have done with the amount of time they had. Casual horror move fans will be engaged but die-hard fans will be wanting more. For a decent found-footage film (although an argument could be made that it isn't), I recommend Unfriended.keithlovesmovies.com",

It was written, co-produced and directed by Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing. The cast includes Reese Mishler, Cassidy Gifford, Ryan Shoos and Pfeifer Brown. It's pretty cheesy and unoriginal but it is entertaining; I have to give movies that don't bore me at least some credit.The story begins at Beatrice High School, in the year 1983. A student, named Charlie Grimille (Jesse Cross), is horrifically killed during the production of a school play; in a tragic accident, caught on a parent's camera. The movie flashes forward 20 years, to when new students are trying to recreate the same play (in honor of the original attempt). A few troublemakers try to sabotage it, by breaking into the school; the night before the big performance. They're mysteriously locked inside, with something from beyond the grave. The movie is definitely nothing anything fans of the genre haven't seen before. It's the same old clich\u00e9s and gimmicks; but it is well done (to a certain extent). The acting is bad (especially by Mishler and Shoos) and the dialogue is sometimes atrocious; but it is fun (if you like these types of movies). I also really enjoyed the ending, and (like I said) it's never dull. So I'll give it a very minimal recommendation; to fans of found footage horror flicks.Watch out movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/NOu1q83bDIE",

From directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing, this is a school based found footage movie, focusing on the brutal accident of previous student, Charlie Grimille. Twenty years after a school production of \"The Gallows\" leads to the death of Charlie Grimille after a props malfunction, the high school drama club decides to remake the stage production to honour the anniversary of the tragedy. However, they soon find that some things are much, much better left alone. I admit, this movie started off extremely slowly. I wasn't that interested in what was happening, other than the very first scene that showed the accident with Charlie, but as with most found footage horror movies, I had to see it through. The beginning of most found footage horror movies are incredibly slow, something that I really wish had not become a trope of the genre, and this is definitely no different. I was very tempted to turn it off. It took around half an hour, forty minutes for this to finally kick in, and when it did, oh boy.I'm not weak to horror. I can gladly sit and watch what are considered the scariest horror movies, and come out of them bored and not scared at all but this movie, damn. The Gallows is an expert at building up the atmosphere, and making the goosebumps appear on your skin. It's absolutely brilliant at bringing up a situation that you know is going to happen, you know this one moment is going to happen, but when it does happen \u2013 you're creeped out and a little scared. The atmospheric build up is absolutely spectacular, and I don't think a found footage horror movie has ever made me feel so uneasy before \u2013 especially with the numerous night vision scenes. Of course, the plot is pretty basic; four teenagers trapped in their school, and a dead student is haunting them and killing them off one by one. It's not a terribly original entry into the found footage genre, but the acting is what really sets this apart from the others, in my opinion. I find in a lot of found footage horror movies, the actors don't seem to always put on a good show, they seem to be lacking. Maybe they know it's a bit of bad movie and they just don't really care, but in The Gallows, all four of the main actors did a brilliant job. You could feel their fear, you could connect in with their emotions, and really understand where they were coming from. Especially with actor Reese Mishler, who played the lead male, Reese Houser. There were pure moments with him where I was so scared I couldn't look away from the screen, I could not move, purely from him acting as scared as he was.This got a lot of bad criticism for a movie, and I'm beginning to feel this is more of a distaste for the found footage genre more than anything, and I think this movie definitely deserves a watch. It was atmospheric, it was scary, things were clear, and it wasn't just another ghost on a rampage. Not original in it's entry, but rather original within it's plot as a movie, and I would definitely give this another watch. This is one of those rare gems of the found footage genre, and I'm definitely glad that I gave this a chance.",

Much too my dismay after you've seen one lame found footage movie you've seen them all. 20 years after a tragic accident at a school play called The Gallows, the students are getting ready to perform it again. Ryan is recording everything going on with his friend Reese and girlfriend Cassidy, The three of them go that night to wreck the equipment and meet up with Pfeifer who Reese has a crush on. The films tactic of static buzzing that you get in these found footage films which after one too man times is no longer scary and just becomes an exercise in seeing how much can we make you jump. None in my case, I didn't feel uneasy, scared or any sense of terror. These kids are obviously not actors because they are awful, no commitment, no gravitas no nothing. Just screaming, acting like annoying little dunderheads and stupid decisions. The Gallows has no sense of purpose or fright that it just ends up looking like a spoof in which nobody cared, nobody saw and if you did see it, you probably forgot about it.

It's surely not the worst movie ever made, as somebody commented.It's an unpretentious, slightly silly, high-school horror movie. The acting is way better than the plot deserves -- in fact, I think every one of the cast puts in a credible performance. The dialogue is amusing, and convincing. The story isn't Tolstoy, but it's not as vacuous as most movies like this. There is (unless I blinked) no nudity or overt sexuality, which film-makers are often compelled to sprinkle around, to brighten up an otherwise hopeless film. What drama it has, it has through decent acting and production values.For the most part I don't really like 'Handycam' movies -- where the film-makers try to simulate amateur recording -- but I think it was tolerably well done here.One criticism I would make is that there isn't enough plot to carry the movie through its full length -- it does get a bit samey after the first hour.On the whole, I prefer honest movies that offer what they claim to offer -- even when that isn't much -- to those that pretend to be more than they are, and fall short. I had pretty low expectations of this movie, and it exceeded them. I've certainly spent my time less well than in watching this.",

The numbers do not add up. If this is supposed to be some kind of revenge movie, if fails. If it's trying to be a ghost story, it fails. What fails most is actors that look in their thirties portraying school kids. Pretty much all of the movie is seen through one camera lens or another. The girls can't seem to control their emotions, so most of their time is spent being noisy, whiny damsels in distress. Doors mysteriously lock and unlock to keep certain characters on one side or the other. If the main boy was supposed to be the son of the actor that did not show up that night, then why didn't his father ever tell him that he flaked that night. This movie pretty much makes no sense because apart from knowing that someone died in the original play at the school, nothing is properly explained to make a cohesive story line.

But then I recently watched \"It Follows\", looked up the reviews and am editing this because now I get it. \"It Follows\" reviews are saturated with what essentially are rough drafts from a film class paper. There was a lot of talk of theme and motif, and praise of the ambiguous ending because apparently it resulted in cinematic freshness and sophistication (yes i'm generalizing). I on the other hand, was irritated by the characters and the ending. None of our opinions are wrong, we are just two different audience groups. Reviews should definitely be honest, but you should be clear of who's writing it and who you're writing it for. (The beauty of everyone having different minds :) )So, if that's the lens you're going to view this movie with, then yeah, it probably won't be your cup of tea. But if you want to be entertained by something, I think this movie succeeded. Honestly I was initially drawn to the movie only by the creepy smells like teen spirit cover, but it's a decision i'm glad i made. Found footage movies usually turn me off with all the shaking, but it was very minimal in this movie which made it that much more enjoyable. The cast was a bunch of fresh faces and I rather enjoyed the longer exposition in the beginning, because it sets you up for a whirlwind at the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie. It did have the tired douchey character in it but he is not overwhelming. And then there's a twist at the end that you probably won't see coming until it's already hit you. There are clues, but you don't really pay them any mind until it's too late. Definitely worth a watch even if just to say you think I was wrong :)",

I don't like them as much because they're constantly moving around and it just makes the acting more cheesy (Hence why I am not a big fan of paranormal activity among other reasons) but this movie was good despite the shoddy camera movements. The story behind the main storyline fits in and delivers the feeling of dread before it even begins. The scares were good, and the ending was a complete shock to me. I walked in with limited expectations, but walked out impressed. What I liked the most about this movie, is the sheer innocence of it. What I mean is most of the horror movies today will have demonic elements, constant cussing, tons of sex and nudity (which completely destroys the mood of terror or dread) or buckets upon buckets of blood and gore. This movie is proof that you can deliver a good story with great scares without so much added into it. This is a very clean horror movie that was actually scary and good, and I actually liked it. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best? No. But if you want a clean horror with a new story and great scares or elements, then The Gallows is for you.",

Though there have been more copycats than original films produced the genre persists, and has even spawned two \"Haunted House,\" movies, which is in itself a monstrous side effect of this epidemic. Every year another article emerges saying that either the genre is over-done and lazy, or there are new innovations. \"The Gallows\" falls into the former.The premise is simply ridiculous. A high school theater production is putting on the same play they did twenty some years ago, even though that original production saw the lead die on stage. That would just never happen, period. From that hackneyed premise a narrative of retribution and revenge emerges, but it isn't doled out to anyone who actually deserves it. Instead four nearly random high school kids get the brunt of a ghost's revenge, and they don't have anything to do with the original issues of twenty years ago. Oh, the film thinks it explains itself with a random, nonsensical twist ending, but in actuality there's little to bond the story other than a red filter and hyena like screams from off-screen.Besides the idiotic plot, these characters are so painfully written that you may need a sedative to quell the rising anger you will feel at the back of your throat. Their two dimensional personas are bad by horror movie standards, which have been especially low in this era of found footage micro-budgeted laze fests. Everything about this film is intolerable and contrived. Do you really think we don't know what you're doing when you have someone follow their friends around with a hand-held camera? No one films themselves opening doors, or pulling ropes, even when no one else is on screen.The only reason I sat through this underwhelming student film is because others like it have emerged and been lauded. \"Unfriended,\" \"REC,\" and the Paranormal Activity films have all been studio strongholds for the past three years, with some serious fan service to boot. This is strange to me, because there is nothing enjoyable about these films. The jump scares might make you tense, and the look and feel are popcorn for your brain, but doesn't anyone miss the old stuff? Does anyone miss the novelty, the ingenuity, and weirdness of really diverse horror? Horror used to be the one avenue to explore things like trauma, obsession, and evocative terror in a creative way. A genre that once housed \"The Exorcist,\" and \"Dawn of the Dead,\" should not have to subsume to something of this nature. Not every horror film must be a masterpiece, but originally horror films did more shock and awe, because they had to. Directors like Wes Craven, Mario Bava, and Joe Dante made films for little money, and replaced studio effects with weird makeup, odd characters, and grisly action. There is nothing salvageable about this particular nonsensical trash, so find something better to get you in the Halloween spirit.",

Well, that's pretty much my situation with regards to The Gallows...I saw the trailers for the cinematic release, looked forward to it coming out onto Blu-ray, but only to be disappointed after finally seeing the film.What disappointed me about The Gallows wasn't because it was another found-footage film or that it was another high school \"teeny\" horror, but because out of those adjectives I used above, it's pretty boring, dull, and lifeless for the most part. This isn't a horrid or a hideous film, and there are definitely worse films out there, but it's definitely a massive let down.Reasons as to why this is a disappointing film for me are numerous...a lackluster script with an anti-climactic (and somewhat nonsensical) ending; the lack of \"edge of your seat\" thrills; the absence of likable characters (more on that in a minute); the predictability in a lot of parts. There's definitely far more going against this film than going for it, and one of the bigger annoyances was the characters. It usually takes me a while for certain characters to possibly p*ss me off, but here it didn't take long. The characters of Ryan & Cassidy really grated me, with Ryan being the typical a*shole high school top jock and Cassidy being the female version of Ryan. Reese was the most likable character, but was just a lemming to Ryan.In saying all of that, though, one good thing I did actually quite like was the atmosphere that was generated in a few scenes. There was none of the usual \"impending doom\" music which helped create better tension, and there's a good claustrophobic feel to these scenes as well. I think without this tension & atmosphere, the film would definitely be 1-Star all the way.Very disappointing overall.",

One of the main elements featured here is the fact that there's just nothing all that interesting about the group here with hardly anything all that interesting happening throughout here. The fact that the film is about high- school teens who do nothing but complain, argue and act like condescending douche-bags for their scenes setting up everything here is certainly commendable at accurately getting the right mentality and mind-frame for the group, but the problem is that this sort of behavior makes people seem far more despicable and intolerable than anything and it grows infuriating seeing them constantly pick on others and insult them following through on their stereotypical issues clashing with each other than occurs in nearly all teenage high-school efforts. On top of that, the fact that there's so much of this that it eats up the time resulting in quite a bit of time before something actually occurs is also a big problem here with this one waiting nearly half-an-hour waiting for them to get to the school. Even once we get there, this one is mostly undone by fact that there's just an endless stream of clich\u00e9 and rather rudimentary-styled haunting scenes that are just so commonplace and ordinary that there's little suspense to be generated from them as they just come and go without really offering anything interesting with them. It really tends to make this one come off all the more clich\u00e9d when combined with this typical type of storyline where it runs through all these expected points without much deviation or change-up in them and there's just such an overall feeling of disenchantment with this one for the majority of the time here. As well, there's the issue here with nearly every found-footage film in that there's so much wrong imposed on the film merely for the inclusion of such a feature in that the characters become far more concerned with keeping the camera running than their own personal safety which really ruins the suspense of the situation, the continuous need for it to be involved in areas that have no business there and basically making it so obviously off-kilter and impossible to see what's going on that there's little chance of seeing what's going on. These here do hold this back, though there's some rather good parts here. The back-story with the haunted school-play and how they're bringing it back gives this a pretty solid framework here to build a believable story, and with the whole amount of time spent on delivering a fine twist to this there's some rather good times to this one. The other good part here is that this one does occasionally get the haunting scenes done right with the way they get attacked throughout the school's hallways in the second half which are somewhat creepy and chilling with the way this one dishes out the continuous encounters to really seal this one as a frenetic finish to the film. These here make this one good enough to be watchable, but that's as good as it gets.Rated R: Violence and Language.",

I had seen the previews and thought it looked really interesting since I have a soft spot for movies that are filmed Guerrilla Style much like the Paranormal Activity movies. The movie started with the backstory as to who and why the school was being haunted. In 1993 a boy named Charlie was tragically killed while performing the part of August in a play entitled \"The Gallows.\" The trap door opened on the set piece and he was accidentally killed by hanging. This one event set the tone for the entire movie. Jump ahead 20 years to 2013 and another group of students is recreating the play. You meet Ryan who is a snarky jock involved in the stage crew of the new production of the Gallows. He's filming his best friend Reese who is playing August in the revival beside a girl named Pfeifer who he has a crush on. Then there's Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy who is your ultimate blonde teenage scream queen. (What respectable horror movie doesn't have one of these?) Throughout the movie you are taken on a roller coaster ride of twists and turns that keep you guessing right until the climactic ending which left me thinking, this is really F***ed up! It was quiet a storyline to say the least! I can't say much about the twists other than you are going to really enjoy trying to figure out who's going to die and why! They left the ending open for a 2nd part to the movie but they will have to treat it carefully to live up to the first one. This movie had gotten terrible reviews, but quite honestly I'm seriously considering adding it to my home movie collection. You should definitely go see The Gallows.

I really should follow my own advice, though. After all, there's only one truly genius found-footage movie (that would be \"Cannibal Holocaust\") and just a few that are remotely worthwhile (like \"REC\", \"The Bay\" or \"The Borderlands\"). And yes, I'm fully aware that I'm not including so-called masterpieces like \"The Blair Witch Project\" or \"Cloverfield\" because they are, in fact, rubbish! \"The Gallows\" is even worse than rubbish; - an utterly boring and amateurish effort with an uninteresting story, loathsome lead characters and shaky camera movements that are possibly even more irritating than in every other found-footage movie ever made. Is there seriously anyone curious to learn the history of a geek who accidentally died 20 years ago during the performance of a high-school play. No? Too bad, because that's what \"The Gallows\" is about. In the same school in middle-of-nowhere Nebraska, new geeks are rehearsing for the same play in which poor Charlie got hung in front of a full theater. For some unclear reason, however, supposedly cool but dumb kids intend to wreck the scenery and decors in the night before the big premiere. They quickly come to regret it, of course, as Charlie's ghost haunts the school hall and clearly wants his tribute to take place. The routine of these zero-budgeted \"found footage\" movies is overly familiar by now. Nothing happens until the final five minutes, except maybe a couple of blurry ghost-apparitions. Then we get some vague and unidentifiable action-shots and a bit of hysterical shrieking, and then it's finished. What makes \"The Gallows\" even more unendurable is that the lead characters are beyond stupid, and the school setting is so damn dull and customary. Other found-footage movies suck too, but at least they are set in abandoned asylums, desecrated churches or whatever. I'm generously giving one additional point because Cassidy Gifford is pretty to stare at for as long as she doesn't talk too much.",

I was set to give it a ten to balance out the negative reviews - until the ending. The plot was simple (but they managed to screw it up). Here is the problem. The tragedy happened in 1993, then they fast forward to twenty years later. At the end, they strongly imply that \"Pfeifer\" is Charlie's daughter. However, if Charlie died twenty years ago, even if his daughter was already conceived, she would be around 19 and out of school. This could have been fixed by fast forwarding 18 years instead of twenty. There is one other possibility. Since Charlie is a ghost and capable of killing - perhaps, he and his girlfriend supernaturally conceived a few years later. Then his daughter would be the right age. However, that should be made clear if this is the case because most people's minds are not going to go there. It is, more than likely, an error - which really bothers me because they did so well with everything else but managed to forget that the audience can actually count.I do like the thought that had Reese's father not called in, Reese's father would have died, and Reese would not have been born. So, Charlie feels as if Reese has no right to be on this earth. The actors could actually act (not always the case with low budget horror). There were plenty of scares to keep me at the edge of my seat.Due to the age flaw, I cannot give it more than seven (a solid score for horror).I guess what I am trying to say is that this movie did NOT suck. I really enjoyed it.",

But if it's his ghost, how has he grown to a full sized adult? And it was far too coincidental that the group ended up at the school on the night of the anniversary of his death, gaining entry through an unlocked door, which has allegedly been broken for an extended time, without anyone having made any attempt to repair it. And why did this ghost want to kill the son of the guy who he blamed for his death twenty years earlier? If it was the older woman, shown briefly early on, then again, how did she know they would be at the school on that night? Why didn't she try to kill him/ them earlier, she had plenty of opportunities?If this guy, Charlie, is a ghost, why did he need the woman and/ or her daughter to get them to the school so he could go after them? And why did he attack the cops at the very end? Did he not figure that would draw attention to the woman and her daughter? And again, if Charlie can leave the school to kill, why did he have to wait until the son of the guy he blamed for his death went there on, coincidentally, the twenty years anniversary of his death, to kill him?I didn't mind the shaky-cam, what I minded was the fact that the plot made no sense, even for a low budget horror film, and the nonsensical plot took far too long to get going. There was a bit of atmospherics in the second act; the school itself was creepy, as the group wandered the darkly lit, empty corridors, but again, the plot was a complete mess, a desperate attempt at setting up another horror series, like Friday the 13th. Even the line \"Don't say his name!\" seemed like a desperate attempt at creating the obligatory, seemingly contractually obligated catchphrase.",

The movie really has no plot or story to keep you interested and tries to rely on little jump scares to keep you watching.

The Poltergeist remake scared me, but this terrified me. I still have a pit in my stomach, and my heart is still thumping as I type this. A lot of people will write off this film as \"bad\" simply because it's found footage, without even seeing it. (Looking at you IMDb message board trolls.) This movie proves that found footage is not dead, and can still be scary. The acting is phenomenal (which is a surprise considering this is the first movie for almost all the actors.) It feels incredibly realistic. I was in stagecraft in my high school and this movie is the reason why I will never join that class again. I will also never join drama. Simply because this movie has scared me off those two classes forever. This makes the game \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" look like \"Sesame Street\" by comparison. (No offense, Scott Cathon. It's still scary, just not as scary as this.) This is the kind of movie you want to see with your friends in a room with the lights off and locked doors, so there is no escape. Bwahahahaha! I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's quite impressive that it has such a small budget and yet it still feels like a theater-worthy movie. I won't give away the end, but know that it is one of the greatest twist endings I have ever seen! Bravo!Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",

There must be an explanation, because nothing about 'The Gallows' even whispers a $100,000 budget. I would have played the Ryan role for far less money, and walked around with my shaky hand held camera for 80 minutes - I can be highly annoying, too, for no extra charge.But instead, they decided to take the expensive route, and hire these top notch A list actors, to provide us with this highly entertaining, suspenseful, and frightening pile of rubbish. Okay, so 'The Gallows' is none of those things (well, other than the rubbish part.) And the exact opposite would be far more accurate, but I'm trying to be a nice guy here. Enough of that. A short run down for those of you who may or may not want to sit through this horrible film - A kid dies during a school play, via hanging, because I guess high school's back then took the more realistic approach, instead of the safer prop route - Hmm, okay. Fast forward ahead a few years, 2013, I believe - and another group of students are gearing up, for, you guessed it - the exact same play, and, of course, using the exact same, highly dangerous method (Lets pretend this plot hole isn't a complete killer, and laugh it off.) So, anyway, the ghost of the original victim (Charlie) wants revenge on the person who was originally supposed to play the role, but backed out - by going after his son years later, and any person connected to the son - makes sense, since the son played such an important role in 'Charlie's' death the first time around, right? Okay, maybe not, but let's go ahead and kill him anyway. You're also probably expecting the usual 80s/90s clich\u00e9 - someone related to Charlie is obviously taking his or her revenge, too, right? Well, why the hell not, since they have $100,000 budget, they can please every horror fan on the planet. 'The Gallows' is just an all around crowd pleaser.Random Ramblings of a Madman: There's enough plot holes here to fill an entirely different 80 minute film, including the $100,000 budget that vanished into thin air. But if you're a fan of bad found footage films, and you don't get motion sickness (had to correct myself here, I typed 'suckness,') then by all means give 'The Gallows' a chance.",

They start being picked off, one by one, they just disappear and near the end, a person in a hangman's mask is finally shown-supposedly the culprit-and the ending is remindful of 'The Blair Witch Project'.

            "content": "I came in expecting a typical, low-budget horror bust but I was surprised by this one. 20 years ago a high school drama play goes horribly wrong as an actor (Charlie) accidentally ends up being hung. Because of the poor quality of the raw footage or the fact I wasn't paying enough attention, I wasn't sure if the kid committed suicide or if the play prop came apart. 20 years later, the play is being re-enacted by a new set of teens. Ryan is the \"cool guy\" jock/camera man who coincidentally is taking drama class when he has no appreciation for the art. He doesn't take his role serious and is giving constant obnoxious commentary as he films throughout the movie. I'll give him (and the director) credit; movies that are usually made with raw footage are usually incredibly annoying as they shake incessantly. This guy seems to be a natural! The shaky footage was rather tolerable. Reese dropped out of the football team and is now an aspiring thespian. He has a crush on the lead actress, Pfeifer but is insecure about his acting abilities. Ryan, who seems to have a man crush on his buddy Reese, manipulates him to forget his acting future and convinces him to ruin the set of the play. Doing this will save Reese from delivering an atrocious performance and will allow him to console Pfeifer once she sees her play was canceled. Reese's dad urges him to quit the play as well and return to football. Reese, Ryan and Ryan's girlfriend, Cassidy, go to the high school to destroy the set. That's when sh*t starts going crazy. As they're wrecking the other students' hard work on the set, Pfeifer runs into them as she coincidentally saw Reese's car outside. They start noticing odd things (noises, set being put back together) happening and get freaked out. Conveniently, there are no lights for two-thirds of the film. Ryan tries to be \"cool\", and antagonizes Charlie (the teen, spirit) to come out. His big mouth gets him a broken leg. They get separated numerous time which is EXACTLY what you shouldn't do in cases like these. Cassidy is the second to get choked out by the creepy Charlie. There were a few instances that delivered a scary vibe so be prepared to jump! I didn't, but maybe you will. Reese's dad was supposed to play the role Charlie played but he called out sick. Now things start making sense as the demon-ghost has a vendetta against Reese's dad. He possibly feels he would still be alive had the dad shown up for the damn play. Reese and Pfeifer brilliantly decide to ring the fire alarm to notify the police. Charlie is in hot pursuit during the wait. It's not known if the cops show or not but they see that the door is now open. Reese is on his way out but notices Pfeifer is on her knees choking on something. The lights now work and that serves as a cue to continue on with the play. Reese, trying to be the hero, hangs himself to save Pfeifer. Pfeifer ends up taking a bow with guess who, Charlie, HER DAD!? Wouldn't that make her 20?? Why is she still in high school... I don't know. The girlfriend of Charlie arrived to a rehearsal and she apparently was the mom of Pfeifer. Cops arrive to their apartment to apprehend the suspects. Why they were recording is beyond me. The mom is combing Pfeifer's hair in a creepy room that resembles the set of the play. Charlie the creeper, kills the two cops but somehow are able to see this footage.The concept wasn't bad but there were holes in the story. Charlie was a very busy ghost. He was moving, rearranging things super quick. Was Pfiefer's mom/Charlie's girlfriend knocked up before he died? Is that even their child? Why wasn't any of their cellphones working at a school? Did the police arrive when they rang fire alarm? Why was the footage like that of a VHS towards end? Why didn't Charlie go after the dad and not Reese? The film was similar to that of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. That's the recipe to profit in the industry. 100k budget and its grossed 22 mil. It's suitable for the teen demographic but if you enjoy horror films (even the bad ones), I recommend you check it out on cable.",

            "content": "In recent years, horror movies have come with critical and financial revenue, such as Insidious, Get Out, Don't Breathe, and A Quiet Place. Unfortunately, for every gem there's always a rough spot, and this film falls into that category. The found footage genre seems to be looked down upon in this day in age for how cheap and low quality they're seen to be, and after seeing this film, I don't think that sentiment will be changed anytime soon.Set twenty years after an accident during a high-school play called \"The Gallows\", some students try to recreate the play again. Soon after, students Reese, Pfeifer, Ryan and Cassidy get trapped in the auditorium whilst facing the wrath of the vengeful spirit of the kid who died on that fateful night. I'm ok with simple plots, but the story just isn't engaging enough to warrant an hour and a half of viewing. As such, the film becomes tedious as we merely subject ourselves to a lot of running, yelling, obnoxious acting, and a highly predictable payoff. This probably wouldn't be much better as a short film, but at least it would've been over quicker.Adding into that, you'd think the cast would at least be interesting, but there is not one likable character in this whole affair. Reese has little charisma or unique qualities to make him stand out, Pfeiffer's bossiness and demand to finish the play presents her as rather moody, and Cassidy.......uh......I got nothing about her. However, the worst offender is Ryan. I'm sure the filmmakers intended to make him snarky and arrogant, but he becomes obnoxious very fast since all he does is film stuff and annoy people for nearly thirty minutes. Also, it's funny how one of the students can't act in the play when the actor himself can't act in the movie either. When not even the acting is convincing enough, there's lots to be desired with these bland and unlikable characters.It's obvious this film was made on a low budget with the setting mostly consisting of a school, but that's where the film's cinematography also becomes problematic. Given that this is found footage, it becomes annoying and gimmicky to a fault, and the usage of filming everything in front, even during chase scenes, becomes old quick. Even the props range from a rope and a ladder and not much else, making the experience more lackluster than scary. There isn't even any reason for this to be found footage; they could have shot this any other way and nothing would change at all.Now I don't think jump scares are inherently weak, as they can work well if given the proper buildup and tension. In this case though, the jump scares just happen on a wham, making them feel unwarranted and tiresome. Even one scene with Cassidy sobbing by a stairway (which can be seen on the poster) that is built up with surprisingly slow and subtle atmosphere gets ruined by a cheap jump scare from the spirit. Considering that this film is supposed to be set up as pasted together clips of the story from the police department, one would expect even they would get bored of this drowsy experience.Did this film have potential? Kind of, as it does paint itself as a revenge tale of a high schooler named Charlie who accidentally died during the 1993 performance and is determined to have the play finished with one of the students, being Pfeiffer. There is a way to make a story like that work, maybe if Pfeiffer was the daughter of a girl Charlie got pregnant in high school and maybe just wanted to complete a father daughter play. Sadly, all that potential is squandered away for a cheap production set, a boring story, hollow and despicable characters, and nothing else to stand out in the horror genre. There are great horror films out there in the world worth cherishing for eons, but this film will forever be locked in purgatory with all the forgettable horror flicks that favor cheapness over quality.",

            "content": "Great marketing and a little controversy can make a mediocre movie more successful. We've all seen it time and time again, but rarely so effectively as with \"The Gallows\" (R, 1:21). There is an urban legend that in 1983, a Nebraska high school drama student named Charlie Grimille accidentally died on stage when a prop noose malfunctioned and broke his neck. As the story goes, Charlie's ghost now haunts the old Beatrice High School. Supposedly, in 1992, the ex-wife of a substitute drama teacher hanged herself shortly after he subbed at the school, and in 2008, three teenagers broke into the school and were later found hanged. These stories don't appear on the film's official website, but the contradictory claims on several internet message boards can only serve to heighten interest in the film.Whether the film's producers have anything to do with the controversy over whether there really was a Charlie Grimille who died during a play, they did do some other things that were pretty smart. In one of the movie's trailers (which is the one featured on their website), the filmmakers slyly allude to the \"Charlie Charlie Challenge\" pencil game, which some people believe has paranormal connotations. The game appeared in Europe back in 2008, but only became popular in the U.S. in 2015, leading many people to think that the game was created for the movie. And in that same trailer, the music includes a creepy new arrangement of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". That song came out just two years before the events at the beginning of the film and the song's title and lyrics fit perfectly with this movie. Then there's the movie poster. The only color it uses is red, a color not very prominent in many movie posters today, but very suggestive of blood and danger. The poster's main image is a girl who looks like she's scared and crying, making the potential moviegoer wonder what happened to her \u2013 or what might be about to come out of those red and black shadows to do her harm.Now, only if the movie were as effective as the publicity surrounding it.The film's action begins in late October 1993, when a character named Charlie Grimille is performing in a play called \"The Gallows\" and suffers the same fate as the Charlie Grimille in the story from 1983. We see the horrifying moment of Charlie's hanging on home video. In fact, the \"found footage\" technique is used throughout the rest of the film. 20 years after Charlie's death, the school is bringing back the play. Most of the video we see is shot by a character named Ryan Shoos (played by an actor named Ryan Shoos). Ryan's off-camera commentary mocks the play and those involved with it, including his best friend, and fellow football player, Reese Houser (played by Reese Mishler). Reese is only in the play so he can be close to his high school crush, Pfeifer Ross (Pfeifer Brown). Since Reese isn't a very good actor and really doesn't care about the play itself, Ryan suggests that they break into the school the night before the play and tear up the set. That way, Reese doesn't have to embarrass himself in front of the whole town and he can \"comfort\" Pfeifer, who would obviously be in great distress over the show's demise. Ryan's girlfriend, Cassidy Spilker (Cassidy Gifford) insists on joining in, and so, a plan is made.Of course, this being a horror movie with the memory of a tragic death looming in the background, breaking up the set doesn't exactly go as planned\u0085 and there seems to be someone or something wanting to make these teens pay for their disrespect of the theater. The three have barely started messing up the stage when Pfeifer shows up. Reese makes up an excuse to explain his presence there and the vandals decide to just leave. They soon find that every exterior door is locked and no one has cell service. That's when they start hearing noises that can't be explained, doors start slamming, TVs turn on and off on their own and the teens find out that the school has some corridors and corners that are very scary \u2013 especially in the dark. The only questions that remain are who is doing all this and how many of these four potential victims will make it out of the school alive \u2013 if any of them do.\"The Gallows\" has decent acting, a fairly original story, a cool creepy vibe and does the found footage thing pretty well, but a lot of the stuff that happens in the movie doesn't make a lot of sense. How could a problem with a fake noose not be discovered until the night of a play's performance? Why would any school stage another performance of a play in which a student died, especially just 20 years before? And if your stated goal is to tear up the set so it can't be repaired in time for the performance, why just kick over fake plants and use tools to neatly detach the stairs from the gallows? I have other problems with this film's lack of common sense, but I can't discuss them in this review without resorting to spoilers. When I think about this movie, the thing that seems to make the most sense is\u0085 just not seeing it. \"C\"",

It is mostly jump scares but they are done well and got me almost every time. The acting isn't great but its not too bad either. Iv'e seen much worse in horror movies. And for the ending that everyone's complaining about, it was a pleasant surprise to see it end the way it did. I was expecting much worse. People need to lighten up and take movies for what they are. No its not the scariest movie in the world but it was decent and i'm glad i went to see it as a horror fan. If your a fan of found footage horror films then go see it.

            "content": "The claustrophobic, low-budget, found-footage, horror chiller \"The Gallows\" keeps you hanging for 8o minutes without anything that might qualify as either haunting or harrowing. Those few and far between ominous moments when the filmmakers actually manage to stimulate us exert minimal impact. Most of the time we're treated to feet treading floors, epileptic hand-held cameras prowling creepy passages, and dramatic lapses when the characters avert the cameras from the action. Unfortunately, \"The Gallows\" provides little that would urge you to exercise your vocal chords in abject terror. Clearly, rookie co-writer and directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing have drawn most of their inspiration from superior scary sagas, such as \"The Blair Witch Project,\" \"Candy Man,\" and \"Carrie.\" The teen protagonists equip themselves with either video cameras or smart-phone cameras as they break into their own high school after hours on an impromptu mission to play pranks. First, Cluff and Lofing must have enjoyed \"The Blair Witch Project\" (1999) with its wobbly hand-held photography that lent that epic a modicum of spontaneity. Sadly, they bring nothing new to the process, and found-footage films have virtually worn out their welcome. The recent teen time-travel thriller \"Project Almanac\" has proved to be the exception to that rule. Second, you can get into trouble in \"The Gallows\" by uttering a dead man's name three or more times. Cluff and Lofing lifted this convention from \"Candyman\" (1993) and its sequels where invoking the villain's name three times served to summon the supernatural fiend. Third, the pranks are reminiscent of the depraved teens in \"Carrie\" that sabotaged the beauty pageant. Cluff and Lofing go to painful lengths to generate eerie atmosphere, but they never ante-up payoff in the form of white-knuckled panic. Indeed, accompanying stupid teenagers through a maze of halls quickly degenerates into monotony rather than melodrama. These cretins don't have enough sense to prop doors open behind them so those doors don't slam shut and separate them. Characterization remains sketchy, and little about them is charismatic. None of them emerge as entirely sympathetic, so we really don't care when they are eliminated at intervals. Good horror movies boast menacing villains. The villain in \"The Gallows'\" amounts to little more than an anonymous apparition without a musical motif to enhance its evil. Sure, Cluff and Lofing's knock-off of Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, or Candyman has some potential, but he doesn't afflict you with paranoia. Basically, this mysterious murderer with a noose never instills dread. \"The Gallows\" doesn't properly set up its evildoer as an omniscient force of annihilation like those iconic serial slayers from other classics.\"The Gallows\" unfolds in 1993 in Beatrice High School somewhere in Nebraska. A parent with a camcorder is taping a costume play that resembles Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible.\" One character is sentenced to swing from the gallows. Suddenly, everything goes horribly wrong when an implausible prop malfunction occurs. The actor with a noose around his neck dies strangling before he can be rescued. The premise about a high school play gone horribly wrong is provocative, but it is wholly preposterous. Imagine high school administrators allowing their theater students to stage a play with a hazardous, fully operational gallows? Such material itself would constitute dire poor taste. Incredibly, some twenty years afterward this tragedy, the same Nebraska high school administrators decide to commemorate the tragedy with a new production of the same play. Had \"The Gallows\" been set in an off-campus little theater, it might have been believable. Anyway, the night before the play opens, a trio of teen pranksters sabotage the set. One of them is the actor scheduled to swing by the neck on the gallows. High school football player Reese (Reese Mishler) has been persecuted without mercy by gridiron cohort Ryan (Ryan Shoos) into participating in this notorious prank. Ryan has convinced Reese that Reese lacks the most basic acting skills. Furthermore, he contends Reese will succeed only in making an idiot out of himself in front of the whole school. Essentially, Ryan has persuaded Reese to come because if they smash up the sets, then the play will not proceed, and Reese will not expose himself to ridicule. Ryan's haughty cheerleader girlfriend, Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford), tags along for laughs. The three wind up getting themselves trapped inextricably in the school. Improbably enough, neither their smart-phones nor the land lines in the school function since evil permeates the premises. Doors which shouldn't lock mysteriously lock, and an ancient analog television broadcasts the tragic news report from the past about the hanging. Nothing that these terrified teens do can deliver them from this labyrinth where a humorless, supernatural spirit decked out in a hangman's mask stalks them with a noose. Complications ensue when another student, Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown), catches them in the school. She is the student who spearheaded the play's revival and doesn't understand why they want to sabotage it.\"The Gallows\" relies on a largely unknown cast, but these amateurs acquit themselves admirably. As the obnoxious jock, Ryan Shoos is perfectly cast. You will hate this dastard from the moment you meet him. He deserves the noose that the villain snaps around his neck. Reese Mishler plays the only character with a shred of sympathy, and he seems to be channeling Tom Cruise. Reese is undoubtedly the most interesting and disturbed character. Frank and Kathie Lee's daughter Cassidy Gifford plays a repellent cheerleader. The production values are strong, and the high school really seems like a spooky labyrinth. Cluff and Lofing had a promising idea, but they never generate adequate thrills, chills, and spills. Subsequently, the atmospheric horror induces yawns more than yells. They don't make their monstrous villain into a larger-than-life nemesis like Freddy and his competitors. The scenes after the play when the police show up to arrest the culprits seem awfully predictable, too. Far-fetched and formulaic, \"The Gallows\" recycles horror clich\u00e9s without trace of originality.",

            "content": "The Gallows is a film no one wants to like.It's silly, it's messy, it's brutish, it's about insufferably entitled high school students, and it stars someone who once lived inside and consequently shares genetic property with human Franzia box Kathie Lee Gifford. None of these things appeals much on paper, but when they're mixed together in the same bowl, readily sipping from the sweet, campy froth bubbling over the brim is easier than expected.Like its ill-fated cast of characters, The Gallows walks itself into a score of inescapable traps from beginning to end. There's no metaphor more becoming of the found-footage sub-genre than a plot hinging upon a tightening noose, effectively squeezing precious life out of a once- promising formula. The Gallows wrings itself around the creative airways of a tired format, and it isn't savvy enough to harness the potential powers of the medium for good.But, there's a sinister abandon\u2013an old fashioned, reckless determination to get under your skin\u2013running through the film that makes even its clumsiest moments enjoyable on sheer gusto alone. The whole thing feels less like hardcore humping and a bit more like \"found frottage,\" as it's ultimately too ambitious for the shoestring budget scaling back its longing for grander presentation, but The Gallows is most effective when it's making do after killing the lights and playing with the shadows that linger.The film stars Reese Mishler as a popular jock wooing the drama club's resident peach, Pfeiffer, by ditching his football digs for colonial garb as he takes on a leading role in the upcoming school play. The school's production of \"The Gallows\" is a cursed one; during a routine performance in 1993 a malfunctioning prop took the life of a teen actor, and for some reason the school has decided to revive it some 20 years later. Needless to say, that turns out to be a very bad idea for all involved, as the spirit departed is actually a vengeful one because of course he is.The Gallows is a film that indulges so sweetly in the art of things that go bump, and it achieves varying levels of genuine creepiness with effective gags far more chilling than they have any right to be. Its creepy aesthetic crescendos as the film goes on, a feat most horror films struggle to accomplish, as they're often defined by a gimmick that grows stale after a few minutes of wading around in whatever shock-bait concoction of a plot they're hawking. The Gallows doesn't reach that point until its ridiculous conclusion, but it's not much of a bother when all the film asks of us is a mere 80-minute investment.Like most contemporary horror films, The Gallows needs little setup to accomplish what its target demo expects. Stuff a few tanned-and-toned teenage bodies into the throes of dimly-lit peril, and you have a short, amusingly brash firecracker of a film that's only as bad as whatever ridiculous expectations you impose upon it.",

So, now I had low expectations for this movie. Boy, what a mistake THAT was. The beginning of the movie had a little slow start, but I didn't mind. Just a bunch of school students being school students. But after the 30 minute mark, that's when things started to get a little spooky, just what I was waiting for. From that point forward, it was a fun roller-coaster ride from curiosity, to jump scares, to \"what the f*** was that??\" and lastly, to \"holy f***ing sh*t!!\" But, let's not forget the fact that I'm 17. But I could tell it was scary as f*** when I saw my stepfather and mother jump out their seats and cover their faces. All in all, it was a good movie that you can label \"Scary and fun\".

The Gallows doesn't quite go beyond the imaginary and depiction of evil characters and chooses to become another clich\u00e9 found footage done from the eyes of teenage kids. The idea is a bright one and the character design for The Gallows is quite something unique opposed to just the supernatural but doesn't quite justify the overall film to say that the 'hangman' leaves his mark. I personally went into this screening feeling proud of what the film could've been in its own format, red and dark. The trailer is something that certainly leaves people gasping for breath, but I assure you that the direction of the film is quite bleak opposed to how these teenage characters come into contact with \"The Hangman\". The idea of the film is quite ingenious having one location of a high-school in the US and a large entity that surfaces the school but the film tends to show more of these teenagers' problems rather than the attack from the hangman himself.More horror, less teenage drama please. -London screening, 17th July UK Release Date",

The acting was absolutely horrendous. The budget was so low I could have probably made this movie with my phone and computer and all I would have to spend money on is renting a high school for one night.Like I said, the acting sucked and I hated the characters. One guy was just flat out annoying and you wanted him to die, the other guy just cried and was a ladies man the whole movie and he tried to act all cool but he turned out just looking like a complete idiot, and of course the girls just cried and screamed the whole movie.Also the whole movie is just the characters running around in a school the whole time so it got real old real quick.So I guess if you like cheap budget horror movies that will give you a scare you may enjoy this movie if you can ignore the acting, script, and setting.",

This is kind of another of the found footage movies or reminiscent of the video footage type films we have seen from Paranormal Activity. I have to say this movie was pretty darn good, and if you are in the need for a scare you should check it out.The story follows a set of teen's as they try to reenact a play from the past. The original play ended with a tragic accident that haunts the small town until the present day. As you can guess normal teenage shenanigans ensue, and it gets hairy pretty quickly.This isn't your normal teenybopper movie, though.

Trust me when I tell you won't mind the break from the normal doldrums of horror.IF you are into the dark and some well-placed scares that get your heart racing check this out. This movie is all about creating tension, and then exploiting it. I find those the scariest kind of films, and then I get to watch my wife jump.

With this, I will admit that I was drawn in by some previews that I saw during TV commercials. It all begins with the performance of a high school play called (of course) \"The Gallows.\" (Really original, right?) One of the performers is accidentally killed by a noose on the stage. Fast-forward 20 years and a group of high school students go to the school where it took place to check it out, just to see if they encounter the ghost of the performer who died onstage.Before you know it, just about everyone is picked off one by one by some supernatural force that they believe is the ghost of that particular actor. This isn't even worthy of being called a horror movie. It has no scares, little to no suspense, and all of the actors look like they're in a daze three-quarters of the time.

I wonder whether when they watched the daily rushes they didn't take him aside then next morning and either sack him or severely repremmand him. The truth is, both male actors made this film virtually unwatchable. I love horrors - I even secretly enjoy the process of watching bad ones. This, on the other had is a total pile of crap.

Let me say that I do not like the 'unseen footage' type of movie and this one was no different. It was supposed to be a horror film? There was absolutely nothing scary about it. It consisted of a bunch of kids running around in the dark screaming. The narrators use of 'dude' and 'awsum' clearly indicated that it was aimed at 14 year olds. The script was dreadful, and a monkey with a typewriter could have made a better job. This site has lost all credibility and I personally believe that most of the '10's are inserted by people in the employ of the film-makers.

If you're a die hard horror movie lover than you might not be too satisfied with this film. It had the pace of ouija. One moment their in school then then 2 seconds later Charlie is attacking them. Overall \"ehh\" film I feel like it could've been better even with its found footage genre.

Sadly, there are some cases in which this format does not work at all, and \"The Gallows\" is a very clear example.The film's premise goes as it follows: In 1993, a representation of the play titled \"The Gallows\" goes horribly wrong when Charlie, a student portraying a main character dies during a simulated execution by hanging. The legend says that \"Charlie\" haunts the school theater since that day. 20 years later, the play is going to be made again by the High School seniors, and a group of friends, helping a friend who doesn't want to act, decide to destroy the set in order for the play to be canceled, but Charlie won't let them out...To start things out, the first half hour of the movie consists of a boy named Ryan (the irritant Ryan Shoos) making \"fun stuff\" which basically consist on bullying his classmates. I mean, after 5 minutes of his mean jokes you just want his character to step out of the scene. Then comes his friend Reese, a very bad actor both on the play and the movie, that has a main role on the play. Another awful performance was made by Cassidy, Ryan's girlfriend, who plays the typical dumb girl who only screams and cries during difficult or stressful situations instead of trying to help the others. The only decent performance, which gives to me the 2-star rating on the movie, was made by Pfeiffer Brown, she does her best to make her character believable and she certainly does, but it's very hard for anyone to work with such a bad script. The scares on this film consist on loud jump-scares when the ambient is very silent, and they are mostly predictable and dull. The film's intensity is overshadowed by the terrible acting from the three main characters.I have to say that the ending actually surprised me a bit until i analyzed it and discovered that it makes the whole film turn to be completely senseless and unbelievable. And that's what i meant when i said it has a bad script. An awful attempt to make a horror film, framed by terrible acting, a bad script and cheap scares.",

I know they're in high school, but it was actually very distracting listening to all his douche bag comments.The movie relied way to heavily on loud noises to scare you, and no actual dread was present.

            "content": "Let's skip the fancy introductions and word play, this is another Robbie K review with a focus on yet another horror movie. Today we jump into the latest teen horror movie entitled the Gallows, which also acts as another attempt to revive found footage films. From the trailers it looks \"interesting\" (to be nice), but I didn't hold much hope for this film. So let's get started\u0085Like most found footage films you can expect bumpy camera work giving you details about the perilous journey to unfold. I have to admit that the camera work isn't too horrible in this film, most of the time stable enough to give you the same shots of the abandoned school. The crew also gets points for some clever ideas on switching the camera perspective from the camcorder that starts our journey to cell phones equipped with a night vision application. But the good stops there. Much of the time our cast is running from the unseen force that is Charlie, the camera unfortunately swaying to and fro with not stability. Sure it brings a little more reality and edge to the picture, but too much of it left me annoyed at the lack of details. In addition, the multiple camera angles were an interesting twist, but they were executed in the wrong manner. When the doors close and you hear someone screaming you can get an idea of what is going on? So why then do I have to see footage minutes later showing what I pretty much already knew. To do this not once, but about three times didn't make it any better, and much of the time was more cheesy than anything else. Oh well, with a $100,000 budget, I guess you have to get as creative as you can right? But you probably want to know if the Gallows is scary right? In a one word summary, NO. The Gallows is cheesy, all horror drowned out by the ridiculous characters tale integrated around it. At first you get the chills as the suspense builds and you wait for that first moment of terror. In fact, the scariest part of the whole movie is the setting itself, a school after hours where one can feel abandoned in the dark hallowed halls. Why is a school so scary? Most likely because it is real, a place we can all relate to, one that is supposed to safe from such horrible fates. That comfort is robbed though when the school closes and the lights go out, the unknown frontier of the dark instigating that primal urge of fear. But past the dark halls, the scares are diluted to comical level. For one thing, the teenagers are idiots, obnoxious, rude, and annoying examples portraying the typical behavior of the average American youth. I found myself having no pity for them, waiting for their stupidity to get them in a situation they couldn't talk their way out of. In addition that building suspense is rapidly dropped, as the hunt unfolds in a manner of minutes, each predictable moment unfolding the way you expect. And the story that explains all this is rather\u0085 lame. At first it seems a simplistic tale of Charlie exacting revenge on pay defilers, but it quickly becomes more convoluted, a plot that has a few soap opera factors to it that again make it cheesy. As for Charlie himself, well the team dropped the ball on that one too. Again they started off strong, doing some subtle, traditional scare tactics that invisible specters do. Your imagination begins to paint a scary, creepy picture of what the creature looks like, and what tools he will use to torture our victims. Then you see him for what he is and well\u0085 it is very disappointing. Charlie is just a modern looking version of Jason Voorhees where the mask is replaced with a sack, and the machete is replaced with a noose that can skirt ceilings. This diluted version lacks the edge that the classic killer had and quite honestly represents the product of a low budget. There isn't much more I can say about this, other than Charlie's main scare is his lurking in the shadows in that manner that makes you want to look over your shoulder. The Gallows is a movie that is as cheesy and cheap as the budget they used to make the film. A film filled with predictable scares, a shallow story, and obnoxious characters do not make for a good scare film. Throw in the camera-work, lack of diversity and low budget villain and again you don't have much to go on. Thus, this reviewer cannot recommend this film for the theater, and would say it was better cast on the SyFy channel where cheesiness is welcomed. I can't even think of a group to go see this in the theater other than teenagers looking for a good, \"cheap\" scare. My scores are: Horror/Thriller: 4.5 Movie Overall: 3",

He had quite a big role and yet we never really find out any back story for him and his girlfriend.The Jump scares are well spaced throughout, and although most of them are very predictable, they still leave you with a racing heart and a good feeling that you can only get from horror films. The point where the film started getting confusing was as soon as the fire alarm turned off. The two remaining characters decided that because it suddenly turned off, it meant that the police had come and saved them, even though earlier the demon Charlie had clearly had enough power to change the rooms about and call the main characters phone pretending to be his dad, but I guess this skipped over his head later on.The film then clearly tries to show that this Charlie demon wants them to finish the show which he never got the chance to. But there was no reason whatsoever as to why Pfeifer suddenly was in on the whole thing. She was made out to be innocent throughout the whole thing, and even though it explains why she randomly turned up, the ending was very confusing.Just to add to the not so certain ending, the police then go and investigate her house and find her and her mum sitting there, watching the tape of the death of Charlie. And it turns out that they're some sort of witch.Overall enjoyable film, however there are many plot holes throughout which could definitely have been worked on.",

The best ones. The worst part was, in horror films, ten guys go in and only one comes out. Sometimes none. The found-footage presentation was okay for such concept. The film was short and one day event based. Most of the story was on the night in an auditorium. The initial part had fair space to kick-start the tale with a simple intro. And then the following event did not stay up to the buildup.The basic storyline itself was very weak. The characters, and their behaviours, all easily gives out the upcoming scenes. So predictable, even the twist was ordinary. The way it ended was worse than ordinary. I felt the final scene with the cops was totally unnecessary. There's nothing wrong with the actors. Even filmmaking was acceptable. But I don't know how the production company okayed the screenplay. One of the low cost film, but earned better. Despite not received well by all the quarters. I would always encourage such small films, but I can't suggest it.2/10",

            "content": "Was the production budget dangling on a string of rope or something? Because this was cheaper than a school theatre production! The inexpensive and simple conception of \"found footage\" films has resulted in many horror films tackling a variety of different ghouls who adore scaring the \"bajeezus\" out of youths and depicting pitch black environments. Sprawling woodlands, claustrophobic catacombs and even an abandoned mental institution.Well, what's the scariest place for students? High school, obviously! Shame the film was tamer than an amateur reenactment of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew'. A small cluster of students break into school one night to wreck a stage production of 'The Gallows', a play to which an understudy was accidentally killed years before.Firstly, let me address the face-palming stupidity that exists in this snooze-fest. Why would a school actively agree to create another production of a play to which an actual death occurred? There would be an uprising from parents! Especially those that were actually in the original production. Also, why would any student (although let's be honest, these actors look far too old) break into school in the middle of night? Their motives were flimsy to say the least, and it was bound to be a predictable recipe for disaster. The characters themselves were one-dimensional, emotionless and, particularly the main camera holder, irritating beyond belief. Seriously, the immature humour and childish antics were enough to get that moron a year's worth of detention. Shut the eff up and get hanging!The atmosphere was hugely lacking due to the vast amount of \"found footage\" clich\u00e9s which inadvertently failed to create any scares. Characters will stand in the middle of the camera if something happens and the typical bass kicks in to inform you that \"horror\" is coming. A few slow moving background shots enable one or two chills to invade your body, but no where near enough. Oh, and the ending? What even! The Gallows should be sent to the gallows immediately.",

            "content": "In Beatrice, Nebraska 1993, Beatrice High School student Charlie Grimille is accidentally hanged and killed after a prop malfunction during a presentation of the play The Gallows. 20 years later Beatrice High School is staging another production of The Gallows with reluctant drama class member, Ryan (Ryan Shoos), documenting the production both for the class as well as some additional shooting he's doing for himself. Ryan's best friend, Reese (Reese Mishler), is more amicable towards being in drama mostly because it allows him to perform with his crush, Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown), despite the fact he routinely flounders in his performance. When one of the stage managers Ryan Routinely abuses gives Ryan a taste of similar pranking abuse, Ryan convinces Reese to break into the school with him after hours to sabotage the set allegedly so he won't have to embarrass himself in the play in front of his crush when in reality it's to satisfy his personal grudge. Ryan's girlfriend, Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford), tags along and the trio trash the stage but eventually find Pfeifer in the school as well and the four eventually find themselves trapped in the school by supernatural means tied to the tragedy in 1993.Jason Blum has become a massive figure in Hollywood in a very unexpected fashion. Rather than producing high risk films with hefty price tags, Blum has made an empire of consistently profitable films beginning with the likes of Paranormal Activity and Insidious eventually leading to larger scale but still frugal films like The Purge, Blum's company Blumhouse has consistently churned out multiple films in a single year who's combined budgets would maybe account for at most 1/6 of your average Summer action film at most. While not all of Blumhouse's projects reach the level of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, or The Purge, the fact they're so low means if even they go direct to video or streaming it will most likely recoup it's cost. This brings us to The Gallows, which was one of the Blumhouse films frequent distribution partner Universal passed on from their first-look deal and instead distributed by Warner Bros. Who put it out during the Summer where it was met with critical and audience derision, but thanks to its $100,000 budget was able to be reasonably profitable thanks to $40 million in worldwide gross. The Gallows is just embarrassing, it's a hackneyed Found Footage film that's lacking in scares, likable characters, or even basic logic.The movie has one of the most obnoxious and unlikable leads I've seen in a horror film outside of an Eli Roth film. Ryan Shoos is the primary character for 70% of the movie and he's is just awful. When we're introduced to him he's making snide remarks at \"geeks\" and women he finds \"unattractive\" and makes misogynistic remarks and is basically a muscle headed bully who casually abuses people for no reason other than because he finds it funny, however when one of his bullying victims pulls a revenge prank on him (and relatively minor all things considered) Ryan goes berserk threatening physical violence only stopped by the fact the instructor is there and instead decides to get revenge later. Ryan Shoos plays up the character's smarminess and chuckleheaded nature to the nth degree and you find yourself rooting for the ghost. The rest of the cast are just bland, Reese Mishler is probably the most likable character by default but he's basically a blank slate who goes along with Ryan's nonsense because the movie needs him to. Cassidy is just a female Ryan, and Pfeifer is your basic quiet girl.Even basic common sense is lacking as we're never given a reason why Ryan is filming anything, especially since the stuff he's filming shows him engaging in both bullying and criminal activity including breaking and entering. The logic in a found footage film is seldom airtight and has always required some level of \"just go with it\", but the movie gives us nothing as to why this footage is being filmed. And then of course there's the ghost's \"motivation\" for why this is going on which is so misdirected and inane it's hard to know where to begin. The fact the drama department built a fully functional gallows with actual noose and trapdoor TWICE in 20 years is a major plot point in this film and with school's banning squirt guns or gun keychains under zero tolerance, there is absolutely no way any school would allow this even a state like Nebraska. Even on a purely exploitative level the movie doesn't satisfy because none of the kill scenes are memorable and are just variations on being dragged away or hung.The Gallows is a sorry excuse for a horror film. Filled with unlikable characters and nonsensical logic, The Gallows plays less like the high points of Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch Project, and more in line with the direct-to-video knock offs that were inspired by their success. At least with movies like Paranormal Entity or Gacy House they had the good sense to stay on video, but The Gallows decided it was able to sucker people into paying cinema prices, and the sad part is it worked.",

            "content": "Although it has some sparks throughout of being a generally decent thriller, The Gallows amounts to nothing but being another lifeless and incredibly predictable little found footage film, with almost nothing at all new or worthy to offer. My greatest complaint with this film has to be the editing and the acting, two very essential components in any film, especially with films like this. The acting is godawful, I've seen better actors in middle school plays than i've seen from these schmoes and not only that, but the characters are incredibly shallow and truly just the most cliche archetypes you will ever see in a horror flick. I appreciate what the film is trying to do, even though it fails drastically at doing so. The setup and plot can be interesting, but its too forced to be any fun, and oddly insensitive to its own dark origins- playing suicide off as a joke, and providing little to no reason why the horror occuring is happening at all. It's never a good question to ask while watching a movie, but more than any film i've seen in a while, The Gallows made me ask just why? It's a terrible screenplay, despite its interesting concept, its choppy editing making the illogical storyline even less coherent. I didn't hate this film, but it frustrated me, because there was truly something genius deep down in here, but instead, it's nothing but a complete and utter dud.\nMy Rating: 3.5/10",

When I go to see a scary movie, I want to be scared and this movie did just that. Almost every second of the movie I was in suspense or completely freaked out. Yes, it was a thriller with stupid teenagers, but it was SCARY and I loved it. The movie was set in a high school theatre which is extremely creepy on its own and I thought the story-line was solid. At the end of the movie every relationship and plot came together in a smooth and terrifying way. Also, the antagonist wasn't on screen much which made him even more frightening. When the antagonist is shown too often it looses the scare factor.. Great movie!",

There was no reason for the movie to be done that way aside from the theatrical affect, which was cool when Paranormal Activity did it, but now is way too overdone. Secondly, the characters were terrible & had no depth. The character Ryan was a douche bag. He wasn't funny at all. The girl was over-the-top typical bitchy cheerleader & Reese was the most boring main character I've ever witnessed. The plot line made 0 sense. This movie was simply just a fail. Everyone in the theater was laughing. The only reason it didn't get one star from me was because it did make me jump at some points. But it was mostly filled with dramatic noises & things popping up, there was no real \"horror.\" This movie is NOT worth watching. If I had been watching it on Netflix I would have turned it off after 10 minutes.",

And after 5 minutes you couldn't pay me to care about anything in regards to the film.Loosely, the plot of The Gallows is as follows: twenty years after a high school play goes horribly wrong and an accident leaves a student dead, students resurrect the play to honor the anniversary of the tragedy. Four kids go back to school at night, and that is when things go wrong.The Gallows is a flimsy excuse at a horror movie plot, and everything about it is pathetically contrived. The lore is pathetic, the characters behave irrationally and are terribly one dimensional. To top it all off, The Gallows is a 'found footage' film and is unwatchably shaky.With this type of film, and given the quality of the material, it is no wonder that the actors are also pretty bad, not horrible, but far from 'good.' They moan and whine and whimper as the shadowy figure lurks and attacks for no good reason. Not all of the blame can be put on the actors, for the dialogue is partially responsible. It is written so forced and unnatural that it is impossible to believe these are lines from a standard high schooler. It is a puzzlement that The Gallows actually managed to be greenlit from the screenplay alone, let alone get distribution when this garbage was produced.But hey, a broken clock is right two times a day, so maybe The Gallows will have some worthy scares so it is not completely possible. Unfortunately, this is a misguided hope that needs to be squashed. The Gallows relies on simple horror and the majority of the time I was laughing at the supposed 'scares'.Please check out websites for full reviews of all the recent releases.",

I guess you have guessed by now that if all a movie has going for it is to show crowd reaction at a \"special screening,\" it's not going to amount to much. Such is the case here. There is no tension, no scares, and really not much of anything. What you get is a lot of screaming and running about. Again, cell phones seem to be useless whenever you need them. There is an attempt at a \"twist,\" but if you've followed horror as much as I have, you can see it coming from a mile away.Rated \"R\" (and I don't know why) for a little salty language and some violence.

Of course the kids decide to break into the school and trash the set the night before.....piece together the rest. Anyway, the movie does well keeping you wondering where the scares will come from, but it tends to scare more with anticipation then the payoff. First person is at least used well to show the story unfold even though there have been many copycats and few turn out well, this one was average. The actors were just plain stupid throughout which was distracting and at times it was pretty slow. Overall, sure watch it if you like the handi cam flicks and/or horror in general that uses atmosphere more then gore for the scares. Netflix should work just fine for this one for you all.

Ryan convinces Reese that he is going to bomb so the three of them decide to break into the auditorium to sabotage the sets so they can't do the play. Pfeifer unrepentantly shows up and the four of them get mysteriously locked in. Ryan is filming everything as supernatural events being to take place and they start to die. This found footage movie attempts a few twists along the way, including its ending, but still fails to satisfy. Anyone who has seen three found footage movies in their life will be able to tell you what is going to happen next. Unfortunately, Directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing never steer this predictable movie off its chosen path. The scares and jumps may be effective on young teens, everyone else need not apply.

However, in order to maintain the narrative expedients coherent, it would be necessary to find a suitable justification for them. While in movies such as those from the Paranormal Activity franchise the presence of portable cameras is legitimated by the plot itself, in \"The Gallows\" and many others F.Fs, the public often ends up wondering : \"why are they carrying a camera right now? is it realistic to go on filming while in danger or under pressure?\". This important gap between reality and fiction creates a feeling of uneasiness in the most careful among the viewers, discouraging them from concentrating completely on the movie. Another small observation : there are a few attempts of creating humor, I believe, in the first scenes. It has become quite a tradition in modern horror (I remember the beginning of \"Grave Encounters 2\" or \"Cloverfield\"), but in my opinion not all the habits need to be respected. This confusion of genres, this mix of feelings is dangerous and cannot bring positive consequences : it only spoils the atmosphere, which is an essential precondition for Horrors, and also the most difficult and unstable element for writers to deal with. To sum up, I would say that \"The Gallows\" rests quietly on a pile of far worse Found Footages, but does not surely belong to the most exciting and surprising examples of the genre.",

I am a huge horror movie fan, in my forties, love all types of horror films (films in general actually), don't need non-stop action (I love IT FOLLOWS), don't need tons of blood etc. to enjoy a film. I can appreciate b- movie type films, as well as the highest art films. I am game for all of them. So in a nutshell, I don't necessarily have an agenda, in terms of what makes a horror movie a good one. I also must say that I love, LOVE, found footage films as I feel they draw you in and let you mind fill in so much of the parts you don't see. Love them.OK having said this; let me get to the movie. I went in expecting just to be entertained, no less. I never really have high expectations for films, and try not to read a lot about them before I go in, so that I don't pre-judge them per say. With The Gallows, I basically saw the add on TV, and left it at that. I was, if anything really set to enjoy the film and looked forward to it. Let me be blunt. I left the theater feeling like I just watched either 1) a subversive attempt at commercial film by a religious group; 2) or a film aimed at people who don't like horror films, are easily offended, or only see G rated films. This was by far the most vanilla ice cream, generic, unimaginative, not scary horror movie I have seen. Maybe ever, and trust me when I say I have seen tons of films. I am the one that you work with or go to school with that always finds something to defend in terms of films when others say, \"it's boring,\" or \"stupid.\" No I am that guy, the one that looks deeper. Well my friend I looked, and looked and dug, and at the end of it all felt a bit insulted. I felt like my great-great grandmother edited the film for my consumption. The dialogue was not realistic. I'm sorry, children do not talk like this unless they are in a Christian school, and I'm not even totally sure about that. But furthermore the film was just an hour and twenty minutes of pseudo haunted house type scares. But not as scary. So for those that want a nuts and bolts view of this. No cursing, no nudity, no blood, virtually no violence, and frankly kind of comes off as silly. I mean seriously this is a horror film for children. Really. Not just because of the lack of these things but because there is no substance either. Silly is the word I keep coming back to. Anyone, and I mean anyone can scare someone by jumping out at them from the dark or making a noise. But so what? I mean, is that film making now? Seriously, I feel like someone gathered their drama club for real (maybe they did) and said lets make a horror movie they can show at church on Sunday. This is possibly the worst found footage film I have seen. I wasn't scared for a second. I constantly found myself asking who is filming this at this time. I wondered how many cameras there were\u0085 Oh and don't get me started on the guy who wants to destroy the set of the play and breaks out with a drill to carefully undrill the screws and parts to the set\u0085what? Oh and pushing a plant over, now that's destruction. This is so silly I can't really explain. This is a kindergarten movie, but not as scary. Look, if you are bored, and really have nothing to do, and there are NO OTHER FILMS, NONE, and someone else will pay, and you have a vague, passing interest in horror, and you can't schedule a dentist appointment or something\u0085then maybe go see this film.

After all, that was all completely unnecessary, because this movie was one of the better horror movies that I have ever seen on the screen.This movie just really did what it should do as a horror movie, which is scaring the audience. And it did! Just hearing the audience scream was already worth my money. This movie includes some great jump scares, and even though you can feel them coming you will still shock! Some people were complaining that they did not like the way of filming, that is similar to unfriended and paranormal activity. But the way of filming did not bother me at all. As a matter of fact, I think it made the film better. Mostly because the film gets a lot more scarier when you see the halls from their camera, that they keep closely tot their own faces. So it is oftenly filmed like seeing the environment through their eyes instead of from a short distance.In short, I would highly recommend to go see this movie in the cinema if you are in for hell of a scary movie with a hilariously scared audience.",

If you are expecting a good horror movie, the closest this movie has to offer are a few jump-scares and loud noises with shaky home video camera action and low lighting.

Save for maybe Reese, the protagonist, the characters are all annoying in their own way. Youv'e got the instigator: Ryan \u2013 who plans the whole break-in to the school, whines most of the time, and doesn't really do anything other than hold the camera. You've got Cassidy \u2013 the blond bimbo girlfriend of Ryan and Pfeiffer \u2013 the overdramatic drama nerd who just happens to show up at the school the night before the play inexplicably and nobody bothers to ask her why she's there?

            "content": "My Thoughts:Oh, horror movies, you try so hard sometimes and sadly, usually fall short. The Gallows falls short on a few different levels. First and foremost, they made it a found-footage movie--why hasn't this type of movie died yet? Seriously, it was a great gimmick like ten years ago; now, it is an annoying gimmick that makes me not want to pay attention to your movie.The whole premise of the story is that in 1993, a student of the play The Gallows was killed during the hanging scene. Now, twenty years later, one of the drama kids wants to resurrect the play to complete it, and for some reason, a couple of football jocks decide that even though they suck at acting, they will join the drama class. Well, they convince themselves that the only way not to either bomb or disappoint the class is to sneak in the night before the opening day and destroy the set. Needless to say, things don't go down the way the kids thought they would.The scare tactic of choice for The Gallows are jump scares. Don't get me wrong, they have some inventive ways to get you, and I will admit, some of them did get me, but like with most horror movies (at least for me), once you figure out which horror tactic they are employing, you can be on the lookout and prepare yourself for them.If you are paying attention during the movie, you can pretty much figure out the who-done-it, though they do throw in a twist towards the end which I thought was pretty good. However, it does not make up for the rest of the movie.There are no mid-credit or end-credit scenes. My Recommendation:Rent it.check out more reviews at www.shepfromtamp.com",

This is a movie you can see multiple times, and still be scared and see things you did not see before. The R rating is completely because the movie is so scary!

            "content": "I'll admit, the first trailer for this was moody and intense. I came to find it was a full scene from the film, and one of the better ones at that. I had reasonably high hopes after that first trailer, and that maintained\u0085right up until I saw the TV spot (link is above) that said \"Freddy had his glove. Jason had his machete. Charlie has his noose.\" That was the first red flag for me, and I know it's not the fault of the film makers.The reason that I hate that so much is simple : you can't call yourself \"the next\" something. Freddy and Jason were never expected too be much of anything, and became icons by accident. That's how icons are created, people form emotional connections to characters and that's how it happens, you can't force us to feel that way.Alright, shoddy and weird marketing aside, let's get to the actual movie. While I won't say this movie is without value and is total garbage, I will definitely not be sharing the views of any of the people who gave this movie 9/10 reviews. It's funny to me to see this movie getting such high praise, when found-footage (yes, it's found footage) movies get immediately written off by the general public.I'm going to start with the positives, that seems like a nice thing to do right?First off, the opening scene of this movie is great. It's a pretty convincing tape of a school play, the parents filming are having a barely audible argument off camera, and the whole thing does feel quite genuine. The accidental hanging of the student is pretty grim, and you do get a pretty chilling opening as a result. I even forgive the weird moments of static that appear to make it creepier, almost. The scene would have been more effective without them, but hey, what can you do.There are also a few really good, tense scenes in the movie, the one from the trailer is pretty effective, and the quiet moments in the school are pretty good for tension building.With that being said, the movie is not good. Our main characters are pretty unlikable from the get go. The guy holding the camera, Ryan Shoos (Pretty Little Liars), is really just terrible. He spends most of the movie being the bro-iest bro from brosville and making fun of his best friend (?), Reese Mishler (nothing you've heard of), for getting the lead in a play. He spends so much time making fun of theater \"geeks\" and \"nerds\" (seriously) and puffing himself up, because he plays football and dates a cheerleader and s therefore superior.Credit where credit is due, there are no homophobic epithets in the movie. At least, none that I heard. A few years ago, Ryan's character would have absolutely been remarking on how \"gay\" everything is, but it is nice that that is strayed away from. However, being not COMPLETE garbage doesn't make you a good person or this a good movie. It's hard when 3 of your 4 characters are unlikable, and the other is kind of a non-presence.The scares in the movie rely primarily on loud noises, I really wish that people would learn there is more to horror than just having someone scream in your face. You can feel all of the scares coming about 10 minutes away, and it's kind of like having someone hiding behind a door, who you know is there, popping out and just YELLING in your face every few minutes.The ending is rushed, and REALLY stupid, we find out (of course) that one of our quartet has a connection to the original play via their mother, and it's just\u0085 dumb. We've seen it all before, and we've seen it all done better. There are good moments in the movie, but overall it's another weak entry. It's starting to feel like you can't trust much from a major distributor like WB, and even New Line has started to let me down.What a shame.www.barleydoeshorror.com",

This is why I've given it a 7 out of 10! People expect too much from horror these days, the sooner we accept that it has all been done, then we'll be able to enjoy the genre a lot more!

While this isn't the worst found footage horror film I've seen in recent memory, it's not even the worst horror movie, but the found footage sub genre is starting to get boring. There are something's about this movie I liked however, the atmosphere and setting are great ideas, and when two characters had cameras and something would happen off screen it would then show us what happened, that was a clever idea. The script was atrocious, right off the bat we are introduced to that mean guy in school who you really want to kick in the head, he goes around insulting everyone for the first half hour and it's really annoying, and his reason for wanting to ruin the play the school is having doesn't make any sense. The school held a play in 1993 where a cast member Charlie, was killed and that's the play the school is holding. No school board hold a play where a cast member was killed. The premise of the play reminds of a Goosebumps story \"The Phantom of the Auditorium.\" Our main character Reese, who is playing the lead role in play due to his crush on the female lead Pfeiffer, and his decision to go along with buddy's plan is just stupid. To secretly devastate his crush and support her in a time of need, good plan, NOT! They, along with with Ryan's girlfriend break into the school to ruin the school play, as they carry out the deed they find Pfeiffer is there as well, and then they are locked in the school and scary stuff starts happening. Later on they discover Charlie was an understudy in the play and the original actor called in sick and they find out it was Reese's father. While they try to escape, they start getting attacked and killed. Near the end Reese and Pfeiffer are the only ones left and pull the fire alarm to alert the authorities and as they nearly escape they realize the spirit wants them to do the final scene in the play, Reese is executed and Pfeiffer takes a bow with Charlie's ghost as this was watched by the original actress, who was Charlie's girlfriend in 1993. It is revealed that Pfeiffer is Charlie's daughter, teenage pregnancy? The twist made no sense and felt forced and just didn't work. And seriously, who films themselves breaking and entering, idiot alert! This film was uninspiring, following terrible horror movie techniques, the false jump scares that only made me jump because of a loud noise. I hate false jump scares, you hear this ear-piercing noise when it's just a friend opening a door or turning on a light, at least have these loud noises emulating from something that's scary.

I found the film to be quite boring and it wasted so many chances for potential scares, also the best scares (apart from the end) were all in the trailer, so there weren't many surprises to be had. I did like the creepy ending because i did get creeped out a bit, but the reason for the film ending up there was absolutely ridiculous and a very, very annoying plot hole! It would have been kind of clever if it had made more sense, i also predicted a lot of things that happened.

The worst problems is that falls into the clich\u00e9 that the vast majority of such films have: the classic characters and their so burned development, the classic jump scares, the classic entity/monster/ghost that -somehow- is killing just for the sake of the plot, the classic perfect end to the murderer.I'm mean... I get that thanks to movies like this you can just disconnect from the real world and enter a world that you don't have to think to much, not that cinema has to be that way, but man... this movie is such a wast of everybody's time, even the guys that made this crap.This is boring and for the sole purpose of getting the most money to the cinema audience . Clearly, Hollywood is an industry and as such seeks to maintain a way or another, is an industrial monster that does not care about the product but the financial result.Now, making money is not a crime, everybody does that. The crime is to not take enough respect to the story and the intelligence of the viewer.Thank God I did not pay a penny for this crap , but I did paid the price for my time.",

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer for this movie and read the plot summary, it did not seem very promising to me. However, some time later I decided to give The Gallows a chance and watch it on VOD. Turns out that this 2015 \"found footage\" horror is probably the worst wide theatrical release movie of 2015. Every minute of it is so badly thought-out, scripted, acted & shot, that I wonder why anyone went throught the trouble of making a marketing campaign and distributing it, and more importantly why so many people went to see it at the big screens (this mess apparently earned an astonishing 40 million USD at the box office).\nSo the film's premise is very simple and from the very start it's obvious it's going to be about a group of teenagers filming themselves being haunted in their high school by a ghost of a student who had died during a school play. However, this simple plot has a needlessly convoluted introduction as much of the movie is spent introducing numerous characters doing various activites, but that's all just filler because the whole movie follows just 4 characters which means that more than 90% of the film's cast is in it for no reason. When the horror starts (and it takes a lot of time for it to start) most scenes are filmed in such an annoyingly bad lighting (even for a found footage movie) and everything looks so unnatural and staged, that it's really hard to even follow the movie, let alone care about anything that happens in it. The scene with the girl in red lights from the film's poster is supposed to be the highlight of the movie, but the way it's filmed differs significantly from the rest of the movie. The acting is mediocre throughout the movie, but near the ending it worsens and becomes laughably bad. There are some moments when we get to see the ghost as a physical creature, and it looks so cheaply made that I could literally make a better costume with stuff from my wardrobe.\nAlso, I don't want to spoil anything (even for such a bad movie) but at the very end there is supposed to be a huge plot twist, but it's so unbelievable & illogical & badly executed, that it's impossible to care or be surprised by it.\nAll in all, the Gallows is an unusually bad and boring movie, even for its genre, and I would not recommend it to anyone.",

The writing, the performances, the camera work, everything, is terrible.The writing is so stilted and obvious its as if the writers think the audience is a bunch of idiots. Lines that are set-ups for future events are so blatant, and the writing overall is just irritating, especially anything coming out of the mouth of the cameraman, who is possibly the worst character in any film I have seen.The acting is over the top and makes the film feel stupid, which makes the already bad plot seem even worse. To tell you the plot would be a waste of time as it has no sort of worth to anyone in any way. It's that bad.Finally, the fact this is a found footage style film adds nothing to the plot, and if anything only seems to be done to keep the budget down. Again, the nonsensical plot makes it seem even more idiotic. Found footage is meant to add a layer of realism to a story and so when the story, dialogue and characters seem unnatural, it completely goes against the purpose of the filming style. It's literally just so that they can save some money and make a ton more profit than they otherwise would off this piece of crap.Overall, don't watch it, it's bad. If you want to get a better idea of how painful the film is, I suggest watching the first 5 minutes and listening closely to that stilted dialogue. It's the same throughout the entire movie, and it doesn't get better. It's awful. Don't watch.",

It isn't good folks and the kind of thing that should have went straight to Netflix.There's not much more to say than that I'm afraid. The opening scene was pretty grim and actually made me think that I was finally in for a good horror movie after seeing the abomination that was the 'Poltergeist' remake. Unfortunately, 'Poltergeist' looks like 'The Exorcist' compared to this nonsense. The acting is just awful. I'm sorry, there's no nicer way to put it but I literally wanted to smack every single character in the face and was rooting for the ****SPOILER**** spirit of Charlie. They just came off as obnoxious and disingenuous. I'm sure they're very nice in real life. Now, when you have watched as many horror movies as I have in my time you have to allow for a generous amount of suspension of belief however, there were so many things in this movie which just seemed ludicrous that it's as if the writers just thought \"oh how are we going to explain this?\" and didn't bother to come up with a reasonable explanation and decided to just throw in a jump scare each time to distract you from the abyss of a plot hole...of which there are many. Oh and FYI - you cannot get an app that turns your phone into a night vision camera. That's not how it works. That's bad research and just bad science.The storyline actually had potential - hence the 2 stars. Had it been developed further and not filmed I in the cop out found footage genre, this could have made for a potentially great horror mystery supernatural thriller in the vein of 'The Conjuring', but sadly it was not to be. To be honest the whole thing just felt rushed. The ending...pfft! It was as if some bright spark said: \"I know, let's end this is the most obvious way ever but make it seem super twisty as if no-one would have seen it coming even though it makes absolutely no sense at all\" and BAM!! Jumpscare! The audience are left feeling confused, underwhelmed and are struggling to remember any of the characters names while three teenage girls who had been sitting down the front spending the whole movie giggling every time their friend flinched, go on about how \"that was so scary! even more than that Paranormal Activity one! I'm not going to sleep tonight! Oh em geeeee!\" The rest of us shuffle out of the theater in silence, checking the IMDb app on our phones, looking for a 'The Conjuring 2' release date in the hopes it comes we give up on the modern horror scene.",

When it comes to the characters, you can see all the clich\u00e9s horror movies now stand for. There is the pretty blonde girl with a slutty attitude, where it gets clear that she's one of the first to die, then there's her boyfriend the sports guy who gets murdered for his stupidity as well. And then there's the cute couple consisting of the girl next door and the football jock who secretly has a passion for drama (Glee, much?) and of course at the end he sacrifices him for her, turned around it could have been better.The story itself is pretty simple, but in my eyes kind of interesting, but unfortunately doesn't show any excitement or scary moments. The ending was th best part of the whole movie (or better the only part I liked), because it was kinda original and \"surprising\" but here again I can say, that they could've extended the situation more.

There, we see a normal high school acting, with the famous Charlie as August, in a play called ironically \"The Gallow\" or something like that. Then, we see the character Bryan (who cheaply is the actor's name) who's recording with a camera everything he and everyone does, and everywhere he is. Now we see the main character, Reese (also the actor's name) who acts in this play as August. This guy's doing something \"productive\" as Bryan annoys him (he's studying for the play.). Reese know he won't do well on the play, so they decided to go and break the stage at night the day before the play. Now Pfeifer (Actor of the play with Reese, ALSO the same name as actor's) and Casidy (Bryan's girlfriend, also the same name as actor's) pop up there \"by coincidence\". Then, they start breaking the stage and the spirit Charlie, of the 1993 play. He starts hanging everybody, everyone dies, etc. That's the film in a nutshell. And i tried to make it long, so that's when you find out that plot's lame, and that this idea never had a chance. Oh, and another thing: the acting is lame, typical of found-footage movies.

            "content": "This movie does nothing different from any other found footage horror movie. Its a waste of time that includes anything from really annoying characters to bad acting. It does have positives that include two cameras for when the characters get separated. The school aspect was also pretty original. This movie has really terrible writing that made no sense and there is a twist that makes this movie no better. The twist actually made the movie worse than it already was. The jump scares in this movie were so hyped up to be nothing more than a character accidentally kicking something. If I were you I wouldn't spend your money on this and just wait for it to come out on Redbox if you really want to see it.",
