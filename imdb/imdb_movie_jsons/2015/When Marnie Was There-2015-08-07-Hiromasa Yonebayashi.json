            "content": "From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.The movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.Not a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.The opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.Feels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.I love you more than any girl I've ever known.Studio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.This film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, every time when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.9/10",

            "content": "One of the many pleasures you have when you watch a Studio Ghibli film is its colorful animation and When Marnie Was There is yet another perfect example of that. More impressively, the story the film tells is just as filled with colorful themes and plot points that you just wouldn't get from a Disney or Dreamworks animated film. When Marnie Was There doesn't pull any punches, but more importantly, the punches they throw at the audience mean something and will have an emotionally resonating impact for all viewers, not just kids. The film tells the story of Anna, a young girl who spends the summer with her relatives close to open water, and finds a mysterious and seemingly abandoned mansion across the water. After drawing numerous sketches of the mansion, she finds her way across using a row boat. What follows after that is a legitimately mysterious plot that keeps the audience guessing at every turn. Is Anna seeing things? Is this all a dream? Which characters are hiding what? And so on. For most of the film, that technique works very well. But there are a few times when the secrets and potential reveals get a bit tiresome.When Marnie Was There is a story about plenty of things like regret, loss, and neglection. But at the heart of the film is a story about friendship, and an unlikely one at that. Obviously, there's plenty of things about the plot that you can't reveal without spoiling anything, but Anna and Marnie's bond throughout is truly something special. It's a bond that is probably more satisfying when you watch it a second time and can appreciate it without having to keep your eyes pealed for the next secret to be let out.The film is complemented by a beautiful score and a heart wrenching end credits song that is sure to get even the most stubborn of people to get teary eyed. But it's also a different kind of sadness than say a Pixar or Disney film can give you (exceptions of course). When Marnie Was There has a dream like quality to the entire story, but the devastating moments hit you like a ton of bricks. Even in its most unrealistic instances, you feel the same sorrow and happiness that the characters do.+Score+Story has just the right amount of dark moments+Probably more depth than other animated flicks+Bond between Marnie and Anna-Mysteries perhaps get a bit tiresome8.7/10",

            "content": "This Movie touches the human soul at many level. It depicts a child who has been abandoned, by her mother and then grandmother and later partly by her foster-mother, so she feels she can not depend on adults for security. It also shows the value of family and love and affection within the family. Unlike American movies where no one seems to have a family, where the only expression of love is trivial and sexual, here the emotions are deep and adult.The movie elevates us to our higher beings, and that is why the experience is lasting, and enjoyable.What I also liked about this movie is that the movie is pure and clean, and suitable for families again unlike American shows where there is always some agenda from some interest group. Here you are free to be yourself. below is in response to a perverted reviewer with mind in gutter who thought this move was misleading. Please do not associate yourself with this movie. This is obviously made for people with human soul, and not you.",

The kind of feeling that your sorrow and loneliness nailed you down and you fell into the deep darkness alone, then you stood up, and finds sparks and sparks of lights appeared, leading you to the end of the nightmare, and when came out, you found the sunshine was warmer than ever? This is the movie \"when Marnie was there\".I like this movie. It's a story about two lonely girls, about family and the world, magical but real. As a OCD viewer, my left brain kept investigating who that girl is, and my right was eager to know what will happen next. The good thing is, however, both my brains were astonished and satisfied again and again, unlike how other Ghibli movies roll. This new film, which is the first one after the retirement of the two great founders, shows the skills and talent of the next generation Ghibli artists. Future is saved, or maybe better?And as many Ghibli movies, \"when Marnie was there\" is full of beautiful paintings and musics, voices recreating the characters vividly, and an unforgettable theme song in the end. The story, like I said, is fabulous. I don't like spoiling movies, and the secret in this case is the core and foundation of everything. I'll leave it to you to discover. Enjoy!",

            "content": "The last film to be produced under the Studio Ghibli banner before the acclaimed animation studio decided to take a break from filmmaking following the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki, When Marnie Was There is an elegantly crafted & gorgeously animated tale that intertwines dreams with reality as well as past with present, only to end up getting entangled in its own web.Based on the novel of the same name, When Marnie Was There follows Anna; a 12-year old girl who takes a trip to a countryside town for health reasons and discovers an abandoned mansion where she finds an unlikely friend in Marnie; a blond girl. As their new relationship blossoms over the next few days & both get to know each other better, it is unraveled that Anna is more closely related to Marnie than expected.Nicely directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, When Marnie Was There is his sophomore effort following his debut feature, The Secret World of Arrietty, which remains my favourite Studio Ghibli film to be not directed by Miyazaki. And although his latest is no doubt an ambitious work, its pay-off won't be rewarding enough emotionally unless the viewers try to connect the dots all by themselves by doing a little digging of their own.The technical aspects are expertly carried out for each frame of it is sumptuously animated & vividly photographed from start to finish. Editing tries to juggle various elements of story at once & doesn't always succeed. However, there isn't any issue with the pacing for its 103 minutes of runtime never becomes tedious at any given moment. Also, the background score brims with tracks that infuse a soothing feel into the narrative.The Japanese voice cast is only as fitting as the studio's previous works. However, it's the beautiful relationship between Anna & Marnie that leaves the biggest mark. The film can be viewed as a coming-of-age drama that follows the journey of Anna from a lonely & anxious girl at the beginning of the film to a more confident person later in the story. Marnie herself exhibits an aura of mystery around her that not only allures Anna but us viewers as well.On an overall scale, When Marnie Was There isn't as magical as Studio Ghibli's finest films but its take on friendship & isolation nonetheless manages to cast a spell of its own in bits n pieces which makes its story captivating for a while. A love story, a coming-of-age tale & a deep journey into one's own past, When Marnie Was There may or may not benefit from multiple viewings but for now, it has to settle for an underwhelming experience in my book. Still, it's worth a shot!",

            "content": "Anna, a twelve year old girl, is living with her foster parents in Sapporo but she has asthma so they think it will do her good to spend the summer with her aunt and uncle in a small coastal town. Here she goes out intending to do some sketching; while out she sees an impressive mansion across the marsh. She paddles through the shallow water and finds a house that appears to have been abandoned. As she returns she thinks she sees a light in an upstairs window. She decides to return but the tide is high, however somebody has left a small boat on the dock which she uses to row to the Marsh House. Once here she meets a girl about her own age who tells her that she put the boat at the dock for her. We later learn that this girl is the Marnie of the title. There is something a little odd about her; sometimes it seems as though she just disappears and when she invites Marnie into her house it certainly doesn't seem abandoned.When one thinks of Studio Ghibli one instinctively thinks of great directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata but they have now retired and we can just hope the next generation of directors can provide us with more iconic films. Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi is certainly getting off to a good start; first he directed 'Arrietty' and now this. The story is told at a very gentle, some would say slow, pace but for me that just served to bring me into Anna's world\u0085 of course it helped that everything looked so beautiful. Anna is an unusual protagonist; she is fairly unhappy much of the time; at least until she meets Marnie\u0085 and then there is the sense that Marnie is quire real. Her exact nature is uncertain though; is she a figment of Anna's imagination or a ghost or is there another explanation? There was certainly a haunting feel to the story as we waited to discover just who she is. The eventual revelation was delightfully bittersweet. The film will probably not appeal to the youngest viewers as it isn't the sort of story that stuff constantly happens and it is a bit sad at times; however I suspect slightly older children and their parents will enjoy it\u0085 even though it isn't officially 'shoujo' I expect it will appeal more to girls than boys. Overall I really enjoyed this; I just hope it isn't Studio Ghibli's final film as has been rumoured.",

            "content": "I've nearly watched all animations by Studio Ghibli (and many others other than from this studio) and I can with certainty say that this one is the best animated one! It's like a live-action film with great actors :) Every single emotion is magnificently drawn! When you watch this animation, you shouldn't expect a thriller or scenes of action.. the story is widely dramatic and heartbreaking. It has lots of suspenseful moments that make you want to watch it till the end and the ending is really worth the wait! The anime is about family problems and a young & ill girl's way of dealing with it. One could say that it is her coming of age story which is not easy for her, so she finds a \"friend\", a mysterious foreigner who helps to find herself and make her see the world with different eyes ;) People who think animations are just for children or for younger generation are completely wrong! If you have prejudices, go and watch one and see it for yourself! I can recommend Spirited Away & Grave of the Fireflies. And I really can't believe that Studio Ghibli will take a break from filmmaking now... or will maybe never come back to it again. It's a mess! After seeing so much untalented people doing so many films and earning much money (especially those cheesy Hollywood animations), although for not deserving it, I'm aware of the fact that real artists should be praised! BTW: I don't easily give a film 10/10 ;)",

            "review_title": "A musically driven almost-masterpice.",
            "content": "This film has the honour of being the first anime film that I experienced on the big screen.I THINK the moments when I was walking out the door after the movie defined what I felt about the film: I overheard a teenage girl saying: 'Don't know about you, but I never noticed violin music in films before this.' Then she proceeds to hum Anna's theme out loud...note by note.OK, first of all, I don't know what films she has being watching before this, because pretty much every film I watched with a decent score had music I can remember. But even I must admit: The music is the hero in this film, its by far the loudest sound maker in the film, as the strings overwhelms you while the subdued virtual camera pans across typically well-produced Ghibli background art with a bit of light sound effects. I think this film has mastered musically silent scenes...by perfectly contrasting them with scenes where the music takes the reins. The feelings to dread, loneliness and the atmospheric feelings when Anna was exploring the marshes.I find it intriguing that Marnie's theme was hinted at the beginning, even before the appearance of Marnie, taking its full form about half way into the film, but was never given a full fanfare moment: its a tender woodwind led melody that usually takes the form of a bittersweet waltz, its really quite beautiful to see our two main characters dance to it. Anna's theme; definitely the most memorable theme of the film; is written sorely for tear-jerking. The second phrase of this theme takes the form of a 7 note motif, with the first note jumping almost an octave apart to the second before sliding down with the following 5 notes: vintage nostalgic and beautiful writing. Anyone who can survive these 7 simple notes must have a brick for a heart.And this basically sums up the music of this film: simple, beautiful and absolutely nostalgic: it is able to etch itself into your brain without the brute force of brass and percussion, relying mainly on tender piano and woodwind solos and a warm strings section. Even the credits song; interestingly sung and written in English; is practically created just to give you nostalgic feelings and tender melancholy.If I have to describe this film in one word, it would be 'sweet.' That's it. Sweet. Every character; no matter the amount of screen time they get, are awfully likable, the Oiwa family is fun to watch while they had the spotlight, Sayaka, who briefly appears as an adventurous and curious girl, is pleasant to see on screen, Anna and Marnie share a lot of sweet and cute moments, each one leaving you with a big smile on your face. The exceptions to this are characters mainly shown shown in flashbacks: the maids and a brief character called Emily. What I like about Ghibli films like this; a general lack of concrete plot timeline (see Kiki, Totoro and Poppy Hill); is just how...character-driven these films are: there's no plot points that taints and 'conveniently' motivates the characters, instead the plot is moved along by character motivation itself; even if some characters may appear for just seconds...they still somehow serve a profound purpose: The most brutal scenes in the entire film is when the elder Hisako tells her story to Anna and Sayaka: we get to see how Hisako, Anna and Marnie are connected through time.Granted, I would've like to see more of Marnie, Sayaka and Hisako; particularly Hisako; but what I got was satisfying.Needless to say, the art and animation is flawless, Studio Ghibli just utterly celebrates hand drawn animation...its backgrounds feels like vivid recreations of Monet paintings brought to life, the Marsh House drawn on pencil by Anna and oil painted by Hisako looked stunning on screen.So...is this a good film to farewell Ghibli in the foreseeable future? Yes. Is it a masterpiece? It succeeds in many ways but fails in some others. Like I said, the side characters have much more to bring to the table, Anna can be a bit whiny and annoying at first, but she grows like any main character should, Marnie feels too...perfect, and her backstory does not seem to fit her character at times...but she's still a likable presence on screen. Overall, a must watch if you want a easy segway to slowly get into Ghibli films. The soundtrack? Now, this is a possible masterpiece...I would rate score with 5* if its theme based rating only, but overall, its a 4.5*. I also recommend you to check out the included image album: particularly the Anna theme suite.",

            "content": "Following Miyazaki's retirement, the pressure was heavy on Director Yonebayashi as the next successor of Ghibli Studio. But in the Japanese multimedia, it was stated by the Former Director Miyazaki and Producer Suzuki that the future successor was finally decided after watching Yonebayashi's first solo directed movie \"When Marnie Was There (2014)\". Was this really the case? My answer - Yes.This movie is unique in a sense that the story revolves around two female protagonists \"Anna\" and \"Marnie\"; although it does remind us a hint of the nostalgic movie \"My Neighbour Totoro\" which starred \"Satsuki\" and \"May\", their relationship is far more complex. As the story progresses, their relationship becomes more clear and vivid to the audience, and the confusion of the intertwining reality and the dreamlike world starts to unfold. The two girls go on a journey as they discover each others past and dwells upon their current problems, and gradually develops an unbreakable bond that unites them stronger.Although the trailer did cause some confusing misunderstandings between the two girls in Japan, and at the same time my expectations lowered; after watching the movie it was no doubt a splendid and flawless piece of art both literally and figuratively.It is worth noting that Yonebayashi truly challenged the impossible, as even Miyazaki had once thought of making this novel into a movie but had backed down due to its continuous complex changes that occur in the world of the two girls. Furthermore, Yonebayashi has created his \"own\" depiction of the sky in this movie, and is no longer the \"blue sky\" and \"white clouds\" that Miyazaki has portrayed in his series of work. So we can expect to see his own unique world of Ghibli gradually bloom in the next upcoming years.To summarize the experience, it was astonishing how we, the audience ourselves can go on a journey together with the protagonists to overcome their obstacles. Paying attention to the changes in Anna's facial expressions is extremely crucial if you want to enjoy this movie. The succinct yet complex portrayal of these two girls really make you think of the depths of friendship.To conclude, I would like to end with Suzuki's logo that he had written for the advertising poster. The message of the logo is so sincere that to me there is no better way of epitomizing the message that the author and the director was trying to convey to the audience - \u300c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u300d- \"I love you\"; an unconditional love.",

            "content": "Joan G. Robinson's novel \"When Marnie Was There\" is a favourite of mine and has long enjoyed great popularity in Britain, but I was surprised to learn that it is also known in Japan. The original novel is set in a seaside village in Norfolk, but this animated version transfers the action to the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The characters become Japanese rather than English, although the names of the two main characters, Anna and Marnie, have been retained. Rather oddly, Marnie remains a blue-eyed blonde, as she was in the book: Anna is a brunette, but nevertheless has large round blue eyes. Now characters, especially female characters, in anime often look surprisingly Caucasian, even when they are supposed to be Japanese. In this case, however, Marnie is the daughter of an English father and Japanese mother. (There is also an explanation for Anna's blue eyes, but I won't say what it is as that would be to give away too much of the ending).In this version Anna is a shy, withdrawn and introverted girl, probably aged about 12, living in Sapporo with her foster-parents, with whom she has lived ever since her real parents were killed in a car crash and her grandmother died soon afterwards. Because she suffers from asthma, Anna is sent away from the city to live with Mr & Mrs Oiwa, relatives of her stepmother, in a rural seaside town. Anna has always found it difficult to make friends; she feels that all the rest of the world is inside an invisible circle and that she is on the outside. At first does not seem any happier at the seaside than she did in Sapporo, but things change when she meets Marnie, a girl living in a large house by the sea.The two girls form a close friendship, the first either has ever known, but there is something strange about Marnie, who asks Anna to keep their relationship a secret and who seems to appear and disappear mysteriously. Nobody seems to know anything about her or her family, and her house, although obviously once grand, seems dilapidated and abandoned. Anna finds herself wondering whether her new friend is real, or a ghost, or a figment of her imagination. Eventually Marnie seems to disappear for good, but Anna is befriended by another family who have recently arrived in the village, especially their daughter Sayaka, and this leads to the truth about Marnie, and about Anna's own past, eventually being revealed.When I was younger, animated movies always seemed like something specifically American; Disney seemed to have the market in full-length cartoons sewn up. In more recent decades, however, Disney seem to have abandoned the traditional hand-drawn cartoon in favour of computer animation, and their mantle has passed to Japan, particularly Studio Ghibli. The Ghibli style, however, is very different from the Disneys which I used to love as a child- less stylised, more realistic and with more subdued colours. The visual look of \"When Marnie Was There\" is particularly attractive; I have never been to Hokkaido, but the mountainous landscapes depicted here conjure up the same sort of sense of place which Robinson achieved with her descriptions of the very different Norfolk coast.Much as I love Robinson's book, it does have a couple of minor weaknesses. She never fully explains why Anna is allowed to take so much time off school and what becomes of her biological father after his divorce from her mother. There is perhaps something of a slackening of intensity in the third quarter of the book, between Anna's final meeting with Marnie and the denouement. In the film, however, all these matters are addressed or resolved. Anna's absence from school is explained by her health condition, and Anna's mother is only married once; the man who dies with her in the accident is Anna's father, not her stepfather. The pacing is also better, with no perceptible slackening, possibly because Sayaka, who emerges as Anna's new friend and confidante, is a more well-developed figure than Priscilla, the equivalent character in the book.On the surface, Robinson's novel is a simple tale of the friendship between two young girls, but beneath that surface it is surprisingly deep, tackling the interrelated subjects of loneliness, friendship, bereavement and parental neglect. All of these elements are covered in as much depth in the film version which, I feel, in some respects even manages to improve upon the book. With this film Studio Ghibli have succeeded in the difficult task of taking a story very much rooted in one culture, transferring it to another, very different culture (with only a few minor changes to the plot) and producing something of universal relevance. A beautiful film. 10/10",

            "content": "A while back, I watched a documentary about Hiyao Miyazaki and he sure sounded as if he was saying that after his final film, Studio Ghibli would be no more. Is this true? Not exactly, as this film soon came out...but since then things have been vague and at the very least, the studio is on some sort of hiatus. What's next? Who knows. But does this film give any weight to the argument that Ghibli certainly can go on without him? It did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature....but is it good and does it meet the studio's standards?The film is about an asthmatic loner, Anna. She's a very sad young girl and has no friends. To help her improve her health, she's sent out to live in the country. However, she soon becomes obsessed with a seemingly abandoned mansion nearby as well as the young lady, Marnie, that lives there. But as the film progresses, the audience begins to wonder if Marnie even exists or if she's some sort of ghost. The real story about Marnie and how this all relates to Anna is something finally revealed near the end...suffice to say that you might just need some tissues. And, since it is such a melancholy film, I don't recommend it to young kids, as they won't understand what they are watching. But for everyone else, including adults, it's a very satisfying and beautiful film...and every bit as enjoyable as the best of Miyazaki. Because of this, I don't quite understand the hiatus. Why not continue the momentum and positive feelings this film will no doubt generate?! Overall, this is a very special and quite unusual film...one that probably has no chance against \"Inside Out\"...but still well worth seeing.",

            "content": "This one was an interesting one for me.It was a great movie, and an amazing story about a lonely foster kid whose angry at the world, but befriends a mysterious girl that changes her life forever.I'm usually not into this type of anime that tells a story that can be told using live-action. The movie is similar to the Wind Rises in it's dramatic pulse, but the animation in The Wind Rises was able to help the story along far more than it did with this one. There was nothing about the film that seemed to be helped with the fact that it's animated. I know people who love movies like this but will not go see it cause it's a \"cartoon\" which is a shame.The story in itself is so good that I forget that the anime theme was what sucked me in, and I just take it in as the overall excellent movie that it is. It's just such a beautiful story about friendship and commitment, and the animators did do a great job in showing deep emotions through their moving pictures. A hard task, even to do in live-action, done perfectly by animators, so I guess for them the movie was an ultimate challenge in animating that they won.Definitely worth taking a look at and hope to see it at as a Oscar nominee in 2016.",

            "content": "'When Marnie Was There' may not be one of Studio Ghibli's best films ('Princess Mononoke', 'Spirited Away', 'My Neighbour Totoro', 'Castle in the Sky', 'Whisper of the Heart' and 'Grave of the Fireflies). But even when Ghibli are not at their best they still produce films that are better than most studios at their worst, while 'Tales from Earthsea' is from personal opinion their weakest effort it does have enough to make it watchable still. 'When Marnie Was There' drags a little at times particularly in the first half an hour or so, which is somewhat aimless, and some of the supporting characters could have been much better fleshed out. These flaws aside, 'When Marnie Was There' is still a real charmer, and ranks possibly around higher middle of Studio Ghibli's filmography. Its best assets have to be the animation and the music. The animation is simply wondrous, the colours are both atmospheric and ethereal, all the characters are appealingly drawn in distinctive Studio Ghibli fashion and the backgrounds are exquisitely detailed and gorgeously idyllic, was also really impressed by how Anna's facial expressions conveyed so much. The music is incredibly beautifully orchestrated and sears with emotion , nostalgia and atmosphere, often appropriately gentle and sometimes melancholic. \"Fire on the Outside\" is genuinely moving as well, not mawkish or over-sentimental at all. Scripting warms the heart and moves the soul, the lack of humour not being an issue at all, and actually considering the story it would have felt very misplaced if it was included. The story, centring around Marnie and Anna's friendship, is haunting, heart-warming and often incredibly poignant with the right amount of mystery, the central friendship being charmingly and sometimes heart-wrenchingly portrayed. The message is a strong one, and gives the film an uplifting quality, if one is wondering how the message is written here it does succeed in not preaching too much. Marnie and Anna are likable, well-written characters , while the voice actors fill their roles sensitively. All in all, not one of Studio Ghibli's finest but still a charmer. The DVD bought from Amazon was pricey, but at the end of the day it didn't feel like a waste of money. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I went into this movie not expecting it to quite live up to the Ghibli standard as most of the films not directed by Hayao or Isao, tend to be among their weaker ones. Yet in terms of story and subtle character writing I would easily rank this among the upper level of Ghibli's films. The story starts off very simple yet it progresses into something very deep and as its mystery is gradually revealed it touches on concepts that are rarely captured in story telling of any medium. It is more than what it appears to be on the surface and it is far deeper than a typical plot about friendship and growing up. While those things are elements of the story, at its heart I would say that it is about the bonds that transcend generations. It is about how time can complicate relationships and simple decisions stretched out overtime can have unintended consequences. It's about discovering that the people we give so little thought to are sometimes far closer to us than we realize and are often experiencing similar hardships. It would have been easy for the story to end on an ambiguous note as so many stories like this do but thankfully the plot is fully explained and provides answers that make the story even more meaningful. Along with its deep and unique story the characters are also subtly crafted and express emotions that are true to life. It deals with very complex feelings such as self loathing and social insecurity in a way the is very natural and rarely captured. Many of the characters are people who have trouble expressing themselves honestly and just as in real life, that behaviour is far more subtle than words can express. Anna is kind at heart but she can also be unintentionally cruel. She is polite and yet dismissive. Other characters who appear strong on the surface are in fact vulnerable but won't show it in private. The movie does a great job of showing characters from slightly different perspectives to show that they are more than simply the face they show the world. The film very believably portrays the idea that people very rarely express what they truly feel, in a way that others understand and that is often what leads to relationships breaking down.As with most Ghibli films, the art direction here is also fantastic. The sets are beautiful and feel like real places. The tone and landscape are immersive and realistic. Its not only beautifully designed it is designed in a way that feels believable and serves a purpose. While this isn't one of Ghibli's most awe inspiring movies, it is one of their most realistic and most profound. It takes a simple relate-able story and takes it someplace rarely explored. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an appreciation for real subtle characters, unique coming of age stories and stories about complex relationships. I think it is a great movie for families as it is really deals with understanding the people close to us better. It has a great message for people of all ages and it is accessible enough that it can be appreciated on many different levels.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this after seeing it's poster ad which showed two girls standing back to back close to one another, and, yes, the first thought that came across my dirty train of thoughts was, \"This must be shoujo-ai.\" That honestly what triggered me to watch it. Because, honestly, the sort of posters that come out under Studio Ghibli's works never (if I'm correct) features two girls hand in hand like the one depicted in Since Marnie Was There.But boy was I ever wrong for trusting my trashy sixth (or is it seventh??) instincts :-p The story is poignant at its best. It made me cry my eyes out almost all throughout the story, only because, I can relate to the characters' pain expressed and shared in the story very well, and I'm sure those who've experienced the kind of pain Anna and Marnie experienced in their lives.This is also the kind of story that makes you stuck in watching the show if only just to enjoy watching the beautiful scenic art and animations it could offer the audiences. I fell in love immediately after Anna arrived in the countryside. Gosh, the word 'beautiful' just won't do justice to how mesmerizing the art that depicts all those breath-taking scenery in this movie.And just listening to the ending song, made me bawl out ever the more, I had contain myself from making much snotty nose noises in my room, haha.In all seriousness, I want to applaud Studio Ghibli, for once, in their whole studio, for creating a story that doesn't center on LOVE between a girl and a boy, but instead, on grasping the essence meaning of the word LOVE itself, which is so much for than just a love story between a guy and girl. Love yourself, love and appreciate others, kindness, is important as well.",

When Marnie Was There will certainly go down as a \"smaller\" Ghibli film, like Yonebayashi's previous film for the studio, The Secret World of Arietty, but no shame in being smaller than Miyazaki or Takahata. I actually think I might prefer this one slightly to both of their final films, and I hope Yonebayashi continues to direct after this. The story involves young Anna, a sickly, depressed girl from Sopporo who moves in with family friends in the country one summer. While exploring the area, she comes upon a beautiful, seemingly abandoned mansion. One night she finds it's not abandoned, but a young, blonde girl named Marnie lives there with her rich parents. They become quick friends, but each new meeting seems more dreamlike than the last. Anna begins question whether Marnie really exists. Like most Ghibli films, one of the highlights is the score, here by Takatsugu Muramatsu. The English language song that plays over the closing credits, \"Fine on the Outside\" by Priscilla Ahn, is tremendously moving. Truly wonderful.",

            "content": "Presumably, if reports are to be believed as of this year (or last), When Marnie Was There is the final theatrical feature from Studio Ghibli (this on the heels of also presumed - for real this time - retirements for Miyazaki and Yakahata, who made their recent films as The Wind Rises and Princess Yaguya). This makes me sad, but mostly as this movie is itself so painfully sad all over. It's a tearjerker, without any equivocation, and that's not a bad thing as any movie if it's done right - maybe the greatest Japanese animated film ever made, Grave of the Fireflies, is a cry-every-other-minute film - but here, it's almost too much, and deals with pain and loss and alienation in such a way that it ultimately is disappointing that it ends up in a plot 'twist'. Or is it a reveal? This does, seemingly, take audiences to a more realistic place than some other Ghibli films - I was reminded of Whisper of the Heart, also a movie about an artistically talented girl who gets a connection to a special person, only for her own existential path to be more complicated - and that's certainly welcome. It follows this girl Anna who has asthma and is actually a foster child, and is sent by her Auntie to get some fresh air for the summer with relatives on a coastal island (I think it's an island). There, one evening, she meets Marnie, a blond-haired girl who lives in the mansion that Anna finds so beautiful. They become very close friends, but something doesn't quite seem right in some ways.Of course as friends they make it a 'secret' not to tell anyone. Who might Anna tell anyway? No friends really (she shoves some away due to her social awkwardness), and not her guardians (one voiced in the English dub by John C. Reilly, also welcome). But Marnie? It seems less clear - except that, if one can see pretty quickly, she's not exactly who she says she is. Is she an 'imaginary friend' as Anna comes to the conclusion once discovering new people moving in to the mansion? Or what about a ghost? In a manner of speaking, yes. But the details of why Marnie is no longer 'there' become the emotional cornerstone of the entire film, and certainly not an easy one to take.When Marnie Was There is unabashedly sentimental stuff. I wondered at times if I might just be, as a grown man, just not the right audience for this material. But then I've gravitated to most of the Ghibli library, even when there are characters outside of my frame of reference. And it shouldn't matter, the themes are universal, up to a point, of a little girl who is alone and feels alone and is with someone else who also feels alone and they have each other. That part I can get. What is a little distant this time around is... frankly, a certain low-key energy for at least the first half of the film. I hasten to say the word 'boring' because it isn't, and there is a difference with low-key, where things are just... moving along, a little slowly, leisurely, without any deference to anything or any major stakes.The second half picks up, to be sure, as the mystery of who Marnie is or where she was from, and the significance of the silo and what might have happened there. But by the end, as a sort of exposition dump happens and a major reveal happens about the past of Marnie, and Anna herself, it's slightly unsatisfying. Perhaps I should've expected this - I called that she was a ghostly figure fairly early on, and there's no real trace of fantasy stuff outside of it. On the plus side, as a given with Ghibli, the animation is breathtaking and sweet and sumptuous, and in all of the ways that are subtle and exacting of the place and time. This is warm summer with water and beaches and big mansions and the like, and it has the weight of this place much as Whisper of the Heart carried the simplicity of city life to a T.So what was I expecting that the movie didn't give me? I don't know. I can't not recommend When Marnie Was There for admirers of the studio, and I'm sure aficionados will seek it out anyway. I may be responding on a first watch to its elegiac tone (albeit at the core it's a movie about finding someone to love in a platonic sense, I think) and I wonder if there was any intention on the part of the filmmakers to finish off their studio's output (at least for now) on a story that deals with separation and loss (or lack) of identity and trust in adult figures. You can get the napkins and handkerchiefs ready, but it just wasn't totally great for me, at least up to the (admittedly) high standards of Ghibli, or even this director, who's previous film The Secret World of Arriety I liked very much.",

The two giants of the studio, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata have both gone into retirement and the studio announced that they will not be making any more films for now. Takahata and Miyazaki are responsible for some of Ghibli's greatest films such as Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies. When Marnie Was There is directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and is about the introvert girl Anna who is sent to the countryside to live with relatives. She becomes obsessed with a deserted mansion and the girl who lives there who may or may not be real.Ghibli's films usually contains imagination and the focus is almost always on children but despite that, the films are not only meant for them and also often include deep meanings and thoughts. Ghibli has always been incredibly skillful in drawing and creating magnificent images and When Marnie Was There is no exception. The beautiful Japanese landscapes makes you want to travel there immediately and see the country for yourself. The film is told like a detective story and Anna finds and puts the clues together one by one. She is our guide throughout the film and what she experiences, we experience too.When Marnie Was There has a story I believe many can relate to. Not being able to find your own place in this world and to feel like an outcast. Anna searches like many children do, for their place in society and at the same time she's trying to understand her life and situation. The film is also about strong friendship and love and why we are drawn specifically to some people. It's always hard for me to try and summarize Ghibli's films and explain why people should watch them.

There she befriends a young girl with flowing blonde hair who she begins to build a close bond with. The two build a strong friendship, though the mysterious, ethereal Marnie clearly is more then meets the eye.The movie When Marnie Was There, appears from the outset to be a coming of age story, with the focus being a young girl discovering her past in a far off place, through the mysterious Marnie. However to contrast the tropes of the coming of age narrative, there is an unshakable sense of passing in this story, from the ghostly appearance of Marnie, to the mysterious boatman and the frail condition of our heroine Anna, we have a tale which is as much a story of childhood as it is of eventual adulthood and death. Much has been made of this movie for being the first Studio Ghibli movie post Miyazaki's and Takahata's retirement, both of whom were the founders of Studio Ghibli as we know it. Many have speculated as to whether this movie offers a glimpse of the future of Ghibli in younger hands, and from reading a few of the English language reviews already availible, many seem to contemplate whether this is a swan song for Ghibli or possibly a new dawn. Having just seen this movie, my overriding opinion is that Ghibli is alive and well and in the director Yonebayashi, they have a director who is a fitting heir to the masters Miyazaki and Takahata. The movie When Marnie Was There carries all of the hall marks of great Ghibli, as you would expect from Ghibli there is; attention to detail, a strong narrative, well fleshed out characters, a great score, gorgeous visuals. This list reads as a standard for Ghibli animation, but what we should appreciate is that most movies failed to attain any of the points listed above, Ghibli achieves this with each and every one of their movies, and this is not attained effortlessly, but what we see when we watch a Ghibli movie are master crafts man at the peak of their creative powers striving for perfection in hand drawn animation. There is a creative vigor on the screen, one which screams both joyously and artfully. When Marnie Was There fits nicely into this bracket, and proves that Ghibli will endure long after Miyazaki and Takahata has left the building.",

Overall When Marnie Was There is fantastic. The plot is interesting, the characters are good, the art design is amazing, and the ending was fantastic.

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 2.8/5 stars\"When Marnie Was There\" never fulfills on its grand promise of something profound. Based on the book by Joan G. Robinson, it's another fantastical tale from Japanese animation juggernaut Studio Ghibli. Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi sweeps the frames with the studio's quintessential ethereal brushstrokes, delivering an aesthetically superb piece. But there may not be enough meat to keep adults engaged, while the subtler themes of sexuality and gender will likely soar over little ones' heads.After suffering an asthma attack at school, out-of-place Anna is dispatched to a seaside town in Hokkaido. There she finds herself fascinated by a dilapidated mansion, perched on the edge of a marshland. She strikes up a fervent friendship with the house's enigmatic occupant Marnie, and the pair soon becomes inseparable, enabling the previously withdrawn Anna to open up. But in typical Ghibli fashion, things are never what they seem, and Anna finds herself charged with unraveling a family history mystery.The plot centers on female friendship, exploring \"tomboy\" and \"girly-girl\" archetypes. This is particularly interesting coming out of Japan, where femininity and innocence are inextricably linked and highly revered. Anna is a world away from the giggling schoolgirl stereotype, and while vague questions of her sexuality and mental health are hazily hinted at, they're never really raised, let alone explored. Understandable for a PG film, but in the end, it left me with more questions than answers. Anna and Marnie frequently abscond together in clandestine meetings, suggesting a rapport that is far more intimate. It reaches an apex when a jealous Anna questions Marnie about dancing with a boy. You're certain that something more will come of this, but eventually nothing does. Later there is a scary interlude that resembles a Gothic tale involving an old abandoned silo that terrifies Marnie. More suggestions of something deeper than what is actually presented. The denouement ultimately ignores all of these plot threads and settles into a resolution that doesn't effectively address the issues with which Anna is struggling. Psychologically, she was really messed up to begin with, and the reveal is totally disconnected from what this girl had been feeling. It seems all too rushed and contrived after a point.Maybe I'm being a bit demanding, but \"When Marnie Was There\" just feels more muddled than most Studio Ghilbi offerings - many of them classics in their own right. You sense that it boils down to a scripting issue, simply because the film doesn't earn some of its poignant scenes - for instance, Anna and Marnie declare their love for each other after one quick meeting, which doesn't evoke sincerity as the writers don't make us believe that the characters ought to be feel that way. Nevertheless, the movie is too visually hypnotic to ignore. Both the background score and sound effects enhance the rich milieu, which is spellbinding to begin with.With Ghibli announcing indefinite hiatus last year, \"When Marnie Was There\" marks the last film we'll see from the studio for some time. In that light, it's dimly disappointing and doesn't hold a candle to most of their erstwhile endeavors. But it's still worth a look for ardent anime fans and Ghibli devotees who'll be waiting a while for their next fix. It's visually alluring with some nice touches, but one does feel that it could, or rather should, have been much deeper in its narrative. I liked it. I just didn't love it.",

            "content": "Being the last movie before Studio Ghiblis hiatus, I had big expectations for 'When Marnie was there'. Since the studio has produced nearly exclusively great films so far, 'Marnie' had to compete with giants like 'My Neighbor Totoro', 'Spirited Away' and my personal favorite, 'Princess Mononoke'. Leaving the theater, I was quite disappointed. 'When Marnie was there' follows the 12-year old, depressed girl Anna. She doesn't have any friends and her foster parents are overwhelmed with her, so they sent her to the countryside to visit some relatives. There she meets and befriends the mysterious girl Marnie.Since 'Marnie' is stylistically similar to 'The Wind Rises', the animators couldn't let their imagination go wild and create amazing fantasy worlds like in 'Spirited Away'. But this isn't really a problem, since 'Marnie' is more grounded and focuses more on the characters and plot and not the world they live in. Despite that, the animators are still able to pull off some great visuals that not only look great, but also serve the plot and characters.Ironically, this is the major problem with this film. While the plot itself is great and has some interesting themes, the friendship between the two girls is extremely superficial and barely explored. They meet and from one second to the other are best friends for life. To make it even worse, the dialogue is cringe-worthy at times, especially when clich\u00e9'd phrases like 'I will love you forever' and ' Always remember me' are used. This wouldn't be a problem, but since the mutual relationship is one major theme and not really developed, this dialogue seems heavy-handed and out of place. The next wasted opportunity was the ending. The buildup and especially the subtle hints throughout the film were well done, but it was completely ruined after they explained for the 5th time what the ending was about, in case somebody didn't pay attention for the last 10 minutes. Another minor complained would be the constant falling and tripping of the main character. Miyazaki always used some quirks like these to make his characters more real, but director Hiromasa Yonebayashi went way overboard with this and made Anna look clumsy and barely capable off walking.What makes this movie disappointing is not that it is a bad movie, but that it had potential to be great, and wasted it.",

It's more like a soap opera for kids.For roughly the first half, the build up and mystery is there, but then the secret is revealed and revealed again, and again, and again, and that's pretty much all the rest of the film does while essentially putting the art and animation on a loop until the end.As a short, it would be tolerable.

            "content": "The opening sections of Omoide no M\u00e2n\u00ee get the film off to a very good start. Primarily this is off the back of how interesting Anna is as a character; she is not amazingly new in her teenage struggles perhaps, but they seem genuine, informed, and they show on her surface in a way that speaks to a lot more happening that is buried. With Anna as the base, the slow pace of the film did not bother me too much because I was interested enough in her to trust the film as it took us to a new community, set-up some interactions and the mystery of the mansion across the swamp.This doesn't last unfortunately, and the film doesn't built on that character so much as sit on the potential. There is a certain engagement in the way the mystery plays out and what Marine leads the film to. However as it goes it asks a lot but doesn't deliver too much; again one goes with this on the trust that it will be something the character deserves. I found it far too neat and tidy when we got there though, and the aspects that Anna indicated early on are sort of simplified more than I liked. It still offers something as it goes, but the destination didn't satisfy.Along the way it is as visually stunning as you expect, and it is as professionally constructed as the norm \u2013 but when it moved from an engaging reality into the more fantasy realm I expected it to soar with this as its base, however the pat nature of the conclusion rather grounds it instead.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Ghibli fan. I love Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away and Porco Rosso. But this film was very disappointing. The movie falls in the category 'but is was only a dream'-type of movie. You'll find out there's something about Marnie (not going to spoil it) but the way the story unfolds is so poorly executed you will most likely only enjoy it if you don't think too much about what is happening.Here's a few examples; the adults in this film are merely decorative. None of the adults have a purpose except for moving the story along. There's no real interaction and what interaction there is is just weird. How come Anna's guardians don't really care about what she's doing? Everything she does is fine and they never talk to her. We only see them being happy as campers and that's it.The whole focus of this film is on Marnie and Anna, and the world besides this doesn't come to life. There are shots put in of the environment and despite looking great they feel forced. Ghibli used to be great at this but they don't seem to be capable of creating this engaging world they so often showcased in other films. Also the one other character Anna interacts with also feels like an important pawn but nothing more. It's a very colourful character but the way she all of a sudden appears to be a major part of the plot makes no sense.And the last thing is Anna her clumsiness. Holy cow, she falls and stumbles and staggers so many times it's ridiculous! It happens so often that it distracts from the movie.So all in all it's just a hard to believe story. If you're good at ignoring details and fawning over Ghibli you'll enjoy it. If you enjoy proper story telling I'd suggest to skip this one and go for one of the other excellent movies Ghibli has made in the past decades.",

The film's derivative of countless other anime (\"Only Yesterday\", \"My Neighbour Totoro\", \"From Up on Poppy Hill\", \"The Secret World of Arrietty\" etc), all of which use bucolic idylls to delve into and so heal traumatic, tragic pasts.The \"tragedy\", in the case of \"Marnie\", involves the psychological and physical abuse suffered by several generations of related young women. To say more would be to spoil several key revelations. Suffice to say that, by the film's end, family and love have assuaged issues of abandonment and inferiority. The film was directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, a Miyazaki prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who struggles to find his own voice.

I have no issue with LGBT films (in fact, I love them) but let me explain why I thought this to be the case and why it is necessary to discuss in this review.When I watch a film, I would instantly evaluate it based on what I actually detect from the viewing. I rarely watch trailers or read a lot about it beforehand so most of the time my mind is clean as I do not want to form preconceptions. That is why I couldn't help thinking Studio Ghibli had made a lesbian film, as it has a misleading story progression.The main character, Anna, is a shy and lonely girl who is often uncomfortable with people. She hates herself and probably everyone around her, as she could be seen hostile to others at times. However, she bonded so quickly with Marnie, whom she just met. Anna looks so dependent or obsessed with the girl. They secretly see each other for many nights. All of a sudden, Marnie says they would remain a secret. They quickly look like soulmates so after some time I thought they might be lesbians. When Marnie finally says she loves Anna more than any girl she has known, this reinforced the idea!Lesbian film or not, that is not the issue. The thing is, When Marnie Was There (2014) is quite a letdown because they had attracted my genuine interest; I thought this was going to be a special Studio Ghibli film which celebrates LGBT pride but in the end it is not. It is also not a romance nor a friendship film; it is something else and the progression is truly misleading. I guess they are just trying to make the film feel mysterious but this goes terribly wrong.Despite this, When Marnie Was There (2014) does have the ability to make us wonder about people from the past and everyone's unique story. There are some sad scenes and the ending is a little satisfying because a mystery is solved but all that cannot make up for rest of the time wasted on something that ends up feeling underdeveloped. I wanted to love When Marnie Was There (2014), but I just can't.",

            "content": "'WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE': Three Stars (Out of Five)A Japanese anime flick; which was nominated for Best Animated Feature, at the upcoming Academy Awards. It was written and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi; and it's based on the 1967 young adult novel, of the same name, by Joan G. Robinson. The film tells the story of a young girl, that becomes obsessed with a mysterious young woman; who may just exist in her imagination. The movie received mostly positive reviews, from critics, and it's noted, by fans, for possibly being the last film produced by Studio Ghibli. I found it to be very slow-paced, but also charming.The film tells the story of a 12-year-old girl named Anna (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, in the English version). She lives with foster parents, in Sapporo, but she becomes unhappy when she realizes her parents are paid, by the government, to watch over her. After a serious asthma attack, at school, she's sent to live with relatives, of her foster parents, in a seaside town. There she dreams of a girl named Marnie (voiced by Kiernan Shipka and Taylor Autumn Bertham, at different ages). She's stunned to see Marnie come to life (apparently), in an abandoned mansion near by. Anna then becomes infatuated with the strange girl.The story is very slow moving, and I can't imagine why most kids would like it (much). Not all animation has to be for children though; the book was written for young adults, and that might be a more appropriate age group for this. That's not to say there's anything inappropriate with the material; it's perfectly acceptable for kids, of all ages, to see. I think it also has a very positive (and upbeat) message, about coming-of-age. It's well made, and it has a very classic animated film feel to it (too). I found it to be (mostly) boring, but it's also slightly moving.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM",

            "content": "It's a shame that Studio Ghibli is going to stop making movies. While they never exactly said that they're done for good, it seems that with the legendary Hayao Miyazaki retiring, the studio knows that it needs to figure out what it going to do without their master at the head. I can understand their fear that they may not be able to go on without Miyazaki, Studio Ghibli has brought some of the greatest animated movies to the rest of the world, and not to mention has given Americans two things that we don't do for our own movies.First of all, the most obvious; the animation. Ghibli was keen on keeping their movies with a hand drawn look despite the advancing technology of computers and how every studio in America makes their animated movies in realistic CGI. There's still a beauty within it's high detail of paint and ink. The other difference is the tone. While most animated movies from America tend to go with louder that it's audiences want, Ghibli makes their movies quieter. The stories still feel large, but often their movies will focus on the smaller stories of life like moving or making friends. When Marnie Was There is a testament to friendship.The quiet twelve-year-old Anna (played by Haliee Steinfeld) is that girl we've all known to be so shy, that she shuts everyone out and has no friends. She even shuts out her foster parent Yoriko (played by Genna Davis) when it's found out that she gets money from the government to look after Anna. Anna suffers an asthma attack at school, so her parent sends her to relatives living in a rural seaside town to give her better air to breathe. It seems like a nice summer break, but Anna would rather not be a burden to anyone.She arrives with open arms from Kiyomasa (played by John C. Reilly) and Setsu, but still seems a bit closed off. They try to set Anna on a outing with a neighbor kid, but that proves to be a failure. When strolling through the town, she grows an attachment to an abandoned marsh mansion. She rows there one night to find a girl her age named Marnie, who lives there with her nanny. The once abandoned house is now a majestic home by the sea. As Anna meets up with Marnie more often, she starts to feel a closer connection then with anyone she's ever known.Studio Ghibli could have gone out with an epic, grand adventure to close off their stories, but When Marie Was There both something subtle, yet big. What I mean from that is that the story puts more time with the friendship of Anna and Marnie then the mystery that surrounds the movie. The scenes between the two are beautiful. Part of me wishes that the story could have been more focused on that then the more supernatural element in place. It's not that the mystery is bad, but it is really hard to follow.It took me time to figure out if Anna was really seeing Marnie or if Anna is the ghost of Marnie's world or what. I think Studio Ghibli was trying to make the most complex story to go around the friendship, but it comes off like an art-house wannabe.The good news is that like its other movies, When Marnie Was There has great characters and a nice atmosphere. Anna may be an introvert, but we understand her personality enough to like and wish she could connect with people. The town she stays in is so quaint that it reminds me of my favorite vacation grounds, Laguna Beach. I'll give this seven abandoned mansions out of ten. It's not the best Ghibli movie, but a nice one to end on. I hope that Ghibli manages to return to continue bringing it's beautiful looking stories to America. We're not going to do it, so Japan might as well stick around with this. If you're a Ghibli fan, see it. If not, see some other Ghibli movies first before catching this one.",

There she stumbles upon a mysterious house on the marsh that she feels compelled to learn more about.Getting the positives out of the way first: like all Studio Ghibli movies this one is beautifully animated. The scenery is drawn in such a way that I want to be there and the food in the movie always looks delicious. The music is also great, I could listen to the melodies in this film all day, they are really relaxing when they need to be, and quite sad when the time comes for that. The voice acting for the dub is also good, nothing much to report there, everyone does a good job with their characters. So all the technical stuff that you come to expect from Studio Ghibli are done well, how is the story...Now time for the negative. The main character, Anna, is sef-loathing, anti-social, ungrateful, boring, irresponsible and sometimes just mean. Understandably the movie needs a flawed character for the protagonist. That way the audience can see the way they develop and improve as a character. But I think they went a little too far with this girl, making her journey hard to get engaged with.The rules of this fantasy world are also very inconsistent. It is hard for the audience to gage the stakes of the situation if all that is going on turns out to be a dream or something like that.A lot of the film feels directionless, Anna will just sort of wander around and daydream about a house she sees. If they are trying to do a slow burn mystery plot, they need a better hook then simply: \"that house looks familiar\".The supporting characters are nice, but not given much time to shine. I was ready to call this Ghibli's worst, but the movie does salvage a lot if points with its ending. The last 15 minutes or so, help bring the story together in a nice package and leave the audience with a good feeling.It all comes down to how much you are willing to forgive from a good ending. For me, the good just about evened out with the bad. And the film walks away with a neutral score. Watch if you're a Ghibli fan, otherwise, you don't need to go out of your way to see it.",

With the exception of Wind Rises, the movies were overrated with simplistic Tale of Princess Kaguya (at the beginning, of course). I was pretty skeptical about this one. While it started off with a great beginning, it got boring and annoying when Sayaka showed up. She is a forgettable character who was kind of mean, yet so nice, she's clich\u00e9d.Anna bothered me for some reason, it was because of her boyish clothes but it was also something else, I don't know. Maybe she's just a stereotypical pre-teen. Marnie was the standout character of all the characters, she was perky, friendly, and mysterious.Anna befriends Sayaka which drops the ball because a lot of movies have characters befriending the clich\u00e9d nice girl. The art and animation were still amazing as usual, but I am very disappointed in Studio Ghibli for ending up like Pixar. The movie of course got cloying as it went on whether it's between Anna or Sayaka or Anna and Marnie. It also ended in a sentimental way. Maybe if they brought Hayou Miyazaki back to directing, he would save the studio and bring it back its glory.Also, I thought Sayaka's voice acting was a pretty bad job. The themes just didn't click with me, it was boring and sometimes not empathetic. Studio Ghibli tried too hard by throwing in creepy parts and an emotional ending to be like their other movies.

But now, it is not just the great man himself that is announcing closing for business, it is the Studio as a whole. Directed by one of the younger of six directors to have worked under the Studio Ghibli name, Hiromasa Yonebayashi, 'When Marnie was there' brings an end to three decades worth of anime, starting with 'Laputa: Castle in the Sky'. This film already, therefore, has a lot resting on its shoulders. Yonebayashi has worked on numerous Ghibli films in various animation roles, though his only previous film as a director with the Studio was 'Arrietty': not perhaps their strongest work. Like 'Arrietty' before it - and indeed other Ghibli films - 'When Marnie was there' is based on a British children's novel. The flat, isolated land of Norfolk has been replaced for the mountainous, isolated land of Hokkaido, with young, moody Anna, suffering from asthma, leaves her foster mother in Sapporo to stay with relatives in a small village from some much needed R and R. Troubled at home, Anna's troubles don't particularly ease, failing to fit in, lost in her imagination and sketch pad. Quickly she becomes fascinated by the 'Marsh House', an old mansion left in a state of disrepair. Becoming an obsession, she begins to imagine Marnie, the former daughter of the house many moons ago. Forming a bond with her imaginary companion, Anna begins to come to terms with her own situation at home.The film can be divided into three distinct sections for me: To start, as ever with a Ghibli film, the attention to detail is impeccable, with every pixel of the screen thoughtfully considered, making the animation as true to life as possible. It's once we move toward the film's middle that the level of visual detail starts to decrease a little as the storyline develops. This is where we hit the film's weakest point. As it's a Ghibli film, many might see this as magical and moving in a coming-of-age tale, though for me 'When Marnie was there' gets far too soppy, borderline lesbian and a little bit of a bore. Luckily, as the film draws to a conclusion, it is rescued somewhat as the storyline is rounded off.Up until the new millennium and 'Spirited Away', the direction of Ghibli films was tackled by-and-large by founders Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Since then, however, younger directors have, at times, taken the reigns, leaving the films, while on the whole satisfying, a little more bumpy and inconsistent.But with the two founders now both old men, well deserving of the title 'retired', rather than letting the Studio slip into the hands of others, perhaps calling it a day is called for.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk",

While there, Anna is fascinated by an abandoned mansion, dilapidated and overgrown, across the marsh, she wonders why it seems familiar to her, it has been empty for a long time, but Anna has visions of the house looking well and people residing in it.

A week later, while sketching, Anna meets older woman Hisako (Vanessa Williams) who paints pictures of the mansion and marsh, she comments that Anna's sketches look like a girl she used to know when she was young, and she used to live in the mansion, which is being renovated for someone moving in. Anna returns to the mansion, she meets a girl named Sayaka (Ava Acres), she discovers Marnie's diary in a drawer, it includes text about a party Anna may have been part of, several pages of the diary are missing. The next day, Marnie reappears and talks to Anna about her parents always travelling abroad, her nanny and two maids and their physical and psychological abuse, Anna wants to help her confront her fear of the silo, where she used to be threatened of being locked in, Anna falls asleep, and is upset to find Marnie has abandoned her in the silo.

Anna recovers from her fever, Sayaka shows her the missing pages and a painting Hisako gave to Marnie, Hisako tells them Marnie's story. Marnie married Kazuhiko, who died from an illness, they had a daughter named Emily, Marnie was committed to a psychiatric hospital and Emily was sent to boarding school, when Marnie was released Emily was upset for her abandoning her, she ran away and had a daughter of her own, she and her husband were killed in a car accident, Marnie raised her granddaughter until her death, the girl was put in foster care. It is the end of summer, Yoriko is taking Anna home, she gives Anna a photograph of the mansion that belonged to her grandmother, she realises she is the daughter of Emily and Marnie's granddaughter, this revelation brings Anna closure of her identity, she bids her friends of the town goodbye, and sees the mansion and Marnie one last time as she is taken back home. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as the Elderly Lady, Ellen Burstyn as Nanny and Kathy Bates as Mrs. Kadoya. The cast dubbing the voices into English are all chosen well, it is a fairly simple story of a pubescent tomboy girl unknowingly going back in time to meet the younger version of her relative, it is perhaps more realistic than previous films from the studio, no magical and fantasy elements as such, it hasn't got quite the same charm as these other films, but the animation is fantastic, overall its not a bad animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!",

            "content": "I'll just start by recounting the things I appreciate and think this movie did well: The main character Anna's unreality blending with reality. An abandoned mansion across a lake in a quiet village. The tides that open and close a path. Pencil sketches. The decay of a mansion. Illusions from a past. A dance with the flower girl. A haunted silo on a hill. Plenty of sentimental strings. Excessive use of windy field recordings (why else would you watch anime). Self- loathing introvert Anna. Dreamy rich secluded girl Marnie. An old taciturn fisherman. A nighttime picnic with juice and cookies. A classy suits-and-dresses party. \"Fine on the Outside\". Anna passing out in ditches (I'm stretching it now). The whole movie is visually pleasing. I always welcome peaceful depictions of a countryside. I loved that the mystery of the mansion and who Marnie was, lasted long. Patient storytelling is a huge plus. Unfortunately I disliked some things too. Mostly the ending. Anna's self-hatred is neglected by the end. Her character arc doesn't make a lot of sense. She just transforms into this new happy girl, or at least I was left with that impression, which is just the same. It really felt like a gimmick when they faded away the background noise right as the super obvious plot twist was revealed. It's like they're telling us \"you're supposed to be awe-struck now!\". It's effective when you don't see it coming, I guess. But I had figured that Anna already made that connection when she listened to Hisako's completely revealing story. Perhaps she didn't know she was in a movie where nothing can be a coincidence. In the end, the writers mess up a good socially anxious character by embracing, excuse my cynicism, typical family-movie-level optimism. It carefully maneuvers around realer, darker matters (like that of what seems to be her escapist delusions) by stuffing the viewer's throat full of parental love and finding happiness and friendship. All timeless clich\u00e9s, but so uncalled for here, given the mysterious setting and mature tone of the first three fourths of the movie. Why remain on the surface when there are deeper waters waiting to be explored?You see it's hard for me to find virtue in Marnie and Anna's relationship now that I know the outcome and know who Marnie is. Especially when I know who Marnie is. Tell no one this, but I had my fingers crossed for their relationship to blossom (Ghibli doing yuri would be a sight to behold). Or at least for something more daring and mature to happen. I learned afterwards that this is indeed based on a British children's novel from the 60s, so that explains a lot I guess. Ech. How naive I was to think this was an original and recent creation. Oh well. At least finding solace in illusions is still a beautiful sentiment.",

Pointless?We see the main character, Anna, having to travel to a small village for a while due to a health issue and her having to breathe fresh air. The whole plot revolves around her coming into contact with Marnie, which has a mysterious past and a rough childhood.Most of the movie consists of fairly harmless scenes about their friendship, which is cool, but doesn't push the plot forwards at all. Near the end of the movie, we finally get the answer to who Marnie is, but it's some of the most underwhelming reveals I've ever seen.The plot feels like it's leading up to something that's not really there, and the ending feels like a weird \"and then everything everyone lived happily ever after\" situation that doesn't feel earned at all.That said, I did kind of enjoy this movie. The animation is gorgeous (VERY gorgeous!), and the scenes were good enough to keep me interested on what'll happen next. It's a decent family movie, but I sadly didn't connect with it as much as others did.",

Based on a British novel of the same name, the story follows Anna, a troubled teenager who finds friendship and ultimately revelation in Marnie, a mysterious young girl who seems to live both in Anna's world and in her dreams. Like all Ghibli productions, the animation is lush, detailed and fluid. The voice work in the English version I watched is good despite being somewhat flat and generic at times. I very much like Studio Ghibli movies but find in general that anime adds more to fantasy films (where it can make unreal real, such as \"Howl's Moving Castle\" or \"Spirited Away\") than it does to more 'realistic' films such as \"When Marnie Was There\". Despite that, and being both the wrong gender and decades away from the target audience, I really enjoyed, and would recommend, \"When Marnie Was There\".",

Hooray the Miyazakis are making films they want to make! But yawn it's not something I want to see. But boy this was a treat to my eyes, ears and, yeah yeah, heart.With a plot that might sound like a psycho-sexual horror thriller if told by wrong voices (In evil Cumberbatch voice: A sick girl is lured into an abandoned mansion by a mysterious blond woman who has some dark secrets and her own motives), this film has classic Ghibli elements: A young girl with problems. Well-meaning adults. (Beautiful) Country side. Supernatural (?) friend. You spend the first half hour just enjoying the beautiful pictures and ticking off your To-See List for a Ghibli film.Very very slight spoilers ahead.Then Marnie appears. I realized what the film was doing but was still mystified by it. Got to admit the change of scenes didn't really feel connected. I guess it was hard for the makers too since they resorted to \"stuff disappeared while the heroine dosed off\" clich\u00e9. However this is not faulting the contents but the glue.There was a moment where I smiled and whispered \"Aha!\" 15 minutes before the final revelation and ended up proved wrong with a clever twist on the twist. Wow. What a pay-off it had. The obligatory explanation sequence was turned into something powerful and resonant and it's thanks to the build-up that may have baffled you earlier.It's a shame that this film lost out to the annual regurgitation of tired old Pokemon: The Movie series. The director Yonebayashi made Arrietty for Ghibli which easily trumps Goro Miyazaki's attempts at direction. Hope the next film he makes doesn't take the same step of his two previous works and go for a whole world of fantasy.",

The Wind Rises, From Up on Poppy Hill, and now When Marnie was there.Now don't get me wrong. I LOVE Ghibli movies. Kiki's delivery service, the Cat Returns, and Castle in the Sky are some of my favorite movies of all time. However, this one, I sadly have to say, it is the ONLY ghibli movie I have ever shut off halfway through due to boredom.I don't know what it is about recent Ghibli movie and their aversion to using magic, but it doesn't help their cause.Ghibli unfortunately is like every other studio. They are not infallible. They make mistakes.The biggest issue I found with this movie is that the main character is an annoying little whiner. Every problem she has in the movie is due to her being a whiner. (except for the asthma) She goes to the new place, and she's mopey. People try to make friends with her, and she's a jerk and mopey again. Then when the kids in town get annoyed at her for being a jerk, I think the movie is trying to get you to feel bad for her? But I can't. Every single time something bad happens it is entirely her fault. The first half of this movie was just a test of patience to see if you didn't punch this girl in the face. Then Marnie shows up but the problem is, you hate the other girl so much by that point you don't even care if she makes a friend. I sure didn't.Ghibli's music and animation are never brought into question. No matter how terrible their movie is the art and music are always breathtaking. That doesn't change. But the main character was so unlikable, there was a lack of overt use of magic or wonder, and I did not give a single care about the story this girl went through as every single problem created was of her own doing.I actually read the ending of the movie on wiki because I just felt like knowing how it ended but I didn't want to invest more than 30 seconds doing so. And I still don't care.I do not like some Ghibli movies. I know this may sound blasphemous, but I just can't get into some. However, on the flip side, some of them are breathtakingly amazing. But I have NEVER shut one off halfway through before. That is something amazing all in itself. Tales from Earthsea and from Up on Poppy Hill are BAD but I didn't shut them off halfway through. Because as bad as they were, at least they weren't BORING. And that is the greatest sin a ghibli movie could have. So it with a heavy heart that I have to give When Marnie was there, a 3, out of 10.",

So how does it hold up? Surprisingly well. You can definitely see that Yonebayashi is still learning the trade. This shows most clearly in that the film doesn't flow quite as smoothly as it should. Part of that is due to the original story, which has a lot of complex elements and transitions between dreams and reality, but some of that is definitely due to pacing problems.On the other hand, there's a lot of really good stuff showcased as well. The animation, for one, is very high quality, even for Studio Ghibli. All the characters move beautifully, the backgrounds are simply gorgeous and the use of colours and styles evokes the image of paintings, fittingly keeping with one of the themes of the movie. The film also has great mood and atmosphere. The storm sequence, near the end of the film, for example. Whenever thunder strikes, you will shiver in primordial fright.I also like the two main characters, Anna and Marnie, who are both bright, independent yet fragile young girls, and their friendship is the one carrying the story and the whole movie. Yonebayashi is very skilled in showing us their similarities, but most importantly their differences. All of their shared scenes are very good.Unfortunately, this brings us to the problems with the film. It is simply way too slow. The film makers were clearly going for mood and atmosphere building over a more event driven film experience. And they do that very well, but the fact still remains that you find yourself wondering when the actual story will begin. It is often a very delicate balance to juggle both the story and the needed space for character development and atmosphere, but in this case that tightrope act is more than a bit wobbly.Nevertheless, I definitely do think that this film is worth seeing for all fans of Studio Ghibli and animation in general. It looks great, has great characters and even though the pacing could have been better, it will still leave you with a soft smile on your face.",

Take away the lovely animation and the brilliant composition, then all that's left is a dull and mediocre story.My main problem is the main character, Anna. As someone with asthma myself, I must say she is not only unrelatable, but also unlikable. Poor, poor Anna. You're born into a gorgeous middle- class family, have two loving guardians, have people who want to befriend you despite your empty and soulless personality. It must be terrible living in such a beautiful, hundred-acre house with a garden and surrounded by mountains, lakes and forests. Unbearable, I say. What's that, you immediately dislike a girl you didn't know other than the fact that she looks 'ugly and fat'? You insulted her as well, after an attempt to be your friend? Gosh, I can't imagine how miserable I would be if I were her. Then you meet a pretty rich blond girl and you instantly become friends? That's cool.First of all, can we really say Anna is a role model for girls? Doesn't she just inspire you with her boringness? She is constantly depressed and humourless, not to mention emotionless most of the time. This girl lives a sheltered, well-provided life and she's bitching about it because her foster parents are getting child benefits. She's never faced a single true hardship about life, not even her sickness. It doesn't serve to empower her will to live by the end, only as an excuse for her to come to beautiful countryside hide-out that's the setting of the movie.I feel like all the movie's good for is for viewers to admire the breathtaking animation.

Besides, the people at Ghibli do spend as much time on drawing the movie as on creating the story and developing the characters. Their stories are always a mix of the mundane and the celestial, the worldly and the dreamy, the ordinary and the extraordinary in life, the matter of fact and the inexplicable. Ghibli's movies are always sentimental, emotional, dramatic and fun, all at once.When Marnie was There is no exception. The film is based on Joan G. Robinson's children eponymous book published in 1967. The story is really lovely, and goes in a full circle to explore the feelings of alienation, angst, lovelessness and loneliness of the main character, Anna, a tomboy girl who hates herself and her life and has bouts of asthma out of stress. Most of the story occurs in her relatives' country house, where Anna's auntie and foster mother sends her to see if she recovers her health and joy for life. There, in this remote and pristine area of Japan, in an abandoned house, she meets the almost-Disney girly girl blonde Marnie, who becomes her best friend and does the miracle of opening Anna's heart to love. Kids and teens who experience this sense of abandonment, loneliness and alienation, will certainly connect with Anna's struggle to be herself, to open up and overcome her fear of rejection, and to opening to love, romantic and non romantic. Adults will love the magic realism of the film, the inexplicable synchronicity that leads to the end, and the overall spicy sweetness of the story. My mixed feelings about the film rely on the apparently queer relationship of the two teens. This wouldn't be a problem if the story didn't end as it ends, or the story was one with explicit queer love. I haven't read the book, so I don't know whether the relationship was expressed the same in the novel or not, but it was a distraction for me. For young queers trying to find their identity and fit in the world, the film will be a thrill, but for those who aren't it will be mostly a what-is-this-doing-here? moment. If Ghibli wanted to explore that part, great, no problem, but if that is the case I expect the story to be open about it, clearer about it, the characters to be related differently and the movie to end differently. I think part of the problem with the lack of success of the film it is just the apparent lack of inner congruency.I felt that Sayaka was a wonderful character to explore, but we barely get to know her. The same can be said about Anna's hosts the Oiwa, who are truly a funny interesting couple, and of the character of Marnie's childhood friend and paintress Oisako. On the other hand, the story is mostly an exploration of Anna's character, and the film does so perfectly well.Overall, this is a beautiful movie to watch with many layers of meaning and interpretation. Not a movie for children unless under supervision, and more for young adults and adults.",

This animation is so gorgeous in the countryside. i'm very appreciate ghibli's creature. this is the best.The best also is the soundtrack !. The sound is excellent. so pure like real life. I can feel the sound of nature in the countryside, moreover the sound of rain, thunder, wind, and water are so authentic. I feel like i was there. and the soundtrack is so calm, nice and very suitable for this film. the song is Fine on the outside by Priscilla Ahn. this is one of my favorite songs too.The mystery surprised me at the ending this film. it overwhelmed me. because the story, animation, and sounds are stunning.Like the previous Studio Ghibli's movie are 'Spirited Away' that the best than this film. Although, 'When Marnie Was There isn't up to the incredibly high standard of the best Ghibli films. it still beautiful and sweets. i like it.The last creature by Studio Ghibli is great and makes us remembered always. 'When Marnie Was There' is truly a Studio Ghibli classic guranteed to warm your heart.thank you.",

When Marnie was there was a movie that I had been wanting to see for a good while but I never got around to watching it till now because this movie was included with HBO Max so I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it and I'm glad I did because this movie was just truly beautiful from start to finish and there is a lot to like about this movie. The cast in this movie was just amazing everyone did a fantastic job playing there characters and honestly they became there characters. The characters in this movie all are great too, each character is very important to this story and plays an important part. This movie also has a mystery and I have to say the mystery was so well done and had me trying to piece everything together throughout the whole movie. The story in this movie is also fantastic and well executed from start to finish. The animation in this movie was also stunning to look at and was just so beautiful. The music is also amazing and it honestly plays an important part in the story. Overall, I am surprised it took me this long to watch this masterpiece of a movie and I honestly can't wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "This is my 3rd favourite Ghibli film. Just behind Spirited Away & From Up on Poppy Hill. It's a really good movie.All of the characters, even the minor ones, were so well defined and likeable. Anne was great, Marnie was great, Anne's Caretakers were great, the little girl in Marnie's old home was great, and that painter lady was great. Even though I don't remember their names right now, I still know that they were great.The plot, while confusing at times, was super interesting and incredibly emotionally investing. And it all came to such an amazingly powerful and satisfying conclusion. And there was a really cool plot twist in there as well. I wouldn't have seen it coming if it wasn't already spoiled for me. It was still really cool to watch though.It goes without saying that the animation was great. I loved the music as well. The end credits song \"Fine of the Outside\" is going to become one of my favourites. I can already tell.I also have very few problems with the dub. Everyone does a pretty good job. It's not perfect, but I'd say it's probably better than most of the other anime I've seen. Any moments that felt off were very brief and never godawful.But what really sells this movie is the relationship between Marnie & Anne. It's just really nice. Very cute.There's really nothing more to say except restating that I loved it.",

I decided to watch this after Earwig because I wanted to save the best for last, and holy cow was I right. This is probably the best Studio Ghibli movie that I have watched.Throughout the movie, the audiences were in a mystery drama where the main girl, Anna, who was introverted and depressed, spent time with Marnie, a mysterious friend from a mysterious house. I loved this mystery because it kept me invested and wanted to figure out the twist.The friendship between the two main girls were beautiful. They slowly learned about each other, and became dependent of each other. This friendship was elevated due to the gorgeous hand-drawn animation. The sceneries were breathtaking and hypnotizing.And when the twist hit, this movie became one of the most heartbreaking and emotional plots I have ever watched. I was on the brink of just letting all the tears out. When I figured out what was happening, I felt like sinking and in awe at how impactful and beautiful the storytelling was. The last shot was both beautiful and made me even more sad.Overall, a simple story with less fantastical elements than a typical Ghibli movie, but its effective storytelling and heart-wrenching revelation made for the only Studio Ghibli movie that made me cry. It's mature, but can be very helpful to young kids who are going similar times as the characters. This movie will stay with me for awhile. 10/10.",

            "content": "\"When Marnie Was There\" has the unenviable task of representing Studio Ghibli's first production without the involvement of either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. These two men, Miyazaki in particular, are synonymous with Studio Ghibli, which left \"When Marnie Was There\" needing to reassure movie-goers that the company would continue in the fine traditions of its founders.The result is promising with slight reservations. There's a lot to like here. The main character, Anna, is a complex central piece to a fairly complex story. She is emotionally distant from those around her, owing to the early loss of her parents and the loss of familial connection this brings her. This makes her genuinely unpleasant to some of the people who try to reach out to her, an ambitious choice by the writers for a character that we need to connect to in order to care about the film. I found that this really worked, and provided an intriguing and sometimes unpredictable character to focus our attention on.The story that unfolds around Anna, involving her fascination with an abandoned house and its former occupants, is beautifully presented to us but with few scenes that really dazzle dramatically. A gripe that I had with the film was that some slowly simmering plot points, such as the sinister grain silo, didn't really deliver on their early promise, and overall the film ties off a lot of plot points fairly rapidly which left me feeling slightly dissatisfied. Overally I was left suspecting that there were probably a lot of plot holes that wouldn't take a lot of poking to reveal, if one spent the time.This wouldn't matter to me too much if the film's emotional core was solid and it is, again, for the most part. As is fairly typical of a Ghibli film, my eyes did well up a few times during the movie and some of this was certainly due to the emotional connections that were developed throughout. However, I couldn't escape a nagging feeling that at times the film used some fairly cheap tricks to elicit these reactions from me, including the swells of a very unsubtle score and the buckets of tears produced by the on screen characters.The film's key strength is in visuals and accompanying sound as it is a delight to experience. Director Hiromasa Yonebayashi and his animation staff deserve enormous credit for conveying the sensations of the main character with such tactile clarity. When Anna crosses the bay to the abandoned mansion for the first time in the low tide, the animation and sound combine to such an effect that I could practically feel the cold water around my ankles and the uncertain contours of the bottom underfoot. These are the moments that really carry the film and display the talent still on offer at this illustrious animation studio.",

            "content": "Hiromasa Yonebayashi director of Arrietty (2010) and one of Spirited Away's (2001) animators directs a typically stunning Studio Ghibli feature but might not be the ones Ghibli fans are use to, but don't let that disappoint. The film is refreshingly beautiful and soft to the eye. Based on Joan G. Robinson's modern essential classic novel of the same name. The story is moved from Norfolk, England to the Countryside of Japan without losing the core of the storyline. About a young girl Anna, who's socially an outsider, being an orphan and is sent to the country to rediscover herself. There, she makes new friends and one in particular is Marnie, the girl who lives in the supposedly derelict Marsh House. There's an instant bond but a haunting feeling behind it all. It's all a mystery and even though you think you might have guessed it, all is not what it seems. As expected, the animation is glorious with parallax scrolling and beautiful sceneries. However there's no wondrous weird characters that normally populate Studio Ghibli films. But there's still the lovable characters in human form such as the Oiwa's and Sayaka. Takatsugu Muramatsu composes the score but is sadly not quite the enchanting Joe Hisaishi some of us might expect but nevertheless it suits the film and sets the scenes nicely. There has been speculation that this might be the Studio's final film after the famed Hayao Miyazaki departure, retiring. There is a planned prolonged break while the studio decides what to do but there is nothing final about it closing down. This is a fine example of the animated features the studio can produce, an enchanting mystery that's emotional and heart-warming. A great film for all to watch, especially the kids but some might find it long, a little slow and doesn't have the usual magic Ghibli films have.

Her guardian sends her away one summer to live with some of her relatives in a quieter seaside town... At this stage the story is all about Anna coming to terms with who she is, and is quite similar to a lot of teenage \"coming of age\" stories.Then the story shifts gears and Anna befriends a girl called Marnie, who lives in a seemingly abandoned house across the water / marshes. It is here that the story lacks a bit of consistency and becomes a little less compelling, if not more intriguing. Marnie may not be quite what she seems, and through her Anna may find answers to the questions which plague her and fuel her self doubt / emotional pain.The story here just feels a bit lightweight and thin, when it should really be heavier and more emotionally heavy hitting, drawing you in. There are moments which succeed, but some of the dialogue is a little flimsy and cliched, and Marnie's character is a little too one dimensional.The animation is Ghibli at its absolute best, there is genuinely no film with better animation in their back catalogue than this, and the soundtrack is very pretty.A really lovely film with a great story, it's just a shame they didn't give the story more of the power that it deserved.",

It was partly the reason that she was sent away to her aunt and uncle for the summer. Her mother sent her there in hopes that she will get better and that she will find happiness. However, nothing related to her sickness was ever showed during her entire stay there.It was obvious that Anna was struggling with depression. She had also been causing a lot of problem for her aunt and uncle. She was always home late, found multiple times unconscious on the streets, she even insulted someone who was just trying to be nice. In results of that, her aunt and uncle were the ones to get blamed for not keeping an eye on her properly. However, the both of them never confronted her about it. They also never asked her if everything was okay. Maybe they didn't want her to feel uncomfortable, but it's as if they don't care what she does. Someone even said that she pointed her child with a knife (which was untrue), but they let that slide too.SPOILER ALERT! Later, we find out that Marnie was actually Anna's dead grandmother. However, their relationship before that discovery was more like lovers instead of friendship or family love. There were multiple times that Anna was seen jealous of Kazuhiko, her GRANDFATHER. I get that she didn't know that at the time, but it's still weird. Anna had also tried to get Marnie in her room, implying that she want something more than friendship (?) She was also seen multiple times blushing around Marnie and Marnie seems to be enjoying her reaction.Despite all of these, I think this movie portrays perfectly of how a depressed 12-year-old would act. She might appear ungrateful to most people because she has such a loving mother, yet she never appreciates her. She didn't even bother to write back to her mom when she was clearly worried about her. She had also been causing trouble to her aunt and uncle during her whole stay. On top of that, she was being mean to people who were just trying to be her friend. Yet, she was also so relatable. All she ever cares about is Marnie. Yet, she was also so relatable. I think at some point in life, everyone thinks that the world is against them. But she grew out of it. Marnie made her view the world from a different perspective.The artwork and soundtracks? As expected from Ghibli Studios! MESMERIZING!!",

It is seen how Marnie was beloved by Anna and had only sweet and heart-warming memories about their past years. In fact, reflecting her past experience on the present ones turned out to have a favourable impact on her individuality. Namely, not only did she reminisced about their pastime with each other, but also cherished every single moment spent together.Frankly, this is a great piece of work for those who try not to socialise with others.

The main draw to this movie was its emotional content, and by golly it delivered on it, i havent felt this much emotion in an anime movie since wolf children, i honestly cant decide if i like wolf children more than this movie right now (and believe me, thats saying something) it was somewhat sad in a way, but it was also uplifting and beautiful. I dont really want to spoil much but believe me, this movie will tug on the heartstrings in more ways than one\nabsolutely recommended, check this one out if you like anime, or even just emotional stories in general, because this one is fantastic.",

No Ana wasn't your typical loveable main character, especially the way she starts off, and how she treats others.... But, I knew there was more to her, and I knew that she was experiencing pain, trauma, unresolved childhood issues, that only she can experience... everyone you meet, everyone you walk past, they're all fighting their own battles and, and the way the artists told this Ana's story was really amazing, and heartfelt, it resolves in such a beautiful way.This film must viewed to the end to resolve.It's not spirited away, or any of the other cult classic ghibli's, and it's not trying to be, it's \"when marnie was there\" and it's amazing story if you give it a chance.",

I don't read the original story, but its sure a good story made by Joan G. Robinson. To transform a foreign story and mixed it with local culture, this is a good example of solving the race problem for audience to relate. Some other movie just adapt a story from foreign country and use local actors to replace their original name, even completely killing the character like we found in The last airbender and hopefully not for Ghost in shell. From now on, Marnie is a part of my life that i'll never forget, even though she's just a fictional character. Ghibli made this character so unforgettable with her strong character. His childhood is really sad, when we know even the maid bully her and she rarely met her parents. This made a link between her and audience, we really felt sorry for this girl and so sad even more when we have told the complete story, her old days are even sadder.",

The single adopted girl as the protagonist, with Asthma, about the age of my daughter, who I went to see the movie with, was a little close to home. The complete independence give to the girl by her Uncle and Aunt, through which she discovers so much about herself, is a very generous backdrop to the film. The freedom allowed to children in Japanese life, in which they can be quite mean sometimes, is refreshingly portrayed. The idyllic setting required to tell the story is another thing. There are not many places like that left in the world.This is a wonderful anime product.",

            "content": "Well the latest entry from Studio Ghibli was an interesting watch, it's not quite as emotionally taxing as say From Up on Poppy Hill or The Wind Rises are & it's not going into the ridiculously wonderful & whimsical vibrant worlds of say Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, it is a film of small personal drama that at the heart of it is a story of a young girl troubled with loneliness & a feeling that the world around her is not accepting her...that can be oh so relatable, just from the simple feeling of opening up only to get hurt in the process therefore further isolating herself, sound familiar? The one thing you do get from the film is something that is very prominent in many Ghibli films and that is the convincing portrayal of the main character having to 'find themselves' to discover who they are, which is always a great message to put out there.For me personally it's not up there with the Studio's best with some of the tones a bit too twee for my liking and hey I'm not afraid of a bit of Ghibli whimsy but they've done it so much better in the likes of From Up on Poppy Hill (which I feel is greatly underrated) and The Wind Rises that embrace the personal drama, humor and whimsy in equal and affecting use, considering also some of the films themes this may explain away why there wasn't as much humor in the film.It has to be said Ghibli always make interesting films & even with this being not one of their best it still has plenty to offer & I could still see it connect with a young adolescent girl audience.I hope that this (given the rumors) is not their last film for a while as their films make the animation landscape such a more vibrant place to view interesting films.",

I think one main reason why people felt that way is because they had certain expectations even before playing the movie. That's why they watched the movie from a very different point of view. They only looked for clues to support their views and discarded all the others.Another reason may be that people don't have a good understanding of \"Love\". As it is often mistook by sexual desire. That is what happened in this case. People thought Anna and Marnie's action towards each other as sexual. From way I understood, it was not it.For Anna, she went to Marsh house as it felt familiar to her. Yes, it was weird that she talked and danced with a little known girl quickly. But as story unfolds it became apparent that Marnie knows Anna from before. At the ending, you should have realized why Marnie and her tune felt familiar to Anna. Also, why she kept coming back to Marnie.For Marnie, think of this way that she has given a small chance to come back to the world to talk to her granddaughter. But what would she do when Anna don't recognize her? Anna at this point, lost all trust to adults. So, she came as same aged as Anna. And she wanted to help cure Anna's problems without telling who she was and get forgiveness for her absence.Lastly, the type of bond Marnie and Anna showed is what you may have with your very close siblings, relative and best friends. You can also have such with your partner if you connect well. But, if sex is the only reason of your union with your partner that you will not have a lasting bond.",

            "content": "It's not often I watch a movie then jump straight in to write a review, but this is a rare exception. As a long time Ghibli fan I had been disappointed by their last couple of movies. From the dragging depression and heartbreak of The Wind Rises to the forgettable Up On Poppy Hill, I was hoping When Marnie Was There would break the trend and return to, if not the fantastical magic of Ponyo and Totoro, then at least the sweet satisfaction of the likes of Arietty and Whisper of the Heart. In fact I surfaced from this film wondering if it may just be the most perfect Ghibli of all time. How on Earth can this have lost to Inside Out in the Academy Awards? It's just on another level. Sure it's less fun and cartoony and probably dull for kids to watch, but in terms of artistry, depth of plot, and sheer magic...well, comparing IO to WMWH is like comparing fart jokes to Shakespeare. Not since the first ten minutes of Up have I felt so emotionally drained from watching an animation. And in a good way: the ending doesn't leave you with tears caused by tragedy (Grave of the Fireflies springs to mind) but with those of pure, bittersweet joy. It's a movie that explores the true meaning of love so many ways; friendship, family, fostering and even same-sex relationships. It says more about the uncertain and fearful psyche of a lonely teenager than Inside Out ever could. It is Ghibli's perfect demonstration that one needs to look beyond the superficial, to forgive people for their insecurities and that if you truly care for someone then neither blood, gender or time can or should get in the way. 10/10",

Enjoy the sounds. Don't worry too much about the plot (were they lesbians?). If you do you get distracted instead of just experiencing what you're seeing and hearing and feeling, you miss the simple pleasure of letting yourself enjoy.Best example is Totoro - visuals to sounds to experiences - makes you feel good. Marnie is just as sensorially intense, but in a different way from Totoro - more an adolescent frame than a child frame - quite ingenious how they do it with hand-drawn animation.With Marnie that's exactly what you get - a film to be enjoyed as it is - rated 9/10 (Totoro's a 10).",

This is kind of deppression. she ever got breathless. therefore, her mother was so worried her, and she sent her to a village to help her asthma and get her emotions back from this dark place.\nAnna's hobby is sketching. Finally, in the village she found a girl like her. her name is Marnie. she has long blonde hair, blue eyes and seems like almost a ghost on the lake. Actually, when i see marnie i think she is a ghost but not.In here, you can see how beautiful friendship is. Friendship and knowledge is what gives us hope and makes Anna realizes that she want to love herself and be brand new.\nThis animation is so gorgeous in the countryside. i'm very appreciate ghibli's creature. this is the best.The best also is the soundtrack !. The sound is excellent. so pure like real life. I can feel the sound of nature in the countryside, moreover the sound of rain, thunder, wind, and water are so authentic.

I wanted more and more interactions between our protagonist and Marnie and I was certain at one point, given how Anna acted around Marnie and how certain scenes were, that Anna was having a crush on her. Given that, I was really taken aback by the plot twist that it was actually grandmother.From the scene with the tower that Marnie started breaking down I was kind of lost and struggled to really understand the events happpening but continued watching. By a certain point I felt as if the movie had already ended but somehow kept going. I felt like it was dragging quite a bit towards the end.Overall, it's a movie absolutely worth watching but I think it's one that kids wouldn't really enjoy as it does get kind of heavy for a movie of its kind so I'd suggest to watch later on.",
