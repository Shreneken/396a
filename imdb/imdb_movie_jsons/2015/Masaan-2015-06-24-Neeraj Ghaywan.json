            "content": "M A S A A N What a satisfyingly great piece of filmmaking. Super amazing performances by Shweta Tripathi\u200b, Sanjay Mishra, Richa Chadda\u200b and the newcomer Vicky Kaushal. Neeraj Ghaywan seems to be a very sorted-in-mind kind of a person to be able to make such a sublime film. The cinematography is spotlessly inspiring and to be put simply 'PERFECT'.It is difficult to believe that we have such fimmakers making such films in India with such good performances by such good actors!Shweta Tripathi\u200b is adorably cute and you just to keep looking at her. Vicky Kaushal has the 'boy-next-door' believability and he portrayed his character full of romance initially and angst later with such subtly and smoothness that from the first time you see him, you believe him. He needed some one like Shweta to complement his performance. Actually both of them have complimented each other so perfectly in the film that now I can't imagine any other actors doing their roles.Richa Chadda plays 'Devi' and her character is so interesting to watch from the very first scene. Her's is a character which cannot be described easily. She lives in a small town, belonging to a rather seemingly conservative family where there is only her father played awesome-awesome-awesome Sanjay Mishra who is a priest-scholar. Devi is an educated young woman who is exploring her sexuality when she gets caught. Rest of the film is about the way she deals this matter with her father, everyone else and herself. Their is a guilt of sorts in her mind that she needs to deal with. She loves her father but their is something in their past that bothers her perhaps. Hers is a very pragmatic character who probably feels bogged down by the small town mentality and sensibilities of the small town that she lives in. Don't want to divulge much, you have to watch the film to try to understand her character.Sanjay Mishra ji is simply put awesome. He 'acts' so effortlessly that I can't even call him an actor. Cos he just doesn't seem to be acting. He just becomes the character here. And he a delight to watch. I need to congratulate the casting director of the film for a perfect magical cast. Even actors casted for Deepak's family are perfect and each actor was realistically believable.Cinematography by Avinash Arun is just awesome. I loved the way he has lit the film. There is no extra, unnecessary lighting which gives the film a realistic look. I loved the shots which would be perhaps termed as under-lit in conventional mindsets. Cinematography was just what it was supposed to be. A great tool to visualize the director's thoughts and it did it wonderfully.Editing by Nitin Baid was spot on. There is not a single moment in film where the film lags. Its cut crisply yet there is 'thairaav' where required.Music was like cherries on the cake. Totally sweet! Totally delicious!'Masaan' is a film that should, would inspire Indian filmmakers to do- away with all the extra glam-sham quotients of the typical Bollywood films. Films are all about story telling and this film does it perfectly. It is based in a very small town where there is nothing over-the-top in any manner. Real locations have been used and they look superb. The film is full of metaphors and it makes you think. But maybe there isn't much to think, It can be a bit of an abstract film which also works if it doesn't bore you. This film doesn't bore you! It really engages you!Definitely worth a watch!My rating: 8.5/10",

            "content": "Masaan was felicitated at the Cannes Film Festival with standing ovation from the audiences. True to its hype, Masaan lives up to the reputation and gives you hard-hitting drama with realistic views on life.Masaan, means \"crematorium\", tells two parallel story in the holy city of Varanasi. From the writer Varun Grover( lyricist to some good films like Gangs Of Wasseypur, Ankhon Dekhi, Dumb Laga Ke Haisha) and direction by Neeraj Ghaywan ( 2nd Unit director to Gangs Of Wasseypur and Ugly), Masaan tells you the ugly side of life \u2013 The cremation scenes at the ghat of Ganges, the coin-collecting game and police extortion deep- dives into simple life and thinking of Varanasi people, caste system and police pressure. The hitting drama is hair-raising and it will be difficult to gulp down few scenes. Kudos to Neeraj Ghaywan for daring to be different. It takes nerve of steel to tell the not-so- happy ending stories. Art direction is brilliant. Cinematography is astounding with eye-catching scenes of beautiful banks of Varanasi. Dialogues are witty. Background score by Indian Ocean is tuneful. I was expecting the climax to be engaging but was slightly disappointed. Coming to the performances, Masaan has four protagonist and each of them gets into the character. Richa Chadha is brilliant and gives a staggering performance. She is undoubtedly gem of a actor playing various characters ( Nagma Khatoon in Gangs Of Wasseypur, Bholi Punjabin in Fukrey) with ease. Sanjay Mishra just gets better with each role. He is electrifying as usual. Newbie actors Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi shines and are promising.Masaan is gritty and realistic cinema which should be lauded for its sheer effort. Excellent 4/5",

            "review_title": "A Heartbreaking Chronicle of Harsh Lives. \u2666 76%",
            "content": "Now we know how long it took for Bollywood to come up with 2015's first best film: 7 months.One should be prepared to give multiple chills to their spine as he/she goes on about watching and completing this compelling drama consisting of two parallel stories talking about life, love, and death. A young careless daughter (Chadda) of an aging professor (Mishra) from the highly conservative city of Varanasi finds herself committing a mistake while bridging the gap between love and lust, after having fallen for one of her coaching class students, which pushes the father-daughter duo into a horrible mess involving a corrupt policeman and his greedy, two-holed belly. The first five minutes of this story is enough to entice a normal person, and if you are a film fanatic, you'll throw away the popcorn for you want to concentrate.The second tale, about adolescent love, is as charming as its two main characters. The most valid setting for an interior village in the holy city is perhaps what best describes one of the protagonists here: an Engineering student (Kaushal) who is the hope of a family whose generation-old work background has everything to do with the celebrated, open crematorium (translating to masaan in Hindi) that happens in the banks of the Ganges river in Varanasi. His transition from a sincere student into a bereaving mass of wreck is triggered when a girl (Tripathi) innocently enters his life. They fall in love, and watching this love unfold is a real treat. Sweet pleasure treat.And if one feels unfinished with these stories, then there is great doses of poignancy to it. It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch the fate of these characters as they embrace dynamic equilibrium in their hopeless lives, just to move forward. The stories as a single entity reek of realism to the fact that such things still happen in this modern world where on one side of the globe people are talking about shifting to Moon or Mars. The whole idea is haunting and let us not go down the anachronism road, not that it is prevalent in the film.Cast performance is brilliant. The way they act out the well-written characters shows how the makers have paid attention to details and have done good homework about the theme. Mishra, as original as ever in his typecast character, rules the frame whenever he appears. The newcomers also add panache (wrong word, I know) to the screen, especially Tripathi. Music and lyrics are supportive, too.BOTTOM LINE: With a fantastic conclusion, Masaan is a heart- wrenching tale of people trapped in a conundrum we all call life.VERDICT: 8 stars out of 10. Highly recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESSex/Profanity: Mild",

            "review_title": "Masaan film review \u2013 A Story that touches your soul",
            "content": "Masaan is a story set in real Benaras which is better known as Kashi. Why did I mention real Benaras? This film makes you meet the other side of Kashi which is more active in the night than the day, the cremation Ghats where the dead bodies are burnt as per Hindu rituals. The cremation Ghats of Kashi has been mostly portrayed in films and serials as a mystic place but here the director, a d\u00e9butant Neeraj Ghyawan and co-writer Varun Grover portrays the cremation Ghats as a usual business place where the bodies are burnt after dying. But, the film has a hidden treasure beyond the burning of the bodies in the cremation ghats. It's the burning of people griefs and the courage to let go their guilt to celebrate a new life.The urge of arriving in life is portrayed by each central character of the film \u2013 Richa Chadha as Devi, Sanjay Mishra as Devi's father and Vicky Kaushal as Deepak. While Devi wants to get out of the narrow mindedness of the city and attain more liberty in the form of experiencing love and pleasure, the other character Deepak wants to break his shackles of being a pyre burning lower caste youth of becoming a civil engineer and dreams of marrying his upper caster girlfriend.Sanjay Mishra runs a small shop at the cremation ghat and is trying to rejuvenate the cold relationship with his daughter and in order to protect her from a scandal; he breaches his own moral principles when he forces a child who works in his shop to take part in the dangerous game of collecting coins from the Ganges. The story brings twist in the each character's lives when they are forced to do a soul searching. Their soul searching brings dark moments in the film when you feel sad about their lives. But wait, there is light after the dawn and no grief is permanent. The films at the end leaves you with a message that Masaan is not only about burning the physical bodies but also about letting go your grief and making your soul guilt free.The film is beautifully written with a strong message and a good d\u00e9butant director attempt towards the serious sensible storytelling cinema. The music by Indian Ocean gels with the characters lives and the city's backdrop. The lyrics and music of the songs 'Tu Kisi Rail si gujarti hai' based on Dushyant Kumar's poetry and Man Kasturi re' are simply magical and has lifetime music value. All credits to the Director Neeraj Ghyawan who has been trained under Anurag Kashyap and the co-writer Varun Grover for such a beautiful story. Both the seasoned and the d\u00e9butant actors have worked hard on their characters and that is evident from their acting. I want to end this review for Masaan with these few lines in Hindi.. Jo Man ko Chu Jaye Use khubsurat ahsas kehte hai, Jo Atma ko Chu Jaye Use Masaan Kehte hai !",

            "review_title": "Bollywood - your time is up. Welcome to real Indian cinema...",
            "content": "Gone are the days when people used to flock to cinemas on hearing about a \"Salman Khan will remove his shirt\" scene. Gone are the days where you have a 100 people pop out of nowhere and join the actors in an impromptu dance. Gone are the days when a shower of petals across the screen would imply that people are making out. Well, at least, they should be gone.2015 is turning out to be a breathtaking year for Hindi Cinema. First we had \"Margarita, with a Straw\", which, simply put, broke all stereotypes. And now we have Masaan, which makes Margarita look small. We have had a few amazingly touching and intense films in regional Indian cinema, with the likes of Ray, Kasaravalli, et al, but this is a whole new territory in Hindi Cinema.Masaan is devastatingly beautiful. Where do I even start? In the small North Indian town of Varanasi, the lives of a few ordinary people intertwine in two tales of love and loss. Right from the opening scene, we are thrown right into the tragic lives of these people, with an intensity hitherto unseen in Indian cinema, almost Scorsese like. It is so intense, that an air of discomfort fills the theater just 5 minutes from the opening. And that of unjust. Unjust, as we are forced to see the catastrophic consequences of corruption, greed, caste-ism, and people's attitudes towards sexuality. This is no pretty film. There are no scenes of comic relief. It gets into your head real quick, and you are all but mute spectators to their spiraling lives. You feel chained to your seats as you're unable to do anything for them. Now that's the power of good cinema.The acting is almost perfect. Richa Chadda, as Devi, the bold woman caught up in sexual crime and corruption, is the star of the show. She pulls off the small town girl next door role with elegance and beauty, which only increases with her fearlessness as the film progresses. All the other actors, though not as good, are extremely believable in their respective casts. The direction is impeccable, with every small shot, be it romance or crime, captured with equal ferocity. But where the film truly stands out is in its cinematography. Avinash Arun Dhaware does in incredible job in capturing the holy city of Benaras in both its highs and lows. He sure is an expert in glorifying tragedy. The shots of the cremation at the ghats, the boat rides at night, and the train on the bridge are so hauntingly beautiful that they would remain etched on to my memory for quite some time.Masaan is a film that exposes you to the kinds of lives people elsewhere live, and gives you an opportunity to evaluate yours. It makes you ponder over issues, though a tad exaggerated, that people in certain parts of our country surely still face. It might also teach you a thing or two on love, loss and moving on. Although I haven't seen a lot of Hindi cinema, this might just about be the best that I have.Unfortunately, most people would still prefer a topless Salman Khan than a gem like this.",

But a film and its audio visual story telling has such an impact that few film like this one can reveal to you all about living even as One faces death all the time or suddenly at any time unexpected.How like flow of river Ganga which begins as many rivers but merges at a geographical place in India the characters of the film begin far apart from each other.The stage is set all along the river and camera captures it in pain, suffering, will to live on and beauty it shares with those who resides along her banks. The spasm of a growing up youth beyond genders and culture or geography is well captured by first part of the film.Two different approaches to Courtship and eventual beginning of a unit of civilization-The family is revealed.One is daring and experimental walking the talk till its unexpected turn and the Other soft and smooth slowly inter twining relationship which too faces its test.Suddenness of turn of events in both stories shake you up and tests the will power of the protagonists.How they climb the uphill climb challenge that the life suddenly throws against them leaves us with immense faith in the flow of time ,life and ability of the Human beings to live on despite it all.The river along is the perfect analogy that any one can relate it all with.The ghats and life of the most ancient city in the world-Kashi,Benares ,Varanasi is captured with caring camera work.Despite the stage where last rites by Fire are performed as a routine occupation by few of its actors the life of courtship ,education, finding job, friendship between genders and within themselves all blossom in front of you.How friends are add ons to the family helping one in many ways during all times is what we all can relate to.How one has to walk out of it all as life moves on too we all know.Barriers of age,culture,ethos,caste and economic difficulties are multiplied by by gross inhuman injustice of corruption and exploitation from those who are our protectors.How in our utopia we all dream of fair-play justice, freedom to be oneself and power to explore all aspects of life as we want!The central characters have acted so well with such finis in direction of each frames and scenes that we all feel the ups and downs in their lives as if our own for 109 minutes we share with them till screen is lit.What else is life but certainty of death looming large silently unseen over it.Still we all live ,enjoy its each moment,and have ability to heal the wounds and learn to live on as a river does.Film will reinforce a belief that Life will help you ,the world will conspire to help you if you help yourself and continue the journey called Life.Walk On despite it all..",

            "content": "FIPRESCI, Un Certain Regard and standing ovation at Cannes, standing ovation in Ahmadabad and now a standing ovation in Bangalore, Neeraj Ghaywan's Masaan is a film that deserves high accolades for its exceptionally well written screenplay and execution. This year has been good for Indian cinema with some of the best films like \"Court\", \"Killa\" and \"Kaaka Mottai\" hitting the screens. Masaan joins this list of elite films. These films do not have big stars, big investments but the honesty in film-making and the content that they carry is something that Indian cinema has not attempted before, even attempted not this subtle. \"More subtle, more the impact\" seems to be the mantra of these films. From larger than life narratives these films bring in the shift to depict stories of ordinary people in mundane situations and their reactions. There is a kind of honesty and faith in the film which one can easily get engaged to. This not only brings the freshness breaking the stereotypical norms also gives out thoughts through the different layers the narrative has. The stories that narrate the connect of human emotions need to be explored more. \"Masaan\" deals with the connects of relationship in a very mature and subtle way. It keeps away from the usual melodrama. It thrives of modernism though tied with traditional values. \"Its a bold film with values rather than bold visuals\".. Each one of the characters has a story with real life turmoils. Some of the scenes are brilliant. Thanks to the film-making brilliance. Such experiments have an overwhelming and everlasting impact on the audience. You realize how cinema can be used as a powerful medium. You train yourself to care about good cinema watching films like \"Masaan\"and i think this is something such kind of films do beyond what they are normally expected to. The joy of having watched a satisfactory film is one of the best feelings any film-lover will want to have. It has become a rare phenomenon in Indian cinema. Commercial cinema has really cared about reaching the 100 Crore mark rather than providing satisfactory cinema. On one end we have the high grosser films and the other we have films like \"Masaan\" which mainly get tagged as \"festival\" films and in between films like \"Piku\" which is good cinema with a commercial appeal. I feel its time to get these festival films a commercial space. Its wrong for a good film to be bound only by festivals, it needs support from the theaters and mainly from the audience to thrive commercially. This would definitely help bring in a change of sense of cinema and help Indian Cinema grow.",

The movie has flaws (the absence of that scent of regional tone in the dialogues was the most disappointing part), but the mindblowing performance by Sanjay Mishra & the strong, heavyweight performance from Richa Chadda will make it up.If you support such good cinema, and want more 'daring' film-makers, then don't miss it.",

The story takes 2 tracks, one is richa chadda's track - an educated smart girl, trapped in a society that doesn't want to match her pace, instead wants to just pull her down by trying to shove sexist prejudices down her throat. The second track is around Vicky Kaushal - a boy whose ancestral tree has been in the funeral work, but he is smart and completing a good education, falls head over heels in love, young, innocent college love and then loses that love in the most shattering way. Both tracks take us through a series of emotions that the main characters experience. First love, desire.. then regret, pain .. then longing for closure.. all around the banks of Ganga where the ultimate closure is done. I might run out of words to describe this film. It has so many layers. It is so very moving and thought inducing. It is just brilliant in all possible departments - acting, writing, film setting, screenplay. Just superb.

            "content": "Banaras doesn't really stand a chance when it comes the nation's top film-makers , does it? From Ray's 'Aparajito' to Mehta's 'Water', this holy cradle of Hinduism has been imbrued with a decidedly unholy miasma. Employing two tracks , one a story of police corruption and victims' cowardice, and another of a young funeral- pyre attendant aspiring to be a civil engineer, Masaan will not inspire you, either, to instantly book a train to this sacred town but holy cow! it does chart a riveting story of loss and hope that mirrors the rebirthing ethos of those stony steps and waters. It neatly slices open its own layers of social milieu to reveal that while the larger whole still seems hopeless, its young rebels calmly persevere to buck the trend. Produced by Manish Mundra and the Phantom Films triumvirate of Bahl, Motwane and Kashyap, 'Masaan' marks the auspicious directorial debut of Neeraj Ghaywan. Most of India will not hear of this film, despite its international accoldes and inherent caliber, but the picture will stand as an emblematic triumph of cinema neatly filtering the modern reality of an ancient epicenter. One of the pic's strongest assets is the airy light that pleasantly suffuses its wide canvas - I appreciated this better on a 60 inch screen than on a laptop. Cinematographer Avinash Arun Dhaware frames Banaras in clean composed frames that dignify its actual shabby sprawl. There's a superb night-time shot of a boat motoring through dark waters while yellow light silhouettes hives of activity along the town's shores - what's more the on-board narrative continues with similar understated beauty. A terrific medium-length static capture stands tall later in the story when a person enters a house and an uproar ensues inside but the shot maintains the visual hygiene of remaining unmoved outside the gate , gazing at the house exterior. And there's a completely soothing canvas of a boat nearing the survivors of this tale, as it traverses a beautifully sepia mirror-like surface of the Ganga. In the first story-track, a young couple caught in the act of secret sex are blackmailed by a malignant police inspector , while the other thread revolves around a youngster from a small-town underprivileged background aiming to make it big and the arc of his dalliance with his sweetheart. The undeclared just-below-the -surface script here narrates how the new gen calmly fights the sclerotic demeaning mores which have robbed the spirit and happiness of their ancestors. Attending to and tidying up funeral pyres his whole life only affords Deepak a meager salary and a depressing hellish job day after day year after year, and his supposedly low-caste birth and position means that he can't carry out the the luxury of courting just about any pretty girl he sees but this does not stop Deepak. On the other track, the traumatized girl Devi Pathak is initially shell-shocked as any girl would be , but steadily we see her true spine (in response to a savage blaming her in public, she retorts \"Whatever we did, we BOTH did it!\"). Her father persuades her to accept a measly Rs.5000 per month ($100) job from an employer who was his student ,but when she stares at him in cold anger at the recruitment table, the father says in defence - 'But look how much respect he gives us!' (obviously his daughter has moved on from the peanuts gleaned from such token respect).The film's several producers notwithstanding , I find Anurag Kashyap to be the true moral guardian of this film. Debutante director Neeraj Ghaywan shows an European aesthetic and reserve in depicting his canvas , and a fine temperament is telling a tough story without melodrama. With a producer-director team like this, it is no surprise that 'Masaan', steeped in boondocks bedrocks opaque waters malignant lawkeepers failed fathers ruptured lovers and eternally burning hells , emerges beautifully from the ashes.More analysis @ Upnworld",

            "content": "Neeraj Ghaywan's 'Masaan' is packed with strong performances, but as a tale, its flawed & not as gut wrenching as it believes to be. This Two-Story based narrative is certainly not without some merit, but it could've been so much more.'Masaan' Synopsis: Four lives intersect along the Ganges: a low caste boy hopelessly in love, a daughter ridden with guilt of a sexual encounter ending in a tragedy, a hapless father with fading morality, and a spirited child yearning for a family, long to escape the moral constructs of a small-town.'Masaan' aces in its first story, which is genuinely tragic. The father-daughter angle is powerfully handled, offering moments so real, they literally hit you like ton of bricks. My problem was with the second story. I couldn't care less for the low-caste boy who falls for a girl, who turns out to be his opposite, in terms of caste.Ghaywan & Varun Grover's Screenplay solidly builds one story, but fails in the another one. I wasn't repulsed by the goings-on, although the Writing aims to disturb you. The Writing needed to be sharper. Ghaywan's Direction is good. Cinematography & Editing are perfectly done.Performance-Wise: Richa Chadda & Sanjay Mishra lead 'Masaan', with heartbreaking performances. As the conflicting father-daughter, Chadda & Mishra deliver magnificently. Newcomer Vicky Kaushal & Shweta Tripathi are sincere. Pankaj Tripathi is priceless in a cameo.On the whole, 'Masaan' isn't as powerful as it hopes to be, but its still worth a watch for the performances.",

            "content": "Richa Chadda stars as Devi, a beautiful young lady who meets a coworker at a motel for a sexual encounter which is rudely interrupted by the local police. It goes downhill rather quickly as Devi's father is forced to pay hush money to the cop in charge of the investigation. Devi helps with money from a couple of low paying jobs. A second story concerns a college student named Deepak who works burning bodies for burial in the Ganges river. He is of the lowest caste in India and falls in love with Shaalu, who is of the upper caste, which makes the relationship forbidden. Tragedy follows and a somewhat predictable ending which any viewer will see coming. Even with this small criticism, I recommend Masaan for its excellent cast and breathtaking cinematography.",

            "content": "Masaan is a gem, maybe an unpolished diamond is a better description. Watching Neeraj Ghaywan's debut reminded me of another amazing debut, Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox. Masaan is not as beautifully constructed but one can already feel it's heartbreaking eloquence and like Batra, Ghaywan is an old soul.There are two main stories dovetailing hand in hand in the final act, but the themes running through both stories are so powerfully portrayed that I never felt like I was watching two separate narrative threads. Both stories are downright heartbreaking and offer up facets of life in India I have never seen before. In an amateur's hands, only one possible type of movie will be made, but not here. The tone is even, with no gloss, and no preachiness. The protagonists are characters caught in a social cage. They want to break out but every direction they turn shuts them back in. The sadness is so palpable that it seeps under your skin and will refuse to let you go. These are characters portrayed so remarkably well that they feel like real people in front of you. How everything is done with zilch emotional manipulation is pure masterclass. The themes of breaking out encompasses the movie seamlessly.This is the type of movie you can't believe came out of the Bollywood studio system - no pretense, no glossy sheen, yet full of intensity, heart and it never cheapens the human condition just to squeeze tears out of you. This is one of the Hindi gems of 2015 that flies so under the radar with no mid to heavyweight actors that you wouldn't even bother. However, if you have seen it, you will be utterly grateful for such a unique vision. Right up until the final frame it never betrays its initial tone but yet is able to instill so much hope. How you determine the ending is exactly what kind of person you are.",

            "review_title": "Love becomes a Funeral Pyre",
            "content": "Varanasi (Benares) has held a strange fascination for an unlikely plethora of travelers and denizens, from ash clad Aghori Sadhus and weed smoking hippies to hapless widows and trigger happy photojournalists. For me the defining image of Varanasi is of the never ending pyres on the banks of the Ganga, death in all its naked glory. It is this image that Director Neeraj Ghaywan & writer Varun Grover (Gangs of Wasseypur) take as a central theme of the film to showcase a series of interwoven stories set in this haunting, mythical city. The film explores the lives of the families of a preparer and tender of funeral pyres and a Sanskrit scholar, ubiquitous professions that define Varanasi. A previous attempt by Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta to showcase the lives of the widows of Varanasi in Water (2005) was largely shot in Sri Lanka as its take on misogyny and social ostracism fell foul of the right wing. Incidentally the screenplay of Water was written by Anurag Kashyap who's Gangs of Wasseypur seems to be a finishing school of sorts for India's cinematic talent. Consider this: the writer, director and lead actress of Masaan are a paean to Anurag's unerring instinct forte as a talent scoutThe film's protagonists, newcomer Deepak Chaudhary, as the pyre tender's son & Richa Chaddha as the scholar's daughter provide finely nuanced yet restrained performances that serve as a backdrop for Sanjay Mishra's electrifying performance as the beleaguered father who is a respected scholar coming to terms with a sex scandal that his educated, daughter is embroiled in. This is truly his magnum opus, his portrayal of Vidyadhar Pathak,a man in the last legs of his life and career on having to bravely deal with something that could jeopardize the only thing he has left: his reputation in a city where its the greatest currency. While Deepak has definitely made an impression this film is not a patch on Richa Chaddha's performance in Gangs of Wasseypur. It was never meant to be and that is what makes Richa one of the most watchable actresses of our times.Masaan has a subtle underlying message of human aspirations and how death, near death and loss of dignity cannot curb our desires to fly. When all hope and companionship is lost we are not averse to 'flying solo'. In a cruel irony Vicky (Deepak) is tending to the pyre of an anonymous woman who he discovers to be his beloved. This was one of the finest scenes of Masaan, where Deepak's soundless pain is felt by the audience. Devi (Richa) has to cope simultaneously with the loss of a loved one, the loss of her employment, a blackmailing inspector Mishra (Bhagwan Tiwari) and her own father's humiliation. Young Jhonta (Nikhil Sahni) nearly loses his life diving for coins in the Ganga as part of a betting game that his employer Vidyadhar Pathak sees as a means to accumulate the bounty demanded by the blackmailing inspector. Yet, they all bounce back. It's not an easy process as we see Devi deal with indecent propositions and suitors and Vicky struggling to master his grief to bag a job, his only ticket out of the burning ghats of Varanasi, where his family has slaved for generations at the bottom of the caste pyramid.The Cinematography by Avinash Arun does justice to Varanasi in all its dark splendor but restrain in the use of sepia would have saved the viewer some monochrome fatigue. The misty images of Ganga as seen from a boat during a day provide a perfect contrast to the countless scenes of blazing funeral pyres on the banks.'Love becomes a Funeral Pyre' is the latest biography of The Doors by Mick Wall released in October 2014. The name is borrowed from the lyrics of a popular song by the band titled 'Light my fire' released in 1967 in their self-titled debut album and spent three weeks at top of the Billboard top 100 chart. The theme of the song is 'love cannot wait' something Devi and Vicky epitomize in Masaan.",

He is pursuing Civil Engineering degree. The girl dies and he goes in to depression. Chandals does the work of last rites of dead bodies on Manikarnika Ghat of Varanasi. It is said that if you are creamted at Varanasi you go to Heaven and if in Maghar then you go to hell. Kabir mocked this belief and insisted that his last rites to be done at Maghar. Thus Chalndals are at the lowest of the most unjust system of world. This film mocks the inhumanity of caste system. Symbolism of Kashi is too good to be missed.This is a story of triumph of human spirit. How both refuse to bow down to small mentality of a backward small town and society. They don't give up and come out triumphant.Music by Indian Ocean is another high point. They have set to tune a poem of famous poet Dyushyant Kumar (Tu kisi rail si gujarti hai; Main kisi pull se thar tharata hu).Acting of Richa Chadha and Sudhir Mishra is superb. New comers and others are also good.Must watch for the fans of realistic, intelligent movie which has strong story line and touches your heart.But it will be mocked by low IQ, rigid, holier than thou and prudish mentality persons and they should better stay away.",

            "content": "Neeraj Ghaywan's debut movie Masaan evokes a whole gamut of emotions ranging from fear, redemption, hope, love to transformation. The movie's themes of entropy, destruction and resurrection are signalled by the title, which means crematorium, and the location. Masaan looks for love, meaning, redemption and transformation which it victoriously portrays through its lead characters, characters which swirl in their own eddies but forging ahead with determination.Set in the backdrops of rustic yet idyllic Ganga ghats of Varanasi, the movie showcases two parallel stories.Two journeys are twinned, one beginning in despair and the other in hope. One is of Devi, whose sexual rendezvous with a recently acquired boyfriend goes horribly wrong, putting Devi and her father at the mercy of a corrupt police officer. The other is of the star-crossed romance between Shalu and Deepak, she from an upper caste and he a member of the Dalit Dom community that cremates bodies at the Varanasi ghats. The scenes between Deepak and Shaalu offer innocence and charm and offset the sadness that overtakes Devi and Pathak, neither of whom is equipped to deal with their changed circumstances.Ghaywan's periodic drama also digs and lucidly put forwards the brutal truths of Indian society- sexual repression, the caste divide, financial hardship, limited mobility \u2013 through individual philosophical journeys. We are stifled by our growth and age-cultural traditions that have led to relative morality. The whole patriarchal system allows us to take the moral high ground \u2013 how a small city girl cannot have sex before marriage, for instance. Though brutal but these traditional truths encapsulate the inherent Indian-ness and allows the viewers to be more attached the displayed theme. Ghaywan's narrative is fluid and rich with confidence and sensitivity and the Indian-ness in his writing and shooting does allow its protagonists savor the characterization. Masaan perfectly captures the journey of two tragedy-struck souls from decay to renewal. It all comes to the beautiful concluding scene, which suggests that sometimes, redemption can begin at a point that is not too far away.",

The film is an extreme closeup of the Indian societal and casteist construct, for both foreign nationals wanting to learn about modern day India, and natives oblivious of the burgeois.A certain Chekhov's Gun-esque element beautifully blends the stories of the two protagonists.Watch it once, and the watch it again, because the film leaves you with a feeling of completeness, and nothingness alike.",

Writer Neeraj Grover, story is hard core realistic, screenplay is fresh and dialogues are brief but support well to reveal the character. He used some good metaphor in screenplay, like in the scene, where girl says about her ring that her uncle had inserted it to her finger in her childhood but now its so tight that without being willing full she is carrying it. Clearly, shows about the girl's character that how she is stuck with her traditional family. There are many shots, which enhances the scene and film without speaking much. Cinematography is very impressive. Even, it is not in full cinemascope format but you never miss the shorten length of frame. All visuals are like a big scale film. Even, difficult to find the guerilla shot scenes. Credit goes to its amazing cinematographer Avinash Arun Dhaware. I was sure that I am going to give this film at least 7 after watching the first half but then makers deliberately drag this movie into a parallel cinema. First half is so innocent and cute. Especially the love scenes are just amazing, full of rawness and innocence. I was so engrossed with them that I was expecting such scenes in second half also but then I have to face the truth. My beautiful dream ride got brutally broken by the slap of realism. I was not happy with that and even irritated a bit. Actually first half and second half are literally on two notes. Performance wise Vicky Kaushal as Deepak is mesmerizing. You have to believe that he is indeed Deepak. He emotes so well in the scene, when he cries. Shweta Tripathi as Shaalu is mind blowing. I just loved her expression in all scenes, especially in love ones. Richa Chadda as Devi, is a fine performer, she is brilliant. Sanjay Mishra as her father is very good. Pankaj Tripathi as railway booking clerk, is very natural. The child, Nikhil Sahni as Jhonta is adorable. Bhagwan Tiwari as Inspector Mishra is so good that you just hate him. Vineet Kumar as Deepak's father is very good. Actually, this film is full of good actors and performances. Credit goes to casting director Mukhesh Chhabra too. Music is good, especially the song \" Tu Kisi rail Si guzarti hai\" based on great gazal writer Dushyant Kumar, touches the heart instantly.",

            "content": "Masaan, a film by d\u00e9butant director Neeraj Ghaywan, is a very different film which Indian Cinema has not seen in the recent past. Masaan is going to touch your hearts. It has already won two awards at 68th Cannes International Film Festival this year. Masaan has got raving reviews from all across the corner after its release. I feel very incompetent to review this movie, since many details are to be seen and felt, very difficult to express through writing. Masaan is a story of life, death, innocent love, natural progression to explore love as adults, the need to be part of a family, conservative yet adopting a modern outlook towards life, complex mix of modernity with tradition, rebelling against the moral constructs of the society, corruption by a police officer etc. Masaan is definitely going to have a lingering impact on you, make you accept death as an inevitable part of life, value life more, handle the loss of life, grow beyond grief, face the turbulence of life and the necessity to move on in life irrespective of situations. Oh yes, there are moments of innocent love which is going to bring lot of smile on your face. The film does not try to convey what is right and what is wrong, it does not take any stand as such. It just projects certain realities of life. Certain scenes are so intricately handled, minute details are covered, and these generate so many emotions within us.The word Masaan means cremation grounds (Ghat), where dead bodies are cremated. The movie is set up in the backdrop of Banaras Ghat. Different stories are conveyed, intertwined with one another. Initial credits in the screen are followed by a message which meant that life is an arrangement of five elements whereas death is actually disarray of the very same five elements. It sets out the tone of the whole movie.The film begins with Devi Pathak (Richa Chadha) watching a porn film and later going to meet her boyfriend Piyush Agarwal who used to come to her coaching institute where she was working as a receptionist. Both of them are caught red-handed by police officials in a hotel during their first sexual encounter. Inspector Mishra (Bhagwan Tiwari) does not waste a minute in shooting Devi's video. Meanwhile, Piyush attempts to commit suicide in the restroom. Life takes a humiliating turn for Devi. Vidyadhar Pathak (Sanjay Mishra, Devi's father), once a professor, now sits in one of the ghat as a Pandit to conduct rituals and sell Puja materials, and also translates some work to earn a living. He reaches police station to bail Devi out. Oh, it is such a strong emotional moment, when Devi and Vidyadhar are sitting in two chairs adjacent to each other in front of Inspector Mishra. One can relate with both the characters. Vidyadhar is a person, for whom, respect in the society matters a lot. Vidyadhar and Devi's humiliation reflect so much through their body language. Even after their coming back home, without uttering a word, Vidyadhar expresses to Devi his grief, pain, disbelief, humiliation. Inspector Mishra later emotionally blackmails Vidyadhar when Piyush dies and demands money from him.And then there is story of Deepak Chaudhary (d\u00e9butant Vicky Kaushal), who is from Dom community, lives in Harishchandra Ghat along with his parents, brother and sister-in-law. He is also pursuing his final year engineering from a polytechnic college. Masaan shows the lives of people of his community dealing with deaths every moment and earning their livelihood out of deaths. There is a dialogue in the movie which says: There are only two kings in Banaras \u2013 one is Kashi King and another one is Dom king; and how true this is. The Dom community is in ghat with the funeral pyre most of the time. They even use this holy pyre to light their stove at home to cook food.Deepak falls in love with Shaalu Gupta (d\u00e9butant Shweta Tripathi), an upper caste girl, who is so much a lover of poetry and well- versed with the works of Mirza Ghalib, Bashir Badr, Nida Fazli, Akbar Allahabadi etc. The way love blossoms between Deepak and Shaalu does bring lot of smile. It is interesting to see, how Deepak chooses face book to connect with Shaalu. Music by Indian Ocean band, and lyrics by Varun Grover (inspired from the poet Dushyant Kumar's ghazal) is superb.A strong bond is shown between Vidyadhar Pathak and adorable orphan kid Jhonta (Nikhil Sahni), who assists him in his shop at ghat. Jhonta loves to dive deep into Ganga but does not get permission from Vidyadhar. Another character Sadhya (Pankaj Tripathi), is a clerk in the railway reservation center. How his character is introduced and his role adds to the film's plot, watch the film to know. How does the story of Masaan move further? Does Devi's character succumb to guilt and humiliation? How does she address her own guilt? Does she outgrow it to take charge of her life? How the relationship between Devi and her father Vidyadhar shape up after the unfortunate incident? How do they arrange money for Inspector Mishra? What happens to Deepak and Shaalu's love story? What actually happens when one person who sees deaths every moment but has to face the death of his most beloved one? How to overcome the grief and feeling of loss? Does the holy river Ganges able to fill the gap between caste, genders created by human beings in the society? Although, the climax, rather the whole plot, might raise certain questions in your heart i.e. what if the things which happened never happened at all or had taken a different turn?",

            "content": "Have you ever thought what makes a film to have a long lasting impression on its audience. It doesn't always require an unique storyline or plot, nor does it always need a big setup, sometimes simplicity does the trick. Masaan is a proof of that kind, it is as simple as it can get, got into the heart of its viewers, only to remain there forever.\nA well researched movie by Neeraj Ghaywan, about varanasi, the accent, the people. But sometimes we have also seen that too much research spoils the movie. The problem here is that the director needs to also decide what part of the research to show in the movie. A prime example is Batti Gul Meter Chalu. Here the director along with the location and the prevalent local attires also tried to completely use the local language. Most of the audience never heard that language and above that even the actor seemed to be speaking the language only superficially as the language was also new to them. \nThe movie covers two parallel story set up in Varanasi, a father-daughter duo and a love story of a lower caste boy and an upper caste girl. Both the stories has tragedy as their central theme and the story leads the characters to cross each other in the climax. Director, Neeraj kept the ending quite open ended and allowed the audiences to have their own opinion about the life of the characters after the movie has ended. Sometimes this kind of open ended climax works in the negative way where the audience wants to know about the final fate of the characters because they want the writers to give them a happy ending. The director and writer Varun Grover in this movie never aimed to actually tell stories of four lives, rather they just want their audiences to feel and experience their pain. Trust me they did it brilliantly. The love story between Vicky kausal and Shweta Tripathy was not only heartwarming but also looked very authentic. The best part is that the writers never used any catchy bollywood liners in the movie to express their romance. The cinematographer Avinash Arun very beautifully captured the nuances of Varanasi as a background to this love story. This also made the love story look more realistic. Notably the scene in which Vicky and Shweta met for the first time, scenes of durga puja fair, first date at restaurant are the ones which leaves you wanting more. \nThe movie could have never been so good without the good performances of its lead actors especially Vicky Kausal. Director Neeraj has dug gold here with Vicky. Even when Vicky Kausal has featured in two feature films before Masaan, he for the first time has done a noteworthy role and you will keep thanking the director for this. You will rejoice with him when he is happy and will cry when he cries. Such was the effect of his act and character in the movie. Shweta Tripathy is sweet and innocent and played her character from the heart. Pankaj Tripathi shines in his short role. The casting of Richa Chaddha for the role of Devi Pathak played out to be perfect as it now seems that role of strong and bold female character is always made for Richa. She has previously played the role of a bold girl with outward personality in Oye Lucky Lucky Oye, so this was not the first time for Richa. The song \"tu kis rail si guzarti hain\" is very well written and the music by Indian Ocean has quite a bit of local flavor. This song during durga puja festival very beautifully connects the audience with the unspoken romance between Vicky and Shweta. \nWhile the movie does complete justice with the story of Vicky and Shaalu, it couldn't do justice at the same level with the story of father and daughter. Not that the director failed to show the estranged relationship between Richa as daughter and Sanjay Mishra as father, they actually did able to keep the audience hooked to this story as well but the audience will not feel the same connection what they will feel with the story of Vicky and Shaalu. The missing thread here is that the writers and directors didn't tell the audience about how was the characters life before the tragedy happened. They started the movie with the tragedy itself in case of sanjay-Richa story while in case of other story they first showed how happy the characters were before the tragedy. Overall one should watch this, as not everytime you come across such a marvelous piece of art.",

            "content": "Revealing the basic review, where at one end MASAAN does turn out to be a fine, worth watching film as a powerful debut of director Neeraj Ghaywan, capturing the basic essence of Banaras representing life and death together, at the other it doesn't offer anything outstandingly new in terms of the basic story content and isn't able to shake you well as expected from a film majorly focusing on DEATH.Putting it bluntly, the standing ovation from the foreign audience as well as from a particular section of Indian festival viewers, was probably just because of the extensive 'burning ghats' shots and sequences shown in the film for the first time ever in such details. Exactly similar to many of those early Ismail Merchant movies that used to exploit the Indian cities, its local people, traditional rituals, caste-system, suppression of women and poverty on screen winning over the influential western audience for the obvious reasons.As a matter of fact, my above conclusion got confirmed, when I found many of the co-viewers walking out of the theater talking with each other in terms of, \"It's good no doubt, but\u0085.. that's it\u0085.. jitna suna tha utni nahin thi\". Straight away pointing towards the humongous expectations raised by the several news reports, tweets, FB posts and videos posted at social network about those 'standing ovations'. Perhaps in absence of them all, MASAAN could have impressed a lot more, making a surprising impact bridging the gap between the mainstream and festival cinema as desired.Anyway moving on to the film, it presents two different story lines running parallel to each other that finally meet at a mutual point in the end, representing the 'Sangam' - a progression we have earlier witnessed several times before in various films. Thankfully, the interesting insertions in this familiar setup remain 'many' ranging from 'young mind's excitement over sex', 'mms curse', 'police corruption' and 'underemployment of educated girls' (in the story related with Sanjay Mishra and Richa Chaddha) to 'soft inter- caste romance', 'role of Facebook in an affair', 'mention of many renowned Indian poets' and 'extensive coverage of burning ghats' (in the second plot revolving around Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi).Focusing on 'hope' guiding every single character in its script, the major strength of MASAAN (a local spoken word denoting 'Shamshaan') becomes its rare picturisation of Banaras like never before, with bodies being burnt by the 'masaanis' following their daily hard routine, breaking skulls as the traditional ritual setting the spirits free and the 'pandas' making an earning by supposedly reaching and feeding the already dead as per the ages old religious customs. So here we have an entirely different city of Banaras/Varanasi/Kashi that is not the usual tourist destination or 'the holy town' normally seen in our movies till date.But since the film offers all these emotionally moving and worth experiencing sequences post intermission only, therefore it just remains a sweet, realistic take on relationships in the entire first half that actually restricts its overall impact on the viewers as mentioned before. In other words, beginning with an otherwise shocking 'hotel scene' involving a young sexually excited couple, MASAAN takes some time to pull you in and then makes a decent impression in the end with a better second half like a sweet that tastes the best as it ends.Apart from that, the most significant contribution of MASAAN for the younger generation happens to be the inclusion of respected names of Dushyant Kumar, Nida Fazli, Akbar Allahabadi, Bashir Badr, Brij Narayan Chakbast and more that many might not have even heard before like the hero of the film trying to impress his chosen girl with a song from film QAYAMAT SE QAYAMAT TAK. And with such inclusions MASAAN does fulfill the responsibility of good cinema introducing the current generation with all our masters of the past as required. In its worth listening soundtrack, Varun Grover writes meaningful lyrics and Indian Ocean comes up with a beautiful composition of \"Tu Kisi Rail Si Guzarti Hai\" sung by Swanand Kirkire (adapted from a ghazal by Dushyant Kumar) along with 'Mann Kasturi' and 'Bhor'. Giving the much deserving credit to another substantial merit of MASAAN, it's the cinematography of the film capturing Varanasi and DEATH together with a completely different vision by Avinash Arun (the director of award winning Marathi film KILLA). And Avinash's silent camera indeed makes a lot of difference to the end result of the product, unarguably.In the acting department, we once again have Sanjay Mishra excelling in his effortless act of a helpless poor father scoring the maximum and its really a treat to watch his every scene in the film, especially the ones with the small kid. Richa Chaddha tries hard to put up a good show and delivers to a large extent but its Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi who remain completely natural and adorable in their respective parts with Shweta winning every heart in the theater in just a few scenes through her innocent looks and intelligent talks. As usual the talented Pankaj Tripathi makes his presence felt in a small cameo coming in the film's second hour. And not to forget the little 'diver' kid, who frankly comes up with the most moving sequence of the film while trying to win the big race for his old man.In all, MASAAN surely deserves to be seen as a must because of its unusual execution revolving around the burning ghats and all realistic characters emoting well on screen pointing towards our known social curses still continuing as it is from hundreds of years. Yet as a film specifically focusing on DEATH, I personally found it much less hard hitting, missing that instant emotional connect and 'cinematic power of transforming the viewer', to be honest.",

I love foreign thoughtfully crafted films as much as the next, but the problem with Masaan and plenty of foreign films of late Is that they get very praised, full stars, win much prises but its nothing special about them at all. And I just can't see why? Of course I haven't seen them all but The Salesman, leviathan, separation and the other Heavy hitters has left me with only feeling what a waste of hours spent. Its actually just kitchen sink dramas that really doesn't lead anywhere. i find them very boring and they all tend to play on some family tragedy and it gets very repetitive. In the wrong way also, I just cant relate to these characters. In the opening in this Movie a grad student wants to take suicide when the cops come bustig him for sex. Thats just profoundly stupid. sure, embarrassing for the kid but you brush it off. ANd it gets worse, then the female character doesn't say anything? its all your fault and press charges on the pigs for cops. In the salemsan we have this very stupid dialogue between the theater sessions. Its like who in the right mind act like that in reality? his wife was almost beaten to Death and he act like a swine throughout the entire Movie. The protagonist main characters just comes out as stereotypical. very stereotypical. Its often a poor family. and a father figure that in the end shoot down the baddies or just completely fall apart. thats it.",

The guy commits a suicide. She lives with her father and their life is turned upside down with a police officer asking a 3lakh bribe from his father to not put the video on YouTube. She quits her job as they blame her for death of the guy, and struggles to find new jobs. Her dad keen on her working for any sufficient pay so as to pay the bribe. Dad is ashamed of what the daughter has done. Devi is sad about how her right is being treated as her crime. What happened was not her fault. It was the guy who had committed suicide. And both of them consented to have sex. So why blame her? She goes on strongly about it, determined to move to Allahabad once she is done helping her father pay the bribe. She is still in love in with the guy, Piyush. She wants to talk to her family to tell them what had happened, as it is important for any parents to know what were the last conditions of their son still alive. It doesn't go well when she visits them in Allahabad. Her Dad is has struggles of his own. There is Jhonta, a little guy who he bets money on in the competition of which of the kids gets most money out of the river in few dives. He loses him and finds him. Deepak is from a lower caste family whose job is to burn dead bodies and help with rest at a ghat in Ganga. He falls in love with Shaalu Gupta. They both love each other. Until she dies in a road accident. They had talked of running away from home and getting married if their families don't accept it. His life is shattered from her death. She liked Shayri's. Tu Kisi Rail Si Gujarti Hai. Main Kisi Pool Sa Thartharata Hun. He dwells on them for a while. After having thrown her ring in the river and then violent but futile attempt to recover it, he decides to move on. He works hard and lands a job in Allahabad. Devi moves to Allhadbad too for her university course. After visiting Piyush's parents, which doesn't go very well, she decides to move own. Drowns the last gift from Piyush in Ganga and when Sobbing, Deepak approaches to console her. And that is how two stories connect. I can't actually place what the movie was about. It does portray the struggles of young India who wants to shatter the bounds placed by society on whether it is OK to have pre marital sex or if it is OK for a low cast and high cast boy and girl to be together. They try. They are happy momentarily. And then find their lives shattered. One due to society, but other just random chance. Both of them get over it and start a new life, leaving the old shackles behind.",

            "content": "Without a doubt, Masaan (Fly Away Solo) is one of the best movies of the current times. Neeraj Ghaywan is such a talented director that you will not be able to appreciate his talent until you watch each and every frame of Masaan. Whether it is screenplay, story or direction, this movie should set the example of what \"perfect\" can be. The story is so impactful that it stays with you for several days. The innocent love track between Deepak & Shaalu is simply superb. Portrayal of a helpless father by Sanjay Mishra is impeccable. Richa lives up the life of Devi like she is really living it everyday. Close to reality and real-life dialogues just sink inside your head like you are in the middle of everything. The breakout of Deepak with friends makes you cry with him to share his sorrow. Devi's visit to his boyfriend Piyush's silently displays her guilt trip and begging for forgiveness. In all, Masaan puts Neeraj at the top of the line directors - even he didn't do any commercial cinema yet, this proves that he has what most directors lack - the soul, the feel to bring what you see from your naked eyes into a frame and get the best out of his characters.Performance wise, Sanjay Mishra gives Oscar-worthy performance. Richa Chadha tells her story via her expressions..she plays Devi's character so well, she literally doesn't have many dialogues right after the beginning when the incident happens but she says it all via her body language & expressions. Pankaj Tripathy shines in a small yet very powerful role, oh boy, the dialogue delivery in local language is amazing. The hidden gems are Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi..you like them so much on screen that it becomes hard to digest that Shaalu dies in an accident..excellent job from the young talent.In my opinion, this movie should go to Oscars for the international category and I am very confident that it has the potential to win.I wish there were more avenues for directors like Neeraj, Anurag Kashyap to unconditionally fulfill their desires with no restrictions whatsoever, then you will really see the best cinema of the century.10/10.",

Here are are a few of my random thoughts about the film in case you are interested.Masaan is another film like Titli with all the dirty toilets and all. No just kidding.I guess urban middle class Indians are a lot more curious about rural India now. Middle class problems - like internet not working, can't find servant etc are not interesting scenarios for a movie, you would have to admit. The problems of these working class small town people are real. They are interesting. They have aspirations. They have created new ideas about themselves (stolen from Naipaul!) and their role in society.So it is a film about a bunch of small town people who are fed up of their small lives and are planning to move to greener pastures (like Allahabad).Masaan is a film with some amazing daylight photography. Some of the frames are so pretty. Despite the fact that the film takes place in a pretty dirty and run down place.The performances were respectable. Frankly, all the actors underplayed their roles to the point of fatigue.I wonder what the significance of the coin divers were. Are those kids who dive for the coins connected in anyway to the film's theme? What are they supposed to represent? Is there some sort of hidden meaning or something? The film was dull at times. I wasn't awed by it or anything.I would rate it a (6/10) Best Regards, Pimpin.",

            "content": "Indeed, the socio-political reality in Masaan is impossibly frustrating. Directed with heart by Neeraj Ghaywan, the film chronicles two separate accounts of two heartbroken souls and explores the most difficult themes at the heart of India's socially and culturally underdeveloped and often regressive areas, including class prejudice, poverty, misogyny, and systemic corruption. The last of these, as manifest in one of its stories through blatant police corruption, is enraging. The helplessness of simple citizens before a corrupt system and the inability to seek any guidance or justice against the most immoral of people as well as the narrow mentality of their own society, makes for a rather troubling watch.But not everything is this dark, as just in life, there's always a ray of hope and a way out. Life goes on, and this film shows it. Amidst the devastating reality that this film presents and its critical commentary on its many important issues, a true portrait of optimism, resilience and hope turns out right underway. And it emerges rather naturally through the strong sense of life that drives the film's wonderful characters, all of whom choose to move on and win. Masaan is beautifully shot, with even the most unpleasant places looking quite exotic. It is nowhere near a mainstream film but the realism blended in some wonderful romantic portions make for nice moments of relief.The acting is spot on, with Sanjay Mishra leading the cast with a heartfelt and touching performance. Richa Chadda is excellent in an understated performance; she smiles not once and wears a permanent frown on her face, but clearly holds in so much. Vicky Kaushal, though a little self-conscious at points, does exceedingly well in a movingly natural debut performance. His simplicity and everyman quality helps a lot, and indeed, his romantic scenes with the lovely and pretty Shweta Tripathi are quite cute. Masaan is not a film for everyone but many curious viewers might find an insight of a world far removed from their consciousness in this fine, heart-touching film.",

            "content": "Masaan in its English translation means crematorium, but the film, in its wider release, is named Fly Away Solo. This dichotomy of tone between the translations can be seen throughout the film and that is where Neeraj Ghaywan scored in his brilliant debut feature. The film is uplifting but heartbreaking, reflecting on both sorrow and hope and thus transcends to something that can be as refreshing as the morning air.In Masaan, the story, set in Banaras, is woven around two primary protagonists, Deepak(Vicky Kaushal) and Devi(Richa Chadda). One of them faces tragedy early in the film, and the other one sees its devastating form later. But, predictably, and here 'predictably' should not be taken in a negative way, both of their lives converge; one finding closure through struggle and another solace amidst loneliness.Masaan is not plot-driven, but character-driven; the like we see in Iranian and Romanian new wave films. It is not much of a story-telling than portrayal of life on screen. Life and the elements that control it; namely society, religion, family, love and death. This is where Masaan triumphs. It is hard yet poignant, heartbreaking and yet poetic; because life is all of those.Masaan dwindles on life and death like its name. Death is a prominent figure in the story and And it is not only two protagonists' eyes we see life at Banaras through; we see it through the eyes of Vidyadhar Pathak too. A guilt-ridden and simpleton father struggling to protect his daughter, Devi. Pathak's attempt to diminish the distance between him and his daughter is one of the key points of this film.Writer Varun Grover and Director Neeraj Ghaywan deserves all the accolades and plaudits they received in the film festival circuits. Masaan creates a flurry of small yet memorable characters in form of Jhonta, a boy working as apprentice in Pathak's shop, Sadhya Ji, Devi's colleague in Railway office and the antagonist Police Inspector Mishra. All of them were necessary elements that framed the picturesque story in Masaan.Vicky Kaushal and Richa Chadda led the performances by churning out superlative display. Kaushal's portrayal was simple and charming while being in love and effortlessly devastating in front of death. Chadda was subdued but strong, much like her character. However, it was veteran actor Sanjai Mishra who shone as Pathak. His nuances while Pathak was trying to remain strong in trying times were impeccable and bound to bring a tear or two when he broke down. Special mention for Pankaj Tripathi who played Sadhya Ji.Masaan is one of those films where everything clicks. If you praise writing, direction and performances of actors, you cannot simply leave the cinematography and music of the film. \"Tu Kisi Rail Si\u0085\" and \"Man Kasturi R\u0085\" would definitely strike a chord of melancholy in viewers.Masaan is a beautiful of piece of lives in a world you definitely would not want to miss from experiencing.",

Because such businesses in motel is illegal in India. But the motel owners have to give weekly fees to the local cops so that they do not interfere with their biz. Sometimes, when they fail to collect weekly fees for months together, they inform the cops about unconfident couples hiring room for an hour or so\u0085so that the cops can raid and extract money from the 'sex-making' couples!Unfortunately, this was one of those days when the cops barged in and the couples were caught in the act\u0085!

The cop went on extorting money shamelessly and the simpleton quietly collected the money for his only daughter\u0085.who hardly had any love or respect for her father.Simplicity is often shown as dumbness or ignorance in films.

An engineering student, whose father was a 'priest for the dead' \u2013 i.e. Dom in Hindi \u2013 whose work is to burn the bodies after death (considered as low caste in India), falls in love with a higher caste girl- Girl B.

They have grown up and they are inquisitive about sex and they can't wait till marriage\u0085\u0085accept this fact and be relieved from many a heart- breaks and shocks! Imagine the shock the Gupta family would have gone through \u2013 had they been alive and after the Pilgrimage tour \u2013 having taken the blessings of several idols of God..they would have come to know that their daughter wishes to marry a Dom's son! Nothing wrong in marrying him at all\u0085.but the entire family (esp. parents) would have gone into total shock\u0085..whereas in the film \u2013 only the boy got shocked and got over eventually.

To me it was a cinematic expression that had oscillations between romance and melodrama, yet truly realistic. An Indo French collaboration that earned much deserved accolades in Cannes ; brought alive the hypocrisy and human bigotry in an Indianized version. Three struggling tales that are inter wined to depict an array of emotional disparities attain confluence in the ripples of river Ganga. Deepak (Vicky Kaushal), a civil engineering student hailing from an out casted clan known as Doms , who perform the brutal skull crushing and burning rituals of pyres on the ghats of ever salvating Banaras. He is in love with upper caste Shalu (Shweta Tripathy). Parallel to this , Devi (Richa Chadda) who clandestinely met her boyfriend and they indulge in passionate sex in a hotel room. Bad luck, however came in the face of Inspector Mishra who seemed on a moral policing drive. In the haste, her boyfriend attempts to end his life, petrified at the thought of getting involved in a scandal. Mishra tells Devi that her life is doomed. With a disturbing start like this we go on to see that Devi lives with her father Vidyadhar Pathak (Sanjay Mishra), who was earlier into teaching and who now runs a small shop selling puja knick knacks on a ghat. Mishra demands hefty sum in order to relieve them from defame and shame. Taboos of morality, sexual exploitation and caste driven romantic bigotry is filmed out in a relatable fashion. Story and acting by this outrageous slice of cast happen to be the stellar pillars of the film. The story is of desiring bodies, dead bodies, burning bodies, gendered bodies embodied within the pathos rooted in orthodoxy. It's a question aloud about right to sexual liberty being intruded by law in a horrible fashion. Flames of young and subtle romance seeded by technology wherein we see Vicky and Shweta making an effervescent debut, effortlessly stupendous nail the emotional chords so aptly. Vicky soaked the character so earnestly and with an unquestionable ease. Script is a nest to emotions so crestfallen , anxious, rebellious, tender, churning and thoughtful. It's has something so simple, yet so powerful. For a maiden venture like Gaywan's Masaan , this script howls out that in this country where women routinely get raped a few kilometers away from police headquarters and they don't get any information until it is too late, but there itself two consenting adults cannot spend private time without the moral police harassing them in every way. Bodies are made tools of humiliation and torture; how effectively is being conveyed with this script. The city , symbolic of Indian roots, traditions, spirits, vedas and soul salvation is actually feeding in dearth of mental salvation. From the same pond rises the lotus which is level headed and unshaken by these atrocious and immoral practices, Devi; whose attitude remains unshaken and rock solid. Avinash's natural incorporation of lights have given a beautifying stroke to script and presentation. How naturally he has lensed out the lanes, ghats, waterways and eeriness of Banaras is simply exemplary. This parallel cinematic delight has a effect that has an uproar and serenity both\u0085 It can sensitize your follicles if at all you dare to delve deep.!!!",

            "content": "Just the opposite of the modern day dross and gloss, \"Masaan\" portrays the hardship of life in the edge of Ganges of Benaras (so called ghats), where everyday dead people are cremated. The story revolves around the people who make a living in this ghat burning the dead or making small business, and their hardship on making a decent living. The film presents the agony of the poor and the extent to which they need to struggle. The film presents two separate stories running parallel. The first one is of a father and a daughter, and the next one is of a student from the lower caste whose family makes a living out of burning the dead, who falls in love for a girl. Both the stories unite at the end.The film offers less characters and is away from the commercial gimmicks. Still the film is able to touch you and the extent to which people lose their dignity out of poverty just brings tears to your eyes. The film beautifully captures the ghats of Benaras reverberating the mortality of human life. Most of the cast are new with Sanjay Mishra, all bringing life to the film. Overall, the film is remarkable for its superb portrayal of the agony the poor people go through and the hardship they need to make to meet the ends.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",

This is what one reads about in the newspapers every now and then but how bad it really is, came home with that scene.Everything about this movie was realistic. How ordinary people from a traditional society deal with the situations and circumstances they are faced with, their emotions, their fears; everything is brought out so well and so poignantly. I cried my heart out a couple of times ...The plot is tinged with shades of O. Henry. The sets, the locations, the cinematography, I loved it all.Sanjay Mishra is the only known face here, all the other actors are relatively new to Bollywood yet they all performed so well.It is a shame that films such as Masaan do not get the box office drawings they truly deserve.Do watch Masaan, you will not be disappointed.",

It is felt a lot due to the build up to the accident. They are very cleverly shown as a very sweet and innocent couple, a couple who were quite early into their relationship.

While, the second one is totally a funny romantic story, starring Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi. It has very funny incidents. Everyone is laughing and blushing, too. Post interval, the story suddenly takes its path to sadness. The film ends not convincingly, but, it's up to us to think after the movie. The film is slightly boring in the post interval. Only cine-lovers can enjoy the whole craft sincerely. It's not the public movie, so don't go and spoil the mood of others if you are in public category. Indian Ocean's music is a major plus point. Man Kastoori is my most favorite. Background score is also good. Locations, costumes and sets are perfectly suitable to the story. Performances are very good. My personal favorite is none other than Sanjay Mishra. Outstanding performance as usual. Both the newcomers acted well.

            "content": "For years,Hindi cinema has projected Banaras as the quintessential town in our semi-urban milieu symbolizing purity, divinity and sacredness.Director Neeraj Ghaywan's Masaan,however, is a strikingly radical departure which examines four different lives - bruised and battered with setbacks, against the backdrop of the holy ghats of Ganges.Masaan becomes a metaphor for the emotional loss and upliftment, as it witnesses these ordinary people getting sucked into the vortex of tragedy and its implications.Devi(Richa Chaddha) gets caught red- handed with her boyfriend in a shady hotel room by the police which eventually leads to a mishap.His father(Sanjay Mishra), an ex- Sanksrit teacher, is blackmailed by a corrupt policeman who demands hefty bribe.Another parallel narrative follows a bright young diploma student , Deepak(Vicky Kaushal) from a low-caste corpse burners family who falls in love with an upper caste girl and sees a new lease of life until the unfortunate bereavement strikes him.Ghaywan gives us a shock right at the outset and allows that to be absorbed gradually with a gripping tale that's heart-breaking, sometimes disturbing and yet spiritually uplifting.Raising an elusive diatribe against the parochial mindset of our society and the fading morality of a father who resorts to cheap means to acquire funds for the bribe,he crafts a deeply believable world with authentic characters whom we would love to invest on.The story- telling adds grit and gumption to the plot and has a lyrical quality to it.Avinash Dhaware's astounding cinematography captures the myriad moods of the city and even the ashes and flames of the funeral pyre to convey the deep- rooted meanings of life and death.Powered with brilliant performances from Richa Chaddha,Sanjay Mishra and new find Vicky Kaushal, Masaan makes a lasting impression with its soul-stirring musical scores and more importantly Varun Grover's competent screenplay which so intricately weaves holy Ganga into the poignant narrative.Cast in relatively smaller roles, Pankaj Tripathi and Sweta Tripathy are immensely likable.Ironically, with a title that alludes to death , this film is a resurgence of new wave of meaningful cinema.Hats off to Phantom Productions for co-investing in it and bringing it on to the celluloid.A deep cerebral experience..Rating : 4/5",

            "content": "The beauty of this movie is that it is a tragedy and it is all too real. I read reviews from some of the western viewers who found the concept of police taking money unrealistic. Welcome to India where a girl having sex before marriage is considered worse than crime. Things are changing in India but they haven't all changed so it is real. There are some powerful performances from Richa Chadha (Devi), Sanjay Mishra (Devi's father), Vicky Kaushal (Deepak) and above all Shweta Tripathi (Shalu). I am going to start with Shalu. She is a college girl who loves poetry (Shayari) and falls for this boy who she doesn't know very well. She enjoys his physical touch and his company and that is portrayed so well by her. You could see her as that innocent girl next door. She only has a relatively small role in the movie but she does shine.Deepak is young boy who is from a poor family and he is about to complete his bachelors in civil engineering. He has a bright future in front of him but he does carry his family background as a baggage on his shoulders. He falls in love and deeply cares about this girl but he is not sure if he can get her even though she loves him dearly. He does lose her and he portrays the grief astoundingly. You feel bad when he is crying and that is hallmark of good acting. Vicky has that effortless way of selling his character.Devi is another character who you feel really bad about. She falls in love with a boy and decides to make love to her. This act is caught by police and the boy commits suicide and she is told that she has committed a crime. She is not so sure that she has done anything wrong but the society including her father thinks otherwise. She feels trapped and wants to break free but this is not easy in this male dominated society. You root for her and movie stops at the right juncture.Last character I was touched by was Mr. Pathak who is Devi's father. He is exploited by local authorities who are threatening to ruin his daughter. He knows that his daughter hasn't committed any crime but he finds himself too weak to really stand up for her. Instead he tries to cover for her the best he can. He loves his daughter but finds himself somewhat powerless and meekly gets exploited. Sanjay Mishra portrays the helplessness so well.Supporting characters besides the above four were also real. I watched this movie because its writer is Varun Grover who I have started to admire after watching some of his stand up routines. I do see this movie and say to myself that Hindi movies do indeed have a future. There is life beyond multi crore Khan movies. I highly recommend this movie if you don't mind a tragedy. It is not going to be a song and dance routine but is a real depiction of life in many circles.",

            "review_title": "Depth of hope and despair",
            "content": "'Masaan' - depth of despair and hope (Note: The review may contain spoilers)'Masaan', literally meaning crematorium, is an excellent movie dealing with India's tethering issues like caste system, religious beliefs, corruption and clash between traditional and modern generation grown on internet & smart phones. Many mainstream - and not so mainstream - films have touched upon these issues before but not as tenderly, but powerfully at the same time, as this one. On the backdrop of vibrant visuals of holy city of Varanasi, the film deals with the love & loss of it, exploitation, crumbling moral values, pathetic life of 'Doms' of Kashi's 'Ghats' and depicts the plight of modern youth in handling these issues and moving forward. In the end the film turns out to be both - a tragic melodrama as well as pleasing modern day youthful romance. It's somewhat like old black & white classics, but presented in modern, artistic and extremely realistic manner - and its director Neeraj Ghaywan succeeds in convincing the audience to take home whatever they like. Two - or more precisely two and half stories - run parallel to each other in the film. It starts off with the story of Devi (Richa Chadda) and her erotic sexual adventure that veers into a case of abatement for a suicide & sex scandal and goes on to show how she and her father, Vidyadhar Pathak (Sanjay Mishra) cope with the corrupt cops, social stigma and their own shattered life. The second one is a tender story of low caste college student, Deepak's (Vicky Kaushal) whose surreal romance with Shalu (Sweta Tiwari) takes off with a pleasant & typical small-town boy-meets-girl way but later wavers into a tragic episode. Then the third is a small time story is of teen-aged orphan boy, Jhonta (Nikhil Sahni). Vidyadhar Pathak engages him in a dangerous betting game of diving in holy Ganga and fetching coins to boost his own income compromising with his moral background. Shades of communal and social tension afloat, these three stories together squeeze out the emotions and pathos that completely draw you in and the feel of joy, sorrow and suffering of each character turns it into an unique movie experience. The film is very strong in practically all the departments. It's tight and poignant script by Varun Grovar, excellently supported by editor Nitin Baid, uniquely balances the situations of pleasure and pain throughout and keeps you glued to your seat till the very end. All the actors - most of them new comers, except experienced, Sanjay Mishra and to some extent Richa Chadda - have done a fantastic job. While Richa Chadda well balances her role, Vicky Kaushal agonizes you when he bursts into heart-breaking cry on the river bank. Sanjay Mishra, of course, is a very talented actor who, unfortunately, had been playing second-in-line roles in most of his films till now. Giving due respect, this film awards him almost a lead role and an opportunity displays his true mastery over the craft. Besides, all others in the cast, including the young boy, Nikhil Sahni and Sweta Tripathi, seem to be living their roles to the core. The casting director certainly deserves a special mention here. What should I say about Avinash Arun Dhaware's cinematography? It's simply fabulous! Capture of some of the scenes like raw beauty and intrinsic culture of Ghats of Kashi, sparks and burning flames of the funeral pyres, birds formations in the sky; blinking lights of two trains crossing on the bridge in the darkness of night and many other scenes are simply fantastic. And then, the films songs 'Tu Kisi Rail Si Guzarti Hai, Main Kisi Pull Sa Thartharata Hoon' as well as 'Mann Kasturi Re' sung by Swanand Kirkire will haunt you for months together. He, along with the poet, Dushyant Kumar & lyric writer, Varun Grover, and music composers, Bruno Caulias & Indian Ocean, deserve all the kudos.Only thing that bothered me was that lot of coincidences were fused in the last few minutes to tie up the loose ends and quickly wrap-up the movie. The film also reminded me of Nagesh Kuknoor's films '3 Diwarein' and 'Dor'. However, with the strong and poignant portrayal of the protagonist Devi, as a strong and uncompromising educated woman of modern India, this film should certainly find its place as one of the great woman oriented Indian movies of all times. As a debut, the film is truly a giant leap for director, Neeraj Ghaywan, who had till now been assisting renowned film director, Anurag Kashyap, in films like 'Gangs of Wassyepur' etc. The film-buffs can certainly expect many great films from him in the days to come. Also film certainly deserves the 'Un Certain Regard' award it had won at Cannes Film Fest. 2015 in France.",

            "content": "I'm afraid I can't quite get all the love for this screenplay. The acting's fine, as is the cinematography, but the storyline is to my (albeit western) eyes implausible to say the least!I get that as a female Devi is regarded as something of a liability to her father. I understand that the birth of a boy in an Indian family is regarded as a joyful & jubilant occasion of celebration, ant that of a girl as a time of shame & commiseration. Then there's the issue of bride-price to be considered in marriage arrangements, an sometimes ruinous financial imposition on a girl's family. Having fallen on hard times, perhaps Pathak senior might feel resentful for the consequences of his daughter's impropriety & indiscretion. Even in a society still obsessed with pre-marital 'purity' as that depicted. It would only be a crime under the oppressive Sharia laws of fundamentalist Muslim jurisdictions. Hindu mysticism, by contrast, celebrates sexual athleticism and prowess.Therein lies my problem: fornication is not a crime in contemporary India. Not even within the somewhat conservative lower castes in Varanasi/Benares. The entire 'setup' by the corrupt officials beggars belief. Firstly, that she is accused of prostitution, a crime easily refuted. and secondly that she is threatened with abetting the suicide of her young lover. It was the police presence that was the primary, and indeed sole, reason for the silly boy's actions. He would've taken HOURS to bleed out if unattended. Wrist cutting is a slow, relatively inefficient means of suicide, and the overwhelming majority of attempts simply get it 'wrong' anyway. The blood supply to the hands is relatively feeble and slow. Sever perhaps a femoral or carotid artery, or even the jugular and you will likely bleed out in a minute or two. But even if successful in severing the wrist's radial or ulnar arteries, which is in fact protected by a cluster of tough, resilient sinews, and about the worst that will happen if unattended for some minutes is the eventual loss of the hand (a few weeks later) by tissue necrosis!Why not tell the cops where to go in such a ham-fisted and amateurish attempt at blackmail? Yes, I realise the real, actual threat was to the family's reputation rather than that implied by the spurious charge of abetting suicide. But as the screenplay implied, her 'reputation' actually followed her into her subsequent employment anyway. Loss of face perhaps, but that's all. We all must pay the price for our youthful waywardness and indiscretions.",

            "review_title": "A Refreshing Product from Banal By-lanes of Bollywood",
            "content": "There is a perceptible drift among Indians towards Hollywood. I happen to have a friend who proudly claims of not seeing any Indian film for past many months! For me this is a value-neutral proposition. Cinematic preferences are among last things which reflect patriotism or even nationalism. Hollywood films like 'Star Wars', 'Spectre', 'Mission Impossible' and even many not-so-blockbuster films (eg. San Andreas) are doing well in small cities of Uttar Pradesh- the bastion of Hindi cinema. There are many reasons behind this. And as we are reviewing a Hindi film, I'll stick to the supply side- the Hindi film-making. Hindi films now a days can be broadly classified into two categories. (Yes, there are shades in between but let's keep it simple)1. Masala Movies- movies which rely on gullibility of hapless Indian viewers. These movies utilize 'superstars', gaudiness, clich\u00e9d stories and audience' indifference to lure viewers to cinema halls. Recent examples include 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo', 'Dilwale', 'Bajirao Mastani', 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan', 'Tamasha' etc. These all-singing-all- dancing-drama films provide full escapism. 2. A breed of movies made by newer generation of film-makers. This category includes the likes of Anuarg Kashyap, Tigmanshu Dhulia et al. But there is a problem with this category. These guys profess to tell original stories but they are very much influenced by famous Hollywood directors. For example, I couldn't help but draw similarities between Anurag Kashyap's 'Gangs of Wasseypur' and Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill'. Also this category of films unabashedly use violence and abuse as part of their narrative and this very feature alienates the middle class audience which is essentially conservative. Here Hollywood stories provides a sense of remoteness which psychologically preserves the Indian conservatism. Now, Masaan's ingenuity lies in blending the aforementioned categories. It blends individualism and libertine (Devi and Shaalu's characters) with conservatism (Devi's father and the general religious undertone). The best part is that it eschews unnecessary violence and slur. The film provides a touch of reality, a hint of escapism and ends on a trajectory which portends happy endings. That is why it clicks. I must say that 'Masaan' is indeed a refreshing product from otherwise banal 'Bollywood'.",

The direction of the movie is also very good.Its brilliantly written too,be it dialoges or story.It is the best movie of Phantom productions(after Queen and Gangs of Wasseypur).

But the story is told beautifully, the actors performed exceptionally well and its a wonderfully directed movie. Specially the director has done exceptional job. You wont be disappointed with this one. It touches you right in the feels. There have been some very good movies produced in Indian cinema off late, but this one sticks out.. Masaan will touch your soul and will you leave you with an understanding of the beauty of films. I really hope that Bollywood and its audience learn from this one.",

            "content": "Love and loss is a concept that is there in loads of Hindi films but this film can easily be the best of them. Fly away solo / Masaan is a independent film with four interlaced plots that talk about various themes - one about Devi and the predicament she falls in with her boy friend's suicide when police interrupts them during sex and the other about Deepak , whose ancestral occupation is corpse burning , falls in love with a high caste girl Shaalu in college without revealing his identity. The rest two is about Devi's father who cripples between his love for Devi and corruption and a child's yearning for family and life. There is a scene in the film where Devi is rudely questioned by her boss in front of few people and she replies saying \"Jo Bhi Kiya Hum Do Ne Milke Kiya\" and he says \"Par Mara To Vo Akela\". This is a small example of all the beautiful writing in the film that is simple, pale and melancholy on the top but deep down has a lot to ponder on.Other than LOVE the film also talks about other themes ranging from the society's perspective on sex, corruption, coming out of the ancestral occupations , men and women aspiring for a better life, caste issues as a barrier for love, toll that death takes on a person and the preciousness of life.In an industry that's synonymous to gloss and glamor, Masaan is an eye opener. The film is set in Banaras and believe me the place is also a character in the film. The film does have its weak points. It's pacing is very slow and depressing but you hook to the film with those magnetic performances from actors and the simplicity in writing. The costumes, the subtle background score, the locations, settings, lingo and cinematography all cater towards making the film so close to real life circumstances that tears roll down right when the screens roll down. A special credit to Vicky Kaushal who plays Deepak, with his jaw dropping performances brings life to his character. Sad that Filmfare had to follow nepotism and give the best debut to someone else.This might not be a film which you can watch on a good weekend but it surely is a film that after watching will linger in your mind for a long time as it did for me.",

None of it felt fake, the performances felt very real, so real that I rooted for the characters and wanted them to make it out of their ordeal.Richa Chaddha and Sanjay Mishra were insanely good. Vicky Kaushal and Shweta Tripathi also gave amazing performances and made a solid mark in their debut feature film.The backdrop of Benaras has its own character in the movie. They way its shot and how the story progresses, somehow it appeared as if the movie wouldn't have been this good without the city.Finally, the direction of Neeraj Ghaywan is outstanding and I hope to see more quality cinema such as this from him in the future.Final Verdict: 8.5/10 Another gem of Indian cinema of 2015, with brilliant and raw performances. It would be a crime to ignore it. There is a moderately graphic sex scene in the beginning, otherwise it can be seen with family.",

            "content": "It's a movie where the narration is the story composed of actors as the words. When the words are chosen accurately, the story becomes beautiful.**Achtung: Spoilers Ahead**The death is the end of all emotions. Something, which lacks emotions can never be explained in humane terms. It discomforts to deal with death, and the death means a closure for the dead; for the alive ones, everything else keeps on moving.There lies the gist of masaan.Whether the Sanskrit teacher using a kid to gamble, so that he can pay to the blackmailer a sum of money, or the final year polytechnic student, who ends up burning the pyre of his beloved, they all have to live, even when living gets tough. The internal conflict to let go of the dead ones is like the flying sparks of the flame, rising, and burning and then finally, going away, or like the water in the Ganges, which deposits the silt it has been carrying from past journey, only to get sober in the way, and vast on the ghats of Allahabad, where it meets Yamuna. The director brings this up again and again, even in the song \"tu rail si\", which compares the girl to the train and the boy to the bridge, and though the train sends vibes across the bridge, the train eventually has to pass, while the bridge continues to remain there, and many times, in the scene beyond, where a bridge is shown. Or when the boy throws the ring of his beloved into the river, only to realise he has let go the last of her, and frantically diving in it, just not to find it.Like the girl who was smitten by Shayari of ghalib, it's a movie which is a canto of narration, with the pauses and nuances being the frames, the bridge and the river, which flows only one way.",

It is unfortunately not a one off either as RC was equally terrible in conveying any inner life in another of her movies that I recently watched, Section 375, which again, on other merits, was a fine movie.Too bad, because as a simple allegorical tale with many deftly portrayed elements (regressive social norms relating to sexual freedom, caste, administrative corruption, etc.), shot well with strong performances from the rest of the cast, this could have been a great movie.",

Unlike many of other Indian products in movie sector, Masaan contains drama and it does not try to make it seem better than it is. The places where events happen were not subjected to other Bollywood movies. This movie won't make you feel happy, cheerful, or will not try to convince you that everything will be alright in the end. It will just show you a section of life in India's low classes. It criticizes the common bribery in constabulary of India, also challenges the society's hypocrisy about morals. It gives some hints about the ongoing cast system in India. At the final scene, we see that all these events happened around (and in) Gannes River, which is considered as holy and sacred by Indians. Some coincidences in the movie (such as Shaluu's ring that Jhonta found in Gannes, or the meeting of Devi and Deepak) are not disturbing the audience's perception of reality. Very irrelevant but interesting fact about this movie: Richa Chadda (Devi) resembles Turkish actress Nehir Erdo\u011fan in this movie.",
