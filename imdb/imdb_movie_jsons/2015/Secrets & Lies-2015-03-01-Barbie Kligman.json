            "content": "This is a 10-episode mini series about a fictional crime in North Carolina, USA. It is a remake of an Australian series. A married man with 2 daughters (played by Ryan Phillippe) finds the body of a young boy, the son of his neighbor across the street (played by Natalie Martinez) while jogging. He becomes the main suspect for the Police (Detective Cornell is played by Juliette Lewis) and his community.The series is made to build up tension in every episode. The spotlight of who is the killer changes constantly as more clues are coming to surface.The direction of photography and direction create a haunted atmosphere, but this isn't a supernatural thriller. It's all about the human nature. Emotions, blame, jealousy...The acting is OK. You get to see Juliette Lewis with her hair up and a Philip Marlow raincoat playing a relentless homicide detective who won't stop until the killer ends up behind bars.10 episodes are too much (the Australian series had 6) but in my opinion if you have the time to invest, check it out.",

            "content": "The pilot started in a good way ,, The plot is catchy ,, irritating .the storyline is flowing perfectly .. the Detective is so pushy and uptight in an amazing way ,, that you gotta hate her so much :DI never really watched closely in the media at what happen in real cases like these (child murder ) but here in a way you start to create affections for the supposedly suspects and how the Media is dealing with them just to make it to a front page in some paper.I believe the whole idea was picked up by the Australian version of the show which ended last summer. it also got a huge compliments last year with high rating.The cast is fresh,, you won't easily connect or confuse them to any previous roles ,,Ryan Phillippe and Juliette Lewis did a good job ;)The ending of the episode is genius, so you'll definitely want to see what's gonna happen in the next episode.I also watched the second episode just now and again they leave you with a breathtaking ending just to keep you tied up to the series ;) !!____________________ Update ___________________________The series went really good,as expected, the finale and more specifically the finale couple of scenes were dark and a surprise for a guy who watched the original series , opened the gate for a second season,, Aaaaaaand they renewed._______________________________________________________",

After a failed attempt to resuscitate the boy (presumably leaving his DNA there) the police question him over the circumstances.This is a remake of an Australian series of the same name except this one has been lengthened from six hours to ten hours. This series is different to your standard whodunnits insofar as it concentrates on the stress levels of the suspect and his family as the police appear to have hung out to dry with the local news media. The local residents appear to suspect the jogger as well. One can feel a certain sympathy for the suspect as he is tried by the media. Whether or not he did it remains to be seen.My big problem with this is that it could be done in 4 hours. I have no doubt I will be thoroughly bored by the end and only be watching to see who it was.Be prepared for plenty of 'filler' episodes.",

The story was pretty terrible from the start, everyone in it looked like a model so seemed completely unrealistic, the detective would turn up and ask 1 question then go again wasting countless hours in travelling, I believe the house got searched twice by supposedly professional police forensic teams and they failed to find a load of money stashed in a loft and blood soaked trainers in a vent underneath the house even though the vent was half out! The last and most ridiculous part is Ben's sacrifice saying he was the murderer as having told at least 3 other people and the Detective knowing he was making it up there is now way in this world that the Prosecutor would have taken it to court as he would have been sued for millions if the truth then came out. I wont bother with series 2 thanks, I was so disappointed as hoped this would be another quality crime drama like True Detective, Southland, The Wire or Homicide - Life on the Street.",

It was all an act. Knowing that should've been rewarding. Again, meh.A couple of the actors worked with what they had to work with. Others could've phoned in their performances...to Telemundo. Over-the-top for no reason at all.I've really enjoyed Juliette Lewis in other projects, and I respect her willingness to stretch her acting muscle.

Juliette Lewis' character is so one dimensional and over the top, it's just as I said, unpleasant to watch. It becomes difficult to even look at her. If they developed her character a little, gave her even one redeeming character trait, maybe I would watch the rest of the show, but every time she is on camera I want to avert my eyes. Just don't bother with this one. There are so many better shows out there. I don't understand why we are forced to type 10 lines of text. There's nothing more to as but, if you ever want to echo anything with Juliette Lewis in it ever again, avoid Secrets and Lies.",

            "review_title": "Very involving, entertaining summer series!",
            "content": "I think that SECRETS AND LIES (2015-?) had very low expectations going in. I certainly wasn't sure about it. Thankfully, my reservations were alleviated almost immediately! Ironically, my main reservation going into ended up being completely unfounded and that was the casting of Ryan Phillippe in the lead, central role of Ben Crawford. Never one of my favorite actors, I was pleasantly surprised at Phillippe's exceptional, gripping performance in Season 1 of this series! I dare say that it was Phillipe's persuasive portrayal of Ben that kept me tuning in each week.In counter to Phillippe, I was ironically not as engaged by Juliette Lewis as Det. Andrea Cornell, at least not until the end of Season 1 when she was less one-dimensional and the writers gave shades of humanity to her character. In retrospect Lewis was really playing a cold, relentless, emotionless person, and she certainly pulled it off. My only issue was that why for so long into the season did she think that Ben was the ONLY reasonable suspect! 'Secrets and Lies' tells the tale of Ben Crawford (a superb Phillippe), who is the prime suspect in the murder of 5-year old Tom Murphy, the son of Ben's neighbor Jess Murphy (alluring Natalie Martinez). In the opening scene of the series, Ben finds Tom's dead body in the woods during his morning run. Immediately contacting the police, the lead detective on the case is Det. Andrea Cornell (an incredibly stoic Lewis). Cornell pretty much sizes Ben up within minutes and figures him for the killer. Most of the series involves Ben trying to clear his name to counter Cornell continuing to gather mounting evidence against him.Other key characters include Ben's wife Christy (excellently played by Kadee Strickland), Ben's 2 daughters Natalie and Abby (very well played by Indiana Evans and Belle Shouse), and Ben's best friend Dave (played in scene-stealing comic fashion by Dan Fogler). It's really Ben's part of the story that kept me engaged, especially his tumultuous relationship with Christy and his funny BFF relationship with Dave. Also Ben's relationships with his respective daughters was involving, with the older Natalie being more rebellious and the younger Abby clinging to Ben as \"Daddy's little girl\". Each episode involved Ben, who has no memory of the events of the night of the murder, trying to piece together clues that could simultaneously jog his memory and clear him of Tom's murder. Subplots involve the various neighbors of Ben, including Jess, all who have their own \"secrets and lies\" and how they could be suspects since they all live in the same neighborhood as Ben. Juliette Lewis' contribution shouldn't go ignored either. Like I said, I just wish we had more shades of her character earlier rather than later, but when the writers really dug into her character's past, that's when I think Cornell became very interesting. And it looks like Season 2 will focus more on Cornell and her personal life, which I'm definitely looking forward to! Again, Phillippe's performance is the real surprise in all of this. He really made me root for Ben and hope that he wasn't the killer in the end. He did a great job of carrying Season 1. This is easily my favorite thing he's ever done and, in my opinion, the best performance of his career. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "This show is entirely wrapped around the chief suspect in the murder of a little boy, that is Ben Garner, played by Ryan Phillippe. We follow him from the moment he discovers the body of a murdered neighbor boy during an early morning run, and through the ins and outs of the investigations. I say investigations because there is the one the police conduct (lead by a stoical woman homicide police detective played by Juliette Lewis in a surprising casting choice) and the other that Ben feels driven to conduct himself.Ben watches as the constant media attention not only starts to destroy his life but also threatens his family, particularly the well being of his two young daughters. From the beginning, secrets are revealed, all of them damning in one respect or another. Ben's own first reveal not only sets him back but rattles his already shaky marriage.We watch as Ben becomes a bit maniacal in his attempts to get ahead of the police and to protect his family. We have very little for us to go on to show us the progress or reasoning of the police. That make this series the opposite of a procedural, as well as a murder mystery with a highly emotionally invested central figure. I find that refreshing, but also a little exhausting. However, it's nice to feel so involved in what is happening on the screen.None of the above would work if not for the quality of the acting which is very well done. That's the glue that holds this whole roller coaster ride together. There are times you will find yourself yelling at the screen, \"What are you doing?!?\" Under the pressure of a trial in the court of public opinion and for the ultimate well being of his family, Ben doesn't always make the best decisions. But we do see what is driving him and ultimately it's too late to pretend disinterest. You find yourself very much wanting to see what happens next and how this all comes out in the end. Because at the end of the 10 episodes, we will know who killed that poor child as well as all the dark secrets the neighborhood has been harboring.Addendum: We are 1/2 way through the series at this point and the drama and heightened emotions have stayed strong. This is an entertaining well done television show.",

            "review_title": "the current season: a huge descent into embarrassing melodrama",
            "content": "The original Secrets & Lies was a fine Australian production. The story was gripping, the writing very good and the performances top notch. Then an American version was produced: same story, almost the same script but nowhere near as polished as the original. Ryan Philippe is not a strong presence and Juliette Lewis's version of the unsympathetic and aggressively prosecutorial detective was distractingly overdone. We don't know whether she was overdirected or whether she overacted on her own, but the result was misconceived. It is to Lewis's credit that in spite of h her exaggerated performance one could discern an actor with considerable thespian chops. (I'd add that the inspector in the original Australian production was a pleasure to watch. He exhibited a restrained, polished and almost elegantly dogged skeptical persistence. The actor was the kind of pro that is hard to find in American television.)The current season presents a new story whose outline I won't rehash here. What stands out is the embarrassing mediocrity of the writing and the cringe-worthy melodramatic acting. The whole thing looks like a parody of a Lifetime movie. Lingering shots of pained faces and corny music telling you -no, ordering you- to feel what you're supposed to feel. This dreadful show cannot be laid entirely at the feet of the actors. Jordana Brewster is indeed a community theater performer. But Michael Ealy, who turned in an outstanding performance in his appearances on The Good Wife, reverts to Lifetime acting here. The fault clearly lies with the writing and the directors. And Juliette Lewis once again grossly overdoes the hard-ass detective. The episodes are drawn out and the whole thing is as boring as a bag of hair. A crashing disappointment.",

            "content": "Ben Crawford (Ryan Phillippe) finds a dead kid during his run in the neighborhood. He seems to have the picture perfect family with wife (KaDee Strickland) and two beautiful daughters. His best friend neighbor Dave Lindsey (Dan Fogler) is somewhat an idiot. However, he's hiding secrets including an old affair with Jess Murphy (Natalie Martinez). Police detective Andrea Cornell (Juliette Lewis) investigates. In the second season, Kate Warner (Jordana Brewster) falls to her death from the rooftop during a party. Eric (Michael Ealy) is her loving husband but secrets are uncovered. Once again, Andrea Cornell is investigating.It's a very odd way to play the anthology game. The connective tissue from season to season seems to be Juliette Lewis but she's my least favorite thing on the show. She's trying too hard to be the hard-nosed detective. It's almost a caricature with her pulled back hair and strict attire with just enough buttons unbuttoned. She interviews everybody like a suspect and they know it. It immediately puts everybody's back up and anybody with a brain would shut the hell up.One of the annoying thing about the first season is that Ben Crawford would not shut up. The good thing about him is the back and forth between guilt and innocent. Ryan Phillippe can play both sides and sometimes at the same time. The secrets and lies are good. It feels like emotional blackmail at times but the twists are compelling. The second season follows Michael Ealy but he's playing it much more like he's innocent. It doesn't have quite the back and forth although anyone around him could be guilty. Again, Juliette Lewis is my least favorite thing about this show.",

So im not usually to quick to jump to conclusions, I'm all about knowing the facts. Detective suspects him based off of no real evidence just going by what she assumes. You see the effects it takes on Ben husband/suspect and his life at home and work etc. The story is great, lots of secrets, very intense, keeps you wanting more. The acting is amazing, Ryan Phillipe does an awesome job! You feel for him even tho your not sure if he's innocent or guilty.

I know good stories don't reveal themselves early, and you're in for a roller coaster ride full of surprises. However, the story itself needs to be interesting, realistic, and enough questionable cues should be revealed to keep you intrigued. For this story, none of that happened. If the writers intended for Ben Crawford to be the killer, then they're doing a darn good job of not showing any cues of his being guilty. He's portrayed to be an absolutely innocent man who is harassed constantly by this unprofessional cop who has nothing better to do than pinning the murder on him. She has no credible evidence, shows no intelligence in her investigative methodology, and personally I find her demeanor annoying.In summary, the story is boring with no interesting elements, the dialogues are mediocre, the pace is slow, and the characters are awfully uninteresting.",

It had a phenomenal script and an even better cast which you really felt for and cared about.In this crappy remake Juliette lewis is beyond awful! That woman cannot act! Ryan Phillipe is OK but doesn't come across as a man that loves his family- there is absolutely no chemistry between him and the kids or his wife. It's like they just got a group of random people together and made hem live under one roof rather than spending the time to find actors who will appear as a family! One of the great things about the Australian version was the pace of the show, things unravelled in a natural way and it felt like we were watching a real life story unfold within the press and within the family. Cut to: American version... It's soooo rushed and forced! It's like they're trying to make you like the characters but they give no background or depth to them in the slightest! I honestly believe if they HAD to remake this show (which I really don't believe they should have) then the Brits would have done a far better job at adapting it yet keeping it as true to the original as possible so it wouldn't tarnish it!

            "content": "(Review based on watching the whole of season 1)Over-long, over-plotted and over-elaborate, \"Secrets and Lies\" is a series that could have benefitted from pruning - a lot of pruning. Buried deep inside the katzenjammer there are a number of valid observations and valid moral points, such as the fact that adults should control their words and actions carefully, from fear of harming children either directly or indirectly. However, these points are hidden inside a large mass of - no, let me rephrase that, inside a large mess of plot twists, revelations, clues, non sequiturs, red herrings, and so on. \"Secrets and lies\" is also notable for its lack of subtlety and nuance. This lack extends to various aspects, such as characters and performances. For instance, there is a female detective who spends most of her time being bitter, grumpy and joyless to the point of caricature. In real life, of course, even the most dour or determined of persons would crack a joke or hum along to a song. I was also surprised by the speed with which the male protagonist became both a prime suspect and a public bugbear. The man finds a child's corpse and before you can say \"What a tragic discovery\" he is discussed, reviled, hounded, oppressed and persecuted, complete with a Greek chorus of newscasters and reporters so extensive that it must represent 90% of American media professionals. Yes, yes, the media can be callous and rash, we get it.I gather that this is an American remake of an earlier Australian series. If so, then it's logical to suppose that the original series was better - it's certainly difficult to imagine it being worse.",

A shame, I was looking forward to seeing Michael Ealy, the one season wonder, again.In season 1 there was palpable tension between the lead suspect and the lead investigator, to the point you weren't sure which was the bad guy. The tension in the community, the actions of the media, the dubious motives of others surrounding the main suspect created a genuine tension right to the very end.Season 2 is sensationalist, lacks any genuine tension and revolves around soap-opera style revelations. After 7 episodes I don't think I really care anymore who the murder is.",

Who would viciously murder a 5 year old child? It's an unthinkable act. But as you pass the halfway mark, it goes off the rails with the number of double lives being led. I was promised a mystery/thriller and got thrown headlong into a disguised soap opera instead. The finale on its surface seems mayyyybe conceivable but if you think about it for more than 5 seconds you realize no, no, this makes zero sense because that decision, given the evidence, has instead doomed a deeply troubled mind to never get help and definitely murder someone else. All relatives of this disturbed individual would have concluded that independently given time.Season Two was bleh, simultaneously boring and melodramatic. Didn't get through the third episode before writing this and bailing. The new lead is a fine actor but that script is awful.",

I'm not sure why Americans find torture and violence OK for kids but sex seems to be limited to almost Victorian standards of restriction.Nevertheless, ABC have overcome these hindrances with remarkable skill and produced a gripping drama.Juliette Lewis (who seems to be in everything in one form or another) has signed on for the second season, but as yet nobody else has. Maybe this will turn in to her show. I hope so.",

The wife, the whole show could have happened without the wife. They went from hating each other to let's have New Years dinner together!

During the pilot, she always has that \"deer in the headlight\" kind of look. I wish the best of luck to the director because he probably had to take so many breaks because of her performance. Many actors study for their role. In some cases, even fill in the role (i.e. Jaime Foxx hung out with Ray Charles for some time prior to filming). Another good example are the many actors whom play WWII soldiers that they often spend many hours with or interviewing the veteran. I think Juliette Lewis watched TV to do her studying of (attempting to) act as a detective. She just needs to stick with what she's good at....playing the damsel in distress.",

If you like a twisting turning story-line that leaves you having to watch more, then you will not be disappointed. I have seen all 4 episodes so far and can't wait until next week for more. This show is definitely trying to keep up with the premium channel's series, and do it in a manner so you can watch it with your teen without a bunch of over the top sex scenes or unnecessary language. Now don't get me wrong, I loved The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, True Detective, and others. But I had to watch them alone for fear of what might be said or shown in front of my daughter.

I'll try to get through the rest of the season, but every time a new episode pops up, I don't feel in any way compelled to view it immediately, and when I do get around to watching, it feels like a chore.

Also, perhaps forgotten, the gorgeous Indiana Evans shows great talent. She plays the snarky daughter with skill. She knows how to take advantage of her full lips to give this pouting look that defines her character. Also she pulls of the American accent fairly well as an Australian. What I really like is how Phillippe though does not try to hard and come off as a caricature of the falsely accused. He had it just right. Some things may be a bit overdone on the show as a whole, but that's the nature of TV dramas. Sort of like the Olivia Pope thing. Good show.
