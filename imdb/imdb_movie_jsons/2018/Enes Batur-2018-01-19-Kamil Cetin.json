            "content": "To be honest, it doesn't deserve either 1 or 10. He is the most popular youtuber in Turkey and he has lots of fan in Turkey. I rated \"1\" because 6 is too much for this movie and i think all of his fans rated 10 so this movie's average puan is so high for that movie. In addition, this movie's scene transition is so bad.. it is like a YouTube video or smth.. not professional and i think we can not categorize that like it is real movie. It has a lot of imperfect scene, casts (except 2-3 of them) was not acting very well. I don't suggest that movie unless you want to lose your times.",

Real people can only describe a human life in such a clich\u00e9 fiction using characters. Actors were awful in the movie, so I didn't expect acting. I watched the film without prejudice, but I became a cringe.\nThe film didn't have much comedy. It has been edited with fiction that has similar films everywhere and it has been really distant.\nIt would be better for everyone to tell the truth. The film has nowhere to be commended. Failed and clich\u00e9.",

            "content": "While reviewing this movie the first thing to consider is \"Should this movie be considered as a long enough youtube video while reviewing it or should i review it as it is a movie?\". If it is first option, it is a profitable and enjoyable youtube content. But since this is a review on IMDb we shall consider it as a movie so it sucks. First thing to mention is cast which is full of famous or almost-famous 'youtubers'. Those guys or girls are not actresses or actors they should just continue to produce entertaining and enjoyable content for youtube. This situation that they have put themselves into is something like \"I can ride a bike well , so why not i ride a motorbike ?\". This is a logic that nobody should believe or follow. I won't even mention the actings of those i have been talking about. Maybe story can be somehow inspiring, but it can only inspire under 10 years old kids who can be inspired by almost anything at that age.",

He proved himself to be an unneeded youtuber once more with this waste-of-time movie. This kind of counterproductive work should have been prevented right at the very beginning before it misled the young individuals.",

I'm not sure if this movie really took time, with this poor quality. Oh and, the creator himself is actually trying to make this movie look good by calling out his fans. Smh.",

I can say that this is the worst movie ever, just throwing your money away. Wakaliwood Productions made much better movie with just 200 dollars.",

The script is atrocious and it written by a 19 years old high school graduate youtuber. Enes Batur is no actor and having a starring role magnifies those deficiencies in his acting ability. I'm sure Enes Batur's little kid fans loved this thing but the problem with the film is that is incredibly boring and silly for adults. There really isn't any artistic integrity within the film and this is probably one of the worst Turkish movie ever made. The film was so bad in fact it spawned one of my favourite Roger Ebert quotes. \"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels. Atrocious.\"",

Actors are the worst part of the movie! They are so bad! And they are not even actors they are just youtubers! And this movie made a good box office so that means we are going to see more youtuber videos! Turkish cinema is death because if anything gets popular they make movies about that! This movie is a low budget movie! And when i went to theathers there were only kids like age 5 with parents and only kids were laughing to the movie! I only smiled like 2 times so this is a waste of time dont watch this movie!",
