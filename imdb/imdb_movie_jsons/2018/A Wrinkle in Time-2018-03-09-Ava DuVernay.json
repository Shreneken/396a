I haven't read the books, I have no idea what the story was supposed to be, but even so I knew there was something deeply utterly wrong with it. It really felt like the hallucinations of a drugged person trying to make sense of the story behind and failing miserably. It was so bad that I suspected sabotage. Is it that someone intentionally didn't want it to be any good? I know I should attribute to malice what can easily be explained by stupidity, but in this case, it is far from easy.The only reason I rated it three stars (towards the funny end of the spectrum) is because of its inadvertent humor, best appreciated while drunk or stoned or part of Myst3k. So many scenes seem to hint to other materials: Star Trek, Dr. Who, Neverending Story. Or maybe it was just me trying to make sense of something completely random. A good description for this movie: white noise. A better one: pretty colored noise.",

            "content": "By the time \"Wrinkle\" reached its climactic scenes, where the stakes are highest and the resolution hangs in the balance, it carried so much forward momentum that I had to keep waking myself up so I wouldn't snore and bother the other theater patrons. Yeah...it was like that. Look, I'll admit: I've never read the book (shame on me, I guess, as a lifelong lover of SF and general metaphysical weirdness), so I can't judge \nDuVernay's \"A Wrinkle In Time\" as an adaptation of L'Engle's literary favorite. But I CAN measure it as a film that wants to tell a story, and on that scale...um......Uy. Never is there a real sense of conflict with which to engage: the tone and mood are so lovey-dovey, from stem to stern, that the film never feels like it's progressing in any meaningful way. The galaxy-gobbling threat doesn't, and isn't. Good performers are wasted on one-note characters (be they whimsical space-nymphs or oh-so-precious baby geniuses) in puzzling costumes and -- were those hairdos? I think they were hairdos. I mean, they were where hair is supposed to be. Expensive FX fill the screen in service to a plot that *drifts* through its paces instead of *advancing*. If there was variance in the musical score, I missed it (but I think I didn't, because I think there wasn't). Michael Pe\u00f1a is asked to leave his \"Ant-Man\" charm at home and put on a goofy mustache and some red contacts for like a few minutes, and Captain Kirk (the new one, anyway) has a beard and is interesting, but doesn't really do anything and OPE what nope I'm awake not snoring sorry no.This is going to be someone's favorite movie, and that's a beautiful thing; art needn't be categorically *good* to be *effective*, after all, and I love the hell out of \"Xanadu\", so I should know. But a film that wants to tell a story should be equipped to tell a story, and if it can't do that, then...it's doing something else, I dunno, I'm.........huh? No, no, I was just...just resting my eyes. It's nice, maybe you should do the same.",

            "content": "Wow. Something went wrong here. For a movie with the backing of Disney and all the resources that they poses, they must have turned a blind eye to this film, or they must have tried to manipulate and control it super tightly. This movie shocked me with how bad it was, and how Disney would release a movie this bad. They don't do it often.\n From start to finish, this movie is disorderly, and confusing. Maybe because I didn't read the book, but I shouldn't have to read the book in order to enjoy the movie. The actors all seemed to lack chemistry and understanding of the role. The three children just couldn't carry the plot along. It was a disaster around every corner.\n A Wrinkle in Time could easily be turned into a rated R film in my opinion, the one thing holding it back was the fact that it was kids and Disney. But had this been Tim Burton like Alice in Wonderland, well it would have been better directed, but it would have set in on a specific style and flow. A Wrinkle in Time never really planted its feet into a specific feel. It seemed to take itself super seriously, but what was happening on screen didn't match up. The score really didn't help. The movie was scored as a dramatic, serious, epic, however, on screen it was kids running around to \"save the world\".\nThe effects were beyond cheesy. I countlessly had flashbacks to the fantastic hit \"Spy Kids 3: Game Over\" and its partner \"Shark Boy and Lava Girl\". In all regards, this movie could rival those movies on the Disney Channel, but this one is too messed up and twisted for kids to even enjoy it. They managed to make a movie that both adults and children could dislike. Disney seems to achieve first still today.",

There's some beautiful imagery here, but then there's also too much green screen and CGI going on that it just loses it's luster. What is the deal with this director also? There were probably 70+ shots inches away from each actors face. It didn't look pretty and was extremely distracting to me. Somehow this director had all of these great actors and couldn't even get anything out of the majority of them. Chris Pine was about the only person that did a good job here.

Worse is that the dialogue, character development, the overuse of CGI and the convoluted plot is making it a major disappointment of 2018. Even the acting is not good with one that goes unnatural like Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis while Reese Witherspoon's and Deric McCabe's acting goes over the top and very annoying and even Oprah Winfrey comes as total bland and boring.The only redeeming qualities is that film contains empowering messages as well a great statement to diversity and feminism as well the performances of Storm Reid, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Chris Pine which are the only saving graces. A Wrinkle in Time should have been the next Wonder Woman. It's a big shame that all of the great intentions were given a waste of time, effort and talent.Lastly, it is clear that the adaptations of sci-fi genre cannot work for Disney as demonstrated in the previous sci-fi adaptations that failed before such as Tomorrowland, Tron: Legacy, and John Carter.",

The astral travel in A Wrinkle in Time is where teen Meg (Storm Reid) must go through a portal to find her scientist father. He's been gone for 4 years, having discovered that portal as physicist and entered it, foolish dad to abandon family just to go where no man has ever gone before.Unfortunately, Meg's coming of age as she travels with wunderkind little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), and high school chum Calvin (Leo lookalike Levi Miller), never involves defining challenges but rather just murky CGI and an evil force straight out of Arrival's Rorschach alien. While we hear about her need to have more confidence and be more aggressive, when she finally achieves those, the film is almost over, and the transforming beats are not obvious anyway.\nEven the \"Which's\" interstellar guides, play by Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, are unimpressive personalities with equally unimpressive costumes. While they might be a cross between the benign Glinda of Oz and the three witches of Shakespeare on Prozac, they are not seminal to Meg's development or the plot's.I can advise Oprah to slink back to her kingdom and Pine to go back to his starship. As for you, audience, I advise you to avoid this clunker and see The Shape of Water. No, that's not kids' stuff, but maybe that's all for the good.

However, I also kept saying \"I hope Disney doesn't screw this up again,\" after the travesty TV version they made in the early 2000s.Lo and behold, they managed to screw it up again.Let's start with the few bright spots (and calling them bright spots is even generous). First, I did enjoy the visual depiction of the tesseract. Also, the casting was pretty good. Storm Reid was well cast as Meg, and Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which were also portrayed well, despite that they drastically downplayed Mrs. Which's character.Now, the bad (and there is a lot of bad). Mrs. Whatsit was changed into a completely negative character who seemed completely inept and pessimistic. Important points in the book (Ixiel and Aunt Beast, for example) were completely ignored and given only cursory mentions so fleeting that you barely even notice it.\nThe Man with Red Eyes is turned into marionette who literally collapses on screen. I get that in the novel he was a \"puppet\" of IT, but the depiction in the movie was laughable.\nThe ridiculous storm scene when they first arrive on Camazotz came out of nowhere and was so ridiculously portrayed. First, they're struggling to find Charles Wallace, then they go through this ridiculous storm sequence, and when they make it over this wall (which again, was nowhere in the source material), that concern for Charles Wallace is completely gone until he pops out of nowhere saying \"here I am.\" And are Meg and Calvin relieved to see him? Nope. It's more like \"meh, okay.\"\nThe movie completely left out how Calvin and Dr. Murray got back from Camazotz. All of a sudden, they're just back. Poof, no explanation.I get that certain stories require work to adapt: I didn't get particularly outraged with some of the changes \"Prince Caspian\" and \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" made in the Narnia series because those were short novels whose structure required adaption to make them cinematic. I wasn't necessarily pleased with all of them, but given the structure of the books, it was understandable that some work had to be done.\n\"A Wrinkle in Time\" was different. It's a very linear story which already was very cinematic and could easily translate itself from page to screen. But instead of a faithful adaption, the filmmakers decided to ignore 90% of the source material.Strike 2, Disney. You've now screwed this same story up twice.",

But actually it's pretty good, at least according to my girlfriend and myself.Based on the classic kid's book, this tells the story of two children who go on a crazy, mysterical adventure in search of their father, a physicist who somehow made it into space with nothing more, it seems, than a wish and a prayer.I've read the book a couple of times, once as a kid and once as an adult surprised because he didn't remember how Jesus-y the book was.I like the character of Meg, who is smart and determined and afraid and in desperate need of self esteem. One of the major themes was, love yourself, and I found Meg's growing confidence touching.I was a bit disappointed by Charles Wallace. I recall the character being odd and brilliant, but in the movie he really seems like a pretty ordinary kid. I had an affinity to the book Charles Wallace because I saw myself as odd and intellectual gifted (in retrospect I was more the former than the latter), but I didn't see myself at all in this movie version.The three wise ladies are fun, particularly a funny Reese Witherspoon as the most prickly of the bunch. The special effects looked good (caveat, I saw this on TV) and the story is well paced. Like any good kid's movie there's a nice mix of humor and pathos.The religious aspects of the book have been stripped out, which I consider generally positive, although it does make the whole good/evil thing feel a little amorphous. I also felt the book was more interested in scientific thought than the movie, which leaves out things I loved as a kid like visiting a two-dimensional world.So why don't people like this? It could in part be the disappointment of the movie related to the trailer. The trailer made it look like the whole movie was this stunningly gorgeous bit of magic and female empowerment, but the scenes that made up the trailer are more the exception than the rule. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I think I would have enjoyed the movie promised by the trailer more.There are also super-fans of the book who are going to object to any changes, including the lack of religiousity. There are also, unfortunately, people who object to the children being biracial, wanting them to be the white children they pictured when they read the book. In fact, as I write this, the most-liked review on IMDB specifically complains about that. (The second most-liked review takes pains to say that's not the problem, though, so I don't think this is a simple case of crackers pushing the rankings down).Look, it's not a perfect movie. It's conceptually silly, and it's not one of these kid's films like A Little Princess that transcends kids movies, but it's lots of fun. My guess is it will be one of these movies that becomes more popular in 15 years as a generation of kids who liked it become adults who can offer opinions.

Even though he had a small role, he fit the role perfectly and was not so excessive. The color scheme is very bright and colorful, which makes the movie somewhat interesting, even with the subpar acting and plot.....Bad: The acting all around is either subar from the cast or over the top from Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis that it comes out unnatural. Even with a good cast consisting of Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, they did not add much to the movie's benefit. Disney spent so much money on its adult characters that they forgot to hire good child actors/actresses for the child cast members are not even on par with some of the amazing child stars from \"Stranger Things,\" \"It,\" or \"Jungle Book.\"Overall: The movie is mainly geared towards elementary and middle school children with some adult aspects, yet the movie is childish and not up to Disney's standard. Disney should be embarrassed to have produced such a movie with big Hollywood names and have it bomb. The movie falls flat and lacks humor leading to a failure for Disney. Even though this movie is supposed to be a big statement towards diversity with a colored director helming a $100 million budget project, the movie does not do justice.2/5",

Oprah Winfrey cannot act; neither can anyone else in this Billy Mumy wannabe ripoff. Give me the Twilight Zone episode with Mumy for 25 minutes over this cornball crap. Aside from the terrible story line; a man gives up his supposedly happy home life for years discovering the cosmos and travel at faster than lightspeed. Please; give me Buzz Lightyear for infinity and beyond instead of this lame wuss who cant even discipline his six year old child. What an idiotic storyline; overly simplistic and sugar-coated to the extent you will get Diabetes if you watch the entire film. Don't even get into the racial insults implied in the film. White man with high yeller woman is fine; it can happen. Nothing wrong with that. But to have your daughter prefer a white man, and then the sequence where the little boy prefers a high yeller girl companion indicates a fairly strong disregard of sensitivity for two entire groups: black men and white women. Both groups are excluded from any relationships in the film. All the white girls are bad, and there isn't one positive black man in the film. Nice way to promote racial integration. How ironic that a film that tries to be PC is horribly NOT PC. But the bottom line is that it really is a crappy film.",

He figured a way to travel the universe with his mind but was laughed at by his colleagues. Everyone believes that he had ran away from his family. Meg has the support of her younger brother Charles Wallace and adoring classmate Calvin O'Keefe. Charles Wallace is in contact with three mysterious strangers, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). They use tesseract to transport the kids to the planet Uriel. There they track Meg's missing father to the dangerous planet Camazotz controlled by a darkness called The IT which is spreading to control the universe.I checked out the 2003 movie before watching this although I won't be reading the book. In that movie, I didn't care much about the three ladies. In this one, at least they're a little better. The use of CGI helps liven up that section and I do like the flowers very much. It's Camazotz where this version falls completely flat with many issues. This Camazotz lacks the threatening darkness world construction. I don't see how a crowded beach be a threatening setting and the holodeck lacks reality. Charles Wallace does not get seduced by The IT like in 2003 as much as he's kidnapped and brainwashed. It's a less compelling interpretation. As for the other two kids, Calvin is nothing more than a puppy love teen who says some awkward unkid-like stuff. I look forward to Storm Reid being an interesting actress in the future. In this, there are a couple of directing mistakes and she does her best to overcome them. In general, her adventures are little more than word salads being spun out by the three ladies. They are great ideas but this movie struggles to visually put it onto the screen. The premise is similar to the much better children's adventure NeverEnding Story but this one concentrates more on the three Hollywood powerhouse stars rather than an enchanting adventure.",

I feel that if I had read the book it might fill in a lot of the stuff it appears to have missed. It just kind of skimmed through the story. Too much time spent on trying to make it look cool and be emotional over actually making the story work. I was thoroughly disappointed.

Was it part of a multi-movie contractual agreement? Did they let you read the script before you committed? Why?\" I'm guessing this film started off as a low budget Disney original movie that got upgraded to the big screen for ... reasons. The CGI is distracting and doesn't enhance. The dialogue seems to be written by a 6 year old with an overly simplistic outlook on life. The characters one dimensional. I'm unfamiliar with the 1962 novel so maybe it's hampered by trying to be a faithful recreation ...?This film got on my radar many months ago because of some commentary around the diversity of those involved in its production.

Sadly to no avail. Disney have done so many very good to masterpiece films, but with 'A Wrinkle in Time' they have misfired...big time. It hurts me a lot to describe a Disney film as terrible, a distinction very rarely associated with them, but that is a very good way to sum up 'A Wrinkle in Time'. That it is a poor adaptation of the book, which had far more wonder and charm not to mention coherence, is a problem, but not as big a problem as the major flaws that make the film terrible on its own terms. The spirited performance of Storm Reid, who makes a real effort giving her role energy and likeability and does quite well, and that from Chris Pine are the only things that stop 'A Wrinkle in Time' from being an even bigger disaster.Cannot say the same for the rest of the cast. Questioned a good deal of the casting choices before watching the film, having doubts that they would suit their roles. Doubts that were proven correct. The other children don't have strong enough presences and inexperience shows, but the adult actors fare worse. On one side of the spectrum you have very exaggerated, annoying acting, Mindy Kaling being a prime example, and on the other you have truly insipid and phoned in acting, the biggest offender being Oprah Winfrey. Didn't care for the characters and the conflict doesn't work when the heroes are bland and lack charm generally and the villains are exaggerated and lack menace. 'A Wrinkle in Time' doesn't even look good, with it looking worse than a low-budget television film (Disney Channel musicals look better!). The effects (of which there is too much of an over-reliance on) are worse than cheap, worse than those from fantasy/magic-themed family shows from twenty plus years ago, and marred further by photography and editing that will make one nauseated. The sets are colourful but not in a vibrant or appealing way, rather tacky and garish. And why Winfrey, Kaling and Reese Witherspoon (also annoying) were made to look like drag queens or something out of a cheesy 80s music video is beyond my understanding, by far the worst cases of costuming, make-up and hair in a film taking bizarre to extremes in that aspect. Nothing dynamic, whimsical, energetic, nuanced or atmospheric about the music. Much of it doesn't fit, and it's either saccharine, over-bearing or tacky, in its own right it doesn't appeal. Was expecting much better directing from the same director responsible for 'Selma', it was very muddled and it was hard to tell whether her heart was in it or whether she was taking on more than she could chew (am suspecting both).Excepting Reid's and Pine's characters, the only characters to have some kind of heart, the characters generally bore and irritate. The script and story are particularly bad, with the script falling on the wrong side frequently of cheesy, awkward and twee complete with heavy-handed moralising. The message is an admirable one but beats the viewer around the head to the point one feels preached at. The pace feels both rushed and flagging, with the action rarely coming to life let alone soaring.The story tries to be ambitious but there is too much of a too hard feel, trying to fit in too much and not having a long enough running time to tell it. There was a heart somewhere in the film and it's occasionally there with the whole finding-father stuff, but that is lost amidst all the above stated problems and that the story is far too choppy that it affects the coherence and sometimes ridiculous. Detected very little charm here and actually felt more tired by the film rather than enchanted. Overall, excepting two performances 'A Wrinkle of Time' was a mess and a rare Disney misfire. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

I'm going to try to keep this as spoiler free as possible so bear with me.First off, anyone that complains about changing the ethnicity of the lead character get over it. Storm Reid is servicable in this role and I can easily see her as Meg. Chris Pine dominates every scene that he's in, as does Gugu Mbatha Raw.Here's where the problems start....When I read this book, and it was written in the 1960s so I'll grant that some stuff just wasn't there back then, the Madeline L'engle was at least somewhat subtle with the message she was writing between the lines.This movie isn't subtle. This movie takes it's message and beats you in the face with it over, and over again.I get the fact that this is aimed at younger kids, but you really don't need to narrate everything that is happening, or should or will happen. I kept thinking that maybe there was a reason that the adults(not the parents) were phoning in their lines but there really wasn't. The costumes of the three Mrs. characters, when taken out of the previews just look silly. Meg is basically turned into an ersatz audience member where she's just led around being told what to do. I think that with a slightly better script, Ms. Reid would have really been allowed to shine here. She has some potential that isn't really tapped here. I hate to say, but I think that the directors picked her because she looked like she could be the child of the parents more than over her acting ability. That in itself is a real shame, because given the right role, Storm Reid could be fantastic.Zach Galifianikis is completely wasted here. So is Oprah Winfrey, and Reese Whitherspoon. Mindy Kailing seemed like she was trying to outdo everyone, maybe because she's used to being in tv. I don't know. A lot of the acting just felt forced.Green screen is used and abused in this film. The first world they go to is amazing, the second interesting, but the whole time I kept thinking that they were going to flash a hitpoint gauge on the screen or prompt me for a quicktime event. There's such a thing as too much CGI and this movie is a poster child for that. Maybe some more work to clean things up would have helped. Maybe not.Had they stuck to the book more closely I think it would have been a much better film. The early 2000's had a TV movie that I found myself liking more and it was done for a fraction of the budget here.",

It doesn't even attempt to remain true to what the book is truly about.First of all, the book is a Christian fantasy, written by a Christian author, Madeleine L'Engle. The movie ignores L'Engle's faith to the point of mockery. To add insult to injury, the movie doesn't even try to add in something that might satisfy in it's place. Not that anything could, but an attempt would have taken away a bit of the sting. Instead, we're left with banal generics about \"light,\" \"darkness,\" and the \"universe,\" with some daytime pop psychology mixed in. For an example, the movie has Mrs. Which, played by Oprah Winfrey, say \"The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of darkness.\" What rubbish! I genuinely hate that line. Theologically, even just morally, it's garbage. Light doesn't have to outrun the dark. Good is not weaker than evil. The smallest speck of light is enough to brighten the most encompassing darkness. That's the message we should be sending children, not some banal quip that makes evil seem stronger than it really is. The movie's fatal flaw is shown mainly in the characters, but also a bit in how the plot was handled. I'll start with the characters, but I want to say something first. I don't agree with those who say the acting was bad. The diverse cast was mostly wonderful! But, even the most talented actor can only do so much, with a bad script. The cast did the best that probably could be done with what they were given. Sadly, what they were given was trash. That isn't their fault though. Chris Pine played Alex Murray, a character horrible misinterpreted by the movie. In the book, Murray is a renowned and VERY well-respected scientist, not some outsider on the fringes of his field. This is a man who is consulted by the President, at times! His work with the tesseract was a group effort with other scientists, not just his wife. The movie utterly trashed his motives for developing the tesseract. He didn't want to \"shake hands with the universe,\" whatever that means. Murray in the book was a man of faith, working for the good of his fellow men. The tesseract was supposed to help people, not just fulfill some personal agenda. Murray in the book took risks, yes, but as part of his responsibilities to his team and country. Equally flawed was the movie's version of Mrs. Whatsit. In the book, Mrs. Whatsit is, frankly, an angel, who used to be a star, before sacrificing herself in a battle against evil...a battle she won. She was a fun character, though, playing a game at being human. She dressed as an old tramp and stole sheets. The sheets in the book, though, weren't stolen to create some magnificent robe for her to look beautiful in, for her vanity. Nope. In the book, she took the sheets to make cheesy ghosts, in order to scare people away from the haunted house. The worst thing about the movie Mrs. Whatsit was how she treated Meg. Consistently and frequently through the movie, Mrs. Whatsit bullied and belittled Meg, showing intense dislike and openly wishing she wasn't there. What an incredibly terrible message to send! This is supposed to be a wise leader, teacher, and guide, but that's how she treats a child? Compare that to the book, where Mrs. Whatsit is playful and gentle, where Mrs. Whatsit's assurance of her love is instrumental in Meg defeating It. I'm a fan of Reese Witherspoon, but she was so wrong here. Frankly, Kathy Bates would have been a much better choice. Another character who should have been happy, playful, and kind was the Happy Medium. Zach Galifianakis played the role as a grump, for whatever reason. Frankly, this is the role Michael Pe\u00f1a should have played. His comedy style would have been perfect for a well-meaning seer trying to show the kids comforting things, their mothers, and instead showing them scenes of pain, as it was in the book. I don't know why they got rid of this bit of character development in favor of CGI crap about balancing on rocks. It's just one time of many, where something deep was replaced with something shallow. Zach Galifianakis could play the Man with Red Eyes, if he can pull off legal evil, a creepy bureacrat, with a deep sense of menace, highlighted by a fake cheerfulness. Finally, we get to Charles Wallace. And, yes, he should be called that, not Charles or Charlie, no. He's Charles Wallace, because it shows he's not ordinary. In the book, Charles Wallace is a gentle, thoughtful child, who very often knows what his sister is thinking and feeling. He's a boy who listens. This is a very important part of his character. He has a wisdom to him that is far beyond his years. He's not a typical kid who screams and yells, when someone is being mean to his sister. Charles Wallace barely talks in front of other people at all! There should be something otherworldly about the boy. Instead, McCabe was directed to play him as a bit wild and mouthy and Charles Wallace's wisdom, understanding, and intelligence were barely shown at all. Not only is this a sad waste of his character, but makes the sequels impossible to get right. They made the classic mistake of telling us Charles Wallace is special, instead of showing us. Poor Calvin. They didn't so much get his character wrong, as fail to give him character at all. He was just undeveloped. Of course, they ruined the possibility of a good adaptation of A Swiftly Tilting Planet, the third in L'Engle's trilogy, by changing his home life from a poor family, with lots of kids, to him being an only child with just a dad. The only character treated worse was Aunt Beast, who was left out entirely, which is shame. Well, they also left out Sandy and Denys, the Murray twins. A single scene with them would have been just fine. As for the plot, I think a single example will highlight how wrong the movie went. In the book, the children arrive on Camazotz. They walk through a suburban neighborhood and see children \"playing.\" The boys are bouncing balls and girls and skipping rope, all simultaneously to a certain \"rhythm.\" Yes, the movie almost gets that much right. The children see that one child alone is out of rhythm, dropping his ball and unable to keep in sync. When the mother's call the children in, the errant child leaves his ball behind. They try to return the ball and the mother is terrified. She assures Meg and the others that there haven't been any \"incidents,\" in a long time. The reader sees that although everything looks neat and tidy, no one is really happy. Submission to evil brings terror and pain, not joy. This deep, potentially moving scene is reduced to make room for a shallow, unnecessary scene where a CGI forest attacks the kids. Speaking of out of character, the entire planet of Camazotz is exactly that. There would not a beach scene like that on Camazotz. Camazotz is legal evil, all the way. The evil of Camazotz does not play those sorts of mind games. It doesn't so much try and confuse you, as try to get you to confuse yourself. In the movie, the children are given a meal, by the Man with Red Eyes. They are given some sort of nutrient base, but the Man can create the illusion of a turkey dinner. Charles Wallace, however, can't be fooled, and knows the meal is shapeless and tasteless, like sand. They weren't actually given sand to eat. The meal did what a meal should do, at least on the surface. It provided nutrition, but without real joy. It was body fuel, with everything better about it drained away. For me, that's the perfect metaphor for this movie, as opposed to the book. The movie tells the story and kills some time, but with all the real joy of the story neglected and ignored.I really wished they had done a good job. I wanted to like this movie, so much. When you make a beloved novel into a movie, you have an automatic audience in the fans of the book. Integrity demands you give that audience what you are promising them. This movie fails to deliver.",

            "content": "I didn't even want to see this to begin with. But I was dragged by people who only wanted to see if because Reese Witherspoon is in it. So to begin with.. the plot is not good. There hardly even is one. The special effects were mediocre but not horrible.. the characters were two dimensional and you can't really connect to them. I don't even understand the point of Calvinother than Meg's love interest. But WHY DOES SHE NEED A LOVE INTEREST. She is a child and while she may have a crush, there is no need for there to be a romantic storyline within this movie. Charles Wallace mentioned that he cane along for diplomacy, but where do we even see that come into play? Meg is just dragging him along the whole time. And on that topic, how does Charles Wallace know all of this stuff. Sure, he's a smart kid, but are we supposed to believe he's psychic or something? And he can just summon the universe? Also, why is the universe so concerned with them? Don't they have other things to spend their time on? So anyways.. the three Mrs show up and oprah's Character is like 20ft taller than everyone else.. why? Because she's oprah, that's why... and that cheapens the feel of the movie. We get it.. you're Oprah. So then they go to this magical land and find out what direction her dad went. So the Reese Witherspoon changes into some giant flying creature so they can go look for their father. But the director focused on the magic of flying and the fun of it that we lost the point of even being up there. There was literally no point to that entire scene other than to put in some \"cool\" special effects. They saw \"the darkness\" though. It's supposedly \"pure evil.\" How pure of an evil can it really be in a PG Disney movie... huh? Anyways, they meet Zach galifinakis to help find their father. (Also, why wouldn't the Mrs be able to find him or help meg find him if they are literally the universe with a bunch of magical powers??) anywho.. galifinakis shows a vision of her dad discovering love is the frequency needed in order to terrasect. (If that's the case, how do people NOT terrasect). And that he went into the darkness. So suddenly the darkness is it's own planet? And Meg risks the lives of THE UNIVERSE in order to go into the darkness.. because that's a good idea. So she gets tested by the darkness and meg is the only one who can resist it.. what happened to Charles Wallace being the all-knowing leader of the group? He falls under the spell of the darkness almost immediately. And also, why was he already across the wall? Did it not fit their \"love story\" plot to have a young(er) child intervene? So now Charles Wallace is evil and suddenly has magical powers. But again.. how evil can he be in a Disney movie? Not very.. and that makes it laughable. So meg again passes more tests and finds her father. Who hasn't aged a day, his beard hasn't grown, and has survived in a small room with nothing? What did he eat? Where did he go to the bathroom? Then all of the sudden the darkness REALLY wants meg and just meg. (Again I wonder why such a powerful being would be so interested in these specific children) and meg gets tested some more. All of this just being a lesson to teach her to love herself, to have self esteem. And that's the cure. That's what strongly weakens the darkness. Again... why does the universe (light and dark) care SO MUCH about one little girl's self esteem. Then the three Mrs tell meg that she's the next \"great person\" in line with ghandi, Marie curie, and various others. Just because she knows basic physics, can figure out a puzzle, and loves herself??? Also, another thing I forgot to mention,; Mrs who can only speak in quotes because she's not strong enough to speak her own thoughts. Then when they are on the darkness' planet, she speaks her own words and oprah explains that it's because the planet is making her weak.... so how does that make sense????? Anyways. It was a horrible movie with tons of plot holes and a really bad plot line. The director focused more on the special affects and costumes than she did on a script, plot, or acting. But hey.. oprah is in it.",

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time has everything it needs (for its intended audience to ignore that it's as riveting to look at as any movie with similar effects). And by \"everything\", I don't exclusively mean a godlike Oprah Winfrey. Say what you will about the current state of Disney; they still know how to make successes and are good at adapting to, let's say, \"climate change\". Speaking of nothing, woman of color (sic) Ava DuVernay directs the movie, and it is probably of little shock to anyone that I think 13th was better.The film, based on a similarly named book I had previously not heard of, stars Storm Reid as the young Meg, who voyages into the universe with her little brother (Deric McCabe) and a schoolmate (Levi Miller of Pan) to find her lost father, an astrophysicist played by Chris Pine.Also at her side are three space-traveling entities wearing varying degrees of glitter and concentrated goofiness. There is Mindy Kaling as Mrs. Who (which is not a Jodie Whitaker reference), Reese Witherspoon as Mrs. Whatsit (which is certainly not a Homestar Runner reference), and last but the opposite of least there is Oprah as Mrs. Which.I don't need to elaborate. Oprah, the best person in the world barring possibly Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9, portrays a powerful alien sorceress who, like her two companions, symbolizes light and ultimate goodness. As old as this book is, few things could be more timely. Somewhere a Trump fan is seething.Our heroes move through unmercifully digital realms (that seem just as convincing to them as they do to us) and see all sorts of creatures, where even the most interestingly designed one looks suspiciously similar to The Tooth Fairy from Rise of the Guardians. In the supporting cast we see Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Meg's mother, Zach Galifianakis as a Happy Medium, as well as David Oyelowo, Michael Pe\u00f1a and others who do not have anything exceptional to offer outside of laughable, outright random costumes.Sometimes the film is a love story between youngsters, sometimes it is comical, sometimes it sets out to be a little more epic and emotionally brutal than the design choices, performances, and cutesy interludes permit. Online posts explain that A Wrinkle in Time (originally penned by Madeleine L'Engle) is a difficult book to adapt; perhaps the changes in tone went over more smoothly in the source material. I, for one, will never know.If this is your first time seeing images, worlds, and special effects like these, as is most surely the case when a kid watches this, I suppose I don't see a problem. But I know adults who are impressed by the movie, so I took the time to join a theater-going party so that I could offer up my two cents; or counter-points, as it turns out. If you're going to praise the film because of the originality of its images, I shall point to the similarities it shares with the visuals of movies like Avatar, the lesser Alice adaptations, and even Transformers: The Last Knight (I swear, even Chris Pine's prison was just The Alchemist's hallway from The Holy Mountain renovated).What else allegedly makes the film interesting? Well, the cast is a rich blend of unemotive children and half-assing professionals, and the movie does set itself apart from others like it in how it focuses on kids and the emotions they struggle with. Critics have praised the considerable diversity of the cast also - like you needed me to tell you that - which is fine and good. They were mostly just saying their lines the way any other performer could have done, but again: fine and good. Good and fine.Regardless, A Wrinkle in Time is not as hard-hitting or enchantingly otherworldly as it insists on being (I never felt convinced by the CGI, for instance, in spite of it technically being well-rendered). Like any other recent Disney movie, it feels safe and manufactured, sans the odd moment of accidental sincerity. I realize it's not for me. And thank God for that.",

            "content": "What a fascinating mess. It's the first time a black female director has helmed a 100+ mil blockbuster, and Duvernay isn't messing around; it is full of candy-coated visuals and enough standing-around-and-expositioning to make Burton's Alice in Wonderland shake its head. She single handedly proves in fact that a fierce black lady can make just as much of a wondrous debacle as white men have done for decades. And yet...So much doesnt make sense though - the rules of the \"It\" change based on whatever the next scene requires of it (including a delightfully mind-boggling bit part for Michael Pena - seriously, this better show up on his honorary Oscar reel one day) - and it is so sincere in its performances and tone that it doesn't see when it's sincerely dumb. The pacing is also off, perhaps due to studio interference, but how then to explain the sudden shift from a serious scene between mother and daughter about the missing-for-four-years Chris Pine ... Right into Reese Witherspoon being there in the living room doing her darndest to be the next Glenda the Good Witch. Huh?Ive heard a couple of reviews compare this to Return to Oz, which was itself a Disney movie taking off from famous source material and going in a much different direction. But Murch, for all of his movie's faults, was really taking chances with his dark tone with the material and things felt organic to the world that gets set up. No, this is closer to something like David Lynch's Dune (also a rather notorious adaptation of a hallowed \"unfilmable\" classic); this is a movie that throws a LOT at the audience very quickly, and while the imagination visually is often breathtaking, and I think Duvernay has some truly crazy imagery ready to give her VFX people to realize for her and us, narratively it is full of information and yet emotionally it's just not there.... No. That's not entirely true or fair, there is an emotional point to all of this, and it's a loaf of hippie-dippie crap. Again, having not read the book, I have to take what the movie gives me, but I've heard that originally there was more Christian symbolism and meaning for why things were happening and rules and so on. Instead of that (if there is any Christian symbolism I totally missed it), we get the kind of message I expect in a Care Bears movie: it's all about love. Literally. It doesn't hold water and moreover it also leads to excuses for the problems in the secondary characters: for children this is a bad lesson, that this nebulous concept of trying to love people more will magically lead to people overcoming their flaws, which is all coming from \"The It\". For all that Duvernay tries to lay the groundwork for all of this to take off, she also presides over more boring CGI and visual locations than not (some do stand out and if one day this becomes for the kids today a stoner cult film for when they go to college), and the climax is hollow. This isn't to say there aren't some decent things to find here - Reid, Mbatha Raw and Pine (the latter two with too few scenes) are quite good and do what they can with their material - but all of the incoherence in the storytelling, in what is too much and simultaneous too little, and a weak message amid the colorful sights and lame musical sounds (those songs will date the film terribly), it all adds up to full blown WTF mainstream cinema.",

The whole thing is a confusing mess, they were not able to transfer the profound message of the book to the screen, it totally got lost. The cast, well, nothing to say other than they are overdoing the 'diversity' thing now and the pc stuff. This book was not written about a bi racial family with an adopted Asian boy; it was written about a girl with 'flaming red hair' i.e. Meg and her white family. Why do we have to make EVERYTHING about race these days? I thought when I saw Oprah in it that there might be a problem but I loved the book so much I was willing to take a chance on the movie. Just hope they don't make the other two books in the series into movies; please don't waste the money and don't waste your time seeing this movie either, just read the book and leave it at that.",

            "content": "There is so much to say about A Wrinkle in Time I don't even know where to start. I guess I should start by saying that I didn't read the book. Even though I didn't read the book that should not have a significant bearing upon my enjoyment of the movie because there are plenty of movies I've watched without having read the associated book yet I enjoyed them.Since we're on the vein of the movie being a book lets start with the storyline. Although I understood it, it was not well done. The story was very scattered and disconnected. Characters just appeared with no rhyme or reason and there was very little explanation given to their presence. One character, Calvin (Levi Miller), was wholly unnecessary. I'm assuming he had a role in the book but in the movie his role was pointless. Along with characters materializing from the Hollywood ether the story itself never had a real flow or cohesion. The movie jumped from one scene to the next without a segue or proper transition. I think it was assumed that everyone is familiar with the story and should therefore be familiar with all that is going on.The essence of the story, as I gathered, was a girl who'd essentially given up on herself after her dad disappeared was given a chance to find her missing father. Finding her father would make her whole again and all would be right with the world. Her father, by the way, was missing somewhere in the universe. If he was missing in Los Angeles that'd be a tall enough task without any real leads, but he was missing in THE UNIVERSE and the girl didn't have much to go on. Her journey takes her all over and again I saw no strong reason for going to the places they went. Without revealing too much the movie built to a climax as all movies do then it fizzled. The climax itself wasn't much to begin with but then it fizzled from there largely because of how sappy and cliche the resolution was.What was disappointing--if I can say I was disappointed--was that there were so many well known actors in this movie and they were wasted. No, I don't mean they were drunk, I mean their talents were wasted. Everything seem so staged and scripted. Nothing was organic or natural, from the scenery to the dialog to their very movements, nothing seemed instinctive. They all seemed like they were waiting for a cue to deliver their lines or move. And the worst of them was Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). If this was his debut role I hope he isn't ruined by it. His character seemed the most hollow and staged. Every line he delivered seemed rehearsed.The incredibly sappy, cliche, disconnected story, and the acting led to serious boredom. I wanted to like it--I truly did--but I couldn't find much to like. It was colorful, that's about all I can say. I can't even credit the movie much for the scenery and special effects because it wasn't that special. There was nothing groundbreaking or unique in that department. Honestly, this movie would have been better off being a Disney Channel release for kids to watch after school.",

Okay, maybe a part of it has something to do with it being based on a book, and also my brother wanted to see it (not that he knew anything about it anyway), but in the end it was one of those painfully annoying Disney films that left me bored out of my brains the entire time.\n Basically it is about a couple of kids, one of them a young teenager, another a child, whose parents are scientists. Anyway, they Dad goes missing so not surprisingly they become very difficult students (not to mention that they also attract the ire of their peers). However, out of the blue, these magical women appear (good witches if you will), who take them on a journey across the universe in an attempt to find their father, only to discover that there is this nameless evil that basically makes everybody behave like jerks.\n I guess you can see where this is going - they defeat this nameless evil (which is call the It - see, I told you it was a nameless evil), and then find their father, and they all go back to playing happy families. All the while, the bullies stop being bullies because, well, nameless evil, and the random boy that decided to join their group because he had this urge to just leave his house and start wondering around a part of the town he never goes to because, well, plot point, finally plucks up the courage to go back home and confront his abusive father (like, that ever works in real life).\n I told my brother that it was a fantasy movie, and yes, you could say that it pretty much exists in the realm of fantasy, because I doubt abusive fathers suddenly have a change of heart just because their son decides to stand up to them, and bullies don't stop being bullies because some nameless and unidentified evil is destroyed because, well, love is supposed to conquer all, and that works out because some person just screams out 'I love you' over and over again, and the nameless evil stops being evil and turns into sunshine and lollypops because, well, that's what happens when you start screaming out 'I love you' over and over again.\n Well, if you get the impression that I didn't like this movie, then you're not wrong there. In fact I won't even go as far as calling it a fairy tale because, well, that sort of ruins it for some of the really cool fairy tales out there. Nah, I'll just call this a Disney film and leave it at that, though I do have to admit that while they have made some absolute gems, in the end, a lot of their stuff is just cliched and rubbish.",

A genuine turkey, this is the film to beat when it comes to the title of worst film of 2018.\u00bd a giant Oprah out of 5",

An exercise in doing, saying & being too much, Wrinkle... certainly isn't boring, but it is bad. \nIt has a lot in common with Tomorrowland: live-action, visually-heavy Disney fantasy-adventures, headed by lauded filmmakers, which celebrate braininess. But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster. It gets credit for being Disney's most enigmatic, eccentric experiments in years, taking visual and philosophical cues from Jodorowsky and Kubrick. Unfortunately, all intended awe and wonder is swallowed up by good, old-fashioned ineptness.\nThe story of a girl having to \"tesser\" across the universe to find her long-lost dad gets some things right, including the critical casting of the lead girl. Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (\"I like earthtones.\"); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. \nThese obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil \"It\" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels.

            "content": "I'll start off by flat out saying that I have not read the books, therefore I will be judging this movie in isolation. That is of course how I believe that all book adaptations should be judged, for what they are. Sadly, this movie in and of itself is legitimately bad.Starting with the positive, I did enjoy some of the cinematography and special effects. However, the movies fails to even be consistent with this, far too much of it feels unfortunately bland for the absurdity of what they're tackling in this movie, which in contrast with the absurdity of this movie, makes the absurdity feel out of place. They're mixed attempts at grounded storytelling and ridiculous storytelling make for a weird dosage. As you can see I've already dived into negatives, because I've sadly already named the positives.This movie tries way too often to be serious, having dark and dramatic scenes that just don't work. The reason they don't work is because half the movie tries to be silly, while the other half relies on us caring. Which I simply don't. Not only does much of the goofy side of this movie come off as annoying, but there isn't enough realism and relatability in characters for me to care about them when the movie does get dramatic.As far as the characters, the flaws come out both from the performances and the writing. So much so that the lines begin to get blurry where the flaws are emitting from, thus I have difficulty pinpointing precisely what is wrong with the characters. But every single character in this movies has flaws.Our three main protagonists in this movie are played by child actors, which is often where movies take a wrong step. I think Storm Reid gave a fine performance, but ultimately her character felt bland. I feel that if she had been given more to do in this movie it would've helped her to stand out. Deric McCabe does poorly, I believe he was miscast in this role, although most of the scenes that really don't work for him would be hard for any child actor to pull off. Also his scenes where he had very little to do felt strangely off, as though he just wasn't up to the task yet. I believe that he was absolutely miscast in this role, and it's possible that it could've been done well by another actor. I believe Levi Miller does fine, but his character ultimately felt far too bland, and when he didn't feel bland he felt weird, but not in an endearing way, in a slightly creepy or offbeat way that just failed. Let's just say that our supporting characters are just as all over the place as our main three, they don't get better.The reason I have yet to mention the plot of this movie yet, is that I might be forgiven for forgetting one was attempted. It is straightforward, predictable, generic, but its biggest crime is that it is forgettable. It's not exactly terrible, although in parts bad, it just fails to be memorable.This movie was absolutely all over the place, from strange attempts at being creepy, which ultimately came across accidentally hilarious, to bizarre attempts at extremely cheesy messages that fell flat on their face. The unintentionally humorous moments made this movie easier to watch, and fortunately my experience was not aggressively annoying. That being said, this movie is genuinely bad, there's hardly anything good in it. Save your two hours and do something else with your life, this one just isn't worth it.",

Along with her brother Charles Wallace? Charles Wallace, Charles Wallace? Charles Wallace! Charles Wallace, Charles Wallace, Charles Wallace! Charles Wallace? (Deric McCabe) and a neighbourhood boy Calvin (Levi Miller) who wanders into the plot by accident, they travel the galaxy trying to retrace her fathers movements.I only realised at the end credits that this was another movie that Disney adapted from the work of Madeleine L'Engle and after this, and the awful \"A Ring Of Endless Light\" adaptation that I had to sit through a couple of weeks back, I'm glad there aren't any more. It's a shame that all of the criticism for the film seemed to land on Ave DuVernay's lap - when the flaws with this film mostly lie with its terrible story. It's a nonsensical and boring plot which isn't interested in it's sci-fi trappings despite bothering to explain them in great detail, instead favouring a painfully on the nose metaphor for not giving in to ones darker and more destructive feelings.Which is not to say that the films production gets away scot-free. Some CGI moments are better than others and it's pacing is all wrong. It's doesn't do a good job of explaining what people's motivations are - certainly in the last third, or what the villain actually wants, or why it switches from an ethereal evil - to a specific possession element. Scenes happen, and then are walked away from without progressing the plot. Performances aren't great, though the kids are better than the adults in this regard, but the most annoying aspect of the film though was to have a character called \"Charles Wallace\" and then to have other characters repeatedly shout both sections of the name over and over again as they look for him.It's looking to be a \"Wizard of Oz-esque\" magical experience, but it doesn't have a story to offset its painfully twee whimsy.

But you can't make up for the fundamental flaws. The movie fails to convey a clear story, and completely misses a key part of the original story in its rush to get Meg and company home. An example of how this movie could have been made? Look no further than the Wizard of Oz which is an adaptation of a book, involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch.Cut the gimmicks, and back to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.",

And no, its not because I didn't understand the overall meaning but rather the slip shod way the narrative tried to portray it. It's just jam packed with Maguffins with the odd sprinkling of real science to try and give it some legitimacy. And plot holes..so, so many! I think what realy annoyed me though was the PS1 type CGI flying lettuce. And the way the characters kept calling the kid \"Charles Wallace\". Is that his name cos that ain't a name. Really annoyed me for some weird reason. What really annoyed me though was the way the film portrayed horrific human behaviour as the influence of some alien entity.

As long as the director and screenwriters are talented storytellers if they are personally passionate about the source material the difference is usually massive (see Battlefield Earth for an example of passion for the story but no storytelling talent at director/screenwriter). One clear contrast of this is Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (2001-2003), who was personally passionate about the source material, compared to the 'Chronicles of Narnia' trilogy (2005-2010) where that was missing: IMDB avg: LOTR 8.8 vs. CofN 6.6Rotten Tomatoes avg: LOTR 93% vs 64%U.S. Gross avg (adj. for infl.): LOTR $530m vs. CofN $238mSo, I think the ratings for 'A Wrinkle in Time' point to a lack of passion for the source material and the resultant quality of the movie: IMDB 4.2, Rotten Tomatoes 42 (RT audience score even lower at 35%).",

Some of the changes didn't make sense to me were they trying to make this story more exciting than it was in the book?First off, the bond between Charles Wallace and Meg was totally lost in this movie. I kept waiting for it during the warming the milk scene and it never materialized. Then the whole thing about the forests popping up, the whirlwind and the wall in Kamozots was entirely fabricated. Why? Then the kids that were playing ball, there was a kid that was doing the ball thing erratically. They later see him being \"rehabilitated\". This whole thing was left out. And it was important because Meg had a speech at the end that talked about the difference between being the same and being equal that was very powerful. This was left out. Then the dad left which made him look like an ass, but that didn't happen in the book. Yes, it was Megs love that saved Charles Wallace, but how they got there was wrong. I was also disappointed that they left out the humor of the happy medium, who was really happy. All in all, I think they missed some of the key messages that then get built upon in later books.",

It attempts to be Life of Pi but lacks the depth and conflict. There is nothing at stake for the character, and the villain is not at all menacing. The supporting cast led by Oprah Winfrey was brilliant though. Oprah reminds us that she was once and still is a bona fide actor. But the scene stealer is Mindy Kaling as Mrs Who. She is radiant. Storm Reid as the Meg is too annoying in the beginning to be likable, but she does have talent. The other child stars are bland. In short, as a movie fan, I rarely find a movie boring, but this is one of those boring movies. It is full of spectacle but lacking so much of plot or depth and the graces of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Michael Pena, Zach Galifianakilis cannot save this movie. In other words, this is a flop waiting to happen",

Directed by Ava DuVernay (Selma), it is an unfortunate mess of storytelling and uninvolving plotting.Meg Murry (Storm Reid) is a young girl trying to fit in at school four years after the strange disappearance of her scientist father (Chris Pine). One day, three mysterious women, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey) appear at Meg's house and offer to help find her missing father, who is believed to be somewhere on a faraway world.Having not read the novel from which it was based, I have no idea how accurately this film adaptation follows the original source material. However, with this in mind, the film seems to be a jumbled mess of overdone CGI, uninteresting action, and forced poignancy. The film's script feels all over the place and there are a number of plot holes which are never resolved and are brushed under the carpet for the sake of moving the film along and pad out its runtime. In addition to this, none of the characters were particularly interesting and the story was uninvolving and often boring. This is one of those films that you are highly likely to forget you have watched it in a matter of days.I rate it 3/10",

That's often noticed in scenes which feature conversations between characters. I felt if I was watching documentary or something, and that made me so confused and I really felt uneasy. There are tons of plot holes and unexplained things from the get-go to the end of the movie. But most of the nonsensical things happened to be related to the character of Charles Wallace. Charles Wallace is a very bizarre character. This character and everything related to it don't make any sense ,alas, Charles Wallace is really a big deal in the story and its messy plot. To add insult to injury, the child who played this character, Deric McCabe, is a very bad actor; for a big part of the movie he was trying to act like a cool sweet young kid, but he is not, then we see him overacting. I wonder if this character, Charles Wallace, is also poorly written in the novel? Mrs. Which, Whatsit, and Who characters have many cringe-worthy moments, and I blame no one but the director, Ava DuVernay, and maybe also Mindy Kaling (Mr. Who) who I should blame; what an annoying character and infuriating performance from Mindy Kaling!I don't have so much to say about Zach Galifianakis or Pe\u00f1a's performances, but I didn't neither like their characters.I think Storm Reid who played Meg, the protagonist, did a really god job. But the only performance that I can really praise is Chris Pine as Meg's father; he is great and due to his performance, the dramatic and the emotional value, which I didn't get, became slightly better. There are very few scenes where the CGI was okay, but, in general, it's weak and cartoonish, and that's due to the bad green screen that is glaringly obvious.I liked the comprehensive concept of the evil as an antagonist, but what we got from it in the third act was disgraceful! I really suffered while watching this act with all its dull and illogical twists.I'm very disappointed! I haven't watched many movies that have been released this year, but this is definitely one of the worst.From now on I'll call this movie A Wrinkle in Logic!(4/10)",

            "content": "GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A sci-fi fantasy that is metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and one of the year's most disappointing movies.JIM'S REVIEW: As a goofy teenager, Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time was heady stuff back in the sixties, a book that I found difficult to understand, let alone, enjoy. It was all metaphysical mumbo-jumbo in those late turbulent 60's and Ava DuVernay's updated film adaptation can be described the same way today. It is a film of good intentions gone badly.The film is ill-conceived from the start. (How anyone looking at the kitschy design couldd not have seen the many missteps is beyond me and the universe!) Words fail to accurately explain the many flaws, but try I must. But first, a short plot summary for those not familiar with the novel: Meg Murry, her brother, Charles Wallace, and a friend meet some time traveling matrons named Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Who. (Who's on first?...I dunno!) They \"tesser\" to different worlds to find Meg's missing physicist father, who may have discovered the meaning of life, as they battle an evil force named The It (No, not that supernatural devious clown, although the circus of misfits has fully arrived).The director has diversity and woman's empowerment seemingly the major emphasis throughout this time-traveling saga, more blatantly on display than in most films. Score some points for that issue. But whereas, the recent Black Panther movie had the same idea and melded it successfully into its narrative, this heavy-handed version makes advancement for racial quotas in the most obvious of ways, primarily in its casting choices and stereotyping of some characters. Subtract points for the lack of logic and pure entertainment value. This film is a confusing dumbing-down of its source material.(In Ms. L'Engle's defense, many of her ideas of parallel dimensions, light vs. dark forces, black smoke monsters, and such were innovative and ground-breaking at the time, although now they are commonplace and contrived due to many later reincarnations from other sci-fi sources.) In fact, when the film stays earthbound, it oddly has more impact than its many treks to supernatural destinations.Storm Reid is our young heroine and the actress holds her own and creates a believable girl trying to cope with a new world order. Her casting is one of the few pleasures in this movie. Levi Miller has that teen idol look but is a bit bland as Meg's friend, Calvin, who seems to have a hair fetish through the movie. In smaller roles, Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw register very well as the helpless and loving parents. Perhaps one of Ms. DuVernay's biggest hurdle was her miscasting of young Deric McCabe as Meg's gifted brother. He is just physically wrong for this role. As directed, the young actor overacts shamelessly and is annoyingly precocious. Mr. McCabe's resemblance to a small but mighty Herv\u00e9 Villechaize does not help matters either. (No rescue here, the plane never arrives!) When called on to be a menacing force of nature, his size and high-pitched line delivery has the completely opposite reaction, more bratty hissy-fit than life-threatening peril. This child actor may have talent, but this role does not show off that potential at all.Yet some of the other adult performers are just surprisingly awful, especially the three fairy godmother types played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and the omnipotent Oprah \"You get a car\" Winfrey. It's hard to determine just who, whatsit, or especially \"why\" these actresses interpret their roles with a fuzzy cartoonish smugness and total lack of gravitas. They never create an iota of a believable character or transcend their real life personas. It's just dress-up time. Other unusual suspects are: Zach Galifianakis, once again hamming it up to excess as a yoga guru called The Happy Medium and Michael Pena plays Red briefly, a wise exit. Ms. DuVernay's vision becomes strained in this re-imagining and the technical CGI have a general artificial quality which subverts the story. It is a rarity in today's filmmaking that such a big budgeted blockbuster from the Disney Studio looks so cheap and be so bereft of imagination and visual style. Blame the artisans involved, the worst offender being costume designer Paco Delgado's outrageous drag queen outfits, the bejeweled make-up, and Disney's fairy-tale over-the-top hair design. (Perhaps this look would have worked as a more theatrical musical, A Wizard of Oz updated tale. As it stands, it just looks foolish and laughable.) In fact, evolving hair styles seems to be the deciding factor for character development, since it surely isn't the muddled screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell. It's more like a skeletal outline of a series of kiddie adventures as the characters space hop to different planets and different obstacles than a complex story of universal adult themes. The dialogue is just a series of positive pep talks and self-help platitudes that grow tiresome very fast (\"Be a warrior!\"...Celebrate your flaws!\"...\" Don't give up hope!\"...\"You know, you have great hair!\").A bombastic music score by Ramin Djawadi telegraphs the emotion one is suppose to feel but doesn't. Most of Naomi Sholan's production design and especially Elizabeth Keenan's unimaginative set decoration looks like a college art design project using painted styrofoam as its main element, with the prize going to best float. Only Tobias Schliesser's photography has some merit.Yes, there are a few effective scenes that are completely satisfying. After all, the director is a powerful force. Just see her previous two films, the superb Selma and the important documentary, 13, and it is proof of her talents. However, in this film, she loses control of her story with trite images (Orion's gaudy cavern, a bedazzled bigger-than-life Oprah, and those ugly costumes with added colored lip gloss, a dated 50's beach scene that seems out of place with all the other contemporary touches) mixed with strong ones (the ripple effect prior to transporting, an eerie beige Stepford suburbia, a dangerous race in a dark forest).This modern reboot of A Wrinkle in Time has many kinks to iron out. Sadly, it is a major disappointment. Hopefully, Ms. DuVerney and crew will learn from their failures and \"tesser\" onto other more worthwhile projects. This one deserves to be lost in its own parallel universe.",

You cannot convince me she was the best choice for the role, she was chosen for \"reasons\".Oprah is a fine human being, but her giant self 5 minutes into the film just looked dumb. That's the thing about this, everything about this film just rings as unnecessary and dumb.Zach G. Shows up for 2 minutes to collect a paycheck and have his name in the credits, along with 5-6 other actors who probably didn't read the whole script before agreeing to be in it.A total waste, do not bother with this.

Every payoff seemed unearned, every line of dialogue felt flat instead of inspiring or thought-provoking or whatever emotion they were trying to make me feel.As an example, Calvin at one point says to Meg something like \"you don't know how incredible you are, do you?\" Yet, there is no context for why he know this or feels this way. To this point, Meg hasn't really shown anything incredible and there is no back story for these two except that they barely know each other. This is the kind of disconnected dialogue you can expect from the entire movie. Monologues and speeches that are suppose to have gravity and inspire but feel out of place. Where did it all go wrong? Is this a poor script, poor editing, or poor directing?The only character I really enjoyed was Charles Wallace, a name you get to know quite well because they say his name about 500 times. He (Deric McCabe) really made the best of the dialogue he was given.This movie is harmless, but ultimately not satisfying.",

            "review_title": "Worst Film of 2018?",
            "content": "'A Wrinkle In Time' is the worst film of this year thus far, due to it's poorly written screenplay, terribly written screenplay and underwhelming acting. On paper, this film has a lot going for it. It has a good selection of talented cast members, it's a Disney film and it's (supposedly) a wonderful, adventurous tale. So it is a wonder to me that all of these things could have gone wrong. From the very beginning, the weak screenplay is evident and consequently undermines the actors. It's very difficult to have great acting when the screenplay in which they act off is terrible. Unfortunately this resulted in talented actors such as Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and Chris Pine being undermined. It also did not help the characters were underdeveloped and simply not interesting. The female trio (Witherspoon, Kaling and Winfrey) were quite quirky and interesting at points, but still remained to be underdeveloped. The leading child cast protagonists were not very exciting, however I can't be too harsh on the young ones. They'll learn one day to be more selective with their film choices. However, Levi Miller shined in this film and was a clear stand-out for me. For a film directed at a younger audience, the plot is extremely bewildering and far too complex. I'm not sure whether this is just a poor adaptation of a great book, or the source material is not that great either. The story comes across as uninteresting, predictable and clich\u00e9d. There may have been a few somewhat-intriguing scenes, but they were ultimately lost amongst the rest of the film. The only thing this film truly succeeded in was a colourful costume and makeup design that was visually stunning. The female trio (Witherspoon, Kaling and Winfrey) looked vibrant and beautiful, with imaginative costumes and striking makeup. At least the film was nice to look at. Overall, this wasted-potential of a film can easily go missed as it is poorly written and uninteresting, and was not saved by it's few interesting aspects.",

When people spoke of the book, it was in terms that did not fire my imagination. It seemed it was of the wish-fulfillment adventure fantasy that Andre Norton worked in, and I did not care for Norton's work.So when my cousin and I went to see this movie this morning, I could approach it without any preconceptions. No outrage that Michael Keaton has been cast as a Batman with chubby cheeks, no contempt for anyone who thinks elves' ears are that pointy, none of the million and one indignities we are subject to because our slightest whims are unheeded without the bother of our having to even think of them! They could change the story around entirely, and I wouldn't have the least idea. I would judge the movie on its own merits.I was mildly bored throughout by a universe in which the love of tween girls is the most powerful force in the universe; a universe where girls love their younger brothers who are smarter than they. I've been a smart younger brother. I can assure you, it is not an endearing quality.It was clear to me that this movie was made to cater to young girls, probably those who loved the books. Since I wasn't a young girl, never had been one, and probably never will be one, it wasn't intended for me. On the way out, I saw a young girl and an adult woman leaving and consulted with them. The younger thought it was good. The elder agreed with me when I used the word \"gooey\".",

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is one of those books that a lot of kids are aware of. I myself have heard about the book since the sixth grade, and from I understand, is a very popular read for a lot of girls. Before the new movie adaptation came out, I took the liberty of listening to an audiobook version. I can understand why as it focuses on a social outcast who gains a great deal of confidence through her journey within the universe. While I can't say that it's the masterpiece that a lot of people have said it is, it's still a good read for children and would even hope that classrooms use this a part of the English curriculum. I think what kids liked about the book was its use of science and mathematics in conjunction with the more fantasy elements of it. It plays out a bit like a smarter Disney story. It seems fitting that Disney would acquire the rights to make a film version of the story. While it has a lot of cerebral moments, I could see this in the vein of Dark Crystal or Labyrinth; one of those edgier family films from the 1980s. Lets see how this new A Wrinkle in Time does.Young Meg Murry (played by Storm Reid) is a brilliant, but depressed and aggressive middle schooler who is still trying to deal with that her father NASA scientist Dr. Alex Murry (played by Chris Pine) had gone missing four years earlier. She has only her younger brother and prodigy Charles Wallace (played by Deric McCabe) and mother Dr. Kate Murry (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw). During an evening at home, their visited by the eccentric Mrs. Whatsit (played by Reese Witherspoon) who tells them that \"tesseracting\" is possible. This puts the family into a shock, but seem to leave it alone as a strange visit.The next day, Meg, Charles-Wallace, and fellow friend Calvin (played by Levi Miller) once again encounter Mrs. Whatsit, this time along with the quoting Mrs. Who (played by Mindy Kaling) and godlike Mrs. Which (played by Oprah Winfrey). The three women reveal that their father is on a distant planet somewhere in the universe and is up to these three kids to \"tesseract\" with them to find them. They end up visiting several worlds and strange people including the Happy Medium (played by Zach Galifinakis) and the evil Red (played by Michael Pe\u00f1a).This new version of A Wrinkle in Time tries to do a lot with it's short running time, but unfortunately makes me debate whether the book was that good to begin with. To begin with, this only follows the book loosely. It's the same plot of finding our character's father, but the encounters are different. That wouldn't matter if it helped the story, but many of the changes neither make sense or devalue what the book was better at. To be fair, A Wrinkle in Time could have not been easy to adapt. It's clear that director Ava DuVernay (Selma) wants to transport her audience to new worlds. And to be honest, the visuals and art direction look stunning. In fact, I might have liked this movie more if it would have taken it's time to show us these worlds, and let the atmosphere tell the story. She's trying to do this, but each scene seems to flow at a quick pace, almost like their fast-forwarding to the next sequence. They'll show Meg getting in trouble...next. The kids go to a colorful world...next. Kids go to the evil world...next. Having a lack of focus might have benefited A Wrinkle in Time. The story itself, aside from having major pacing issues, has such a convoluted execution, that it still feels dated. Without giving anything away, this is another movie where \"love\" is the answer. Think of it as a kid friendly version of Inception. While it's not that their trying to make it work, but perhaps this is something was simply better on paper. The acting even suffers. Oprah is playing herself, Reese Witherspoon is in need of direction, and the boy who plays Charles Wallace is really bad. I'm not sure if it's the writing or the actor, but this kid only seems to be emulating a smart alec rather then a true prodigy. The only ones who does exceptional work is Storm Reid as Meg and Chris Pine.I'll give this four copies of A Wrinkle in Time novels out of ten. Sad to say that despite having a Disney-like story, this has no idea what it wants to be. It gets a lot of points for some neat visuals and style, but the story, the most essential thing to a movie, has the distinction of feeling pandering and confused. Perhaps children will see something else, but this is one book I'm keeping closed.",

            "content": "There's no denying the importance that this movie may have for some audiences. The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.I walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.I've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.There are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.4.0/10",

            "content": "Another weekend, another literary classic to be remade by the lovely folks in La La Land. The movie world continues to scrape deep for the next big fad, Disney brings A Wrinkle in Time to life, ready to unleash magic into the world. With super star Oprah Winfrey backing the project and a number of stars to further support the film, and potentially bring in the big bucks. Does it succeed, or should you just read the book? Robbie K here to provide some insight into the movies ad guide your experience. Let's get started!LIKES:The Acting: With a star-studded cast, one hopes for brilliant performances and Wrinkle in Time has some impressive displays of the theater arts. Storm Reid's career has started off well in this movie, a nice blend of passion fighting pessimism in a manner that feels very much like the whiney preteen age. Her fellow child actors are impressive, but the adult casts' experience manages to shine forth. Oprah's words re limited, but her regality comes across well in her performance. Mindy Kaling's lines are a little more dynamic, again executed to be entertaining, and while wise, not the most engaging of characters. It's actually Reese Witherspoon who was my favorite, bringing the most spunk, comedy, and character to the movie. Her chemistry with the cast was fantastic and her abilities certainly charmed much of the movie. The Morals: Like the book, the movie has a fantastic repertoire of lessons to teach the young audience members targeted by the film. A Wrinkle in Time greatly praises the concept of hope, imbedding the driving, divine light of inspiring others to better themselves and motivate them to fight. It's focus on utilizing the positive to combat the negative emotions is something this world could easily learn from, and even more so in the ability to accept one's faults and praise one's strengths. While a bit preachy in the dialog, the movie has those emotional moments to absolutely sell those life lessons and perhaps promote the next great person for them to endorse. Still, use this movie as a means to educate those in the way of values of self-worth. The Visuals: What can I say, the best part of this movie is the fantastic world building is the world building this movie brought to the silver screen. A Wrinkle in Time's selling point is how beautiful the art department made all their characters and settings. While the realistic Earth scenes are a cavalcade of traditional settings, the real majesty comes when our heroes begin to bend reality. First the costumes of the misses are incredible, as their personalities erupt to life on each planet they visit. Makeup and costume blend together perfectly, truly bringing out the beauty of each entity and reflecting their personal view of each world. And once the costumes are recognized, the creation of the dimensional galaxy gets even better. My favorite planet is the Flower planet (as advertised on the trailers) as it blended all the color and visual stunning goodness into one area. However, there are plenty of other things hidden in behind the trailers to be impressed with. \nDISLIKES:The Story: It starts off so strong, but soon the plot takes a major hit in quality because of how rushed it feels. Once the traveling begins, the movie's plot hits a major break and takes a mighty plunged into rushed territory. Character development, major plot hits, even the mighty antagonist were all kind of bland in this movie, never reaching the full steam past girl power junction. Why such a literature classic could not build up steam I don't know, but sadly this movie didn't quite have all it took to be exciting. A bit annoying: The movie has plenty of cute, kid friendly gimmicks, but my word does it crush over into some rather annoying things. The most annoying for me was how often they repeat the name Charles Wallace, a not only obnoxious name, but an obnoxious calling that was used every five seconds. As picky as this sounds, I quickly got annoyed at how lackluster the name was and how it was used unnecessarily in every context. Better luck next time in dialog adaptation guys, perhaps next time you'll learn how to substitute a name with better descriptions. The Simplistic Journey: You might be thinking Disney would pour their hearts into making an interdimensional journey with some style, class and flare their studios can brings. Sadly, the movie itself still seems to fail in this department for me. Three worlds make up the entire leg of the journey and while they each have some magic of their own it didn't feel like quite a detective journey. So many worlds were reduced to a blurry montage that lasted less than a minute depriving me of a scavenger hunt in order to fit into the two-hour runtime package. With their studio they could have much better on this aspect to extend the mystery, perhaps adding their own leeway and integration of cosmic powers to uncover the clues to finding dear old dad. Nope, again the movie is just a sad, sad display of tempting visuals and rushed plot. The Anticlimactic End: Again, there is buildup up to how deadly the darkness is and how it will be hunting for our heroes at every turn. So maybe you might hope that the big, bad, black void had some actual tricks up its sleeve to hinder the young warriors' journey. Again, the movie has little exciting climax to act as an impasse, a few emotional shadows and musical sores to try to illicit a response. However, there is little threat behind the darkness void, which symbolic as it can be is a boring end to what was supposed to be a crossing of the universe. Sorry, but I expect my shadows to have a little more bite and might when they threaten to plague the universe. The result is a cute, but rather dull finale to one of the most epic tales of the literature adapted world. The VERDICT: Wrinkle in Time feels like a child's version of Annihilation, but without the unique and twists the genre could really have used. It certainly isn't awful as some may say, with good acting and world building to bring forth an emotional telling of valuable ethics and morals. Yet, the movie does not meet the expectations placed by the book, for the story has been watered down into a hokey, gimmick filled manhunt that failed to reach its full potential. Perhaps the director's cut will go into more details with the abandoned worlds, but I doubt extra time will be able to bring the full might this movie needed to match the literary work. Not the worst movie to grace the theater, but outside of visuals and some acting, I think this one can be held until home viewing. My scores are: Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 7.0\nMovie Overall: 5.5",

            "content": "It is strange to see a huge budget family movie like this fail to achieve any of its own goals on such an epic scale. Saying that A Wrinkle in Time lacks compelling interest would be an understatement. It is a cosmically underwhelming film peppered with expensive yet empty visuals. In fact, it is often straight up boring as it moves through several scenes of superfluous waxing philosophic about the nature of time, love, and good vs evil. These little narrations use up movie time and replace any real development of story and character. Ultimately it makes for a rather tedious film to sit through.\nActors... hmm. The big surprise for me was that Oprah struck me as the weakest in this department. It didn't help that her boring delivery and rather emotionless expressions are contrasted by these stagey costumes, hair, and makeup that would be well suited for a 1970s disco star. But this brings up a problem with all the witches: they don't look like witches, they look like actors in absurd costumes. If I lived next door to these people and they showed up at my house, I wouldn't be concerned in the least, because it would be so overtly obvious that my supposedly \"strange\" neighbors were really just theater people who pretend their real lives are their stage characters. Too fake. As for everyone else, they were relatively ok I guess, when considering what they had to work with.\nAside from needing a totally different script, I think the core problem here is that the film never felt mysterious or surprising. The visuals never felt like anything beyond generically \"creative.\" Nothing was convincingly weird as it traverses between these supposedly cosmic characters and other dimensions, which ultimately made it exactly the opposite of what a story like this should be, and so it ends up as a predictable film on all fronts.",

Sometimes I really wish directors would let me see their movies before they released them so that I could point out some of the mistakes that could be quickly fixed.\nDeric McCabe as Charles Wallace is super cute, but sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.\nI couldn't understand a word Storm Reid was saying during the tornado scene in the woods.\nCliched scene where someone says, \"Do you trust me?\"\nMindy Kaling looked so awkward trying to run in her ridiculous dress. What was her character's purpose? She didn't actually do anything to help. \nOver-the-top make-up. The costumes were creative, but they looked like costumes.The \"Mrs's\" looked more fake than magical. \nYou don't need to pay extra money to see this in IMAX. It's fine on the regular screen. Better yet, watch it when it comes out on Netflix.\nThe dialogue may sound good in the book, but it's awkward in the movie.\nLots of close-ups that don't really work.\nA scene in the second trailer was completely cut out of the movie.\nI actually looked at the clock on my cell phone. That's never a good sign.\nThere's no real villain. There's only a wispy, menacing \"it.\" \nKids who haven't read the book might think that Oprah's character's name is Mrs. Witch.

I heard her speak to a room full of 10,000 a number of years ago at the California Governor's Conference for Women and she was mesmerizing.\nSurprisingly, some of the acting was not good by quite a few of the other actors too.

            "content": "Ava DuVernay is best known for her directing of \"Selma\", an excellent film about the civil rights struggle in Jim Crow-era Alabama. With AWIT, DuVernay appears to have tried to continue her personal civil rights march by way of creating a children's film that is chock-full of good messages for young girls, especially minority young girls.That's an honorable intention, but it's unfortunate that she decided to advance her agenda using the name of a well-known, well-loved children's book. Because that's what this is: DuVernay changed Madeleine L'Engle's story in severe ways to promote her own message instead of Ms. L'Engle's. DuVernay made the focal point of the story a young black girl's life struggles, which was not the point of the original novel. That would be fine if she had created something new and original, but a lot of people who grew up loving the original book were rightly disappointed or offended by the changed focus. The film also has a misanthropist (anti-male) slant that was off-putting to my family; none of the male characters are remotely competent, and nearly all of them betray the main character at some point (Murray disappears for four years, Calvin eats the beach food, Charles Wallace becomes the bad guy) or are simply evil in their own right (the It is... itself, Michael Pena kidnaps Charles Wallace, Calvin's dad is verbally abusive to him). Even male characters who are minor players are portrayed as helpless or ineffective (Zach Galifianakis's clueless guru, Principal Jenkins). The movie's heroes are all women, period, and that cannot be by accident. Just as telling is towards the end of the film when Ms. Who is naming off legendary heroes, all except one were non-white. Again, this cannot be by accident, and is just as wrong as it would have been if all the heroes she had named were white.There are plenty of other posts about the poor acting, awful pacing, lousy direction, and overuse of facial close-up shots (DuVernay uses close-ups with the same proliferation that J.J. Abrams uses lens flare), so I won't go into those here. Suffice it to say, this movie is AWIT in name only",

            "content": "Mucking around with cinematic adaptations of the precious prose from audiences' childhoods is somewhat of a minefield - for every Lord of the Rings triumph, there's an insulting travesty such as ... well... The Hobbit. Tragically, there's much more than a whiff of the latter in Disney's big-budget shot at breathing life into author Madeleine L'Engle's metaphysical whimsy. Ava DuVernay's A Wrinkle in Time is a bloated but sweet movie you desperately want to like, gosh darn it. Sadly, it's too unsalvageable to even defend as harmless children's entertainment - so cataclysmically off-base that, rather than rescue it from Camazotz, you'd probably go out of your way to maroon it there, and save everyone from the heartbreak of its existence. L'Engle's novel had a gentle otherworldliness in its whimsy, but the only thing 'otherworldly' in Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell's screenplay is that it reads like an extraterrestrial inhabitant clumsily trying to piece together how humans verbally communicate. The film drips with more grotesquely stale exposition than dialogue, with the unappetizing side order of characters reacting to the increasingly fantastic happenstances as if shot with tranquilizer darts, dopily shuffling from point to point without ever seemingly registering an emotional response. Fall into an immediate conversation about feelings with a boy you've never met? Already outlandish for a teenager. Travel across the universe with a passive-aggressive space-witch who eventually takes the form of a flying cabbage? Oh. Sure. Come face-to-face with the root of all unhappiness and evil in all multiverses? Meh. It almost defies belief that the director of the flooring, poignant Selma is capable of producing a film so shallow and emotionally stilted. It would normally play as charming to have a children's film bounce with the same episodic stream-of-consciousness of a child's storytelling, but DuVernay is never fully able to corral the playful lilt of L'Engle's gossamer, episodic plot. Instead, the film lurches from blandly dazzling planet to confusedly extraneous supporting character with nauseating, plodding incoherence. Loopy yogi Zach Galifianakis and charmingly threatening Michael Pe\u00f1a do their best to raise laughs with their awkwardly out-of-place cameos, but even they fail to distract from how flat the razzle-dazzle of each new alien landscape in between feels. The film's expensive-but-unsophisticated visual effects, are, at best, benignly underwhelming (and what little wonder is raised by their colourful panoramas is immediately extinguished by the unwanted musical accompaniment of an asinine pop remix). Similarly, the ludicrously kitschy costumes do nothing to dispel the aesthetic of tackiness (poor Oprah looks like she should be engaged in a ray gun battle with Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon). If this is what $100 million looks like, it's not money well spent. Things do pick up favourably upon our heroes' arrival at the forebodingly conformist alien hell-hole Camazotz. DuVernay excels at conjuring inventively creepy set pieces, some pushing the boundaries of what otherwise plays as a distinctly young children's film (perhaps a horror movie should be next on her docket?), and, briefly, the film is infused with the glimmer of actual stakes and emotional resonance. Naturally, it doesn't last long, losing steam with a stuttering dud of an ending, which takes all of the nonchalance of the (non)climax of L'Engle's novel, and drenches it with an uncomfortable excess of shouted sentiment (and if you thought the ending metaphysics of Interstellar were uncomfortable... hoo boy; just you wait), just in case the cloying moral hadn't quite sunk in yet. We almost relish the prospect of the children being tormented again as alternative. DuVernay attempts her own 'Wrinkle in Time' by fusing contemporary setting and sensibilities with the antiquated language and uncynical sentimentality of L'Engle's novel. Her intent, evidently, is to show how much our jaded, modern world could benefit from an infusion of more old-fashioned whimsy - which is pretty hard to argue with. Unfortunately, the pairing of quaintness and contemporary is a perennially dubious fit, the twain influences serving to best illustrate each other's worst qualities rather than complimenting each other (Charles Wallace delivering a chirpy, James Stewart-esq monologue attesting to Meg's inner greatness in the face of her post-feminist schoolyard bullies is one of the most cringeworthy movie moments of the past several years - but don't worry: it'll have plenty of company by the time the credits roll here). You can practically taste how driven DuVernay is to make A Wrinkle in Time a children's film with a strong pedagogical moral barometer, including commentary on abusive parents and eating disorders, but, sadly, her film is too much of a disjointed muddle for any real impactful content to stand out. Instead of elevated and inspired, audiences are, sadly, likely to emerge as far more cynical and hopeless than before. Even the film's impressive cast fail to elevate the overcooked, sinking ship of a film around them. Storm Reid feels like a fully authentic teenager (and is lackadaisically likeable in spite of that), but she's a tad too flat to sell her volcanic emotionality as a commanding presence - in short, more 'Meh' than 'Meg.' Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw easily steal the show, imbuing the film with its only dregs of emotion and charisma as her earnest scientist parents, but they're both too disappointingly underused to contribute all that much. As the trio of 'magical Mrs.,' Oprah, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, all feel simply uncomfortable, alternating unfunny banter with mawkish overacting and banal pep talks. Levi Miller is the dictionary definition of 'bland YA lead' as Meg's clumsily spontaneous love interest, while Deric McCabe is impressively adept at playing 'creepy child,' but is infuriatingly simpering as Meg's child genius brother. Time is a precious commodity in today's day and age. Unfortunately, Disney's latest doesn't so much Wrinkle as waste yours. Pundits may complain that 'they 'may not make 'em like they used to' - but, what we learn from A Wrinkle in Time is that, disappointingly, sometimes it's best not to try.  -4.5/10",

Here it's just straightforward good vs. evil.As to issue of depicting a biracial Meg, people have noted that representation matters (especially since it was merely assumed that Meg was white in the book). Some idiot on a cable news channel complained that Ava DuVernay cares more about political correctness than about making money for Disney (Earth to said idiot: the 1980s called and they want their mentality back).Basically, it's not any kind of great movie.

            "content": "A Wrinkle in Time is one of those books, that just makes an impact.This, whatever this was, wasn't what I read so long ago. It was not even CLOSE. The characters were changed beyond all recognition. For one thing, Charles Wallace is a genius who doesn't speak to people outside of his family. And the story, well I did not find one plot point or section of dialogue that was even related to A Wrinkle in Time. They focus this story more on Meg, she is not really the central focus.Moreover, A Wrinkle in Time is one of those books that elevates you. This had the reverse effect, it depressed me.I'm going to try to find the 2003 Made-for-TV version with Chris Potter, I have heard that, that version follows the book almost exactly. Is anyone with me? I found it and have started watching it, although it is cheaply made, it is made well and it tells the story a lot better than this.Even Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit kept true to a lot of Tolkien's ideas, and they mined the blazes out of the 'Appendices\" of that book, and also many of the companion books that had been written, including the official artwork and some of the music, from The Road goes Ever On, they used Tolkein's lyrics from that.But this? They went far away from what it was supposed to be. And if i recall correctly, Ms Who was not a human figure, she was some entity.I hope whoever wrote this travesty gets whatever they deserve.There was a genuine opportunity here to make this into something wonderful, and Disney just missed the point completely, tried to cater to children, and even lost THAT Audience. The 3 Star Wars Prequel films are more intelligent than this is, and that's making a huge statement. That's how bad this film is. This film should be excised from theatres immediately.And people who know my reviews, know that if even I despise something, then it is not worth seeing, because I usually love everything I see: It's hard to disappoint me. I always find something good in every film I review, this film has very few positive aspects. Mostly because they took the work and so substantively changed it, that it cannot be recognized.",

It follows the story of Meg Murry, her brother Charles Wallace and their friend Calvin who are on a journey with the aid of three mysterious ladies in order to find Meg's scientist father, who had disappeared for reasons unknown.I went into this movie with an open mind, as I haven't read the classic book before. I will admit that the people behind it tried, even if it was a mediocre effort. I found Meg's internal struggle where she has to deal with her father's disappearance during the first act very believable and even relatable. She deals with a loss of motivation, she shows negative emotion easily and even feels embarrassed by being herself. What makes this struggle feel relatable is that parallels can be drawn from it and having to deal with the loss of a loved one.I also thought the movie mostly looked great on an aesthetic level. I thought that it mostly utilized its use of CGI and effects well. These effects mostly gave the impression that we were being immersed in a beautiful world. On the other hand, the CGI and green-screening sometimes become too noticeable. That's incredibly bothersome since this is a big budgeted movie with an occasional cheap look to it.Aside from Meg, I wasn't fond of any of the other characters at all. The mysterious ladies were all decently acted, but I couldn't remember a thing about them because they were virtually devoid of any character. The other two kids just feel like one-note tropes. Charles Wallace is the smart-alecky genius of the group while Calvin is just the awkward kid who befriends Meg and barely offers anything to the story. I do remember him offering something minor to it, but nothing of any real importance. The only child actor who I thought was mostly putting in effort into their role was Storm Reid. McCabe on the other hand felt wooden throughout the entire film, but I can't blame him since his character was absolutely bland and obnoxious.Finally, as for the plot, it is mostly a bare-bone and linear plot. It is almost entirely about the journey to find Meg's father with some pieces thrown in. The first act was pretty good, where it explores Meg's internal conflict, but it gradually goes downhill as Meg and co. leave. My biggest storytelling issue has to be with the resolution. The way everything comes together makes absolutely no sense. I was just left confused as I sat in the theater thinking \"What just happened? I'm completely lost.\" I thought the resolution was horrible. I mean nothing traumatically horrible happens to the characters, but the execution of it was just all over the place.A Wrinkled in Time is simply a mess. There are good elements to this movie, there really are. The problem with them is that they're overshadowed by mediocre to terrible elements. Children will most likely enjoy the movie, but it's debatable on whether or not older folks would.4/10",

It's something about space traveling with use of the 5th dimension where one moves through the universe by using just his mind. Mr. And Mrs. Murry (Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw), two scientists, worked on this for years and are convinced it's possible. Until one day Mr. Murry actually disappears without a trace and leaves his family behind.And before they know it, three eccentric-looking, fairy-like women show up. They are called Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling). The three are a sort of space police who heard a cry for help and moved quickly through the universe to the spot where Meg (Storm Reid), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Murry, lives. And together with her brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and Calvin (Levi \"Better watch out\" Miller), Mr. Popularity at school, they're off on a rescue mission.This rescue mission leads them from one obscure and bizarre place to the other. From the colorful planet Uriel, where Mrs. Whatsit turns into a fluttering carpet with a face that looks like a gigantic sprout after she has conversed with a whole bunch of flying flowers. And they talk in color. For real? Yes really. Next, they arrive in a gloomy, dark world covered with clouds, with strangely stacked rock formations. Worlds with immensely sheepish creatures on stilts. And a spreading black smoke called Camazotz. Apparently, this cloud represents evil. And it's spreading rapidly in space. And all this can be seen in the company of a huge, giant Oprah Winfrey. Whether this has been done intentionally to justify her body weight or it's described like that in a book by Madeleine L'Engle, where this film is based on, I really don't know. But it looked absurd anyway.\"A wrinkle in time\" is a fantasy movie, with a gang of children on an adventure in deep space. It reminded me sometimes of Wonka's chocolate factory where every room was a new surprise as well. Only this film is not the same as its other Disney predecessors. Even though every Disney production is clearly aimed at a younger audience, there was always a bit of magic that appealed to adults as well. To be honest: I always have and still can enjoy a Disney movie. Well, this is the first film of them where I can't agree with that fact. I was really annoyed at certain moments. The cacophony of colors and the absurdity of places where they traveled to, felt really exaggerated. The moralistic messages are a bit exorbitant and theatrical. Sometimes it was a bit too obvious. Or did the makers feel the need to give the youth of today an educational kick in the pants to draw their attention to those certain values in life again? A lesson about good and evil. And furthermore, being different doesn't mean that you are an outsider and that it's not normal to be scorned by others.No, this Disney film wasn't my cup of tea. I even thought it was just plain boring. Despite the fact the cast is filled with some famous stars, the acting itself was sometimes even laughable. Even a bonding with the characters was missing. So I really didn't care in the end whether they would be catapulted through the universe or not. The only one of the three cosmic goddesses who could charm me was Reese Witherspoon. And that because of her brutal attitude and a big mouth. Maybe fans of the book will be excited while watching this film. If, however, it was the intention to proclaim the message about goodness and equality, it might have been better if they didn't make a spectacle out of it.",

I am not a youth ages 10-14.A WRINKLE IN TIME follows the story of Meg, a young girl who's father has gone missing. With the help of mysterious figures Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who, Meg goes in searching for her father - through space and time - and ends up helping to save the universe in the process.As Directed by DuVernay (SELMA), this WRINKLE is fantastical in all ways, starting with the visuals I don't know how much was spent on this film, but all of it is on the screen as the images - and imagery - are fascinating to look at, the costumes are unique (to say the least) and the story is simple enough for even a young person to follow.And that might be enough to hold the attention of a 10-14 youth - it wasn't enough for me.If you start to really follow the plot (what there was of it) and the intentions in the scenes, items start to not add up at all. While I understood Meg's motivations - to find her Dad - well enough, NONE of the other character's motivations - and intentions - were clear, or made sense. At one point, a character turns from good to bad (or was it vica-versa) and it just didn't make any sense.I think a lot of this issue was the 3 big stars that were cast as the benevolent overseers for Meg's journey. Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kahling and, yes, Oprah Winfrey as Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which (respectively). Their role in this adventure (I guess) is to guide and help Meg on her adventure, so they were supposed to be loving, caring and gentle with just a hint of secretness (so, I guess that Meg can figure things out for herself - kind of like Glinda the Good Witch in the Wizard of Oz). But, instead, they come off as smug, annoying know-it-alls who are purposely keeping key information from this young girl - if I was around, I would have called the police on them. Also...they all seemed to be acting in their own movies, so their styles just didn't mesh, as well as the acting styles of other \"stars\" like Michael Pena and (especially) Zach Galifinakas - I don't know what they heck he was doing, but Director DuVernay did a poor job of reigning him in or helping him to create any kind of semblance of character.A fantastical feature with eye-popping visuals and, I'm afraid, poorly written, acted and directed. This might be enough for an enjoyable afternoon in the theater for the target audience.It wasn't for me - and, I think, my front runner for WORST FILM OF 2018.Letter Grade C (for the visuals and the always appealing performance of Chris Pine, who - I have to admit - I have a man crush on).4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",

The story never quite achieves its obvious goal (which I won't spoil here but will become apparent soon into the film).

Was this made for 5-year olds and someone forgot to mention that to the adult paying audience?As such, it's neither a terrible film-- nor a good one. It's too frightening for younger children and too ludicrous for older ones. They just pretty much miss the mark in every way, relying too heavily on big-name stars and not nearly enough on good story, script, and film-making. While it might serve as an after-school special, it doesn't really qualify as big-screen fare. It is obvious from the ratings that this movie leaves the average viewer disappointed and unimpressed.",

            "content": "A wrinkle in time is what you get when you take really dense source material with multiple themes both grounded and philosophical and strip it down to its bare bones. A simple story that's almost completely incomprehensible. The basic story is that of a heroine, a thirteen year old girl named Meg (played by Storm Reid) who needs to be reunited with her father and wants to be accepted for who she is. She's accompanied along the way by her little brother and a cute boy from school, neither of whom are main protagonists in the movie.That sounds simple enough right..? It's not. The movie's a mess because the main plot and theme are weighed down by elements (strange characters, strange worlds, heavy themes) that are poorly established or completely ignored, leaving the viewer having to work hard to sift through all the nonsensical mumbo jumbo to follow along. What's happening? Who are these ladies? What are these worlds? What does it all mean? These are things that should have be established early in the movie but weren't. There's a reason that movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, The Matrix, Wonder Woman, have a lot of exposition and world building early on. A scene set in the past... a character who just vomits exposition... a prologue scene... all to set the stage. To avoid confusing the audience further afield. That's really the main reason the movie just doesn't work. There are some others, but they aren't as serious as the movies scripting issues.Storm Reid was solid as Meg, and the two other child actors Levi Miller (as Calvin the teenage would be love interest) and Deric McCabe (as Charles Wallace the younger brother) were both okay. Miller was given little to do. McCabe should have been given a larger role in the movie to make the third act actually compelling. I suspect that if the people behind casting the movie had gotten a better actor for the role instead of casting for ethnicity, the character would have played a much larger role in the film. The movie really needed it.The one thing, the only thing this movie did well was deliver on its message of empowering young kids, especially girls, and more to the point young girls of color. The aim that was no doubt spearheaded by Director Ava Duvernay and Screenwriter Jennifer Lee: accept yourself for who you are and don't let other people define who you are. That's basically the gist of this movie, and that's a great message to send to kids. Too bad the execution from the aforementioned was otherwise horrendous.A few other likes: Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the parents. They both did really well with the screen-time given. They were likable, believable, and empathetic. There was also a terrific visual sequence early in the film that was really cool looking, like something out of The Wizard of Oz. loved it. And I also enjoyed a certain key character moment given to Storm Reid's Meg that ties into what I said about the filmmakers message. But as far as likes go, that's it.I would only recommend A Wrinkle in Time if you have a daughter(s) or are a young girl/teen. The message is one worth seeing for them, even if the movie sucks. For everyone else: PASS.",

This emotionally riveting fantasy is rich in cinematic photography reminiscent of the multi-million dollar blockbuster Avatar (2009) and the creative spectacle of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). At the same time, this movie incorporates the powerful and uneasy confrontation with betrayal and evil with its parallelism to the fascinating fantasy world of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and the darker horror classic The Omen (1976). But more poignant comparisons might be the quantum transpersonal love of Interstellar (2014) and The Neverending Story (1984) based on an international best seller novel by German writer Michael Ende that addresses a fat boy who is bullied and finds himself transported into fantasy world to face \"the nothingness.\"This amazing movie besides tapping into the female power of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, a young female starlet, Storm Reid, as Meg gets to be front and center in coping with school bullying and the grief of the sudden and unexplained disappearance four years ago of her scientist father played by Chris Pine. A sometimes difficult movie to experience because of its sharp inclusion of the insidious power of evil, the uneasy transformation from a light hearted fantasy into the clutches of an ominous, unbalancing sense of dread, A Wrinkle in Time presents its important belief in family and love in a time of societal turmoil when good and evil seems to be present in America today. Perhaps this movie touches too close to home for some, but nevertheless, this movie can offer up a vital and essential experience and message to address today's conflicted populace with hope and vision of a possible tomorrow.",

I suspect that many of the reviews calling the film \"utter trash\" are very much politically-motivated.That being said, another sad truth of the matter is this: \"A Wrinkle In Time\" is not a very good film, either. It is pretty bland all the way through and often seems a bit too preachy or heavy-handed than what it needed to be. Hence, a \"right down the middle\" 5/10 ranking seems in order, which is exactly what I gave it.For a basic plot summary, \"Wrinkle\" follows the journey of Meg (Storm Reid), Calvin (Levi Miller), & Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) on their intergalactic question to find Dr. Murray (Chris Pine), the scientist father of Meg & Charles who disappeared one night and hasn't been seen in three years since. The travels of the trio are helped along by the enigmatic \"Mrs.\", those being Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), and Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling).Generally speaking, I thought that this film hemmed close enough (at least for me) to Madeline L'Engle's original novel. Besides some of the material on Camazotz being changed, it seemed like a pretty good match. The big problem here, though, is that \"Wrinkle\" seems far more intent on pushing the message of positivity and linking it to current social/political events than it does actually fostering a really interesting screenplay or story.Now, don't get me wrong: I like the positive message of the film, and in all honesty I think it will play a lot better to youngsters than it will to my 32-year old self (this is an adaptation of a YA novel, after all). But I just think it throws the baby out with the bathwater to a certain extent in the way it seems to gloss over certain story points in order to cement its overall message.What this creates a film that is filled with diverse characters, positive messages, and uplifting themes...but is so bland to watch for anyone with any film sophistication whatsoever that it doesn't succeed on any artistic level. Besides Witherspoon acting her heart out (as per the usual), the acting choices seem a bit odd and stunted. Nothing to ever aid in the emotional investment needed to truly care about these characters.The bottom line for me, I guess, is that I felt this adaption of \"Wrinkle in Time\" stressed its message over its ability to really craft a great piece of cinema, and I would argue that the latter is always more important than the former (no matter how great the message is). In the business of cinema, a film won't have the desired effect (no matter how much the filmmakers wish it) if it it messily constructed, and \"Wrinkle In Time\" most certainly is that.So, I'm grading this one right down the middle. Just good enough to appeal to kids or very inexperienced theater-goers, but not nearly good enough for anyone else.",

The essence of the film is the CGI effects, the blazing colors, the over-the-top characters, the disconnected episodes of the continuity. (Just hunting for a missing father isn't enough.} Storm Reid is wonderful as Meg. She has had quite a bit of experience, so she was ready for the job. Just the right amount of cynicism and wonder to lead her down the right path. Levi Miller as Calvin (a wonderful actor most recently remembered from the title role in PAN, the Hugh Jackman starrer) made the most out of a poorly drawn role. His function had much more importance than the writer gave it, and he brought as much to it as he could. Deric McCabe lurched between the endearing and off-putting sequences of his role as Charles Wallace. McCabe is a lightly experienced actor who shows signs of a promising career. Charles Wallace was a bit more than he could handle gracefully; his transitions were too abrupt. The surrealistic characters are a bit much. On the printed page, they allow for individual interpretation - embellishment if you will. On screen, they are immediately locked in. Oprah Winfrey can be a wonderful actress (The Color Purple, The Butler). Here, she is not. Mrs Which - a name that unfortunately - when spoken - can only conjure up something else - should be an over-abiding presence. The character should not scream Oprah Winfrey, and this portrayal did. (I don't know how it could have been avoided; she is too well-known.) Several other African-American actresses would have served much more effectively. Reese Witherspoon, as Mrs Whatsit, found a way to do her flighty impersonation. It was empathetic; it should have been endearing. Only Mindy Kaling, as Mrs Who - usually at her very least, annoying - was surprisingly comforting and accessible, not once straying into the obnoxious qualities of her TV persona. The prerequisite parent characters: Gugu Mbatha-Raw (given a totally impermeable character which she couldn't/didn't improve on) and Chris Pine, little seen and totally underused (actually wasted). There is a lot of trite dialogue, some handled well, other lines horribly obvious and awkward.

            "content": "Everyone seems to be throwing shade on Disney for being too attached to franchises and not doing anything original. They are definitely a studio that recycles ideas and makes them into unique new things, so they are always worthy of applause, no matter how familiar one of their films may seem. I was very much looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time. I had no prior knowledge of its source material, so I was seeing it as an original film that was hitting theatres sometime soon. That time has now come, and although I'm something who tries to see the best in every film that I watch, there's no denying that this one just doesn't quite feel right. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, but here's why it fails to reach its potential on multiple occasions. After her father disappears and ends up somewhere distant in the universe, his daughter Meg is sent by three women on a quest through time and space to locate him. Accompanied by her younger brother Charles Wallace and newfound friend Clavin, the three of them embark on a strange journey across the universe. With unique visuals surround each and every scene and a fantastic performance by Storm Reid in the leading role, the epic scale, and emotional impact are truly what will win over the viewers. Aside from those elements, this is a fairly sloppy movie that tries a little too hard to be unique. Without ruining the film, it relies very heavily on the character of Charles Wallace to heighten certain aspects of the story. For that reason, the film suffers from a few laughable lines of dialogue, due to the fact that Deric McCabe may not have been the right kid to cast in this particular role. I was taken out of many dramatic moments, simply because I just wasn't buying into the way he was delivering his lines. On top of that, the three goddesses in Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey are present for a purpose, but they could've easily been excluded from the film once they bring the main characters to the places they need to be. They're quite annoying and simply unnecessary when it came to the story itself. Witherspoon was solid, but that's only because she had more things to do with her role than the others. The most frustrating part about this film is that Chris Pine is great in this movie and the conclusion of the third act felt earned and I found myself emotionally invested and caring about certain characters. The reason that aspect of the film is frustrating is that the film deviates too much from his character and it just feels like it drags quite a while before reaching him. That's a huge problem, especially when reflecting on the fact that the runtime is a mere 109 minutes. In the end, A Wrinkle in Time may have been a much better film with a few re-writes and about 20-30 minutes added on in order to expand the world a little more. The editing felt choppy at times, certain characters appear in places without explanation, and the solid visuals aren't enough to elevate the sloppy plot execution. Yes, there are a few great performances and the core story is worth watching, but there are too many problems surrounding that element to really send anyone out to see this in theatres. This is a neat and complex idea that would've worked as a much grander and elongated epic.

            "content": "Meg Murray (Storm Reid) and her little brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) embark on a cosmic journey to find their missing father (Chris Pine). Joined by Meg's classmate Calvin O'Keefe (Levi Miller) and guided by the three mysterious astral travelers known as Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), the children brave a dangerous journey to a planet that possesses all of the evil in the universe.Our take: It's pretty enough to see in theaters.\nPost credit scene? No.While Wrinkle has its flaws and it may miss a few marks, it is ultimately an enjoyable 109 minutes. Director Ava DuVernay takes the viewers on a journey and if they allow themselves to suspend their disbelief and remember what it is like to be a child, it's an undeniably gratifying, beautiful, and inspired movie.First of all, Disney stretched their production budget as far as they needed to and it is clear that no expense was spared. From the celestial couture of the \"Mrs.\" and their frequent extravagant costume changes to the sweeping CGI landscapes and the shimmering waves of the \"tesser\" this production team really outdid itself in spectacular fashion. The visuals alone make it worthwhile and certainly worthy of a trip to the theater.There's no denying that Wrinkle is a story that played well when it was written originally in the 1960's, nestled in the pages of a book that you might have read in the 4th grade. It's an easy read, but a hard movie to bring to the screen. The plot of the book is choppy, and the film stayed true to that, making sharp jumps from mesmerizing planet to planet, as well as scene to scene. There are some departures from the source material that seemed to be an attempt at overcoming the issues with the narrative therein, but it was clear that it hurt more than it helped. And while there weren't any gaping holes in the plot, there are quite a few moments that don't seem to make a whole lot of sense - even though we've read the book. But bridging the gaps in the narrative seemed to take a backseat to reinforcing the overall themes of the film, and perhaps that's okay.The end result is a film that's completely digestible, regardless of the issues it might have. Every performance is strong, the message is powerful, and it makes strides for diversity and representation. As we said in our Annihilation review, we are all for smart, POC women taking the screen in roles as doctors and scientists, and in this case, a twelve-year-old physics prodigy that learns to love her natural hair.Featuring: An immaculate performance by Reese Witherspoon. And one cannot ignore Disney's typical outstanding ability to sound mix, perfectly matching the orchestral arrangements to the mood in every scene, down to the second.",

            "content": "'A Wrinkle in Time', Disney's next blockbuster book adaptation done by newcomer director, Ava DuVernay staring Storm Reid, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Chris Pine. Director wise the film is beautiful with its fun filled world and well constructed sceneries with beautiful creatures and unique action sequences too. But the directing is where I get worried, it almost felt like the film overuses visuals to attempt to get audiences to forget that there's a story to tell in this film with scenes that last almost ten minutes with no purpose for the story or character progression. And these scenes have little to no dialogue so it's purely director driven in these. Yes they look beautiful but they don't pay any purpose for this film. And the first act is very clunky with its introduction to many characters and ignoring a lot of blaring questions that should be answered for the audience to have at least a little of connection to the story minus the A list cast. (Later I'll talk about the third act though in the Script section.) Acting wise, every comes strong with this film. Each character is either mysterious, comical, or carry extremely wise words that translate to today flawlessly. By far my favorite performance in the film had to be Reese with her constantly changing her mind and quirkiness too. Overall all the actors though were good but some of them felt underused or irrelevant in this film though as just 'fill in' characters or people to just have a respectable role for an A list actor. And viewing the film it struggles to tell what characters give importance to the story or are just there for a laugh for a familiar face. The script is by far the weakest part of the film with extremely long scenes of exposition and ironically a lack of actual explanation of a lot of scenes and why a lot of events occur in this film. Much of the dialogue delivered by a handful of characters don't feel natural, some of it is because of bad acting and others is from a robotic script. I found a few scenes in this film to be boring honestly with its use of visuals that either make no sense, or once again give nothing to the story. And the third act gives a half fast ending and no real explanation on why most of the film occurs. Leaving a lot of plot holes and fans confused as to why their favorite book from their childhood is being adapted so poorly. The film comes off of as a mess in many different categories and left me and a lot of fans and critics not satisfied and confused when the credits begin to roll. A Wrinkle in Time gets a 4.25/10",

Thank God I didn't buy a ticket when it came out.Well, here we go. First, the movie is a fantasy, right? So, what's a fantasy? It's something really impossible, magical, incredible, that would never happen, but the storytelling job is to make you believe that it could happen. Am I right? But here's the thing, the movie definitely does not make you believe a thing. You're never invested on the characters, in fact, you're never entertained by it! Really, we could go even further, and say that you don't even know what the heck the film is about. They've failed miserably on doing a fantasy movie.The CGI. My Goood! The CGI! They say the movie's budget was something around 100 million dollars. But, really, the \"climax\" reminded me of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (yes, it's that bad sometimes).The soundtrack is awful, there isn't a \"line\" that they followed, it seemed just a bunch of sounds put together.The story is just confusing, everything happens so oddly fast. Like, the guy randomly shows up where they are, and, what? Was it some force of the universe that we never hear about later? I really don't even know what to say, until some point half way through the movie, I didn't even know what it was about.And, well, we would eventually get to that. The kids. Yes, the acting is bad, really bad, the girl (Storm Reid), and the little boy (Deric McCabe), who are the main character of the film, aren't good here. But, let me say this, I do not blame them for that, this one is on the director, and the people who casted them. You can just give the 7 years old boy 15 minutes of monologues if he can't handle it. In fact, McCabe was fine in the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but when he stars to have more and more lines... just didn't work. The girl is bad from the beginning to the end. I hope it's just the director here and she has some talent. The other boy (Levi Miller) is just fine, he doesn't have that much lines, so it's ok.So, in order to not seem I'm just bashing on the movie. There is once really good sequence (is probably one or two minutes long, you might found it on YouTube), is when they talked about what \"the it\" is really about, and we see the whole \"evil\" that is on humankind. But this makes me even more upset, cause here is the potential that the movie had! I saw the attempts to have messages throughout the entire movie, but they just never work.I would say that the adult actors are fine. There are indeed lots of talent actors here. Man, this movie could have been just awesome! But sadly, it isn't.Well, to sum up, A Wrinkle in Time had potential but it stilled on paper, and it's a shame. I have to say, if you didn't see it yet. Don't. Just don't.2,5/10",

She became a producer, I learned after 2 years of college calculus that it just wasn't for me after all and went on to other things. But we both continued to love the book 56 years later. What everyone who reads the book and watches the movie needs to understand is the need to view it from the eyes of much younger person. I see reviews by adults. I have yet to see a review by an 11-year-old. So, since I went to see it with my daughter and my 11-year-old granddaughter, I interviewed them and my 9-year-old and 7-year-old granddaughters to get their opinion of the movie. Here it is: \"It was great!\"\nEven my 2-year-old grandson who is the definition of squirmy, sat on his mom's lap and watched the wonder and magic of it all. \nIs it hard to follow if you haven't read the book-yes, so read the book. Does it assume you will listen and pay attention to what is going on-yes, so put down your phone, stop talking, and pay attention.

Is Meg the hero-yes, she is because she doesn't give up, she is stubborn, and she knows what is important. I would give this a 9 because it could have done a better job of tying in the title with the mode of travel-tesseract. They really needed the ants on a string analogy.

As the movie is based on an acclaimed novel, which indeed is, it's not the fault of the story, but the fault lies on how the script has been adapted. It is true that is not an easy story to adapt to the big screen and less easy is to addapt it to a film under two hours. The fault doesn't specifically lie on which things have been prioritized before others and which things have been changed (skin colors, gender, character with more weight, characters that disappear). The things that have been changed aren't the cause of the failure of this movie, but most of the problem is which parts of the story have been shown and how long have been presented to the audience. While the book keeps going at a fast pace, never stopping, never letting you breath, the movie goes fast in some aspects that should be taken more slowly and goes really slowly in some aspects that should be gone in two seconds.Plus, the movie seem like a Oprah show. Why is she taking so much screen? (literally speaking, if you have watched the movie you will know what I am talking about). It's ok to put black actors on the screen to appeal to a bigger audience, but please, the main character is the girl, not Oprah's characters.

            "content": "Everyone seems to be throwing shade on Disney for being too attached to franchises and not doing anything original. They are definitely a studio that recycles ideas and makes them into unique new things, so they are always worthy of applause, no matter how familiar one of their films may seem. I was very much looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time. I had no prior knowledge of its source material, so I was seeing it as an original film that was hitting theatres sometime soon. That time has now come, and although I'm something who tries to see the best in every film that I watch, there's no denying that this one just doesn't quite feel right. Not to say this is a bad movie by any means, but here's why it fails to reach its potential on multiple occasions.After her father disappears and ends up somewhere distant in the universe, his daughter Meg is sent by three women on a quest through time and space to locate him. Accompanied by her younger brother Charles Wallace and newfound friend Clavin, the three of them embark on a strange journey across the universe. With unique visuals surround each and every scene and a fantastic performance by Storm Reid in the leading role, the epic scale, and emotional impact are truly what will win over the viewers. Aside from those elements, this is a fairly sloppy movie that tries a little too hard to be unique.Without ruining the film, it relies very heavily on the character of Charles Wallace to heighten certain aspects of the story. For that reason, the film suffers from a few laughable lines of dialogue, due to the fact that Deric McCabe may not have been the right kid to cast in this particular role. I was taken out of many dramatic moments, simply because I just wasn't buying into the way he was delivering his lines.On top of that, the three goddesses in Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Oprah Winfrey are present for a purpose, but they could've easily been excluded from the film once they bring the main characters to the places they need to be. They're quite annoying and simply unnecessary when it came to the story itself. Witherspoon was solid, but that's only because she had more things to do with her role than the others.The most frustrating part about this film is that Chris Pine is great in this movie and the conclusion of the third act felt earned and I found myself emotionally invested and caring about certain characters. The reason that aspect of the film is frustrating is that the film deviates too much from his character and it just feels like it drags quite a while before reaching him. That's a huge problem, especially when reflecting on the fact that the runtime is a mere 109 minutes.In the end, A Wrinkle in Time may have been a much better film with a few re-writes and about 20-30 minutes added on in order to expand the world a little more. The editing felt choppy at times, certain characters appear in places without explanation, and the solid visuals aren't enough to elevate the sloppy plot execution. Yes, there are a few great performances and the core story is worth watching, but there are too many problems surrounding that element to really send anyone out to see this in theatres. This is a neat and complex idea that would've worked as a much grander and elongated epic. Ava Duvernay is a fantastic director that tried a little too hard to impress here and I truly hate to have to admit that about this promising storyline.

Although this is supposedly an adaptation of a children's book that has compassionate deep Christian overtones, the movie really screws with you automatically and it becomes less and less of an adaptation. The movie does have Reese Witherspoon as a character named Mrs. Whatsit and Chris Pine, along with Oprah Winfrey, but this movie stars a little known actress named Storm Reid who plays Meg, a socially awkward outcast with glasses, but because she has glasses doesn't make you an outcast. Her dad, Dr Alex Murray (Pine) disappears and she's teased for it. WOW! Not only that, she's bullied, but Winfrey plays a character named Mrs. Which, who is a giant. This movie may look nice, but the story didn't hold my interest. I really don't know how to make a movie with this big and unreasonable source material, as I'm sure it could have been done better than this. I appreciate Witherspoon though.

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this is one of those movies with a great trailer but fails to deliver come showtime. You are free to leave while you still can because it's gonna get ugly from here on out.Based on the science fantasy novel of the same name released in 1962, it follows the story of Meg who aided by three mythical beings go on a quest to find her missing father. Classic plot enough to bring in the dollar for Disney, right? On top of that, you got a great cast featuring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and even Michael Pena but just the same they weren't enough to save the movie from \"tessering\" to disaster territory.First the positives: Chris Pine was able to give great acting even though he was given barely anything to work with. I once outrightly dismissed him after seeing him in 'Just My Luck', back in 2006 when Lindsay Lohan was still a thing. He's steadily improved since, between 'This Means War', 'Wonder Woman' and now this. Also worth mentioning is 8yr old Fil-American Deric McCabe who played Charles Wallace. Yes there were some annoying moments (such as the confrontation in the white room) but he showed acting potential and we should see more of him in the future.Now the negatives: The story had so many loopholes and you would know this because you'd wonder about something and even though the cast is just standing there talking no one is explaining it to you. Editing was poorly done and if I had to take a guess I would surmise it's because there weren't a lot of good takes to work with. Even the soundtrack didn't work. I mean I love Sade but the song they chose did not give the feels for the scene they used it for.Lastly the so-sos: Oprah was Oprah, Reese was also Reese and I'm kinda mixed about her performance, like I'm seeing a preview of what to expect in Legally Blonde 4. Mindy, again was the token diversity actress, but that's a progress, from African-Americans we're moving to Asians. In addition, the family in the book was changed from Caucasian to Multiracial in the movie, and I also read somewhere that the book's Christian undertones were heavily edited and they used neutral terms such as light and darkness. While being inclusive opens up more opportunities for everyone, it feels like they spent too much time focusing on that instead of the story therefore it felt forced rather than letting it happen naturally.I'd like to say that this is your usual Disney movie and go watch with your kids, but honestly just watch the trailer and proceed to the next movie on your list.",

            "review_title": "A well-intentioned mess that manages to be weird - and yet also not weird enough.",
            "content": "Since its publication in 1962, Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle In Time has gained a reputation for being unfilmable... for good reason. The book mixes science fiction and Christian theology in an epic odyssey across time, space and the universe - in ways that are endlessly charming to fans, and frustratingly messy to detractors. L'Engle's defiantly episodic tale provides as many pitfalls as opportunities for aspiring filmmakers - accordingly, director Ava DuVernay winds up getting about as much right as she gets wrong.Meg Murry (Storm Reid) - full of youth, self-loathing and abandonment issues - is the prickly heart of the film. It's been four years since her physicist dad (Chris Pine) disappeared, and Meg is still falling apart. But everything changes when her precocious six-year-old brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), invites a most peculiar stranger into their home. Before long, Mrs Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and her two equally unusual friends, Mrs Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs Which (Oprah Winfrey), invite the Murry siblings and their new friend, Calvin (Levi Miller), on a journey that will take them to the darkest corners of the galaxy - which might well include the very depths of their own souls.In narrative terms, A Wrinkle In Time makes the canny decision to focus firmly on Meg in moving the story forward. While Meg was also the primary protagonist in the book, L'Engle spent almost as much time dwelling on what made her two male companions so special. The film chooses to lavish more attention on Meg, allowing her and all her insecurities and contradictions to anchor the entire adventure. It's Meg whose undying devotion to her father knocks the travellers off-course, and Meg who refuses to give up when loss threatens to claim her loved ones.On this count, at least, the final result is something quite lovely. Meg is achingly real - an awkward young girl who can neither take nor believe compliments about herself, but who has the potential to change the world if only she can find her confidence and voice. Reid is fantastic in the part, credibly convincing audiences that Meg's faults might also be her gifts - that the outsized amount of love in her heart is not something she needs to hide or play down. It's an empowering message for girls and boys, and probably the best thing about DuVernay's otherwise uneven adaptation.Unfortunately, the rest of A Wrinkle In Time lingers somewhere in the key of mediocre. For a book like L'Engle's, every choice made in changing or updating the novel for the screen will invariably invite debate. Viewers and readers will be discussing for years to come whether Meg's perfectly ordinary twin brothers should have been cut out of the family, and if the film's glamorous, purely Hollywoodian depiction of the three mysterious Mrses somehow makes them less - rather than more - interesting.Where it really counts, however, Jennifer Lee's screenplay seems determined to avoid as much controversy as possible. The film steers almost entirely clear of what made the book such a seminal work of children's literature, paring away the Christian themes and allegories L'Engle embedded in her story and characters. And yet, it retains a lot of the more peculiar detours taken by the book, from visiting a Happy Medium (Zach Galifianakis) to encountering a sinister man with red eyes (Michael Pena). As a result, A Wrinkle In Time is almost as random and weird as the book on which it's based - but lacks the layers and soul that help make the weirdness work.To be fair, there are plenty of enjoyable moments threaded throughout DuVernay's film. If you accept it for what it is, Meg's hero journey is irresistible and important for generations of young girls who will see themselves in her as she steps up and takes charge. Some of the modern updates are hugely welcome - from the diversity of the characters to a quite wonderful Hamilton reference. The cast, too, is uniformly appealing. Witherspoon, in particular, is having the time of her life as the chirpy, chatty Mrs Whatsit;, while Chris Pine continues his streak of playing white, male characters that we don't often see on screen by injecting his performance with a dark fragility.Nonetheless, it's hard to shake the feeling that A Wrinkle In Time could have been so much more. In the hands of DuVernay (and, of course, Disney), the film is visually arresting, turning up the gloss, colour saturation and special effects to elicit full eye-popping wonder. But all the visual resplendence in the world can't disguise the messiness of the film's central themes and ideas. In effect, DuVernay's adaptation - a blockbuster that comes across as safe and generic when it should be bold and unusual - has things of its own to say but, in so doing, it largely misses L'Engle's point.",

            "content": "I saw A Wrinkle in Time today. The first half hour or so had potential, as the little brother was set up as an articulate champion of justice type who dressed down two teachers for spreading malicious gossip about him and his family, and then supported his sister. All this while apparently marshaling the powers that be of the universe to help find their missing father. The sister started out with some potential too, beating up a particularly vicious bully and walking out on a principal who was trying to tear her down without getting the whole story behind her actions first. The acting and makeup for the 3 universe goddess ladies was rather off-putting and honestly came off as TV movie quality, but the CGI once they crossed over to a new place was impressive. Unfortunately, the whole movie falls flat on its face immediately after that and never recovers. Leaving the heavy-handed and insufficiently heartfelt scene with the seer out, the little brother disappears briefly without explanation (only to reappear later also without explanation) during which time the kids run through a supernatural natural disaster of sorts and escape in a barely believable (even in the context of fantasy) way. Shortly after the little brother reappears, he touches the hand of one baddie and suddenly turns into a power-mad villain, which makes no sense since he showed no signs of avarice up to that point and not a drop of darkness in his personality to be used in turning him. If anything, the setup made him seem more likely to end up the hero of the story. This is just clumsy writing. When they finally find the father, despite the fact he's been trapped in the core of evil for the whole universe for 4 years, he shows no signs of having changed in any way - plus he was way too easy to find but that's another issue. Then, even though he's supposed to have been trapped there, he just decides to teleport him and his daughter back home at will. What!?! Couldn't he have done that, say 4 years earlier if it was that simple!?! Also, when he teleports away and the daughter wills herself to stay to go after her brother, the boyfriend is nowhere near and in the end the daughter and her brother go home without the boyfriend... and yet he's there when they arrive home... with no explanation whatsoever. Oh, and one more plot hole regarding the boyfriend. The little brother asked him to come along because they needed his sense of diplomacy, but he never used it once. He barely even spoke. Both he and the little brother had considerable potential as characters, but were not really used at all. What a waste. Finally, the climax \"battle\" scene of the film kind of undermined the moral of the story (that you should like yourself the way you are) since the argument the daughter made to un-evil her brother was that they loved each other and therefore he couldn't be evil. Huh?Oh, one last note. There was one little moment when the bother yelled to the sister \"Shut up, Meg!\" Surely someone working on that movie must have seen the show Family Guy once in their life and realized that line would have all the wrong pop culture connotations for a moderately large portion of the audience? I mean, seriously, I don't watch that show and even I know that catchphrase. There was a lot of laughter in the theater at that moment, and I think that's why.I'm guessing something important in the original written story was excised from the screenplay to fill it so full of holes. If not, then this is just a very disappointing story all around. Thematically and stylistically, it wants to be Neverending Story, but it just isn't. At all. Not even close.",

I was worried when Michael Pena was cast as the villain, because generally his roles are comedic, and even when he's playing a villain, like in ''My Little Pony: The Movie\" it's as the main villains' sidekick/comic relief. Surprisingly, he did a good job. The character in the story is supposed to be an allegory for the devil, and while he wasn't as creepy as I would have liked, he did add another element to the character by posing as friendly in order to tempt the main characters more. They also got rid of the part of the story with Aunt Beast. (Yay! Seriously. What were those things? Chewbacca's second cousins? Whatever they were, I always hated that part as I felt it slowed the plot down and added nothing. By cutting that part they proved how unnecessary it was and the story still works without it.) Being a Disney film, they of course toned down the creepiness of the planet Camazotz. (Boo!) I would have preferred it to be as scary as the book and 2003 film. It was still a bit unsettling, but not as much as it should have been. Overall, I thought this was a fine adaptation, albeit a slightly flawed one.\nGrade: A- 9/10 3.5/5 stars",

I wish at the end of that 1hr40min disaster I'd not only been blind, but also deaf and rather stupid.From start to end, it just lacks any depth, any story, any satisfaction at all other than the occasional bit of great special effects work. The timeline is all over the place, the characters are shallow and lacking any depth that gives you an investment in who they are or what they are doing, and the acting is at best little better than what I would expect of C grade actors. I think Chris and Reese just turned up for a day or two in-between another more interesting and better paid project, meanwhile Oprah just didn't have much else on that month.I really did ponder if I had fallen asleep and missed a main part of the story, but no, I evidently didn't and what seems to be some large jumps in storytelling were indeed what this film had.Maybe it's a kids film, and they might be too daft to notice all the holes and flaws in general, but these days I doubt that. Basically it was just a terrible film, made no worse perhaps by Oprah and her 'acting', but certainly made no better by the supposedly good actors involved.What I find most marvellous is the fact Disney and others continue to no doubt spend millions on this sort of garbage, when that money might be better spent else where, or donated to the poor and homeless. And whoever wrote this script (adapted it from the book I suppose), should be marched immediately out of the office and banished into the nothing.

Meg meets the three ladies Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) and they go to a beautiful planet, were the flowers speak to each other. They fly through a sky from a mystical transformed creature. Then, they travel to a rocky balanced setting, were they meet Zach Galifianakis's character. Then, to a dark place called the it, were all the dark negative energy lies upon. It is a fun adventure to see these beautiful visual effects. Which is also the weakness of this film as well. When the film relies on visuals over storytelling. Storm Reid did perfect with her performance. You grow to like her character. Levi Miller was also okay as well that has an attraction to Meg. Chris Pine was good as her father for the brief moments that he is on screen. Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling were great as well. What did not work with A Wrinkle in Time? Like I said above, the film relying on visuals over storytelling. The movie is all visual effects and there may be scenes were it is overdone. But the plot is thin. It is about a father's passion in discovering new planets in different universes. And the voyage to the unknown. When Meg goes traveling to one visual fest set piece to another. Meeting new characters and getting a lead to another new setting. There is not much of a story when characters are just traveling to another eye candy visual set piece. There is a theme of love in the film. But does poorly on trying to execute a story. Also, I feel like Oprah Winfrey, Deric McCabe, and Michael Pena's performances were just dull. Winfrey as Mrs. Which did not have any depth with the character. Deric McCabe did decent as a genius kid. Michael Pena as Red was just terrible.Overall, A Wrinkle in Time is a fair film. The visual effects are spectacular but overwhelming. The plot is thin and forgettable. Storm Reid was great and some decent performances from the supporting cast. Otherwise, I will recommend the film as a rental unless you are a fan of the book or want to see some stunning visuals on the big screen.",

But it exceeded my expectations... meaning that I didn't expect it to be this awful.You wouldn't believe it, I certainly wouldn't believe it either if someone told me... but these people spent 100-million dollars for a movie with no sets at all (everything is low grade CGI). But the most significant, inconceivable point is that the plot involves children going to a magical land where everything is magical, and you know, filled with magic and stuff that has magic in it... with the added bonus of magic. You know? Flying creatures, beautiful landscape, which is supposed to make the kids in the audience \"woooow!\" like their onscreen counterparts, and carry them away for two hours.Which could very well happen, of course. But only if the kids in the audience haven't seen any of the eight Harry Potter films. Or the Narnia films. Or the Lord Of The Rings films. Or Spiderwick. Or Labyrinth. Or any of the dime-a-dozen, you-get-free-with-any-10-dollar-purchase children's animation DVDs.

This movie basically glossed right over those, which took out so much of the joy of the story. I went with someone who never read the book and she was so confused over this entire movie's concept, basically because the entire middle of the story-line was missing.

I think the actors would actually do a very good job if it wasn't for the director, they all have potential but unfortunately, they wasted their talents on poor directing and writing.The cast is miscast. Something about Storm Reid just didn't feel like Meg to me, she did pretty well portraying her insecure personality but she just seemed robotic when Meg was much more of an emotional character in the book. I guess it's because adapting a book character as emotional as Meg would make the movie too dramatic but when strange things would be happening, she would be like \"Oh okay...\" she didn't show much expressions of curiosity, fear, confusion etc.. Mrs. Whatsit played by Reese Witherspoon just seemed too excitable. Also, Reese Witherspoon is like in her 40s while I saw Mrs. Whatsit as an older woman. Mrs. Who, played by Mindy Kaling would mostly talk in quotes and would even say things that didn't feel natural to the scenes. Charles Wallace is supposed to be 5 yet Deric McCabe looks like he's 9. And Calvin has the cliched love-at-first-sight thing going on, swooning over Meg's hair and how she's hot.The only good things I can say about the movie were the visuals and most of the more fast-paced scenes. They were fun to watch. But all in all, this is an unfaithful adaptation of a book that takes out some important parts from the book and adds some new ones.I do believe \"A Wrinkle in Time\" book has the potential to get adapted to a good film, maybe not an excellent film because the book is too complex to be made into a wonderful film.",

I kept waiting to see more magical moments coming from these three roles but only met with the lack of it. This movie missed numerous opportunities to deliver some comedic moment/line either from the three misses or the children. Talking bout the children, yeah they're cute and pretty all that but there's nothing really making them quite likeable especially the main child, Meg. She's described as unorganised, problematic, aggressive kid but all of these characteristics were only proven in the movie in 1 scene only and what, they thought that is enough to make us believe that she is this out of control, problematic girl?? Heck no. As mentioned, there is nothing really likeable or relatable with the character Meg and so its hard to care for her and in the end, I just can't help but to not rooting for her. She is in this magical journey with her lil bro and friend but all she keep doing was complaining, but at the same wanting to save her father. How the heck do you wanna save your father when all you do is complain? Anyway, no hate towards the child but I do believe if they chosen another well performed child actor for the role of Meg, it'd be a better character.

The film was directed by Ava DuVernay (who also helmed the critically acclaimed Oscar nominees 'SELMA' and '13TH'), and it was scripted by Jennifer Lee. The movie is based on the book (of the same name) by Madeleine L'Engle. It stars Storm Reid, Levi Miller, Deric McCabe, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Chris Pine, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Pena and Zach Galifianakis. The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics so far, and it's just a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be pretty to look at, but it's also pretty boring and uninspiring. Meg Murry (Reid), and her younger brother Charles Wallace (McCabe), have been bullied at school ever since their astrophysicist father, Alex (Pine), went missing years earlier. Then one day Meg learns that he's being held captive on another planet. So Meg, Charles Wallace, and Meg's new friend Calvin O'Keefe (Miller), set out to rescue him. They get help from three magical astral travelers (Winfrey, Witherspoon and Kaling). The movie is always beautiful to look at, and I really wanted to like it. Largely because it has a diverse cast, with multiple minority and female leads in it, and it was directed by an African-American woman. If the movie's not good, it's just not good though. It did have a lot of potential, I'll admit, and it's a decent kids' movie (I probably would have liked it a lot more when I was that age). It's also well intentioned obviously. I think it would have been better served with a much smaller budget though. Sure it wouldn't have been as visually stunning (which is it's one saving grace), but I think DuVerany could have focused a lot more on it's heart (and message) that way. I also would have cast three different (better) actresses as the astral travelers.",

Disney made sure to make it as PC as possible and glitzed it up to make the Mrs. W's more like fairy godmothers and the scenes more Alice in Wonderland and less scary than the book. I remember parts of the book being incredibly terrifying. The only scary scene in the movie was more Pirates of the Caribbean scary, not terrifying. So many key scenes and aspects were left out, some of which include the fact that there were also twin boys, the Murray's lived on a farm with an orchard, stone fence and star gazing rock, the Mrs. W's first appeared as bag ladies, the boy who dropped his ball in the synced bouncing scene. Many of these elements come into play later, in either this book or the series, and were completely ignored. The only saving grace of this movie was some of the acting. Charles Wallace was excellent. Calvin would have been great, too, had they actually delved into his character and his relationship with Meg properly. Meg, one of my all time favorite female characters and an inspiration as an awkward adolescent, was totally flat and unbelievable. Was it terrible writing or terrible casting? I don't know.

Storm Reid should be proud that this got to be her breakthrough!",

And not gonna lie, there was a moment where i almost fell asleep while watching this and my friend did too. I could hear her yawning and snoozing!

            "content": "I still don't know why I watched this film this weekend but I as a self professed lover of film needed to keep judgment out while watching this film. It was hard having an open mind because the trailers looked....well.... bad. I was hoping for something smart and entertaining at least. While the film isn't as bad as I thought it was there's plenty of problems that ruin the film and outweigh some of the positives. I think young children will enjoy this because they won't pay attention to its flaws.The film is about a girl named Meg and her quest to find her astrophysicist father who disappeared 4 years prior. She soon realizes that reality is not what it seems and her father is being held captive on a foreign planet by an evil force named The It which attempts to engulf the universe. The film is noticeable for its diversity in cast and story and for being the first 9 figure budget picture directed by a woman of color. While I ca appreciate that aspect of the background of the film and the ambitious effort by Ava DuVernay, the film is still a mess.Some of the positives. The film definitely means well and the younger crowd should be impressed by the visuals and adventurous themes. Some of the passages of the journey of the film are also cool. Now the bad, the child actors really aren't good. Especially the younger brother. I can't really blame them because they are kids, but it was distracting. There is lots of CGI, some parts look great and others the effects are very noticeable. There's also storytelling flaws. Things aren't explained well and we are meant to just accept thing as \"oh yeah science\". It gets frustrating when inexplicable things happen for the sake of it.I must admit the film is nowhere near as bad as I anticipated. Parts of the film are interesting. Most however is hard to connect with and get emotionally involved in. I'm sure there are people out there whoa re perfectly satisfied with this judging by the applause it received in the theater from other moviegoers. For me though, its a big budget film that needed to be much more to warrant an impact.5.5/10",

            "content": "The film feels like it was produced by The IT itself - so arranged, artificial, by the template - that it as a whole reminded of the scary suburban street with copy-paste houses and inhabitants. Calculatedly pleasing to the eye, but otherwise lifeless. I guess there were the good intentions and perhaps even the talented ensemble - but The IT in the form of the big badass corporation as Disney, in the board of directors, distorted manager's minds, pseudo-psychology calculations on what \"moves\" and \"sells\" to the audience and all \"the science\" of the business ... could hardly produce anything else than the tombstone to the deluded corporate world, Hollywood style.Don't get me on praising \"at least the stunning visual effects\". They are unimaginative kytsch, boring, underwhelming - considering what we have seen already. No, nowadays spectators cannot be stimulated by quantity, nor by colors anymore. That's not the way to go. Is that the storytelling and acting and directing of the 21st century - people interacting with random \"cool\" CGIs, almost detached from reality? \"I am flying. I am walking the imaginary stairs. I am interacting with zillions of flying dots. I am changing shape and colors.\" Is that all to the contemporary kid's souls - interacting with VFX? The three godfairies, divas, drag queens - or whatever - are sort of an emblem of this production: Lavishly dressed, but static, statue-like, arranged (symmetrically) ... lifeless.Good=light, evil=darkness? Seriously? What about the potential of art to challenge the status quo, cliches, moralism, cheapness, simplification ... and thus educate?That good=nice vs evil=mean is so neatly contrasted, that there it leaves no space for real-life characters, emotions, or audience's connection.I appreciate the irony towards suburban dystopia - or the overcrowded beach scenes ... yeah, the standardized normal families, the template lives, the template fun, the template joy - epileptically colorful and in the same time same, alike, interchangeable - but that theme could have been juiced endlessly. As an independent movie.Oh my, where are the times of The Toys at least.",

            "content": "One thing about the vast majority of movies and are either not well made or just plain bad usually is of no fault of the actors involved. The actors all did a great job and I refuse to fault them for this movie doing so badly. I think all of them did a great job and that needs to be said. However, when the story does not come together and the script is bad, and when, in this case, the book does not follow certain thing crucial to the story, then it seems that often times it can look like a bad performance on their part which is very unfair. I also wonder how much is on the editing room floor.I do think it's great when a story adapted from a book can be reimagined using more modern day situations and events that are more relatable if it's possible and this one should have been one of those. For instance, Calvin's dad being very demanding. We do not actually \"see\" his dad in the novel, we see his mother who is a worn out, bitter woman who is a bit abusive. But, the book seems to be missing some characters such as Meg and Charles Wallace twin brothers. Other things that were changed were things like who Meg was. She was a \"trouble maker\" meaning that she was assertive in a \"rage against the machines\" type of way. In this version, Meg seems more like a push over who cowers at things instead of \"fighting back.\" I have read A Wrinkle in Time\" twice and Meg's dad was not gone for so long. Basically, the movie was missing half it's characters or a lot of them anyway.\nThings happened very fast whereas the book and the previous 2003 version, the TV Movie, showed a longer passage of time. It felt very rushed, had little character development on a lot of the characters, had frayed ends in the story to the point where it just became annoying and unwatchable. I had a hard time following it and it felt like it was saying nothing with a whole lot. It will be interesting to see if an uncut version comes out, but it is still missing two important characters, the twin brothers, in the story.. It was oversimplified and should have been a longer movie.So, I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read any of Madeleine L'Engle's books about the Murray?O'Keefe family aka the Kairos series.",

The book had so many layered themes in it, and I can understand not being able to show them all effectively, or some upgrades from the cold war era feel, but to pretty much chuck the whole second half of the book out in favor of some hard to follow mind trip really suffered.If you can get past that, overall it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great.

A good amount of the film simply does not make sense (How was the father being detained? What is the relevance of Veronica, Rowan Blanchard's character? Furthermore, what was the relevance of Calvin?). I think that the story never quite realized its purpose and just seemed to be going through the motions. The director, Ava Duvernay, has proved herself more than capable, yet her style here is almost laughable. I just think the director, and part of the cast was mis-chosen, which is a sentiment frequently proved throughout the film. The effects, for the most part, were haphazardly done, and I felt the film was generally at its strongest when dealing with literal backgrounds and sets, rather than a CGI/green screened backdrop. For example, the scene in which Mrs. Who interacts with Charles Wallace has an engaging and interesting feel to it, even if the acting and directing is lacking. In conclusion, unless you are a die-hard Disney fan who has taken a blood oath to read every. single. film. they release, I do not encourage \"A Wrinkle In Time.\" I hate to say it, but even \"Sherlock Gnomes\" would be more focused.2/10\n20%\nF",

A bold scientist suddenly disappears as he attempts to discover an alternate reality, four years later his daughter and son become embroiled in a rescue mission which in turn becomes a quest to save the universe. Adapting the unadaptable will gain praise from me, just for the sheer bravery and boldness of such an attempt. But in hindsight some stories just cannot be adapted cinematically, this is one of them. The technical aspects are the selling point, fantasy worlds filled with bright vibrant colours and imaginative environments. A rather surreal experience with many ethereal scenes, such as the process of \"tessering\". It maintained my interest through visual awe and delight. DuVernay's direction is splendid and surprisingly makes the transition from powerful dramas to big budget blockbusters effortlessly. The acting was solid, particularly Pine who brings some much needed emotion and Winfrey whose physical prowess portrays a commanding character. The major issues I have inherently come from the screenplay and narrative. The dialogue is consistently filled with exposition, leaving little room for backstory and character development. It's purely focussing on universe-building and crafting creative landscapes, a minimal amount of attention was made to creating a cohesive plot. I mean honestly, many aspects were incomprehensible as it leaves you questioning \"what the hell is going on!? How did that happen? Why is he there? Who are these Mrs's beings?\" The countless lingering plot holes will infuriate older audiences, whilst the complicated narrative is too advanced for younger viewers. The theme of love is dealt heavy handedly that it left me face palming myself. This is no means a horrific film, with some being slightly too harsh.

It may have been talking about a popular girl struggling with an eating disorder and a great student being bullied by his father to do even better. But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios. In fact, much of the film felt as if they were already thinking about a ride as they were making it. My 9 year old liked it. Hopefully it will make him want to read the book. Then it will be worth it.",

It's not like other Disney films that are timeless and you can watch them years after they came out as a 30 year old and you still love them. The dialogue and the plot are most certainly written for children, and as someone who is not a child it was sort of cringey and awkward to watch. It has a good overall message and theme that is really not subtle at all (hence why it's good for children), but just don't expect this to be the kind of Disney movie that anyone at any age can enjoy.",

I only wish they had spent more time highlighting why the book was so good to begin with. They didn't have to put it all on Meg rescuing everyone. In the book it's a team effort out of love and friendship, so the parts of the book where they cut out the other characters sacrificing themselves or offering to sacrifice themselves for each other and the total unselfishness of characters like Calvin or Meg's father could have helped pack the emotional punch of this movie. Calvin had much more to do in the book, why cut that out? Giving him nothing to do didn't help develop why he is there to help Meg. He and Meg had growth in their character arcs in ths book. Why just show 1 scene of Calvin having problems with his father, why not develop that a bit more. Develop Charles Wallace being continuously teased or show a montage of it if you're short on time. I really really really hate they didn't have Aunt Beast in there, the ending was totally silly and half-cooked. And developing the three Missuses much more...maybe DuVernay should have picked the TV miniseries format with a longer running time with more room for character motivation and development and had a screenwriter writing more true to the spirit of the actual novel.\nI truly admire the colorblindness the film tried to be, but it would have helped to have more meaty story on this film's bones and kept in more of the best things about the book than focusing on the CGI. Way too watered down for my tastes. Respect the audience! We are smarter than you think we are!",

When you saw the children meet Oprah, Kaling, and Witherspoon on the other planet, this was in the trailer, that was the highlight of the movie. I thought it would have been visually stunning, but it lacked in that department too. This movie was pretty much Disney's Eragon. It failed miserably.

            "content": "Children's books will never be easy to adapt for new generations. Not just because of generational gaps of the state of mind when it was written, but also the expectation of holding filmmakers to the standard that a book indirectly sets (even if it doesn't translate to film). While in recent years, Ava DuVernay has established herself directing impressive urban dramas (Selma, Middle of Nowhere) and finds herself stepping into the Disney fantasy land, and while young children can have fun in her world, adults may find a few more wrinkles than expected.The film follows Meg (Storm Reid) who is at a lost after dealing with the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine). Suddenly Meg's little brother discovers three witches who help Meg, her brother and a close friend try to discover why their father hasn't come home.Ava DuVernay is very much staging an ambitious world visually, and while it's interesting to view, it doesn't allow enough on the surface or even depth to understand how the \"wrinkles\" operate. While I'm okay with the idea of the children going into a world unlike their own, I found myself asking \"what is anything and why doesn't it click like it should?\" We are told many times on screen that Meg and her brother have great minds, but we never really get to see what makes them so brilliant like the film says they are. There's points when Meg's brother becomes the central focus and he goes from over his years to unexplainably odd and it becomes hard to digest on screen. And as for Oprah playing the witch, it just sounds like Oprah talking like Oprah. Take what you can from that.It's not all bad within the world though. There's enough colorful elements that I could see young children finding enjoyment in the fantasy world. The set pieces have some interesting ideas and surreal moments in visual repetition and ever changing geography.A Wrinkle in Time sadly has too many wrinkles to give it a recommendation, but I wouldn't tell people run away either. It has interesting ideas, but trouble connecting it altogether. Colorful, but maybe too intense to the eye. The heart and soul is very much seen in Ava's work, but I feel the heart wasn't in the right direction.Rating: 5.1 / 10",

In fact, as I write this review right now, the same copy I was given as an 8 year old is on my desk, nice and familiar and reminding me of days long gone. When I heard they were adapting it to a big-budget film with Disney, I was mostly excited, with a few reservations. Here was the chance to see this great story communicated through a new media!However, I went to see the film and was sorely disappointed. To begin with, it didn't start on a dark and stormy night! One of the most iconic lines in literature, and they saved it for after a needless flashback that oversimplified and explained subtleties in the book.Aside from that, the first half was pretty decent. It mostly followed the book, and I liked the characters of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which. I wasn't expecting to like Mindy or Reese in their roles, but I feel they did a good job. And I did really like Oprah as Mrs Which, which I did have reservations about. I started to have a bad feeling when they landed on Uriel. When Mrs Whatsit shifted into her \"other form\", it looked like a depressing, CGI version of a piece of flying lettuce. Not at all like the majestic Mrs Whatsit on my cover! However, I tried to hold on nonetheless.While there were several little unsettling changes, it all started to veer quite far away from the book the moment they landed on Camazotz. Without going into terrible detail, let's just say that the filmmakers completely missed the point of what the book was originally trying to portray! Entire chapters were left out! Important character development was skipped! And all of Calvin's best scenes in the book were cut, making him some sort of useless tagalong!With all of their skipping, it ruined the original plot and many other good points. To its credit, however, it did have lovely visuals. The other worlds were very beautiful, and while Camazotz was completely inaccurate, it was gorgeous. I also didn't mind the majority of the casting, whether or not I'd agree with it. But, it just lacked the soul and subtlety of the original text.",

            "content": "Before I begin this review, I would just like to say that I don't know how I feel about this film, and I'm not sure I ever will, hence the 5/10 rating. Having read the original source material for A Wrinkle in Time, this is a strange goddamn adaptation, to say the very least. In my eyes, there are a few reasons for this. Firstly, some of the changes it has made to the original source material are baffling, while others actually make sense. For instance, \"Red\" (read: the Man with the Red Eyes, the physical mouthpiece of It (or, according to this film, the It. Why add the \"the\"?) in the original novel) looks like a poor man's Willy Wonka, but quantum entanglement being the mumbo-jumbo Meg's dad uses for tessering instead of a pure wormhole is indeed a well thought-out change. The flowers are a stupid addition (although not altogether pointless to the plot), but the change regarding what Mrs. Whatsit transforms into is rather good. All of what they did to Camazotz did my head in as to whether I liked it or not, including the stairwell sequence, which to me might have well been conceived of on\nSecondly, it is obvious that the message of this film was tweaked a bit to have a bit of commentary regarding womens' body images and how it affects them, as well as empowerment of women, and I am certain there are cries of \"SJW-ism\" and what not in this review section. A film like this attracts those sort of unpleasant reviews like honey does flies. I personally don't know how I feel about it. Ask me Tuesday whether it was garbage and you won't get the same answer Wednesday. I don't even know if I care.\nThirdly, while the performances of the three immortal girls aren't too shabby, the rest of the cast is hit or miss. Storm Reid is alright, but she doesn't get as many lines to work with as I was expecting, oddly enough, being the protagonist and all. Calvin's actor's performance is as interesting as watching a sundial's shadow move. Charles Wallace's actor, Boognish bless him, is trying incredibly hard to nail his character, but falls way short, sadly. Shame, too, as he probably would have been better with better direction.\nTo summarize, I do not know if I recommend this film. Ask Schrodinger's cat instead.",

However, upon leaving the theater, I felt the same lightness and joy I experienced watching Wonder. The film had a deep heart, displaying the power of love and the worth of humans-- and that we can deserve love for being ourselves, rather than constantly striving for approval.A Wrinkle in Time featured charming actors, with Storm Reid stealing the scenes as the persnickety, precocious Meg Murry. Deric McCabe is perfectly cast as the impercetable and brilliant Charles Wallace, while Levi Miller's kind Calvin consistently offers the support Meg needs to save the day. The Mrs.'s, played by Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon, are dazzling, beautiful, wise, brave, and unknowable as they guide the children on first a search and then a rescue mission, giving the children the courage and tools to fight the darkness. I read this book in 5th grade and despised the slow classroom pace and the drying of the novel's appeal with homework and questions. As an English teacher, I revisited the book this past Christmas and quickly devoured others in the series, captivated by the flawed, clever fighter who is Meg Murry. I found permission to be a smart, capable woman as well as permission to live with flaws and not constantly try to cover them up in shame. I found a deeper appreciation for the people around me and a desire to reach out and make the world a better place. While a two hour movie does not allow for the depth of development we find in books, this film adaption does good job of opening many of those doors for viewers. Ryan Coogler's praise for director Ava DuVernay is well earned with a fantastic, diverse cast, beautiful scenery, and spot on emotional appeals.

            "content": "While plenty of children's books are imaginative, no amount of CGI can cover up the fact that a faithful adaptation to the source material should be the highest priority. Unfortunately, due to the heavy Christian undertones in the original story, an anti-Christian Hollywood managed to churn out this loose adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time that doesn't do much more than waste a few hours of your time. Sure, there are hints to such important ideas as faith, but they're lost in lackluster character development that tries to \"modernize\" something that has been timeless for decades.Each of the sequences in this film merely seems like an excuse for gorgeous set design. If anything, the alien worlds and settings are neat to look at, but they don't do much to distract from the events that just happen without much explanation as to why, or what purpose they serve. For instance, the scene with the identical houses and families all acting in synchronicity (one of the scenes from the trailer) is visited and exited in a matter of moments, and there was no point or moral lesson to teach there. It just was. Then it was not.Perhaps the most frustrating part of the film was the main characters. When Meg (Storm Reid) was describing all her faults, I had to stop and think: did the movie show us these faults? Some of them were accurate, but most didn't seem to be obvious character flaws that she was trying to overcome, or at least not ones that were presented earlier in the film. Consequently, all the characters felt as flat as a visit to a 2-dimensional world (which, ironically enough, was a scene from the book that didn't make it into the movie).A hollow adaptation with flashy visuals and nothing else, I give A Wrinkle in Time 2.0 stars out of 5.",

I do applaud this but there is so much........Whilst certainly a film the kids may love for me personally it felt too lovey dovey with cherries on top and apple pie with cream on the side, no meat to the story and honestly I just didn't care what happened to who.

That said, it also channeled (and magnified) all the messiness too. A somewhat garbled plot became completely disjointed. The 3 mrs. characters just plain never worked, spending every moment either explaining things or making stale jokes. An ominous evil force became laughably cliche fairly quickly. And most importantly, every single theme was beaten like a dead horse. It felt like a very special episode of \"A Wrinkle in Time.\" I love DuVernay's ambition, but I had hoped for better than the most expensive and well-done after school special of all time.

Said rip-off remains unfinished, unpublished and partially lost and that is probably for the best. The 2003 adaptation of the Wrinkle in Time novel was really good and stayed mostly faithful to the book. And when I first saw advertisements for this adaptation I was really excited. I like all kinds of movies and usually when something comes out that everyone hates, I am one of the few people who would like it. With a couple of movies it was the other way around but that is to be covered in other upcoming reviews (specifically for Cloverfield and the 1996 Romeo and Juliet adaptation). I have yet to write more reviews that reflect my cinematic taste but bottom line it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie.So the fact I am giving this movie a 3 star rating is saying something.I saw this a few days after opening day. 3.8 stars right away? It cannot be THAT bad, I thought. So my stepdad took me to see it. For the rest of the week I could not stop talking about how bad it was. The good visuals, casting, intentions, and beginning do not at all make up for its shameless differences from the book. I am not a big reader but when I see an adaptation of a book I have read, I get annoyed if it is an unfaithful adaptation. This movie is nothing like the book. The book was strange, unique and indescribably beautiful. This was a very modern and watered-down adaptation that almost insults Madeline L'Engle. The 2003 adaptation did change how certain things happened, but the plot remained the same. This adaptation, however, overthinks the adaptation concept by changing the plot.Adaptations are not that hard to make! I mean, I understand that scenes from the source material must be cut out or hastened to keep it from getting to long (this would probably be a 3-4 hour movie if they did not cut at least some parts out) but changing the parts you keep is just annoying and unnecessary. Entire characters cut out or heavily altered. Important plot points were made nothing like the book. If you have not seen this movie, I will warn you are not missing out. I fully agree with the other negative reviews of this movie.Oh and one more thing. In the book Meg has two brothers named Sandy and Dennys. They contributed nothing to the plot so it makes sense that they were cut out. However, the book has about 7 sequels and the third sequel, Many Waters, REVOLVES around Sandy and Dennys. With that, Disney would run into some very serious problems if they decide to make a Many Waters adaptation. But given this film's negative reception, it probably was not going to happen anyway. Bottom line, I recommend the book as much as I do NOT recommend this movie.",

I like Winfrey, Witherspoon, and Kaling in their roles, and Reid and Pine were good as well. But other than that and the effects, the film falls pretty flat. The only moments where I felt truly engaged was when they were exploring the new dazzling lands. Everything was uneven, it wasn't consistent. The enjoyable parts come far and few in between. For an adventure film, it was kinda dull. I would've liked more adventure and more engaging moments. I felt like the characters deserved a better script.The film tried and I can see that, and I really love the diversity shown in the film, that's a beautiful thing.

Looking at the overall IMdB ratings more closely, I see that women voters rate it a full point higher than men do, but even for them the median is 5/10 even after you cut out the trolls who rate anything they see as 1/10.The level this movie seems aimed at, given the simplistic nature of the dialog, seems to be pre-teen, not YA. But the intense, vivid nature of the visuals is such that it might well give nightmares to kids under about 6 -- there are a few quite intense and scary scenes concerning The It (who is, essentially, Satan). There are many good actors in the cast, but they don't have a lot to work with, and the three magic Mrs. (Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling) are kind of wasted, as is Chris Pine. However, two characters I liked were Storm Reid as the young heroine Meg, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as her mother. They come across well.There's so much here that doesn't make sense even at a first look. The three kids (Meg, Calvin, Charles Wallace) are strictly told by the three \"Mrs.\" to STAY TOGETHER as they set off on their adventure into mystical lands. What's the first thing they do? You guessed it. Why can't Happy Medium (an entertaining Zach Gallifianakis) say more than a few cryptic hints? Why for that matter can't anyone be more specific? And I actually worry about Meg's situation at school. She's a bullied outcast because her father disappeared and she's fallen into deep depression. Kids who are bullied by mean girls at school shouldn't expect their problems to be solved by three demigods who suddenly appear and whisk them off into the cosmos. They need more than just sympathy: they need to know what to *do* about their problem. This movie doesn't, in the end, give much guidance.",

A lot of kids movies these days try to gear towards adults as well, so, I thought I might enjoy it given the amount of stars in the film, and the remake of Annie could have been painful but I ended up loving it and have seen it 3 times since it's a favorite of my nieces and nephews. I've happily sat through Moana multiple times, even downloaded some songs. Frozen...I can sit through that, but not one of my faves. So, I like kids films. But this was one of the worst films I've seen in awhile. Which is too bad 'cause I remember loving the book as a kid...although I can't say I really remember the book other than there was that flying centaur guy on the cover of the book, so my dislike of the film isn't from sentiment. It's just a bad movie. The positives, which are few, are the women in the film. They all did a great job. It's hard not to like Reese, Mindy and Oprah. And GuGu did a great job even though she wasn't in the film much, which was too bad. Chris Pine is highly likable but I had a hard time believing he's this genius physicist. He has pretty and likable going for him but he doesn't look smarter than a 5th grade science teacher. Although, you could make GuGu the queen of England and I'd probably say it's believable so that's either a credit to her or my fondness of her is clouding my judgement. Other than them the casting was either terrible or not good...with the exception of the kid who played Clint, he was pretty good. The rest of the kids and the teachers, with the exception of one teacher, seemed like they came straight out of John Casablancas or some terrible casting office.It was pretty clear the director had never worked with visual effects, didn't understand them, ran out of money, or all of the above. The first shot you see of the fantasy world looked like New Zealand with a hue adjustment overlay that flattened the whole picture and they didn't bother to cut and separate the pieces into individual mattes. Which makes me think the director blew the money. No one does that. Usually there are painted mattes overlaying a real scene or the whole thing is various mattes, more typically. There were some crappy looking flower mattes over the hue color change. Matte cutting is VFX 101 and even your cheap, straight to video stuff has it. The scene still would have looked surprisingly low budget for a film with all these big stars but I was surprised by how amateur it was. I did some VFX assistant work at Disney and I could have tackled it, which is how basic it was.Some of the scenes were somewhat cool but it was all kind of cheap looking. Reminded me of the low-budget kids films of the '80s. The effects weren't as bad as them, but were compared to what's out there now. I also started to think the director, aside from having no VFX experience also had no fantasy/Sci-fi experience when Reese turned into a giant piece of lettuce and flew the kids around like Falcor the dragon. Which, I guess I wasn't that surprised when the villain, The It, turned out to be just like The Nothing from The Neverending Story.Another thing that made me think the directory ran out of money is how few scenes there are in the real world. School. The house. An alley. That's about it. It happened on the movie Dungeons & Dragons. The guy who owned the rights to the title convinced a producer to give him 35 million. He had zero film experience and the director blew all his money early on on effects 'cause he didn't understand how the process of getting them made works, which is why they usually give these type films to VFX specialists or animators to direct, or to film makers who have a lot of experience with VFX-heavy TV like Game of Thrones.When I looked up who the director was I was surprised but not surprised. Surprised they would give this budget and type of film to someone who's experience is low-budget drama. It said Selma was a 20 million budget but I find that hard to believe. A Quiet Place was 15 and that had aliens and a lot more going on than a film where most of it was MLK Jr. talking around a table or on the phone. Which, again makes me think the director has a budget problem 'cause I can't imagine Selma costing more than 10 million. There's no stars other than a few tiny scenes with Oprah, and even the period piece stuff wasn't enough to put a major dent in a budget.Pretty much the whole film is the characters meandering from one place to the next. There wasn't much of a cohesive plot, other than her father is missing and they're trying to find him. They just did aimless things like have the lettuce creature fly around for no reason, then they suddenly decide they're going to go to see some dude who lives in a cave...why? Not sure. He just said a bunch of meaningless hippie stuff, like, follow your heart or something. That's kind of all that was said to get the girl to where she was going. So, not sure how she even found her father. They just decided at one point she would by wandering around aimlessly with no one actually giving her any guidance. Just great advice like, \"I give you your flaws.\" Literally that's how she defeated the bad guy. Which, didn't really make sense. She defeated the bad guy by saying she loved him. Lame, and not sure how that's a flaw. The girl also uses fuzzy physics to accomplish things, meaning, not real physics. Like, why in the world would they make that part of the plot? It seemed ridiculous that this young girl would grasp complex physics and in reality she didn't, so, not sure how that went unnoticed. I suppose because film people aren't up on their physics but seems like they should have at least asked someone...like from Cal Tech, the school 15 minutes from Disney that is the MIT of the west. Also, why was her father trapped in a box? Why didn't he leave? There were doors on both sides of the box. And why would the father suggest leaving the son? No father would be like, \"Hey, this is hard, let's bail and leave the child I never knew.\" Also, the finale was surprisingly scary for kids. The little girl behind us was crying. Again, I don't think the director understood horror elements and age appropriateness. I've seen a ton of kids movies and this is the only one I've been concerned I was going to get in trouble for taking my niece and nephew to, in case they got nightmares.It's a shame. 100 million is a lot of money to hand over to a director whose experience is a low-budget movie and documentaries. Not sure how that happened. They should have given it to the director of Girls Trip. Not the same type of film, but GT was really well done, had a decent budget, big stars. I understand wanting to give opportunities but the process is typically working your way up, not giving someone more than they can handle, thus endangering the livelihood of others when the film tanks. Obviously, this won't tank Disney, but this is why studios try to be as risk-free as possible, 'cause a 100 million flop, plus marketing costs which sometimes are equal to the film, can shutter the doors of a studio. Oh well. It was good to see Gugu. Hopefully this will open more doors for her even if the film wasn't great.",

Telling the story, the way they knew how to, newcomer Storm Reid who plays Meg in the movie, finds herself as she journeys into a world that is strange and very peculiar. \n I loved this movie and I must give props where props are due to the cast, crew and Ms. DuVernay, they did an incredible job on a book that I have never read or even heard of for that matter. The lyrics to the title track sums up this movie very beautifully, just read these words: \"They hear you when you cry. This love is far and wide. When you smile the stars align.

I admit it, i'm a book purist. I go to a film to see the author's vision, not the director's. thankfully, this started to happen the 2nd half of the film. the movie got more faithful (and darker) halfway through. it's a beautiful movie and i'm glad I saw it in 3d, so that plus a great cast is why I give it a 6, but I don't need to tell you this movie is mostly a screw up.",

A WRINKLE IN TIME contained way too many static scenes showing nearly nothing on the screen, as the characters waxed philosophical with seemingly endless Yakkity-Yakking. Even the recent feature MONSTER TRUCKS contained more consistent action, and came off as much better plotted. Considering that the source material for A WRINKLE IN TIME is alleged to be a children's classic science fiction novel, as well as the fact that this movie was promoted as having an A-List cast, most theater goers surely bought tickets with the expectation that they would be blessed with something more stunning, provocative, and \"snore-proof\" than just something at the level of another NINJA TURTLE offering. But rather than spending the pages necessary to pick apart the plot, performances, dialog, and effects of A WRINKLE IN TIME, perhaps it would be more constructive to focus on the ONE good thing about this exercise in how NOT to win friends, or influence people. That would be the portion of the movie in which--thanks to the Miracle of CGI--America's favorite traffic cop Sasser turns into a flying head of lettuce (though it would be nicer if we'd see more of her as she changes).",

They are brave, intelligent, resolute, and at times goofy or even cruel.The three main characters find themselves in an intergalactic search for a missing father helped along by three very different but benign witches. Acting by all participants is solid. Storm Reid as the main character inhabits her role with just the right mix of seriousness, charm, and intelligence. The mix of music is also perfect with well-chosen songs throughout.200w_d.gif\nMy only real complaint about the movie is its length. It's packed with events and visual splendor but is too short. At times I wanted things to just slow down a bit and explore all the characters more. Maybe that's because I've never read the book. Perhaps children seeing the movie will be less patient than I.You must try to experience the movie from the perspective of a child or an adolescent. The emotions displayed in the film are at times very raw and on the surface: love, regret, fear, doubt, jealousy, anger -- they're all here and viewed from a young perspective.It's a heady emotional mix that occasionally butts heads with the plentiful visual splendors on display. That's quite a directorial accomplishment, in my opinion.Some younger children may find some of the sequences too scary or even nightmarish. But on balance this is a very solid film.The Disney organization should be proud that it has made an investment in such a film. What's also significant is that the film's multi-cultural and multi-racial nature will be unnoticed by many if not most of the young people who see it.",

Well let me tell you that that only left me even more disappointed.From the start of the movie they used some very unrealistic situations, which left the audience feeling more disconnected to the characters than we should have. Along with some horrible character development, I overall disliked about every character in the whole movie. The main character, Meg, was unlikable, emotionless for most of the movie, and a major bore. She did not make for a fantastic heroine. Calvin honestly did not add a single thing to the movie at all. They could have left his character out entirely and the story would not have been effected. The little brother was SOMETIMES cute but mostly just annoying. All of the actors, even the very well known ones were preformed atrociously. How is that even possible?? Every line felt lifeless and forced. I'm a crier but there wasn't a single heartwarming/emotional scene in the whole movie. The whole performance was awfully dry.The costumes were, well cool I guess if you like vegetables and have horrendous sense of style. I personally hated everything about them. The colors of the background were way too vibrant and there was an overwhelming amount CGI. It gave me a major live action Alice and Wonderland vibe, which I really disliked.There were too many plot holes left and I was continuously confused throughout the entire movie. Now it's not unusual for a movie to not explain everything so that it builds the viewers curiosity, but in those movies they normally end up answering your questions. In THIS movie, not only do they not explain what's going on and why, but they continue to pile on more and more plot which just made me more confused.The ending seem way to easy, almost as if there was no challenge for the characters. Now I'm going to be honest and say that I have never read the book, so maybe the movie made more sense to those who read it, but after watching A Wrinkle in Time, I really don't want to read the book.Overall, I would NOT recommend this movie to even your worst enemy.

A vast departure from the beloved children's novel from the 1960s, this effects laden, star-studded adaptation sheds significant character and story elements from the novel to accommodate the aggressive visuals, timely social commentary and its overreaching narrative that strives towards its doubtful sequels.Incidentally, imprisonment on another planet is a good excuse for missed child support payments.

            "content": "When I first saw the trailer I was concerned. I re-read the book in January just to refresh my memory on how this SHOULD go... And it should be noted that the book also has it's flaws, like poor character development and an abrupt ending. I'm seeing lots of complaints that movie-Meg is annoying and one-dimensional, and let me tell you, book-Meg is too. However, there is a pivotal scene in the book in which she learns to stop being petulant and finds her purpose, and this scene DOES NOT EXIST in the movie. I would argue that this one scene that they cut out is crucial to the climax of the story, and this adaptation completely jumps over those events. Therefore the fault of character development is further worsened, but it's worth pointing out that one-dimensional characters in children's books are common, in order to allow the child to imagine themselves as the protagonist.Anyone who's read the book knows that their mother has red hair, and Meg's is a mousy brown. People are so upset by this change. The idea that Meg hates her hair is TRUE TO THE BOOK, and personally, I don't think the texture of the actresses' (mom and Meg) hair are necessary to the storyline. The fact that we chose to make them WOC actually makes MORE sense than what's in the book, in my opinion, because our culture actually SHAMES textured hair whereas brown is just boring. In the same way, Charles Wallace isn't adopted in the book, however I feel it helps to explain his \"oddness\" more effectively because of it. We aren't recreating the world of the 60s, we're telling the story in present day so our children can relate to the characters and not roll their eyes at an out of touch story. These were excellent ways to do this. The book is written in a way where it does not make it relevant as to what era it takes place; that's part of its transcendence. As far as the Misses go, they were obviously hyped in the trailer because they're freaking Oprah, Reese, and Mindy, but their roles are not supposed to be main characters. I'm seeing a lot of complaints that they don't serve enough purpose, but that's kind of the point. Albeit, the way they are utilized in the movie doesn't make as much sense as it does in the book with what they chose to leave out, but overall the three actresses play them the way they are written in the book. Whatsit is young and inexperienced in her role, Who speaks in quotes, and Which is your most wise, guiding figure who is so otherworldly she struggles to materialize. And as far as their races go, who cares? The book doesn't describe their skin. I'm more upset that Whatsit transforms into a Green Giant looking parachute instead of Pegasus-like creature described in the book, but that's mainly because I love horses. It doesn't affect the story.All of this leads me to my final point which is, I don't understand why people think this is so preachy? The entire book is based around the concept of good and evil, love and hate. The \"IT\" is essentially the devil in the book, to the point where references to God are made (they're EXTREMELY random, but they are made). So what if Meg is insecure about natural waves instead of dishwater brown? So what if we made the Misses Indian, Black and White? The only scene that gets preachy is when Oprah's character Ms. Which describes what \"IT\" does to our world, and literally all she says is that evil is the influence causing all terrible things in our world. This isn't incorrect. And the whole point is for Meg to learn her potential as a young girl being the ONLY person who can do what they've set out to do. This movie is neither heavily political OR socially conscious, unless you deliberately choose to single out things which neither positively or negatively affect your characters (like race).Let us please remember that the book was written in the 60s, and won the Newberry for it's radical-for-the-time science fiction plot. No, it wasn't radically socially conscious; most children's books then weren't. But this movie only feels like an agenda if you choose to view the casting in this way. If the whole movie was nothing but white people, it would feel like any other stereotypical \"child discovers their potential and how to boost their self esteem\" story. There's a new one of those out at least once a year. Please calm down.This is either the best nor the worst adaptation of a book. It makes some weird choices that make it fall a little flatter than it would have had they followed the book more closely, but when is that ever not true of an adaptation? If you love the book, it's worth watching, but you'll be a little disappointed if you've recently read it. If you've never read the book, there are lots of things which will make you scratch your head and not understand the direction being taken, but keep in mind that most of it is the author's writing, not the directing or acting. This isn't the most exciting work of sci-fi ever written, but it is the foundation of many that came after it. Let's keep it in perspective, ay?",

Maybe Disney's and Ava DuVernay's politics were a bit too in the face for some people, maybe the hate for Oprah blinded them, maybe there was a Twitter battle that I was not aware of, but this is not a bad movie by any measure. Ava DuVernay is an odd choice to direct this children's fantasy movie, as she seems more interested in politically driven movies than CGI eye candy, but Selma was very well directed so I can see what Disney were thinking when they hired her. Most of the movie is really beautiful, very well shot with great sets and visuals. The only thing that doesn't work (and it doesn't work big time) is the look of the Three Misses, from their costumes to their make-up, all is truly horrendous. I have no idea how such an otherwise beautiful movie made such a mistake. But that is not enough to destroy this movie! It has a nice message, from what I can see it was well adapted from the source material (I can agree with the decision to take the religion out of it), and it was entertaining enough. Unfortunately I have to admit that I found the story a bit generic, the Charles Wallace character was a bit too obnoxious, and this genre is not a favorite of mine, hence the low rating after so many good things to say, but I can still easily recommend it.

The film is visually stunning to look at, but it is no air-headed beauty -- it is full of substance and grace and grounded deeply in the authentic emotions the actors bring so beautifully to their performances. Some people seem to be unreasonably upset that the movie is different than the book in some ways -- but the point of an adaptation is to translate the spirit of the source material, not dictate every moment word for word. It is impossile for an adaptation to be the exact same experience as reading a book -- they are not meant to be. The mediums are meant to be enjoyed for their own distinct merits, and I for one love this film for the way it honors the book while bringing fresh insight and understanding to the story in a visually stunning and emotinally satisfying way. Moreover, I appreciate all of the filmmakers for how their obvious care and attention and love for the source material infuses every scene.I encourage anyone considering watching this movie to do so with an open heart and mind, unburdened by the fear of change and the weight of unrealistic expectations. Allow yourself to be surprised by the journey, and embrace the movie for what it is: a freaking cool adventure flick that just also happens to be a call to be a light in this world by seeing the good in ourselves and others, and to fight the darkeness of negativity, hate, and fear by refusing to give in to them.",

I have not read the book-and am probably not the target audience-but I thought the movie looked great and had a good story about bullying and having family to depend on, although it was a little confusing at times. Storm plays the daughter of Chris, a brilliant man that is working on a new form of space travel. It uses what they call tesseracts, sort of like teleporting from one place to another. One day, Chris disappears and no one has a clue-I guess they weren't paying attention to what he was studying. About 4 years later, Storm gets a visit from Reese, who tells her that she knows how to find Storm's father. Reese is one of a trio, including Mindy and Oprah, and they all have weird names, like Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which. The effects are great but sometimes, it gets a little confusing as to what is going on.\nIt's rated \"PG\" for thematic elements and some peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.\nIt's not one that I would buy on DVD but I guess if you are a fan of the book, you might enjoy it more than I did. It would be a good rental, just for the scenery.",

It is not deserving of a weak 4.2 on IMDB and it should be somewhere in the 6 range. The film was a visual spectacle with strong CGI and bright colours. It film itself was basically a Doctor Who style fantasy and is it possibly why I'm not that hostile to the film.However, the film shouldn't have centred itself around a child actor who well, couldn't act and Mindy Kaling was irritating speaking in quotes.",

            "content": "The movie was visually spectacular. Many characters, including all three of the \"Mrs.\" were visually different than the original book. But it worked. They were wild, weird and wonderful.Until we get to Camazotz. In the original book, Camazotz was, in gamer terms, lawful evil. Perfectly controlled, with all individuality wiped out. These were regular people, like us, except that a child who drops a ball is an \"Aberration\" and must be \"Reprocessed\" so that he will never again desire to \"deviate\". IT claimed that it had achieved peace by eliminating all differences.In the movie, Camazotz was chaotic evil. Deserts randomly turned into tornadoes randomly turned into housing developments randomly turned into crowded beaches. It wasn't clear that any of the people were anything but an illusion. The only bit that was done right was the perfect neighborhood with the bouncing balls. Actors were of different skin tones, but were otherwise identical in facial expression, dress, etc. Creepy and very much true to the source material. But then it just folded away like it was all an illusion. Which completely undid the point.In the book, IT forced mindless compliance and called it peace. Meg saved her little brother through the one thing IT couldn't understand (or control): love. \nGiven the number of people (across the political spectrum) who are trying to force orderly compliance, I was really hoping that the movie would do justice to these themes. Instead, it ran more with a trite \"love yourself, love conquers all\" kind of message. Trite and nearly meaningless.The screenwriters evidently missed the point of the book. Too bad. It is an excellent book.",

Also, from there Meg travels by herself back to Camazotz to rescue Charles Wallace, but in the film she is left there by mistake. This fact, along with (2), is important because it's part of her maturation, her learning that the truth, and the ability to fight darkness, is already inside her, inside all of us; but in the film the list of warriors is just part of a lesson from the Ms's. In the book, the Ms's are more Socratic, maieutic, guiding us to recognize truths we already know in another form. This is briefly referenced in the film in a kind of flashback Meg or the children together have when being told about the darkness, and they recognize it in many little petty events in their lives (bullies, adults with conflicts), so the film doesn't get this completely wrong, but is not consistent about the point. (3) is important to the author's vision. I very much sympathize with the intention to make the story more ecumenical, and indeed if I were writing the list it might not include Jesus, or not put him first. But it's not my list, it's L'Engle's, and we should respect that. (4) makes IT too abstract, when the power of the book is to make evil, the darkness, the thing, visible in a variety of weird yet concrete forms, while always reminding us that it, and the fight against it, takes many other concrete forms which we must learn to recognize. (5) similarly makes Camazotz too abstract, and less of a real planet. The ball-bouncing is preceded in the film by a ridiculous scene of tornadoes threatening the children (in the book the danger is not physical but mental/spiritual); and it is followed by an (illusory/dreamlike?) scene on a beach which doesn't capture Camazotz's austerity at all.IMO, the 2003 TV-film version was thematically better; it added a longish illusion/dream sequence at the end which was not in the book, but which stayed closer to the book's messages/themes than the changes in the new one.",

            "content": "A Wrinkle In Time is a children's book by Madeleine L'Engle that blends science-fiction and fantasy. It's also remarkable for featuring a female protagonist with a majority-female supporting cast all the way back in 1962. It follows Meg Murry on a journey across the cosmos to rescue her father. The book's gentle thrills and spiritual themes have made it loved by many, including by myself. It's also quite surreal, dealing in abstracts and ambiguous descriptions. As a result it has long been considered \"unfilmable.\" That word has never stopped filmmakers before though! So, now we get a crack at it directed by Ava DuVernay, with screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell. How did they do? Let's take a look and see...A Wrinkle In Time opens with Meg, played by Storm Reid, remembering her father (Chris Pine). He disappeared four years ago, leaving no trace. She's ended up troubled at school, but while people around her have accepted that he's gone, Meg refuses to give up her hope. Her hope is rewarded when her younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) brings home a friend. This friend is a woman who calls herself Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). She's joined by Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey). She informs the kids that their father is, in fact, alive. But, he will need their help to escape the clutches of a cruel force known as the Darkness. Meg and Charles Wallace thus have to venture out, joined by Meg's friend Calvin (Levi Miller), to save him.So first I want to praise the movie's strengths. Nowhere is it stronger than in the visuals. A Wrinkle in Time boasts delightful scenery, and looks wonderful at every angle. The effects used for the tesseracts - pathways that allow instant travel around the cosmos - look fun and surreal. I found myself especially impressed by the planet Uriel, a utopian garden world with soaring mountains and lush plant life. Between the visual artists, costuming, and make-up, a lot of people deserve to feel proud of their work here...Read the rest at https://www.gouldenbean.com/wrinkle-in-time-review",

The book takes a few chapters to build up to this, which makes the final bit work well, the movies - straight to it with little to no build up.On a positive note, it was well filmed, great costumes and brilliant CGI.

I don't know the lead actress playing the heroine, but she spends the whole movie with one expression - blank staring. The older actresses are all chronically overacting, probably in some attempt to give it life. Even when there is a group of them together it's as if they are delivering lines in an an animation voice studio and they are not actually present or relating to each other. At one point the young brother reappears after being separated and there is zero reaction. The whole film is like that. There are one or two good visual moments, like the sinister children bouncing balls and their Stepford mothers, but otherwise no. It doesn't even have any scientific element to give it some credence.

            "content": "Disney's latest live-action outing is a dimension-traversing trip that centres on troubled 13-year-old Meg (Storm Reid), as she journeys into the unknown to find her scientist father (Chris Pine) who disappeared four years earlier. Joined by her precocious whizz-kid brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) and cute-guy-next-door Calvin (Levi Miller), our headstrong but vulnerable protagonist must confront both evil otherworldly forces and her own life-blocking emotions. Aiming to be accessible for younger audiences, the core message - internal growth is impossible without self-belief - is hardly new, but, despite a completely on-the-nose delivery, it's also effective. The connective tissue isn't always the best (the less time spent thinking about plot machinations the better), though there's no shortage of thrills and wonder, or heart wrenching payoffs, in the numerous high-concept set pieces. There are parts of this movie that are unintentionally silly and a few of director Ava DuVerney's stylistic choices are dubious (over-sized Oprah Winfrey? standard black-tentacle incarnation of 'evil'?), yet enough goodwill is generated elsewhere to forgive these missteps. DuVerney doesn't hide her influences either, family classics such as Avatar and Wizard of Oz are obvious touchstones whilst more adult-leaning masterpieces like 2001: A Space Odyssey and even The Exorcist (\"Charles Wallace is not at home right now\") provide inspiration. Reid is an absolute gem in the lead role too, equally convincing in her self-destructive stubbornness to detach from the world as she is in the gradual shift to valuing her strengths, weaknesses and everything in between. She feels right at home sharing the big screen with Hollywood veterans such as Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, who, along with comedian Mindy Kaling, play an amusing trio of peculiar beings that guide our heroes on their trek. Ambitious to a fault, A Wrinkle in Time is a family-friendly fantasy saga that wears its heart on its sleeve whilst delivering a visually wondrous, if occasionally scatty, rollercoaster ride.",

I saw Disney's previous attempt at adapting this book long ago and detested it, but I was open to giving it a new shot (even if I should have been worried that all the promotion of the movie seemed to ignore L'Engle and the story in favor of celebrating DuVernay and Oprah, in hindsight). I knew audiences weren't loving this movie, and it was already disappearing from theaters, but... oof. Some of the most memorable and meaningful bits of the book were chopped. Mrs Who was cheapened with the updated and uninspired quotes she says. And the themes of the book were dramatically cheapened by focusing on the \"believe in urself gurl!!!\" theme so obnoxiously. (Did hear the song for the end credits?) There was a selfless love that was a theme of the book that here is largely replaced with prideful self-love. I was also sad to see Mr Murray didn't get to work with and encourage his daughter on Camazotz in this adaptation. That's so key. It's a strong indication DuVernay was exploiting the source to make the cheap points she wanted to make instead of really understanding and honoring the source. Same for dropping the blind & kind creatures that the book had us meet so memorably. Calvin... ugh. Why did they make him so creepy in the movie?Casting major celebs as the Mrss was a dumb move. Their essential quality was a strangeness. By making them the most familiar faces on screen, that dynamic was inverted. So dumb! And their acting was not so hot. I mean, Oprah did okay. Not Reese or Mindy. The 3D was very unenjoyable. Duh. I only saw it in 3D because that showing fit my schedule. There were a few good moments but overall I am very disappointed indeed.",

I am also not sold to the idea that movies should be rated from 1 to 10, I much prefer the Google way of saying did you like it, yes or no. With that being said, yes, 8 is my honest score for this movie.Now about the actual movie, it is the type of movie where first you are shown the main characters in the real world, some back story, current situation not so great, then something happens that takes them on a journey in a world that obeys to no defined rules and from there just about anything can happen. Movies that are a blend of fantasy, metaphors on good vs evil, a kind of dream-like feel to them , this is one such movie.I'll name a few movies I believe have a similar style/feel than A Wrinkle of Time:\nNeverending Story,\nWhat dream may come,\nWarriors of virtue,\nForbidden Kingdom,\nStardust,\n(Many more I can't think of right now)This movie presents a different view on the universe, it could very well act as the first in a series of many (very unlikely now with the kind of reviews it is getting).It also delivers some powerful messages and metaphors. For example \"nothing travels faster than light except darkness\" is used to show how some people let the bad affect them far more than the good.I also don't believe this is a kid movie at all, despite the visuals. I would not recommend this movie for anyone under 15 years old, and they have to be into that type of movies that take you on ride to show things that might seem overly obvious to some. If you hate at least one of the movies I listed above, this might not be for you.I'll end this here, hoping this kind of review will be useful to at least 1 person.",

            "content": "I thought that this might actually be good. The Last Jedi was great, and was loathed by full time Star Wars stiffs who spend way too much time earnestly debating the economic trade policies from The Phantom Menace. People who actually just love Star Wars love The Last Jedi. Maybe the latest Disney sci fi outing to get trashed by the anti woke parade could still have some juice. I have no relationship to the novel, and I'm also not a racist. I honestly thought I'd have a lot of fun. Let's take a snapshot 40 minutes in to see exactly how insane the start of the story is: three witches unwittingly led by a five year old trick a depressed preteen and her dim witted sidekick into going on an intergalactic rescue mission to save the preteen's dad, Captain Kirk, who got lost in space years earlier (it's the five year old's dad too, but that kid is doing just fine, because he's a genius astronaut and friend to the local homeless community). The kids get transported from their palatial urban backyard to the grassy knoll from the Windows xp desktop. Once there, we ask some floating flowers where dad's gone, once the flowers gesture towards a lake, one of the witches turns into a flying lettuce and the team jump on her back. Let me pause to say, the shapeshifting transition from Mrs Whatsit, queen of drapes to Mrs Whatsit, flying cabbage monster involves flashing three minors, without their consent and over the protest of the confused sidekick (I'm with this guy, Reese Witherspoon is very beautiful but I do not want to see her naked body transform into literally a giant lettuce). This whole thing should have been great, it doesn't get much nuttier than this. But it wasn't good. It was awful. This is humourless, risk-free, cloying awful nonsense. It just accidentally sounds hilarious in summary. How about on mute, does it look cool? No. Remember Avatar, that movie from about 10 years ago? Yeah, if you're going to make a $100 million CGI spectacle maybe spend the money on the nerds on the computers instead of on Oprah. The first 40 minutes of this movie involves schoolyard bullying and assault with a basketball, emotional manipulation of the mentally ill, sexual harassment and digital environments that look like they're covered in thick plastic. It's not a strong opening lineup. If you think that more believing in yourself is what preteens of today need, you are very welcome to continue on this journey to discover exactly that. I'm afraid to say, while my eyes made it to the end, my heart didn't.The moment that I swerved off and rolled into a deep ravine was when I caught myself thinking about one of these witches, Mrs Who. Mrs Who only speaks in quoted aphorisms and monologues from famous writers, quotes she discovered by reading books after she \"evolved past language\". Oh, ok, cool. ALL SPEECH IS QUOTATION. You've evolved past language but didn't do first year literary theory? It's an insult! I'm happy for you to appropriate the bajeezus out of this 50-year-old book to put a couple of black characters in it. But how dare you disrespect those of us with literature or creative writing degrees! You might be mistaken early on for thinking that the last witch, Mrs Which, has the unique superpower to shrink and grow really big. In fact, her remarkable ability is to give emotional speeches that are, 100% substance-free. Once she stops speaking, you realise, hey, what did she just say? It's like someone erased a few seconds from my memory. I remember that speech, starting, but where are we now? And it happens again. You open your eyes and suddenly, you're on the floor, and your kids are rushing over to see why you blacked out. What's happening to me? Mrs Which is so emotionally inert, yet still so covered in sparkles, it's the reason this movie gets two stars instead of one. In an ambitious sci fi fantasy spectacle, I was underprepared for just how glossy, incoherent and so aggressively offenseless A Wrinkle in Time would be.",

            "content": "This movie deserves a much higher rating than the one it has. It's well-directed, all the actors does a great performance, especially the kid playing Charles Wallace. The soundtrack is great and the story is gripping. The worlds were really interesting, especially the dark world. There was something so unsettling about the apparent normalcy. The pacing was good and the message was clear and conveyed beautifully. There was stunning scenery and great CGI.So I honestly don't understand what makes people give it a one star rating. It's not a movie that challenges the viewer or brings anything new to the table, and it's very straightforward and simple, but that doesn't mean it deserves only one star. I've seen boring, nonsensical movies get better ratings than this. I haven't read the books so I can't compare this movie to the books, but honestly I think that's a good thing. Because what makes a good book and what makes a good movie are two very different things. The movie made the story work in it's format and it did it really well. And that's all that matters.Overall a really enjoyable and visually stunning movie that I warmly recommend.Lastly, I just loved the crazy costumes and hairstyles of the three ladies. I'm not sure I've ever seen this many female characters with speaking roles who are interesting and important to the plot in one movie before. Not to mention so many black women. It was really nice to see.",

            "content": "It looks as though Disney is kinda giving up on wasted ideas for a solid kid-friendly movie filled with magic and adventure. However, I wasn't very happy when this adaptation of \"A Wrinkle In Time\" came out. I saw the movie and just a few short minutes, I walked out of the theater. I'm not saying the movie is bad, but it's just so awfully boring as hell. Every time I heard the name \"Christopher Wallace\" so many times, it makes the film very cringe. I knew that somethings wrong with this bland adaptation of an iconic children's classic. This is like a Disney Channel daytime talk show more like a Hallmark Sing-Along birthday card.This was supposed to be my biggest anticipated movie of 2018, but according to me and myself only, I chose to re-watch Black Panther again and again. Awesome time to be a badass Marvel fan. A wrinkle In Time is just not worth my time. Despite the acting good but sometimes cheesey, stunning visual effects, great soundtrack, an undermined forgettable script, and a promising great director (Ava DuVernay) who produced 12 Years A Slave and directed Selma (another Oprah-produced movie), I'm afraid Disney just botched the movie so bad because of all the hype surrounding the film's release. I don't know if this is gonna be a sci-fi adventure fantasy film for kids, another Disney fairytale adaptation, a steampunk sci-fi thriller, maybe it just doesn't know when you're marketing the film correctly and timed it the way every Disney movie should offer.FYI, Oprah Winfrey, Storm Reid, Chris Pine, and Reese Witherspoon are the only good saving grace that I loved and their performances wasn't nearly that bad. Conclusion: Probably I should avoid buying it on Blu-Ray, but my mom still loves Oprah very much. So I'd prefer a rental. Still, A Wrinkle In Time is a total box office bust. It could barely break even, but after I read about the domestic box office here in the States, this is a massive disappointment for the undisputed House That Mickey Built probably write-down on half of it's receipts. Better safe than sorry, Disney.",

Yes, there is here and there some production value, but everything else: gone is the wonder, gone are the charismatic heroes, gone is the suspense, but left is, well, not too much to care about. Disney, like those other big players of the movie business, does not care about the company's products anymore but about gains and profits.

First is because the plot is not so special, as the cinematography and its main story idea. The cinematography is fantastic, thanks to the cinematographer, Tobias A.Schliessler, who was well-known for his work in Beauty and the Beast and Lone Survivor. In this sci-fi movie, the cinematographer is so great, especially when each time the actors are doing tesser thing, that kind of teleportation, to enter the unknown world. I appreciate also for the acting of Reese Whiterspoon, that is always professional and memorable. She is the one!! In this movie, we can see also the newcomers Storm Reid and Deric McCabe, who are funny, energetic, and show their talent on maximum. They are going to be the next superstars!! But this movie still can not reach 7 stars, because the plot is so predictable, not so strong, and gives us the audience wondering, what is the essential of being disappeared and gives risk to his life and family? Well, this movie is about the 4 years disappearance of a father, notable scientist, to the unknown world, but he is trapped there. His children, with the help of magic universe figured by Oprah Winfrey and team, helped them to across the bridge and found him. Because of the lack of the plots, I think this movie can be watched by DVD or just wait in HBO. If the process of this movie had asked JJ Abrams to join to create the plot, maybe this movie would be the greatest movie this year. I hope I can see Reid and McCabe again in SciFi movies, but with more strong plot and more unpredictable ending, because we need more adventure. This world is so stressed, so we need adventure by watching movie.",

I really like the special effects, I think they look terrific throughout.Onto the cast. Storm Reid does a respectable job as Meg, her performance arguably gets better as things progress - which is the opposite to the film overall. Chris Pine is underused in his role, but the casting of Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling is good - Zach Galifianakis too. I didn't actually find Deric McCabe's character, Charles Wallace, annoying like most seemingly did.Surprised to see that this has a low rating across the board. I've never read the Madeleine L'Engle novel so perhaps that has something to do with it? I do agree the writing isn't necessarily great either.

Yes, many things have changed for the script, but reading the book prior to the movie so I could make an honest judgement made one thing clear.\nThe book is very weak. it doesn't grab me like other books did. nowhere did I feel any depth in it, or any touching feeling. I did have the same with Narnia, don't get me wrong, but there the story for some reason is less depending on coincidental facts to have things happen. It just wishes to be too much and too special.\nThe movie gave me the same feeling and I understood why they made some choices for this adaptation. But seriously, were those the only choices you made? well bad choices were made. It all looks so cheap, so fake, so over the top. The costumes are just really badly made, the visuals look unfinished, the script is just proof of bad writing and even the actors don't seem to enjoy making the film. Reese just comes off as she always does, knowing it all better. Mindy struggles to keep her part up and Oprah, well, she's just Oprah with a wig on. You do want to hug her. she's the only one that you feel love from. But then you just expect her to hand out cars to everyone and she also just doesn't hold up the part well.\nAll in all, this seems to be a bunch of stars having a costumeparty and one of their friends just happens to record it. \nI sat it out, I really did, The book already was a struggle to get through because of the poor writing, but man, how can 1 hour and 40 minutes feel like it cost you your entire weekend and leaves you exhausted.",

The main story is great with great cinematographer, the former cinematographer for Beauty and the Beast, but the plots are quite boring and lack of effects for Sci Fi standard. I can understand maybe the Director would like to deliver a Sci Fi movie with the normal touch, not too much, but this way is failed to impress the audience.

The film was choppy, leaving out many of the important plots and aspects of the novel, including the character development and spirituality. In fact, the movie did a complete 180 with the spirituality that completely left those who are most deeply aware of L'Engle's work completely lost. While I applaud some of the tweaks the director made, such as making the family dynamic more applicable to today's society (interracial, adopted child in family), changing things like Mrs. Whatsit from a Centaurian type of creature into a flying lettuce made no sense. I still don't understand what happened with the character of Mrs. Which, other than to over-emphasize the over-inflated ego of Oprah, the changes just fell flat and made the movie insufferable. The sanitization of the movie by Disney to leave out the importance of the book's meaning spiritually goes to show how it has lost it's touch with reality and deeper meaning behind the works it is trying to recreate for the big screen. Just because it wants to make it seem that there is no such thing as a higher power, doesn't mean that the spiritualness of anything has to be dumped at the door.",

I'm a fan of the book, and like all movies from books, it is different from the book. The movie captures the spirit and heart of the book. This is a children's movie. There are some scary Stepford wives type scenes and a creepy beach scene - and the It is a scary brain that influences thoughts and emotions. There are no intergalactic spaceship fights, no sword battles, very little physical fighting, the fight is for hearts and minds. I would compare it favorably to the Wizard of Oz, and both versions of the Wiz - even though it is not a musical. Has something in common with the first Spy Kids movie that really had the children as the heroes - that one featured a Latino family. Enjoyed seeing it in a theater filled with children and their parents - the children loved it! At the end, everyone clapped! Do something good for your spirit and go see this film!",

Having almost given up hope in life, Meg is visited by three peculiar characters which show her how to travel into space, hoping to find her father and end a powerful force which threatens the universe.It's a movie which at first seems very interesting. It has an interesting premise and brings along a couple of fantastic elements which can make almost everyone shiver in excitement. Unfortunately, the implementation is where almost everything goes wrong with this film. The plot is predictable from the start and does little to change even when close to the end. It's very linear and has, at least as far as I'm concerned, a couple of plot-holes which ruin the little logic that his story has. The characters are pretty underdeveloped and even not very likeable, fact which alienates most empathy. The dialog is so simplistic that it left me feeling on many occasions that it was a movie aimed mostly at primary school audience. To make matters worse, every problem the characters face seems to have a tendency of getting solved/forgotten/forgiven way too slowly. Thus, it doesn't bring any sense of satisfaction as something gets solved.To mention some good aspects about it, I have to tell that the visuals are quite amazing. Every world and place that the characters visit is so impressive, filled with vivid colors and great detail, you cannot help but gaze at it. Also on the plus side, it has some good actors which tend to stand out from time to time but the basics of the movie are too weak for them to help its cause. Oh, and it also has a couple of great songs to back it up from time to time.Overall, I have to say that it was a disappointment. A boring set of events without complexity, a couple of simple characters which don't manage to attract feelings from the viewer and a bad way of solving problems in terms of storytelling, leave an interesting set of fantastic worlds a bit shallow. It's no point in having great visuals if you're not going to tell ca compelling and also interesting story along the way. Too bad...",

Let's start with the positives. Oprah, for what she was in during the movie, she did a good job. Same goes with Chris Pine. The movie was mostly visually stunning and had great costumes and hairstyling. Now let's go into the negatives. The movie was so jumbled around that it couldn't keep a steady plot. Things would just happen out of nowhere and what bugged me was that characters were just fine with it. None of the characters were too surprised with what happened in the movie. The acting wasn't that good either. It's hard with kids so you most of the time shouldn't have the highest expectations. There was this one kid. He played the character Charles Wallace. My god was he horrible. He was by far the worst part of the film. They really needed to work with his character. There were also some stuff in the trailer that weren't in the movie which isn't a good thing in my opinion. There were random pop songs that were placed at totally random parts and weren't needed. The first half of the first act was good, then it started to get worse and worse. The third act of the movie to me wasn't good. It was nothing exciting and didn't catch my attention. I got bored during some parts of the movie. I can't say the movie was absolutely terrible, but I can't say I liked it. It was mainly a Disney cash grab that failed at the box office. If you want to see it, go ahead, but don't expect too much.\nMy Grade: C-",

It's filmed like a scientific drama, but tries to have a sort of magic and cosmos feel and it doesn't work because the visual lacks atmosphere and has a lot of handheld operation. To me, it feels like the director couldn't handle the weight of the project and simply tried to get the shots done in time. The hinting at technical scientific theories is weak and brushed under the carpet, even though it's for kids it still felt weak. Disney has seemed to lost their master filmmakers who were disciplined in all aspects of filmmaking. And if I have to hear the double name \"Charles-Wallace\" one more time I'll go crazy.",

It is this kind of fear that the film challenges us to see and understand before it consumes us.\nThis story is not about skin color, nor sexual anatomy. It is about the power of love and the destruction of fear. The director does an excellent job creating this moral lesson with cinematic vision that both children and adults can appreciate.

But Duverny has no understanding of how to shoot fantasy, at first coming across awkwardly against the urban backdrop and then later in a soulless void of green screen with flat plates of actors and vistas with no grounding or relevance. Wrinkle has a stodgy story with no relatable sense of logic; typically, although cliche, these kinds of fantasy kids films end up portraying the fantasy elements as connected to the grief or fear of the child as they grow up. This film just throws colourful nonsense at us willy billy with no explanation of the logic and no way of connecting to any of it. One imagines that if this were a 2D animated Ghibli film it would be spectacular and appropriate, but like this it ironically seems lifeless and disconnected and pointless.\nIt's twists and turns are predictable and the action is turgid. The way characters meet and the plot moves on are utterly contrived, it's disappointing really.\nIt's not a terrible film, and sometimes with the dramatic elements it can actually be quite stirring and emotional, it's just mostly a film that misses the mark in every department.",

My childhood growing up wasn't that great, so I treasured books that could really transport me on adventures to far away lands, and leave me feeling a sense of magic in this world. This series of books was in my top 2. So you can see how magical and PRECIOUS it is. Madeline L'Engle was a true genius, and I'm not sure that she never actually tessered in her life... but on to the review...\nWith great sadness I have to wonder why Disney felt the need to turn this into a white girls hate the black girl racial thing. With all the hatred in the world right now, we CERTAINLY don't need \"The happiest place on earth\" to be pushing such hurtful issues in HAPPY FAMILY MOVIES! And quite honestly, the choice to change the home from a rural area where they have their wishing rock by a pond - which any of us knows is SO important - to a low rent area where people are getting beaten up and groceries scattered... they ARE scientists right??? And to turn main characters black is not only BEYOND me, it ANGERS me, even after I've had time to think about it. The term cultural appropriation is thrown around all the time when it's against white people, but NEVER when it's against any other race. Why is that? Do you think the African American community would be happy if Soul Food was remade with white folk? Meg, Charles Wallace, the Twins- who were completely forgotten, and their mom were WHITE, and Meg faced white girl problems, and it's WRONG to re - write that, it was important to who she was and thus how she handled the issues! For the record, I am NOT white, I am of the Cree Nation, and you want to talk bad feelings? just saying... There were entire areas of the story that were COMPLETELY left out, entire PLANETS! And those were important in developing the characters! Also, what is up with the UGLY LETTUCE MONSTER, when for DECADES, the symbol on the COVER OF THE BOOK has been the kids on the back of a CENTAUR?!?! Talk about screwing up the story!!!\nThe bright light is all the beautiful use of color, they did SO GOOD! Mandy from the office was AMAZING, I just wanted to hug her! Charles Wallace was darling, and a great little actor! The blond actress was AWFUL on top of the fact her character was written all wrong! Oprah - long live the Diva!!!! The ONLY thing I will say, and this is as a model and one who does makeup tutorials, SEVERAL times they had her eyebrows crooked, and her lipstick was AWFUL! Use Lime Crime or Jeffree Starr to get that sparkle that stays thick!\nAll in all, if it's free, and you've read the book, watch it. Otherwise, AVOID!",

Sadly, we both thought it was awful. I can't fault the actors, this falls entirely on the director. Why on earth do these directors think the stories need to be altered so much? The story was beautiful the way it was written, maybe it should've been updated to make it work with modern times, but not by much.

His role required acting a period of the movie under the evil influence of an intergalactic dark force and he was just superb. 2nd, the lead actor was 14 year old accomplished child actor Storm Reid who played Meg, a new middle schooler who drives the search for her father, a very demanding role that was extremely well acquitted. 3rd, 14 year old Levi Miller playing a neighborhood friend of Meg's called Calvin. Miller is no stranger to stand out performances in leading roles (Pan, Red Dog:True Blue, Better Watch Out, American Exit and Jasper Jones) and he was equally strong in this, cementing his place as one of Hollywood's top teen actors.",

You'll always be aware you're watching Oprah acting. Chris Pine is just tedious and it's not his fault. He just plays a tedious character. He should fire his agent. The lead character, Meg, is just annoying. On top of that, this film is saddled with a story that just gets weirder and weirder, bleaker and bleaker and is burdened with a soundtrack to match - it's excruciating; one of the worst I can remember.

I'm not sure what happened here, but it's just a big mess with few good things in it. So the positives; this film has a wonderful message about self confidence which kids should hear. Oprah was something to behold, she didn't do much but she definitely had an interesting prescense on screen. And Storm Reid did a great job with what she was given, I think she has a bright future. Ok now the bad. This movie makes no sense, and it asks you to just start accepting all this crazy shit happening without earning it. Some things just happen for no reason and they're so bizarre and jarring. The acting from all the others mentioned is either real bad or just too much. Reese Witherspoon is just weird and over the top, and she gets rather annoying real quick. Mindy Kaling did her best with what she was given I suppose, but it wasn't much, and she speaks in quotes, which I guess could be cool if she didn't say who said it right after, and then she just speaks normally halfway through. Levi Miller plays the typical sidekick love interest that's typically given to women, so ok we can let that one slide, but he literally is there for no reason. Even when we're introduced to him, right before the magic stuff starts happening btw, they ask him why he's there and he says he doesn't know, he just felt like he was supposed to, and they never explain that, it's so weird and lazy. Now Deric McCabe...Oh boyI don't want to rag on this kid because he's young and inexperienced so I'm sure his performances will improve, but holy crap this kid got on my nerves. His delivery of this already pretty bad dialogue is just painful. And for some reason he's just aware of all the magic stuff from the beginning and it never explains that. Then they turn him into the bad guy at the end, so now he's trying to deliver this typical villain dialogue with his squeaky childish voice and it just comes across as cringy. All of the other actors do a good job with the very little they had. Overall I really disliked this film and contemplated walking out several times. The only reason I didn't was because I thought it could in some way redeem itself, but it never did. I could see your kids really enjoying this movie, but you shouldn't expect to.",

I can't say I was overly thrilled about watching the film, but I was bored and how bad could it really be? Turns out worse than expected.The story of the movie is supposed to be a feel-good family adventure about the triumphs of good over evil. The plot of the film follows a group of children exploring dream like worlds as they attempt to track down their lost father. All the while they are aided by the fairy tail godlike beings who want to protect the universe from darkness. Unfortunately the film was a narrative mess in every regard. The movie completely dropped the ball in adapting the classic A Wrinkle in Time novel and its subtle complexities.Even describing the basic plot of the movie is a bit difficult largely due to scripting errors. The movie is all over the place and filled with massive plot holes. Its all around very poor writing seems incapable of grabbing the audience. I never once felt compelled to care about the conflicts of the film or any of the characters in the least. I just kept waiting for something interesting to happen.The central conflict never felt grand or epic in any regard which is a shame considering the source material. Despite the beautiful backdrop of the movie the characters all felt like set pieces aimlessly wandering around. There just wasn't a single interesting character in the entire film. With a solid cast of big name actors not one of them brought anything of merit to their roles. They can't really be blamed though for poor writing and directing.A Wrinkle in time is supposed to be a feel-good family adventure about empowerment and the virtues of love and compassion. It's a noble cause to craft a concept around, but at the end of the day this was barely a watchable movie. I really expect better from Disney at this point, particularly when utilizing a beloved childhood classic.So there is one small silver lining which is the animation. The movie had some absolutely beautiful scenes. There were some moments of pure eye candy in the world building. I see where the majority of the budget went to with this box office bomb.At the end of the day not even Oprah with her fairy godmother like appearance could save this movie. While yes it was a shiny film meant for children, there is never an excuse for making a bad movie. The writing was all over the place and it never managed to craft an interesting narrative. It completely ignored the most interesting aspects of the novel. It seems like Disney has at least one bomb a year, this was certainly one of the worst major box office films of 2018.

Can they unite their powers to make the Murry family whole once again?Director Ava DuVernay (Selma 2014) and screenplay writers Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell seem determined to bring novelist Madeleine L'Engle's beloved book, A Wrinkle In Time to the big screen. Unfortunately, the result might best be described as a valiant effort.The good: Child actors Storm Reid and Deric McCabe are adorably well-cast as the Murry kids. The adult actors: Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Mrs. Murry), Winfrey, Witherspoon and Pine take their roles seriously, and I cannot fault their performances. The costumes are sumptuous and the filmography combined with CGI effects is stunning.The bad: The screenplay drags and fails to establish the proper tension required to invigorate the characters' actions. Miraculously, with all it has going for it, Wrinkle falls flat.Wrinkle is not a bad movie for its runtime of 1 hour and 49 minutes, but it actually feels like forever, and it seriously misses the mark in its tepid delivery of such an important and timely message.",

I am still struggling with what exactly happened. Most of the events that occur throughout the film seemed pointless, tacky and annoying. Including the small boy 'Charles Wallace' (played by Deric McCabe), with a voice that will go straight through you, was very awkward at times. Which I put down mainly to the direction.The direction was abismal. Ava DuVernay was able to make even Oprah's role feel uncomfortable. They could have shortened the movie considerably if all the characters didn't feel the need to spend 3 minutes between every word they said and their reaction times.I have no idea what the movie was about. Something about 'Tessersing'? There were scenes that made no sense, people just disappear and pop up a few minutes later with little explanation and if I'm honest, I could have done without the annoying children in it at all. There's one scene where this girl is just looking out of window, it was a bit strange the first time, but when you see her again, it just seems disturbing. Chris Pine who plays the father, 'Mr. Murry' didn't strike the cord. He is intense and again, slow. He should have stayed in the box they found him.I would love to time travel to get the last couple of hours of my life back.

Terrible acting, terrible special effects and it bore no semblance to the novel. Very disappointing. For anyone considering watching this, don't, read the book instead and be entranced.",

This movie felt more like a Disney channel original rather than a theatrical release. The actors were poorly chosen and the script was terribly written. Storm Reid was so absolutely annoying as Meg and I know that Charles Wallace is supposed to be a know-it-all kind of child, but it was very overdone and obnoxious. I found I read the book multiple times and I enjoyed it a lot. This totally dishonored the book. Overall I VERY much disliked this.",

This movie wasn't horrible. The movie has great messages of connection with all, of being yourself and letting your light shine and owning your faults (which may actually be your gifts). I do feel like there was some flat acting in the movie, particularly in some of the beginning sequences, and the beginning was a little slow running for me, but it picked up as the movie moved forward, and there were scenes that were moving enough to have me crying.My 12 year old son loved the movie, and I thought he might pee his pants because he didn't want to take a bathroom break in fear of missing something. I would have loved this movie when I was his age too. This is why I feel the audience for this movie is ages 7-13. The movie seems to deal with situations for this age range (isn't that the age range the book is written for too?).I still liked the movie enough for it to hold my interest, I didn't feel burnt for paying to go see it, especially since my son liked it so much. I also loved the messages the movie had for my son - it was worth the watch just for that.This is a good family film to take the kids to - but don't expect oscar worthy performances.",

(in order to avoid 'suspicions' maybe!? yes, racial issues ARE tricky in America but is the media helping in eliminating them the way they truly could really, or are they worsening it even further? why, for example, America did eventually have an African Black prsident but not a Native one yet? not that i know of at least, has there been one?)dunno if others would agree with me on this but trying to encourage some minority races (again, in the 'police-state' America more than anywhere else, where the topic is 'critical' surely!) into liking science and 'falling' for it when pursuing higher education is in itself a GRAND issue in that country, where, again, education in general and higher education in particular, is not an easy thing for MOST people to begin with, which is due to high expenses and serious financial obstacles such as high-interest bank loans, not to mention 'lack of job security' after graduation, which is also probably the biggest downer for many American young when thinking about becoming a scientist or even a business professional or anything when they daydream about growing up and getting rich!that means no matter what race or minority (or even majority!) group you come from in the US of A, although entering schools is not difficult for anyone, but staying in them (and remaining a 'sane' person too!) is the most difficult, almost impossible part of the deal!that is why America's been so reliant on importing highly educated experts and specialists 'from other planets' rather than producing them 'here on Earth' for a long time now ... (much less to export them 'universally across other galaxies' too!)also, this is certainly a ladies movie i'd say ... director is a female, one of the writers also is, and at least one of the producers too ... not to mention some other females in key positions behind the scenes AS WELL AS in the story: The THREE WHICHes (of Universevil?) are female, the protagonist is a girl, and her scientist mother ... another female 'key figure' there too ...nothing wrong with that of course and i have always loved and strongly supported most female-made art of all kinds my entire boring life post maturity ...but, and again due to the reasons mentioned in previous paragraphs (the rather big and ALARMING shortage of highly specialist DOMESTIC physicians, industrialists, scientists and so on in America thus having to 'purchase' them from other countries) and trying to get minorities (perhaps African Americans more than others?) into, ''Think about it Meg, THAT not so attractive yet very smart teenage gal defending and saving her 'handsome White scientist' ignorant yet loving and hipster father could be YOU! Who knows, maybe a handsome nice White boy will also like you someday just as your White pa did your Black ma, you see!?''but when the proper grounds for breeding such a rare and valuable stock is not only unprepared, but almost entirely ruined and wasted thus unavailable, sending such sublime messages across to the likely candidates is rather like offering them a delicious dessert before the main course and reminding them right away that there's not going to be any meal later anyway, deal with it! (did the current POTUS who's willing to reduce and stop exporting jobs offshore sponsored this movie by any chance? ((NAAAHHH! this movie is pro-Obama openly and for obvious reasons!)) besides, the current POTUS has already sponsored offshore drilling for 'cheap oil' in some nice and clean US places already though, hasn't he?) :Dand those direct hints at cultural and artistic or scientific \"WARRIORS\" by quoting them (who, not surprisingly, come from all nations in the world, well, almost, including America!) as if we're browsing through those cliche' Facebook memes ... and eventually naming them one by one in the end as well (with the exception of many lesser-known yet more influential ones!) doesn't help much really, especially when coming out of the mouth of an overweight business minded super conservative tv and showbiz celebrity figure (and a likely POTUS candidate in the future as well) disguised as a liberal, who happens to be anything but a progressive- or scientific-minded persona really! (just check out her choice of a psychiatrist whot ended up running his own show later!)or maybe that was the idea after all: attracting the attentions of that rather large section of the American society that watches tv all day and night long and loves nearly anything amusing BUT science!?(bringing her giant presence down from the sky and making her look like a normal-size human ((albeit still covered in heavy makeup and fancy expensive dress)) which one of the young actors also confirmed, was a nice touch though! i liked that ...) ;-)long story short, i'm not saying this is a BAD movie; it's actually even worth watching (once only and no more!) and probably the text upon which this movie's been made is a good read after all, but my final conclusion is that it's too mature for the young addresses it was made for (was it?) while also too childish for the mature audience (ignorant 'scientist' parents 'Lost In Space' in particular) who're supposed to like and 'learn' a thing or two from it ...",

            "content": "I picked up a copy of A Wrinkle in Time as a 4th grader in 1984. The book did not resonate with me. For whatever reason, it was not what I had expected and I put the book down for 33 years.At the start of this year I saw that Disney was making A Wrinkle in Time into a movie. I knew it was time to finish the job. I don't like to leave any book I start unfinished, and this was a chance to see if there really was anything interesting in that old book.I ordered a copy from Amazon, and in a few days I was reading it each night to my 11 and 12 year old boys. We finished the book just in time to catch the movie on its release weekend.I think the movie is fantastic.The movie brought the book to vibrant, dazzling life. What was rote back and forth dialogue between a small child and a celestial being, now became a supernatural event that opened up the universe to the earthbound adventurers.Yes there were differences between the book and the movie, but there always are. The changes save time, limit peripheral characters and in the case of the ending, give the movie more emotion and energy than the book's hurried last scene.The movie was made for a modern audience, updating setting, references and language to connect with today's children and adults.What makes the book and the movie great are the themes. Underlying the story are the ideas of perseverance, bravery, trust, family and most important of all, that love wins over fear. The movie captures the movies theme's perfectly, enhancing and amplifying them at just the right time and space.So why was the IMDB rating 3.7 when I looked on Sunday night? It has since climbed to 4.1, but that is still too low for a movie this good. Reading some of the user reviews, it was clear that the haters have come out in droves.Maybe some people simply don't like the movie. Having read the book, I certainly was in a better position to connect with the movie. But given that A Wrinkle in Time focus on interracial parents and their children, cast strong female characters that were part witch, part angel in the case of Oprah Winfrey, an all knowing demi-god, is it any surprise that there are people whose reflexive barriers prevented them from ever giving this children's movie a chance?Despite the overwhelmingly clear message of love, the haters had to lash out...and I know why.You see, the Black Thing has got them. They have been ensnared by IT and Central Intelligence, and they cannot help themselves. They watch a movie that describes the very thing that is the cause of their pain and suffering, along with the anecdote, but they are too blind to see.SPOILER ALERT\nSo I am writing this post to help you, the hater. You need to resist hate and the fear. You need to open your heart. You need to go back into that movie theater and realize you are about to watch a sad and bullied girl go on a journey across the universe to find the father she loves. She will be aided by angels, her future husband and her gifted little brother. She will have to be brave and fight in order to save her little brother from the clutches of evil. In the end she will discover that love conquers fear, and that she is strong and capable.If that doesn't make you happy and bring you joy, then maybe the Black Thing has its claws in you far deeper than any movie can rescue.",

It's a story about family, love, and self empowerment with parts of the original story woven throughout. If you can keep that in mind as you watch this movie, I think you'll enjoy it. I did.\nIt's been a long time since I read the books, but I read all of them (and the related Austins books). As such, I can't remember more than a few scenes from the book, let alone the specific details. But there was enough of the original story \"enfolded\" within the movie that it feels close enough to be easily recognizable.\nIs it a \"perfect\" movie? No. But it's the best adaptation of the books that I've seen yet. Very well done.\nAnd the beautiful visuals are stunning. The acting is (generally) good to great (some of the supporting characters are too one dimensional to be really believable, but they are really only there to serve as instantly recognizable stereotypes anyway). But the leads all mail it.\nThe thing you have to understand is that this movie is loosely based on the book, but it's also it's own story, and it does as very good job telling that story. It's a story about how important love is in a world where hatred, picture perfect consumerism, and general nastiness runs rampant. Maybe if we take the movie's lesson to heart, we won't have to travel to the ends of the universe to figure it out.\nIf you're looking for a positive, visually glorious, slightly perilous (it made my youngest grab for my hand in a few places), and thoroughly entertaining escape for 110 minutes, then this might be a good movie for your to watch.\nBut, if all you want to do is compare it to the book or bash on Oprah, then you won't enjoy this and you'll leave toxic reviews like so many other people have done.

One of my favorite things about the Mrs. Ws is their frumpiness, that manages, for many people, to conceal their brilliant natures. I wish it had been possible to do that in the film. Instead, we had yet another conflation of beauty and goodness. :-(",

These differences lasted a little more than a page. The contrasts ranged from, \"The cast looks different than described in the book.\" to \"Why did they remove and add so many unnecessary scenes?\"The only reason why this review isn't 1 star is because visually, the movie is stunning. Not the best ever, but definitely a lot better than other movies I've seen. However, I wish the budget wasn't spent so much on visuals, and spent more on runtime. The movie begins and ends so quickly, so you never really get to know the characters. I didn't care for anybody, because the scenes were going by too fast to comprehend. If this was someone's first exposure to the 'Wrinkle in Time' series, I think they would feel incredibly underwhelmed.",

I thought the movie caught the spirit of the book, while updating it cleverly.The kid actors were terrific, especially Storm Reid as Meg. A couple of the \"relevant\" jokes (Mrs. Who making hip-hop references) were too cute, but I liked how they linked mean girl culture to self-esteem and then linked that to the spreading darkness of \"It.\" While that is not what L'engle wrote, it is definitely in the spirit of her message.The filmmakers made great use of a smart black girl lead. When \"It\" tempts her with a life where she's popular, the vision includes her having straightened hair. Making Oprah Winfrey, as Mrs. Which, her mentor also underlined this thread. Again, a brilliant way to make the film relevant to 2018 without losing the heart of the story in any way.The movie really needed another 30 minutes in its run-time (and it wasted 12 of what it had with a stupid sequence of \"hey look at me!\" CGI), and needed to work a little harder on selling the physics, but I thought it was solid.",

I have liked Reese Witherspoon in everything I've ever seen her in but her, she is not quirky and adorable the way she's supposed to be (I think?) Mindy Kahling also just floated over her lines without infusing much meaning into them. The boy who played Calvin, and the other adult actors were excellent.

            "content": "The Disney Plus streaming service has introduced me to so many unexpected delights old and new that I would not have otherwise bothered with.This is one such unexpected surprise. In fact, I actually did read the novel a few years ago and I hated the saccharine overly done \"love\" theme and in your face religious aspects (I do enjoy subtle religious underpinnings in movies that give good morals but not when it's in your face). The book had some standout sequences that are memorable but overall it was not a children's book that I liked. To give you context, I adore children fantasy stories such as Tom's Midnight Garden, Moondial, Narnia series, Harry Potter, Dark Materials, etc.But I do love the promotional images of this film, it looks lavish and at least I thought to watch it just to appreciate the visuals. I am one who never ever watch or read something based on other people's opinions. I will decide for myself and I literally judge a book by its cover.One of the many positive stand outs in this film is the surprisingly nuanced performances of all the child stars. Particularly, 9 year old Deric Mcabe who literally stole the show for perhaps a good quarter of the movie's runtime. What a delicious performance, I hope this young child actor is well taken care of, has a happy childhood and not pushed into a career for the sake of wealth. But as long as he wishes to continue on that path, he will have my attention of high anticipation for greatness. The main star, 14 year old Storm Reid was also impressive with some moments of very heart felt nuances. There is no forced acting that one expects with child actors. The adult stalwarts did their part in their accomplished professional ways.But the film itself turned out to be a lovely visual journey with some heartfelt moments of psychological drama and surreal weirdness (something I wish it had delve into further)It has it's plentiful flaws for sure but seeing all those one star ratings is just utter madness. One of those flaws is a certain obvious godliness of Oprah Winfrey's presence that seems a bit unnecessary. I like Oprah, I just don't think it was really needed for her to be so godly! Being the leader would have sufficed.Another criticism I would have is that this could have done with much more humour. Reese Witherspoon's character has some comic relief moments but..just didn't feel enough.What I really appreciated is that unlike the book, this film gives a satisfying complete story. The book had sequels to complete it's main storyline. But as with all movie adaptations, much is cut out and I do feel the stripping down of some of the novel makes the flow of the film rather too haphazard.But the film works for me. It has some memorable sequences and is not anywhere as saccharine as I feared it would be. The journey is disjointed but the performances, visual imagination, Deric Mcabe's show stealing sequence and overall storyline makes up for the shortcomings.I give this a very worthy 7/10.",

All I checked out was the cast and the plot summary. The pace of the movie felt slow. The actors were great on their own (except Calvin which I'll explain later), as well as the visuals but the plot was too cliche and predictable ... which made the movie an overall \"bore\" to watch. \nBut it wasn't that boring though, given a lil thanks to the visuals. That's how I felt anyway, otherwise I would have yawn multiples times throughout the movie; but I didn't.Anyway, good acting came from the star actors, especially lil Charles Wallace (played by Deric McCabe). But one main character felt a bit odd to watch and that is Calvin (played by Levi Miller). Dude looks and sounds like he's high/drugged on some love spell. And I'm not sure if that's intentional or not but I did not feel any emotional depth in character. Like he's just there for the sake of being there. And the plot... ayy, nothing much to say about it other than it being absolutely predictable. Especially with the whole \"there is light in darkness\" concept. So yes, just like most of the folks here have said: \"very poor script\". \nAnd it's such a shame really because I felt there IS potential to bring out that hidden awesomeness in it---I wondered why the advertising for this movie was not that happening.

Like the most laughable line was was the \" Flowers are the best gossipers of the universe line\" which is just as laughable as the first films \" These are glowworms they feed on laughter\" line. The costumes the characters wore in the middle movie were terrible to the point of even looking laughable. They pretty much butchered the characters as they were bland, and weren't anything at all like they were in the book period. They completely got rid of several important plot points like the ixchel part which was important in the book, and the whole movie felt rushed also with some plot points not even making sense to me either.About the only thing I can say that I sorta liked about the movie as I kinda liked what they did with IT, but that's about it; speaking of which they didn't even beat IT either in movie did they? Like they just sorta left it, and to me that's a plot hole as that basically means it's still a threat to earth as they didn't mentioned it died or anything either.Honestly all in all I feel like I wasted money watching this movie, and felt like I should've listened to the reviews on this site instead of seeing it; I don't even consider this movie even good enough to get at a bargain bin because it was so bad.So In a way I kinda recommend the older movie more, but not much as even that movie wasn't that good; however it's still better than this movie by a lot honestly.",

I had heard it was inaccurate to the book and the story was all over the place. But, in the end, I was baffled as to why people hated it.Those that are complaining about the story need to remember that this story IS based off of a book, and it's actually pretty accurate with the exception of some of the scenes in Camazots and the character descriptions such as the medium and the it.The movie had very decent actors, and some of the child actors deserved oscars. For example, Charles-Wallas was probably the best kid actor in the movie and it's more impressive that he's the youngest. He could nail fake-crying and wasn't awkward or quiet.My one problem that costs this movie one star is Calvin. Holy crap did that kid make me want to pull my hair out. I know kids his age who are better actors and probably couldve made it into this movie. I know that he's a character in the book, but he didn't have to be added into the movie, nothing would've changed except the love subplot with Meg would've gone away. The lines that he was given were agonizingly awkward and the way he delivered them was just nails on a chalkboard.My favorite of these lines include:\n\"You have no idea how incredible you are\"\"I like your hair...\"\"I don't know... I just felt... that I had to be here.\"Despite that, watch this movie and form your own opinion. I was pleasantly surprised when I did.",

However, parental guidance may be needed in the final climax of the film. It does get quite creepy and a little sinister. For some older crowds, it will be a snooze-fest And for some, an OK film worth seeing once. Younger kids will like it. Teens will hate it. The film does get weird at times and it seems unsure of itself. Some parts are Life-time channel sap. Others, borderline Burton. Some scenes cringe-worthy. Others pretty cool. If Christopher Nolan had made this film, it would probably have be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece. So, right in the middle. 5 out of 10.",

She said she knew it was going to be bad- and that it was. If Madeline were with us today, I'd be willing to bet she'd really dislike this terrible new version of her fantasy. There are a number of reasons for the truly awful viewing experience this film turns out to be, prime among them the fatal miscasting of almost every character in the book. This is especially true of Charles Wallace and Meg, the main protagonists of the story. Important scenes from the book have been omitted and the film's leaden pacing all but obliterates the suspense that made the novel so memorable. What really sinks A Wrinkle in Time is the fact that the book's sense of wonder, it's raison d'etre, if you will, is missing. Instead, we're subjected to overblown special effects sequences, stunt casting and bad acting. The irony is that the 2003 film that Madeline disliked comes closer to the heart of her story than this stinker.",

One of the some of little problems from the movie was the acting and character development. Although you get development, you don't really care about the characters until later in the movie. The spirits didn't really explain themselves until the middle of the movie. Calvin doesn't get explained a whole lot. And the explanation of how and why Charles Wallas came in contact with Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which is never really explained. Now as far as acting goes, Oprah Winfrey (Mrs. Which) Reese Witherspoon (Mrs. Whatsit) and Mindy Kaling (Mrs. Who) did fantastic. Storm Reid (Meg), Deric McCabe (Charles Wallas), and Chris Pine (Mr. Murray) also did a great job. Levi Miller (Calvin) also did good but didn't express emotion into his character. Overall the acting was great.All in all, this was a good adaptation of a wonderful book. They already made an adaptation prior to this one in 2003. 7/10 Good Movie :)",

            "content": "Going into the theater I was with my seventh grade sister and my boyfriend. We were just finding a way to pass the time by going to the movies and to just hang out because what else do you really do on a Sunday night in the winter. I'm not very critical of movies or actors, I like most films I see even if they are a bit cheesy/cringe worthy and I never really knew what \"bad acting\" looked like, so walking into this I was expecting a mediocre film. I heard good things about the book that was published in 1962, lots of people said it was a classic that everyone adored. The casting also raised the stakes a bit considering Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and, one of my favorite actors, Zach Galifianakis were in it. They were also the face of all of the commercials shown for this science fiction film. The first fifteen minutes I was thinking to myself, \"This isn't very good so far, but I'm going to give it some time, I'm sure it will get better!\" Boy was I wrong. The acting and plot may have been some of the worst I have ever seen. Let me take this apart step by step. \n Let's start with the plot. I haven't read the book, but I read a brief synopsis before we went in so that I could have a better understanding. To summarize it, the main character Meg (Storm Reid) and her younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) have been left alone with their mother after their scientist father has disappeared for five years. Their father had thought up of a concept called a tesseract. A tesseract is the fifth dimension that can shorten the distances across both time and space therefore, forming a \"wrinkle in time\", hence the name of the movie. The kids, especially Meg, have been dealing with the absence of their father very poorly, affecting their social life and school work. Out of nowhere, (literally with no reason) Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon) shows up and starts talking nonsense about their father and his study. After this incident, the kids get involved with two other mysterious astral travelers (Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling). Now this is where it gets messy; the director did a bad job explaining on what was happening and why. One minute the kids and the travelers would be on another planet, and the next they would encounter an \"evil force\". To sum it up, the whole movie was these kids looking for their father with these mysterious travelers and !!SPOILER ALERT!! They find him and they all live happily ever after. The transitions between each part of the movie was unclear and confusing. The director did NOT do a good job.\n Now, I don't know much about acting and I haven't really noticed bad acting before but this movie was the definition of bad acting. The main character, Meg, was honestly terrible. I just remember this one line that she said and it made me cringe so much. Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling weren't bad at acting but it just seemed like they didn't fit in with this type of movie. I view them as serious actors but this movie is like a joke in my eyes. The script was just not good, at all. The actors would say obvious things that just made you go \"Really? Are you really that dumb?\" I do give the movie some credit for having good actors to star in it to attract attention but that does not mean it was a good movie. \n The one good thing that I will say about this awful movie is that the special effects were pretty cool. It was interesting and was probably the only thing that kept my attention throughout the movie. The whole concept of this movie was good and it has potential, but the way it was approached was just really terrible. I think after all the reviews this movie has gotten, the producers would do many things differently. So, to sum everything up, this is my least favorite movie I have ever seen and I was VERY disappointed. Definitely a WASTE of time. The only reason why I would tell someone to watch this film is for me to discuss the things that were so bad about it with that person. I wish I could wrinkle that time when I was in the theater.",

It's not a bad movie It's just Oprah was too much - too much distracting make-up, too heavy of a custom, just too much. If they were supposedly made of light and guiding and searching for young warriors, Oprah was too heavy and grounded to be light and it left an imbalance between the three. The young actors, Chris, Gugu, Mindy, & Reese did their jobs and were immersed in their characters. Maybe it was me every time Oprah spoke it was just Oprah not her character.

The film relates to the world as one filled with heart, passion, love, beauty, majesty, and angst. It was intense, dramatic, and filled with compassion to an extent in which I've never seen in a film. It was beautifully directed, and the actors more than outdid themselves, they were in fact phenomenal and I'm in fact shocked by the reviews that I've seen posted on here. Let me be the first to tell you that they are dead wrong. I don't take films or their artistry lightly, and by no means are the people downing this film correct in any way. This was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my 25 years on this planet. It had me in tears, laughing out loud, angry, anxious, and full of love to the point where it touched my heart to its very core. I believe that everyone who is interested in a well done and an artistically beautiful film needs to see this one. It will stay with me for the rest of my life, and I would see it 1000 times over, just for the sheer joy it brought to me and my loved ones. It is more than worth it, and you'll walk away from it feeling better than when you'd walked in. Prepare yourself for an amazing ride, and enjoy!",

This movie, however, is so poorly made that had I purchased a ticket to see it in a theater, I would have sued for a refund and pain and suffering. First, the makers of the movie have completely changed the characters, all in an attempt to rid the movie world of those pesky Caucasians who have done so much evil in the world. It wasn't enough that a character named Margaret Murry, a red haired Irish girl is being played by a person who I assume is an islander, or perhaps half black, half white, but they had to change almost every character from the way they were described in the book, to something that satisfied the PC police, but ruined the movie. Then, the acting was horrific, the plot was off by a mile and the FX were something a kid could create on a PC. Anyone who says I am a racist for objecting to the multiculturalism in this movie is brain ded, it has nothing to do with the race of the actors, and everything to do with the book and with the fact that Hollywood is reinventing every movie and story, to punish Caucasians for our existence.

            "content": "\"A Wrinkle in Time\" is a baffling movie experience. It's an ambitious adaptation, and I'll give them credit for trying, but they come nowhere close to pulling it off. The story is a complete mess. There's no rhyme or reason to the events that happen, the places they visit, and the people and things they encounter. I'm sure in the book these things were all developed and explained thoroughly but in the movie it all just comes off as random and nonsensical. One moment they're on some planet riding a space wizard, the next moment they go to another planet to visit another space wizard, then suddenly they are in another place facing an inexplicable hazard that of course they magically overcome, then they're at a beach running into a red-eyed Michael Pena, etc. It's science-fiction/fantasy at its worst, where the story is completely incoherent and all the explanations for what's happening is just 'magic' or 'love' or 'because'.The dialogue is also so artificial, that's just not how people talk to each other, at least not in the modern day setting it's supposed to be set in. And 'Charles Wallace' is an incredibly dumb and annoying name. I find it very hard to believe that at least the sister wouldn't have found a shortened nickname to use. That may sound like a minor nitpick, but considering they say/shout the name about a hundred times during the movie, it just becomes grating to the ears.It's a shame, because there's so much talent involved in the making of this movie. The cast is top notch, although many of the actors are wasted on dumb characters, and even all the younger actors do a very good job, particularly the young girl. It has a talented up-and-coming director. Visually it looks pretty great most of the time and it does some really cool and unique things with the visuals, but visuals alone can't save a movie if they serve no purpose to the story. The one area of the movie I do consistently really like is the score, particularly in those moments that are meant to avoke wonder. It's nothing too revolutionairy, just very well-executed, and I was not surprised to learn from the credits that the composer is the excellent Ramin Djawadi of Game of Thrones and Westworld fame.Overall, this adaptation was a sorry misfire that was unfortunately doomed to fail from the start. Complex science fiction and fantasy stories that deal with complicated matters such as different dimensions and time travelling/bending (of which there is a severe lack in a movie that has the concept of 'time' in its title by the way), simple cannot be accurately translated into a 100 minute movie, mainly aimed at children. It usually either becomes an exposition dump of dry information, or they simply don't bother to properly explain the concepts at all, both of which result in poor story-telling. Maybe in the future, these novels get the elongated television series treatment they deserve, similar to how the upcoming His Dark Materials (2019) tv series will hopefully clear the stain of the horrible 'The Golden Compass' (2007) movie adaptation.",

It didn't have any sense from time to time. And also those kids, exept Charles Wallace were dumb. Like for real dumb. The girl got so many leads on what to do and she wasn't able to figure that out. She went to another world and didn't wanted to start belive that she can do stuff. Her brother who had funny name was the one who understand the world and how it works. But still. SHE DIDN'T GO WITH THE FLOW ! And also i didn't find the reason for the Pan guy ( Calvin ) to be in the movie. He looked like he was high all the time.\nCasting:\nStorm Reid - Meg ( pretty decent job )\nOprah - I know that she has a nice voice and it really suits her character but damn, she had some really bad delivery.\nReese - I don't like this actress so i don't want to talk about her performance\nMindy - Why on earth did they casted her ? It didn't felted like all of these three actresses ( Oprah , Reese and MIndy ) were suitable for these characters. And also i'm againts about changing the race of the characters.\nLevi Miller - Calvin : he tried ( bad script can make you look bad )\nDeric - Charles : good job kid !\nChris Pine : He did the best he can.\nGugu Mbatha-Raw - She was good too.\nOkay. So now the reason why i gave this movie 4 stars. I liked the music and the amazing world it showed to me. But I wanted to see more of that first planet. Or planets like that. And from the dark side perspective it was cool again. The IT reminded me of the upside-down from stranger things. But also felted really bad for the makeup. It was just terrible.

Along the way, they come across a slew of creative characters and eye pleasing visuals. And that's about all the film has to offer. A Wrinkle in Time is not only overly whimsical, but also contains moments that are so awful they're almost laughably bad. One of these scenes involves a gigantic Oprah Whinfrey who plays Mrs.Which, gazing down like a diety at the main characters as they whimsically run through an enchanting island, even though their father's life is on the line. The rest of the film is a series of forcefully enchanting moments that don't exactly propel the story. Sometimes the filmmakers even throw in some modern pop music! It only gets cheesier from there. The film's only saving grace lies in the relationship between Chris Pine and Storm Reid. Both of these actors do a good job conveying a father-daughter relationship through acting alone. Keep in mind I said \"acting\" alone. Toward the end of the film, one of these characters does something very unforgivable that isn't addressed for the remaining of the film. In terms of dramatics storytelling, this ruins the once believable relationship. Aside from some nice visuals, which honestly could have been better considering the film was made under Disney, A Wrinkle in Time is a forgettable and overblown fantasy that is worth skipping over.",

We are all light beings and yes once we see our beauty, the true self, we can break any form of darkness upon us. Darkness can only survive through energy and when we give into it then yes we give darkness power. But in order to weaken darkness we have to ignite our lights through removing the layers of the program that has been placed on us through societal ways.

Charles Wallace was not as developed as I would have liked, but knowing the story, that was OK. (One of those missing scenes where Meg confronts her father and all the ways they try to break CW away from the IT should have been in there...)I will admit that would actually give the movie a 7 or so, but I rated it higher because I fear that MANY of the reviews are racially motivated and thereby bringing the overall score down.

It's like the book as well. One of the reasons this film is so great is it shows young girls that love can be a powerful thing. Storm Reid (who plays Meg) does a fantastic job, giving us a character who is relatable and admirable. Deric McCabe (Charles Wallace) also does a fantastic job. The casting in this film is phenomenal, giving us a fantastic cast and each actor delivers a wonderful performance. I honestly think this film did a great job of adapting the source material.

            "content": "When I heard that Ava Duvernay was making an adaptation of one of my favorite books, I was excited; finally, a great filmmaker can do justice to the story after the TV-movie fiasco. Unfortunately, the studios must have tampered with the adaptation as it isn't a movie directed by a talented director; instead, it is more of a nauseous CGI-induced trainwreck being conducted by unusually drunk circus animals.Before I get my numerous gripes with movie out of my system, I'll at least commend it for casting a black girl as Meg Murry. It was a very brave decision, especially considering that it was a major blockbuster coming from the image-obsessed corporate known as Disney.I also want to state upfront that race has nothing to do with me not liking the film. I'm whiter than snow and thus don't get racist crap thrown at me with the same intensity/frequency that some of my fellow citizens sadly do. I accept that everyone is different, but I judge people based on their character, not their physical differences.\nThis comes from my unique upbringing - I'm autistic and suffer from OCD. I'm extremely sympathetic towards people. I grew up in a multicultural diverse church - Bridgeway Community Church, if you're curious; my father has traveled all over the world and taught me to love all kinds of people for their differences. I'm a social advocate who believes in the Black Lives Matters movement as a stepping stone for much-needed racial conciliation. There's not a racist fragment in my being. I also don't have a vendetta against the director. On the contrary, Ava DuVernay is a great person who has made great contributions to the art of cinema, especially with her wonderful documentary 13th. Rather, I'm just stunned that her latest movie was poorly made studio-processed garbage.The movie's basic composition/mise-en-scene was shockingly most unprofessional; its ugly color schemes made the Transformers movies, aka decomposing roadkill, look attractive by comparison. All the acting performances were horrific, especially with the child actors being the most guilty of making wood look more human. The music comprised of soullessly generic pop hits that it arrived deader than a doornail.Worse of all, the script reeked of corporate pandering. First of all, it censored the book's inherent liberal Christian ideology to the point that it became a name-in-only adaptation. Second, it became a boringly bad-at-motivational cliche fest that not even an innocent child would willingly accept. Third, it got rid of what made the book special, which was making kids think for themselves. Gone with the cool scientific concepts, in with cringeworthy CGI and overblown nonsense that insults basic intelligence.The more I write about this disaster, the more I feel sorry for Ms. DuVernay. She clearly has talent, yet her vision conflicted with the studio's financial priorities; hence, we end up with this cinematic travesty. Worse of all, this movie doesn't work with its prime audience as we don't find the characters relatable like how we do with Madeline L'Engle's timeless book.I watched the movie with my older sister and her two kids- both of whom are in preschool. When the movie ended, my sister was gobsmacked at how awful it was. Her children played with their toys once the movie lost their attention yet they stayed within distance of the dreadful thing. Wanting to know what her children thought of the film, she asked her youngest child if the movie was any good. Barely looking up from his toys, he shook his head and replied with one new vocabulary word: \"No\".",

            "review_title": "Not great, but also not as terrible as they'd let you think",
            "content": "So let's get the good stuff out there: the visuals are pretty great. I loved the costumes of the Mrses, Nobody, and I dug Zach Galifianakis as Happy Balance. I liked the diversity of the cast, as it didn't seem to make much a difference either way, which is refreshing. I thought much of the cinematography was well done and quite beautiful. Now for the faults: like most people who have seen this film, the plot is severely lacking. I understand that they're going to find Meg's father, but that is clearly the McGuffin here. Though it's role as the McGuffin is largely undercut by the fact that Meg's father's disappearance is supposed to be the foundation for her despair; so the fact that her search for her father doesn't really matter much means that when they do find him, I don't particularly care. I mean, sure, the reunion itself is emotional, but as far as what it means for Meg as a whole person, it doesn't seem to matter at the bottom line. And I think that's a lot of the problem with this movie-much of the emotion is forced and hollow, with the film telling you how you should feel rather than allowing you to feel it. For example, Calvin just suddenly appears on the street with Meg and Charles Wallace and just stares at Meg and compliments her hair. It's incredibly awkward. I also don't understand why Meg is so important. It's made clear that she's smart, like her parents, but not an oddball savant like Charles Wallace. Yet the Mrses (Mrs. Which, specifically) is convinced that only Meg can save the universe from the Darkness. But why? And besides, if the Darkness is pure evil, why is it not a more powerful force? Why is there no dark, tentacle cloud over Earth? Why does it just manifest as jealousy or abuse in humans? I'm sure this is probably explained in the book, but to be frank, I don't remember much about the book when my fifth grade class read it. There are a lot of questions about the universe that are glossed over or brushed aside and it weakens the movie as a whole. So aside from convoluted story and plot (which I can put squarely on the shoulders of the screenwriters) the pacing also feels off. We spent a good 15 minutes of run time on a flower planet, that while quite pretty, doesn't lead us to much, other than Mrs. Whatsit deciding they need to see a Seer (Happy Balance) to find their father. Why not do this in the first place? They waisted 15 minutes of the movie on a flight sequence that had very little to do with the plot or story at the end of the day. And it's instances like this that make the 1hr, 49min run time feel heavily bloated. I sat through Wall-E (slightly over 2hrs) and the time flew by. By the time Meg finally has her Boss Battle with IT, I was ready to head out. They spend the first 45mins of the movie setting up the characters, but none of it feels particularly necessary. If Act I had been shortened into 20 minutes, it would have left more time for them to explore more of the Universe on the way to finding Meg and Charles Wallace's father. Or they could have just cut it down by 20mins and have been fine. I have to say, people are railing on this movie, and it's really NOT that bad. It's pretty heavy subject matter for kids (some pretty heady ideas being tossed around) but if you think your kid will sit through it, then I think it's worth a watch. I wouldn't spend $15 on it, but $5-$8 sure. I also have to say, hating on the acting is a bit unfair. For the Mrses, Nobody, and Happy Balance, they are beings who are choosing human forms so that the kids can relate to them. They can be whatever they want to be. To expect them to be emotionally human as well is unfair, thus I believe that the irritation one might feel with the acting stems from that. I'm of the opinion that it was a directorial choice and should be noted as such. In conclusion: an OK movie. Not great, but not the worst movie I've ever seen.",

Plus, it's directed by a badass black female director, stars a mixed race teenage girl, an adopted kid, a biracial couple, and an eye candy teen boy who plays the useless tagalong that girls usually have to play in movies. Oprah basically plays herself, Reese Witherspoon also pretty much plays herself, and Mindy Kaling kind of plays a kindly stoned human Wikipedia that only speaks in quotes. But probably the best performance from this movie is Chris Pine. Sir, we do not deserve you. I think it's also important to remember that this book was freaking weird. So the movie is weird. And I think Ava did a great job translating it to screen. It's definitely a kids movie and has a simple message and a fairly paint by numbers plot line. But you'll probably have a good time and it will probably make you feel nice. So yeah, I recommend it.

Mindy Kaling did so much amazing background acting, just with her face, and Oprah... well, who couldn't use a pep talk from Oprah on why you should love yourself? Love is the message, and you aren't beaten over the head with it. Love for yourself, love for your family, be a positive force in the universe because darkness is everywhere.You can choose to do and be better.

Not only were they so far off Madeline L'Engle's book that it bore very little resemblance to her phenomenal story, but the acting was atrocious, the dialogue sounded completely scripted, and the characters were all wrong and entirely unbelievable. I felt like I was watching a low-budget made-for-TV movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is the special effects, but what are effects without a believable story?? Don't waste your time!! This movie is a disgrace to Walt Disney's name, and he'd probably roll over in his grave if he knew such a piece of garbage was created under his umbrella.",

The movie deserves some good stuff not bad. I understand that yall don't understand the film. But give it a watch and yalls opinions may change. But if you dont like it still, then this film may not be for you. No need to ruin the movie for everybody else by spilling out your harsh opinions about the film. Anyways here's my opinions:\nThe story of course i admit is a little weak but its a great story. And it gets better as the film progresses.The music is amazing that it matches with the film very well.The casts could do a little better work on their lines but they seem to do a good job.The tesseracting is very satisfying or terrifying depend on age of the child or adult that watches it.The other planets scenes are either beautiful or terrifying but has a great view for fans to watch.",

The multicultural casting was a welcome change and was the only remnant of the original's spirit. When I was a hearing-impaired fat misfit 4th grader, the book made me feel that it was OK to be different, and that bullies and adults in authority were not always right. Camazotz is a totalitarian planet. Maybe the Cold War has gone away, but the threat of being enslaved by evil because of passivity and conformity has not. The kids in the book walk face IT together (they are not thrown in by a special effect dirt cyclone) and it's an astoundingly brave thing to do--but it's preceded by another brave act: the little boy who dares to bounce his ball out of rhythm, and who they later see being tortured into compliance. Meg goes up against these forces and wins, not because \"Love is the key to everything\" but because she stubbornly refuses to believe the poison spewed by IT. She refuses to submit to the idea that she is unlovable. Mrs. Whatsit says \"You have something that IT does not.\" She discovers that she has love. Sigh. Maybe someday they'll get this story filmed right. In the meantime, if you have a kid, do them a favor: buy them the book.",

We both agree that halfway into watching the movie, we stopped to read the reviews. The reviews were very entertaining.From my daughter: Goodness gracious, what an abomination this is!! I never want to see this monstrosity again. The only thing I have to say that's actually entertaining is the part where Mrs. Whatsit transforms and into a flying lettuce, which by the way doesn't even happen in the book.\nWe had more fun reading the reviews than actually watching the movie. I feel like I'd rather watch Sharknado 3000 times than watch this once again, even though I'm too young to watch Sharknado.

I absolutely adore all of the actors in this film - unfortunately most of their appearances were a major letdown to what could have been.

Kinda. Actually, they don't really help much at all. And for some reason they're joined by a boy from school that she doesn't seem to know very well. He does nothing. Mostly stand around watching her do stuff.After the movie ended I had SO many questions. Where did they go? Another planet? Another Universe? Another time? How did they get there? Something to do with frequencies apparently. Where did the women come from? The same universe her father was in? Apparently the women somehow help people, I guess. Kinda. Why did the women wait so long to help her?There's lots of visual candy and little kids will probably like that. But there's lots of nothing as well. Also lots of vague warnings and such and confusing things that are never explained and nobody seems to care. They say things like \"where are we?\" \"Were on such and such. \"OK\". No, it's not OK. Where is that? Is it a planet? Is it in our galaxy? Universe? We'll never know.The performances are pretty bland. Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon seem to be going a bit overboard to make up for everyone else just standing around talking.It was hard to really care about these characters. The movie wanted you to care about them without really giving you a reason to.I haven't read the books, so hopefully they explain things better than this movie did and if you've read them it makes more sense.Oh. And one last thing. I'm sick and tired of people making up definitions of what a tesseract is. No, a tesseract is not whatever they said it was in this movie.",

But most kids - of any age - are going to be bored out of their minds, and their parents are not likely to be any more engaged.One or two good lines (Zach Galifianakis's \"Thank you. Earth tones\" in reply to a compliment on his outfit comes to mind); the three leading ladies (\"The Misses\") all can be good, but not with these bad parts; the diversity of the cast was unusual, and commendable, and I liked it; the leading kids were all decent actors and nice to look at without being obviously just \"eye candy\".

If you are looking for a story about a hero that takes on not only outer darkness but her inner darkness as well to find whether or not she is a hero, you will enjoy this film. It may not be an academy winner but for what it is, it is inspiring and heart-warming.My one complaint has to do with music choices which I feel will date this film which is a shame because the story is a classic.

It contains fascinating ideas and imagery.\nThis 2018 version of the movie is a contrived propaganda-laden movie, very loosely based on the novel (almost not anything like the novel at all). The cast was carefully selected to be multiracial to the point of ridiculousness. The only two white women in the movie are also the only two mean women... hmmmm... what are we trying to say here? \nI like both Meg's, but the 2018 Meg looks nothing like either of her casted parents - even though I think she is completely adorable. Other than Meg's adorability, the movie seems poorly directed. The costumes are outlandishly distracting, to the point where I spent most of the movie wondering why Oprah Winfrey was covered in so much glitter and so many gems to the point that she looked like a sparkly amazon warrior. Later, I discovered that her make up artist was trying to go for a \"wispy\" look - complete fail.I recommend you avoid this monstrosity of a movie altogether (unless you just can't stand to not stare at a bad accident), and instead - if you really want to immerse yourself in the movie version of \"A Wrinkle in Time,\" watch the original 2003 version of the movie (I found it on amazon).",

This film proves the power of diversity these days: multi-racial cast; female author and female director.

This film has none of these.It's all way too CGI and the costumes are OTT.Last but not least, the name 'Charles Wallace' is said so many times, a drinking game based upon its utterance could claim thousands of lives alongside the theft of thousands of hours.Save yourself.

The reason I give it a lukewarm 5/10 is because of a key failure in the story.\nThe key message of the film is taken direct from the book: the power of love and family. It's a message everyone can agree on. But the story inexplicably fails to honor the theme in ways that lost the plot for me.\nOne of the key instructions for the children from the Weird Sisters was to stay together. The kids are on their own in the realm of evil and it's good advice, but the first thing that happens is they split up. Not only do Meg and Calvin lose young Charles Wallace, they don't even seem to notice he's gone. When he suddenly reappears with no explanation they don't even seem surprised.\nIt's a poorly constructed scene that broke the spell, but it wasn't unique. The people that they love suddenly disappear and no one seems to notice. They suddenly reappear and everyone just blithely trudges onward. It really undermines the story and the message.\nThat said, there is still plenty to enjoy. Read the book to get a measure of how much better it could have been.",

And you can stop reading my review and switch to another review, so that I wouldn't be wasting ur time.But if you are on an Awakening path, this one is for you. This movie is like a manual / a tutorial about our universe n energy and everything in life for generations to come and that's why I like it. I am a Lightworker and so are many. I don't usually see Disney movies but this Wrinkle in Time caught my eye when I heard Oprah's talk about Manifestations on an interview session of this movie. The interviewer in that session herself mentioned that this movie has awakening messages all over. Plus Oprah herself is wide Awake. So I wanted to see it.This movie has all you need to know about healing your wounds by facing them to see the light beyond fear and darkness (that are mere illusions to keep u in the dark). It also hints on the concept of oneness which is true and beautifully scripted. I liked this movie, a lot! It resonated with my awakened being to a T. It's literally the tutorial for life for the young ones and generations to come. This is an Awakening movie. And just keep your eyes on the lookout: this movie is soon going to see its daylight in the coming years as this mass awakening on earth is already happening and at a rapid pace. People are seeing the world with their third eye and getting out of the Matrix fast. This is The Movie for our current young ones and our future generations.Thanks Oprah, Reese, Mandy and Chris for being a part of it. This movie explains the Awakening process to the young ones beautifully.",

The movie did not disappoint. While many have complained that it is different than the book - of course it is! But it doesn't matter. It was still incredible for so many reasons.First, the cinematography was stunning. Absolutely breathtaking. The costumes, the colors, the scenery...it was all perfect.Second, it was so incredible to take my son to a movie with such a diverse cast. I admired seeing such strong female characters of different backgrounds in one movie.Third, the messages in this movie struck such a personal tone. Watching, I felt like I was ripped apart and put back together by the wise words of Mrs. Who, Mrs .Which, and Mrs. Whatsit. We've all felt those dark times in our lives and this movie really made me think about who we are in the universe.Ava Duvernay did a wonderful job. I plan on watching this over and over again, especially on those days that are touched by IT.",

Of coarse, I love the imagination shown in the wardrobe and set design. The story was easy to follow on a young adult level. The messages/life revelations were all positive.\nParents need to look at the movie trailers more to realize that just because Disney was part of the movie's production companies, this is not a story for children, oh say under 8 or so. It will not hold their attention, of course this is strictly my opinion.",

The special effects, locations and sets are gorgeous, the acting, while not seamless, is done very well by the kids in the film. But what sets it apart is why you should go and see it, like, NOW: it's based on a novel about girls' empowerment written over 50 years ago, it's directed by the first (yes! first!) African-American woman to direct a major-motion picture in Hollywood, there's a mixed-race family, a strong, scientist Mom, and a strong and smart girl hero. From what I can see, many of the reviews here (and on IMDB, etc.) seem to be thinly veiled and coded warnings to viewers about precisely those issues...many of the negative reviews are from the same people who gave all of the Harry Potter movies 10 stars, despite those movies' serious flaws. All the more reason to get your family down to the theater. Go see what real women do...and what real girls can do when they grow up. (Hint: they can save the world!)",

It is imagination inspiring. \nThe cast of characters have excellent actors behind them. The cinematography is fabulous. The wardrobe is beautiful. The idea behind this is thought provoking. The end gets a little much for a child under the age of 6-7. That's why I say it best suited for that age and up. Will you be disappointed if you expect it go rigidly by the book? Absolutely. \nBe open-minded. \nI think the negative reviews are the alt-right who spammed this to try to hit Oprah and this movie because it is pushing hard. \nSee past this. See this movie.

Second major issue was the acting, the worst had to be Oprah. I felt like I was watching a Christmas Pantomime in some nondescript English town at Christmas. Third, the story telling was terrible, considering this was Disney I am flabbergasted they let it go to production. Lastly, the end scenes where pretty dark, how did these make it in to this film?!

Storm Reid is great as Meg, Reese, Mindy and Orpah as great as the Misses too.

It's one of those films you are just waiting...and waiting..and waiting for the story line to take off and suddenly you realize you are 1/2 half way through the film and this is it...as good as it's going to get. For me the biggest disappoint was the special effects. Being a Disney film (budget) I expected \"Avatar\" like special effects and except for one flying scene the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed in someone's living room with cheesy backgrounds. I think this is why people think the acting is bad, it's not, it's cheesy at times because of the script and the movie is not very believable because it looks so cheaply put together.

It's not a blockbuster, but the acting is OK. The script and the roles are good also. It is not a masterpiece, not an Oscar winning, but it is worth watching it, especially by those who are really interested in these subjects, in quantum physics and time travelling and all.I never read the said book that this movie was made from, which it entitles me to write this review with a fresh eye, I should say. But one thing I have to say regarding this is that a movie made from a book doesn't have to be totally loyal to that book, but should invite you to read the book. They are alike, but also different, but that point is that it helps the book come out even more.When it comes to this movie, each scene takes you really quick from one place to another, from one aspect of the subject matter to the other and the action is pretty fast, I should say. One needs to pay close attention to what is happening, otherwise would miss the whole point.Overall, I give it a ten because of the subject and the symbolically artistical way in which is portrayed in this movie. And I also want to balance the other bad ratings it has received so far, to make it a bit more worth watching.So, be careful! This movie is not for everyone, but for those who are really into searching about this matter.",

So many moments throughout the movie were clearly THIS IS OPRAH BEING OPRAH moments (or insert whoever else's name instead of Oprah). The entirety of Zach Galafianakis' role was the aforementioned strategy, with a little feeling thrown in so he can get better roles later. Basically, the character development was non-existent so we are left with a lot of actors being actors.The storyline itself was a strange combination of mind numbingly slow and lightening quick. It was a far cry from the book (I'm not a book purist by any means but if you're going to veer, do it well). The screenwriters even seemed to go so far as to write in completely foreign scenes that did nothing to further the story. They exerted a lot of effort to come up with random mediocre scenes. I gave the movie 3 stars, solely because I applaud their ability create a diverse cast and challenge my personal preconceived idea of who the characters were.

But hating on this movie simply because it changed some details misses the bigger picture and fails to acknowledge the importance of the spirit of the book over strict adherence to the plot.First of all, the focus of the movie shifts from the relationship between Meg and Charles Wallace to Meg's journey of self discovery. I think this was a great shift, because I believe the book paints a very dated picture of what sibling relationships are like. I think the movie successfully communicates how deeply Charles Wallace and Meg care for each other while simultaneously showing Meg building self esteem and discovering who she is, and finding worth in that identity. Storm Reid was PHENOMENAL.Next, the ending. Oh god how grateful I am that they changed the ending. I was SO disappointed by that BS \"power of love\" and then it's over ending in the book! In the film, it felt more genuine and immediate-it felt like a fight for their lives. Yes, Meg does still save Charles Wallace with her love, but it's not that easy. It's intertwined with a discovery of love for herself as well as fighting for Charles Wallace.All I have to say about the Mrses is that they where phenomenal, and keep an ear out for a Hamilton reference at the end! Okay, and yes, they changed a lot. They took out the Aunt Beast scene. But was it that important of a scene? Personally I found Meg intolerable at this part of the book, and all they did on that planet was regroup and send Meg to get Charles Wallace. They folded the rescue of Charles Wallace into Meg refusing to tesser without him, and even set up the power of her will earlier in the movie. They also changed the nature of Camazot. Instead of a machine-like city with quotas and statistics and the highest rate of simultaneous actions, it was more a changing planet designed to trap them. At first I balked at this change, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the industrial setting from the book didn't really fit the atmosphere of this movie. Now, I'm not saying this movie was perfect. My biggest complaint was how they downplayed Charles Wallace's intelligence. He never even tried to fight the man with red eyes. He just immediately succumbed. I don't think they did a good job of communicating how special and gifted Charles Wallace is, and I get that they did that for Meg's character, but I wish they hadn't done it SO much.There's more I could say, but these are the main points I wanted to make. Please go into this movie with an open mind and heart. Please remember that this book was published in 1962 and it NEEDED updating for modern audiences. Please give it a fair chance!",

I thought it was lovely. The first half hour won me over and had me in tears. Like the Lord of the Rings, another favorite, the movie-makers decided to take out some things and add some new things. It's difficult to make a movie out of beautiful writing alone (such as any movie based on a Jane Austen novel - the more successful ones add more suspense and intrigue). And so, more action scenes were added (there are no real action scenes in the book). I'm no judge of acting. I just know what I like. I did miss Aunt Beast - I thought that section was important to the story because it made clear that Mr. Murray did not desert Charles Wallace, and it explained why it had to be Meg who needed to save him. I missed the earth-like feeling of Camizotz too, because it is a part that always gives me a strange surreal feeling when I read it - this is one of the places where they decided to add more special effects and action. I can't argue with that, and I thought \"It\" was done in a very interesting way. I loved the paper analogy to love folded over and hidden, and how it was carried through the story though it wasn't in the book - this is an interpretation, a useful device, that made it clear that love was the power that fought the darkness, and was the power that Meg had.",

This isn't my favorite movie, but it is pretty close.\nThe costumes were super good, and I loveeeeeed the various hairstyles. It was nice to see a family with curly hair (majority of black and biracial people have curly hair), because straight hair has been the norm until now. It was nice to see actors being able to show a bit of themselves in their characters.\nIt was also cool to see how far we have come with animations.",

It's considered a YA book, but I've read it numerous times over the years and still love it and its message. Those ideas and images certainly would be very difficult to capture in a film and this one, as many others have said, is a real misfire. Storm Reid seemed to be sleepwalking; the same with most of the other actors. While the book was published in 1962 and contained that time's sensibility, it is erudite and also charming. The updated, PC flavor/characters in this depiction was sometimes laughable and even embarrassing. And that black thing is just \"IT,\" not \"The IT.\"",

I had heard from my friends that it was bad, and I thought it wasn't going to be worth my time (hence the 3/10 imdb rating). And oh man - I was right!The film starts out - - - wait - I can't even remember. I'm not joking - I literally cannot remember how this movie started!There were some things about this movie that I did actually enjoy. Being a cinematographer myself, I try to look out for films that go above and beyond, and are creative in this field. And this film didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed most of the shots. I thought they expressed a good visual metaphor, that looked good on screen.I also liked the costumes and makeup. I know there probably won't be any oscar buzz around these categories, but I thought they were very well done, and got the message across.Now, lets get into the---other things about this movie. Although in some scenes good, I thought the visual effects in this film were surpassingly mediocre. I mean - It's not 'Justice League' bad, but there were times were the amateur-ness distracted from the story.I also think the acting was also very amateur. Now - I love Opra. She's great. But there was something about this performance which really made me wonder - 'Wait - that's OPRA??!!? Wasn't she a good actor once?' Storm Reid was OK. I think she has a lot of potential - and this movie just wasn't her time to show it. I HATED Calvin. I thought he was a totally unrealistic portrayed teenager that does not and will never exist in the world of teenagers.Now, this review has already gone way to long. But there is one last subject in which I would like to touch on. That's the screenplay. WOW. I had no Idea I screenplay could be this bad. I mean - this is almost 'The Room' bad. I haven't read the book, but my friends who have, have told me that a 30 page-longer section (THE CLIMAX) was entirely left out of the movie. I thought the dialogue in most places was cheesy, awkward - and just flat out WEIRD. NOBODY Meg or Calvin's age would EVER say these lines. I almost feel bad for all these actors. ALL of them have great potential, but they were submerged to a terrible screenplay, and that's why I think 'A Wrinkle In Time' is such a bad movie.",

Children being dragged down dark hallways, screaming and clawing for their lives against the forces/grip of pure evil, robotic stepford wives/children in painful sycronization, immersion in dark underworlds with unrelenting devil voices, agonizing sound effects and endless references to patricide, kidnapping etc, a young child possessed by an evil spirit, speaking hurtful, scathing words.....it not darker and darker. 1/2 way through we couldn't take anymore, but didn't want to leave because we didn't want our kids stuck with the trauma of such sickening, psychologically bent visuals in their head before bed. We decided to wait till the inevitable lightening of the plot, but it just kept descending into darker territory. My kids have seen movie rates well beyond their years (6 and 8 years old). This made the scariest movie look like Mr Roger's. They are resilient, tough cookies, but were screaming all eve in their sleep (never in 6 and 8 years has that happened before). None of us slept a wink. Needless to say, when it became so disturbing that my dad and I could literally take it no longer, we left. Nonrefundable was permitted. 50$ put, an eve wasted, heads full of terror. Wow. They should use this movie for torture tactics. It is beyond the beyond. WORST MOVIE EVER.",

Actors are not that bad, Just badly directed.And now the Cons.\n1. (Excuse #3) The Acting isn't that good. Especially Charles Wallace. He was probably the worst actor in the film.\n2. Too. Many. Plot-holes.\n3. Some of the characters in the beginning are pretty awful, but useless in the next acts.\n4. Dialogue just doesn't stick.\n5. Some Unnecessary Filler either mildly emotional or useless.\nAnd, 6. This movie can only usually appeal to a younger demographic. Instead of a wide variety of viewers.And there you have it. A sort-of brief review about A Wrinkle in Time (2018). Now, Should you watch it? If you liked the book, maybe. If you liked the first movie in 2004, also maybe.

            "content": "I read the book a long time ago as a child, and then again as a teen, then again as an adult, and again as an older adult. It has always stuck with me and is a favorite of mine. It's a feel-good book, with classic elements of Light vs Dark, Good vs Evil, etc. It relates to kids who are feeling bullied or worn down by social problems, awkwardness in the teens, adults who make mistakes, and feels like a very empowering book to young adults who just want to have an adventure, and fight the good fight on their own.The movie also accomplishes that. It takes a group of kids and young adults and sends them across the galaxy on a mission to save Meg's father. It has all of the elements of a grand adventure, with gorgeous scenery, magical moments, and an ominous, dark presence to fight.I think what people are having trouble with, especial die-hard fans of AWIT, is that most of the book is centered around Meg and her internal dialogues. Her POV is very heavily personal-experience driven, and that's very hard to do visually. For instance, Meg doesn't like tesseracting in the books, because her body goes numb, and it feels like her entire body has been asleep. Coming out of the tesseract is the reverse of that process. So...how do you *show* that in a film? You can't. But the image in people's heads who have read book think they have ways to portray that sort of thing, but it's only relevant to themselves. And when they don't see it on the big screen, I think they get a little angsty and disappointed. I was not disappointed, and I understand a lot of the choices they had to make to bring such a book to the screen. Some wishes for the movie:\nThe Aunt Beast sequence I feel would have been very important. It was a game-changer that would have given the audience a moment to see Meg turn herself around. I think the trauma and recovery would have been a good sequence to have. I think Meg's sudden self-empowerment is a bit too sudden.The ending fight in the giant...brain?...of IT felt over too fast. The book does it masterfully with a lot of buildup to Meg's sudden realization of the weapon she has that IT does not. I think skipping that important point damaged the ending, and her screams of \"I love you!\" lost a bit of their edge. And I really loved the line in the book about \"She could stand there, and she could love Charles Wallace.\" I wish they had incorporated that somehow, because it always brings me a smile at that turning point. I don't think they visually gave her that realization and turning point. They just focused on her faults and then love, and then suddenly Charles Wallace was free.Central Central intelligence was tossed in there, but was never really explained as to what it meant. I think either an entire removal of the concept, or an explanation would have been better than just a throwaway line for the fans.Man With the Red Eyes wasn't nearly as menacing enough. Too jolly, not enough bite.More emphasis on the mind-control that was happening with IT. The heart-beating rhythm wasn't emphasized enough.In the prison room, I feel Calvin was underutilized. He was essential to distracting Charles Wallace, so that Meg could use Mrs. Who's glasses to get inside the prison in the book. I wished they had had a better confrontation between Calvin and Charles Wallace, the kind of mental battle I thought would have spiced up that scene a bit more.I gave it 9 stars due to the wishes, but I thought it was a great movie.",

First of all \u00ab IT \u00bb was supposed to have taken over the country camazotz. And what was with the weird storm when they got to camazotz. Their were so many little details missed that were like an afterthought, which is weird because Disney is usually very detailed. The craziest thing about this movie is that Disney forgot the actual point of the book/movie. At camazotz everyone had the same things and did the same things at the same time. The point of the book was to point out that our differences make us better and happier and more interesting people. Overal the movie felt rushed and all over the place as if they were trying to cram as much as they could in within the time frame. Disney could have done so much better \u00ab the original and the remake \u00bb. Third times the charm Disney!PS. Almost worth it to watch just for the costumes!",

            "review_title": "Utterly Unremarkable",
            "content": "One thing that should be noted when making a book into a movie is that it should offer something to fans of the book and also be friendly to someone who hasn't read the book. I have never read the book. Going into the movie, I expect it to tell me what exactly is happening, not assume I know what's up from the book. While watching, I just felt like I was missing huge chunks of information. I knew nothing of what was happening or of the world this story took place in. I assume we are supposed to know as much as the main character, Meg, who seemed to know nothing as well. That said, she was much more... \"accepting\" of what was happening than I was. I don't know what Meg is like in the book, but in this movies, she is just an awfully boring and passive character. She obviously doesn't want to be on the adventure, but she also doesn't resist it. she just lets it happen and shows little reaction to any of it. Even when she is showing emotion, if you can call it that, it's so forced. I don't know if they cast the wrong actress or the script was written poorly, I just know what I see and it sucks. It especially disappointing because they used a black girl. They could have written her so much better, gotten in some meaningful representation. I don't want to relate to Meg. She's a flat character and offers positive qualities to the table.Going back to not knowing anything about the story, I didn't even know what was happening half the time. Who are the weird ladies? Who is Whatsit's boyfriend?? Is this about time travel???? I just didn't know. Not to mention that they presented the strange ladies as important characters that just left the kids on their own??? And why are they named what they are named? Why did Charles Wallace know them? And now to move into the petty problems I have. Starting with names.Charles Wallace. I assume this is more an issue carried over from the book. In which case, I criticize the book as well! I get it, OK? people can have two first names. My mom and some of her siblings have two first names. But no one goes around using both of them. That's such a mouthful, and an earful. I don't want to hear them yelling that kids name over an over and over again, its long and annoying and frankly unnecessary. Just pick one! Or better yet, just give the kid a nickname! And Calvin? He added nothing to the story other than some heterosexual tension. And there shouldn't be ANY sexual tension cause these are kids and also there is no time for that, they are on a mission. Also, I just don't like his name. It's not a bad name. I just don't like it. It doesn't suit him.Secondly, oh, and this is truly my favorite. Ms Who? And her only speaking in quotes? Because she's too smart to think up her own words? First of all, that sounds pretentious. Secondly, it sounds stupid. It doesn't make her seems smart. It makes her seem... what's the word? I don't know but not coming up with an original thought and instead opting to use famous quotes is the most unintelligible thing I have ever heard. I'd have been fine if she did not have the ability to use her own words, sort of an echolalia situation, because that adds something meaningful to the character, maybe someone can relate to that. But that is not the case. She is capable of original thought and chooses not it. And some of the quotes she uses are so cryptic! Its more cryptic than cryptic can even be! But that just might be me being stupid. But if I recall, this is a kids movie. I would hope they could make the quotes easy for kids to follow along to.I think the message of the story is to love yourself and know that you deserve to be loved by others but... I only got that through what Meg said to her brother? The message was barely shown in the movie, at least not in any meaningful way. You had bits and pieces where Oprah told Meg that so many things had to happen for her to be born just the way she was, but it seemed like a passing moment. That it would not be a major thing. And it never was. I didn't feel Meg's struggle to love herself. She was always more caught up on her father and anything she said about not liking herself was just words. It wasn't until the end that I thought, \"Oh, that's the moral of the story?\"All in all, I felt the movie really missed the mark. It's flaws left me uninterested in the movie and it really was a waste of time.",

Let's start off with how unfaithful it is to the book it's based off of: Entire sections from the Wrinkle In Time book are cut out from this movie. For starters, instead of finding Meg's father by going into the Camazotz headquarters and having to fight the red-eyed man inside and Charles Wallace under his possession, the part of the movie on Camazotz is restrained to completely boring borderline filler. Eventually they reach what the movie calls the Camazotz headquarters but it's an empty room where Meg's father is just sitting up in another empty room connected by an invisible staircase. Another big change is that the planet Ixchel is completely removed from the movie despite being a major part of the book without any attempt to even replace it. Even more randomly it seems they changed the introduction and conclusion specifically to highlight Calvin as a love interest. Another issue that sinks the movie: The visuals do not live up to the book's descriptions. The beautiful creature described on Uriel literally looks like flying cabbage in the movie and Camazotz looks less like the madness described in the book and more like a generic small town neighborhood. Possibly a bigger issue than terrible illustration or terrible adaptation, however, is terrible pretentiousness. The movie as a whole has this attitude that it's woke and deep with the flashbacks of bad things happening on Earth and the semi-vague descriptions of IT that make the whole thing play out like the protagonists are on an ego trip. I had to stop here because I'm late for something but yeah this movie sucks.",

Some of her scenes really blew me away. I also enjoyed each of the \"misses\" immensely. The story was great but the writing sometimes felt stunted with very little world building. My girlfriend was confused throughout the entire story. I just felt like the story could've gone so much further while explaining a little more along the way. The graphics were great but some of the editing/directing made it feel chopped up and inconsistent. Lots of extreme, extensive close ups. In particular, a lot of the music choices really bothered me. Maybe it's just me but adding modern music with lyrics in a sci-fy fantasy movie really takes me out of the story and cheapens the whole thing.

I don't like fantasy and went into it not expecting to like it but am pleasantly surprised. I think the difficulties the children experience when their father disappears is well portrayed. I like how the boy goes off at the teachers for their idle gossip about something that is so deeply personal to him (the disappearance of his father) and sticks up for his sister who is being systematically bullied since their father's disappearance because of her vulnerability.. He is promptly called crazy along with her for which his sister retaliates and is told by the incompetent principal that it was an unprovoked attack and that she is trying to use \"her father's disappeared\" card for four years as an excuse for her aggression and is told to cut it out.It is later revealed the principal was indeed selected over better candidates for the position,. Then the movie moved from social justice themes into the trippier themes of time travel and the timeless fight between good and evil. (People criticise that it didn't show the father and friend tessering back, but everything obvious thing doesn't need to be spelled out in a movie. They tessered back the same way the brother and sister did).. Meg stayed back to rescue her brother that had been possessed by evil and it could only be overcome with love. Meg had to face all that was dark and hidden about herself, all the things she didn't want to accept about herself to be strong enough to save her brother. Only the strength of pure love could overcome evil and she achieved that. People may think that is corny but in my 50 years, I have only got strong by facing my weakness and I have only overcome evil with love. The themes are pretty solid for me. That is my lived experience. I actually liked the costuming. I liked seeing what they would do with the makeup, the clothes and the transformation into other creatures. If people are so disappointed with the movie, the book must be outstanding or just not focus on the themes of social justice and good vs evil as much - or has it's qualities in another area that the movie missed and disappointed viewers. It held me all through and I enjoyed it.",

The cinematography was beautiful; they make great use of CGI to depict the alien worlds, while still maintaining the realness of the main characters. I also thought the pacing was good. I was worried it was going to move too slow, but it ended up moving slow in the parts where it should and moving fast where it shouldn't.I liked the unconventional cast, though maybe Oprah didn't need to be in there. In the book Meg is supposed to be awkward, so people who are saying she can't act are just misunderstanding how she's supposed to be acting. The story is about embracing your faults and figuring out a way to use them to succeed in life; it wouldn't have worked to have Meg be swashbuckling.The main difference between the movie and the book is in the movie IT is actively trying to get them, whereas in the book IT is much more passive. I didn't mind the change. I think the PG13 rating confused some people-- this is a definitely a kids movie, but one that grown ups can also appreciate.",

Really. There are some moments in this film, albeit small moments that the dialogue is exquisite and really made me sit forward and think. In fact at one point I was even nodding in agreement with what Oprah was saying about how the main character got to where she was. There were a few moments like that that saved me from turning it off. There was also other visual moments that kept me watching, like her last leap through space/time to get home. It such a shame that Disney has taken another, what I'm sure was a, literary masterpiece and tore it to shreds to make a quick buck to add to the billions they already have. Shame on you Disney/producer/director but well done to everyone else who was great in this film. Thank you for restoring my faith in books, I will be visiting this series soon.",

It was distracting and so over the top and absurd that it was alarming.Additionally it was so, so slow and did nothing but wear you out with music for a long, long time.This could have been a Wizard of Oz for the present, but instead it turned into just a massive distraction.
