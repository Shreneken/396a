During the whole movie I tried to stop watching it multiple time, but kept on going hoping something good will happen and was utterly disappointed at the end. The movie has very old and cliche plot line. Typically, there is a protagonist who literally eve-teases a girl who at the end is wooed by his \"persistence\" (no wonder a lot of street goons are inspired by such characters making our country an unsafe place for women). The action is typical comical south-indian movie style where one punch from the \"hero\" sends villain in alternate dimension. The dialogues are crowd pleasing one line punchliners which might appeal to certain audience. Only good thing about the movie was decent acting by the lead actor.",

            "review_title": "Basically a stylized exercise in hero worship! [+44%]",
            "content": "K. G. F Chapter 1 might be an astonishing wonder for one section of film-goers who haven't yet been exposed to world cinema. But, honestly, it is little beyond an overstretched exercise in hailing the protagonist as invincible. The problem with films that have invincible heroes is that none of the challenges that the screenplay poses turns out to be engaging enough. This, in turn, makes K. G. F Chapter 1 a less than exciting experience.Prashant Neel has packaged the film with all necessary massy ingredients: there are slow-motion intro sequences, exquisitely staged yet pointless fights, and excessive hype created around the protagonist's indomitable aura. There are a bunch of scenes that try to reinstate the fact that Rocky (Yash) is unbeatable. It's clear from the very first scene that he's in. Yet, the director chooses to drive the point home over and over again. The dialogues too are some of the campiest I've heard in recent times. It's like no one in the film speaks normally. Everyone speaks as if they've been preparing their cheese-filled quotes/monologues for years, just waiting to spit them out at first given instance.Character-building is one area that the film lacks terribly in. We have more than a dozen (main) characters being introduced but none of them (and I repeat, none of them) are well-fleshed out. Even Rocky's childhood is just a collection of massy moments: he is pushed to the limit; his mom utters philosophical nonsense, and the next thing you see, he's beating people up in a jiffy. When Rocky grows older, he beats even more people up. Basically, the film uses the tired formula of one-man-against-many to build hype around the character of Rocky. This is something good old Shankar tried more than a decade ago and emerged a winner at. Prashant Neel attempts the same; he's supported greatly by his cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda (who assigns splendid colours to frames, often giving it a neo-noir touch), composer Ravi Basrur (the songs are bathroom-breaks but the background score was pretty epic), and the fine-looking production values (the set designs are elaborate).Where Neel lacks in the screenplay, he tries to compensate with cinematic gimmicks. The heroine, unfortunately, is a mere prop. She shows up in a couple of scenes (and a song) that do nothing but stretch the film's first half. In a film such as this, it would be criminal to even consider a well-written role for the heroine. In fact, the protagonist's mom (who appears in flashbacks) and a struggling pregnant mother at the gold mine receive better treatment than the heroine. Well, here's hoping she has something more to do in the sequel.The villains? I like how Prashant Neel tried to bring to the forefront not one, but a whole array of them. However, none of them manages to leave an impression. At the end of the day, they're just brawny halfwits who are not worthy of even tying the hero's shoelaces. K. G. F Chapter 1 certainly has a better second half (once the film shifts to the gold mine), though that it isn't saying much. I wish the director spent less time trying to write scenes glorifying Rocky and instead, focused on telling a more compelling story with well-rounded characters.I agree that a gangster movie needs its share of crowd-pleasing moments and even then, K. G. F Chapter 1 isn't a lot beyond an overly indulgent star vehicle. I'm not exactly sure if it's the packaging that impressed audiences or the frequent massy reminders; it definitely isn't the screenplay. Yash sleepwalks through the role of Rocky - one which thankfully doesn't require the greatest acting capabilities. This may be a benchmark for the Kannada film industry, but it's high time they realize they're still way behind when it comes to quality content and story-telling, because well, a brilliant technical crew can only do so much to elevate a mediocre screenplay. I hope to see more films along the lines of 'Lucia', 'Lifeu Ishtene', RangiTaranga', 'Kirik Party', and 'Thithi' instead of 'K. G. F'.",

Yeah, it makes sense in South Indian Films where law of physics are not counted.\nBut we are in 2019 now and still watching this cringe? You are going to say, Superhero movies in hollywood does the same and we don't talk about that. duh, these are completely different genre. secondly, dialogues in the movie is okay for movies that released in 90's times. \" Gangster to jo gang leke aata hain, wo hai monster\" I Can't take anymore of this cringe. In fact, they wasted the whole film duration in developing the characters, Not a single shot where, Rocky is not shown. Maybe one or two? And the plot? Well, A boy from slum , his mother dies, this kind of story is common now.You want a gangster movie? Watch once upon a time in mumbai, see how it entertains you without having masala elements.

Just pure cringe. Add to that the real world hero worship by the fans just shows you how politicians and film stars float on the sevenrh heaven in India.4. Headache inducing action: Rapid cuts and editing just make you dizzy.5. The heroine was there just for fun.. so were the item songs.6. What was the point the movie was trying to make? The mother makes her son promise that he will die a rich and powerful man. Ok understood. But richness and power can also be done in a legitimate way. Not by becoming a gangster and kiling people left right. An interesting story would have been if he got educated, became a minister or govt officer and then fought againt KGF mafia to win over the mines in a legitimate way. Maybe throwing in some fights for the required masala. Like Nayak.\nTLDR: Just avoid and save 2.5 hours of your life.",

It was well choreographed and don't mess with physics and logic unlike other south indian movies. The VFX was excellent, especially the gold mine scenes were visual and emotional treat. The atmosphere they build was very realistic and cinematography was good. But other than that, everything falls flat. It turns out to be a masala film that masses would cheer.

To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.",

Take KGF, for example. SO. MUCH. HYPE! Like Baahubali level. Baahubali - although wasn't SOO spectacular, was at least entertaining. Moreover, we were watching a well-conceived historical fiction after a long time. So the hype was understandable. But KGF? Is this a joke or prank?To me, it seemed like the director got heavily awed after watching Mad Max, then decided to take certain \"formulas\" from Bahubali, and a few bits here and there from other films, and packaged it with a good trailer and decent BGM. But the overall story? Nothing new at all. A poor child vowing to become tough and strong due to poverty, joining a don gang and becoming a big shot goonda. I mean, how many countless movies have shown the same thing? It is an appealing story though - if taken at least with an ounce of logic. But no, one hero should be able to bash up 50 to 60 men single handedly! He can walk on petrol with a cigar lit, he can dodge a hundred bullets, he is GOD! He is Yash and he is a mass hero and he is GOD. When are we going to mature as an audience?Of course, a hero who kills pretty much in every second scene should also have a conscience right? Because we can't risk seeing a bad man as a hero. Oh no! So the hero stops traffic for miles and crosses the road - all for what? To give a bun to a poor lady and preach on the values of motherhood. See? We have a strong man AND a good man. So, worship him, please? Add to this a namesake hero worship song and a namesake heroine who first hates the hero and then adores him hearing his bun motherhood speech. Yawn.And did I mention - this story is so disjointed. In the name of experimentation, we reel from past to present to past, and it just gives a headache. The second half gets slightly better - but again, only because the bad guys are shown to be SO bad - like, literally monsters - that we want to see them defeated. The last ten minutes are so loud and violent that it took me a day to feel normal again. Moral of the story - I write long reviews that most people won't anyway agree with, but it feels good to vent.Hands down, the worst movie I have seen in 2018.",

            "content": "This movie truly had the potential to be something more than just a bunch of braindead sequences of the protagonist beating up tens of hundreds of people at the same time with his bare hands, some even armed with guns.I mean, come on, seriously? The only intelligent confrontation scene was when the leading lady challenges Rocky, our hero, to touch her while she was encircled by her Gangster Daddy's bodyguard thugs. I half expected all the goons to lower their guns when Rocky stared at them or the guns to melt somehow. But thankfully, Rocky backs off, rides in a tanker with an inflammable liquid and then spills it all over the floor, thereby neutralizing the threat of ammunition being fired.You see, that was brains over brawn intelligent thinking. If only Rocky had used his brains more often than relying on his questionable source of strength with a seemingly endless reserve to get things done.The negative aspect of having an overpowered protagonist is that there isn't a moment that you're scared for his life. What if there's an army of bad guys coming at our hero? No problem, we've seen him kill or incapacitate hundreds of goons with his bare hands before, how hard could this new challenge possibly be? If you want a reference on how to get that balance right, please watch Marvel's Punisher on Netflix. Frank Castle kills numerous people at the same time too, but he takes a good thrashing himself in the process which makes him a believable character.The sets were good and the story really had potential. But, unfortunately, the Writer, Director, and Producers had already decided that this will be a no-brains, hero-worship flick with stylized explosions in the background while the protagonist walks in slow-motion with bad guys flying left and right and sometimes even spinning in the air after being struck as if they were cricket balls being hit out of the park. *sigh*1/10",

This isn't a dull gangster movie or a long documentary, it's just intelligent, smart, stylish, stunning fun with a heart!KGF is a win for the whole Kannada film industry. Every single frame oozes a pan-Indian appeal. So no matter what language you watch it in, you'll get the feel of a straight film. Prashanth Neel's direction is stunning given that it's just his second directorial film. Yash is definitely the new pan-Indian star. His performance is beyond judging. The film is long in duration but I never realized that!Since it's a period action film, KGF delivers much more than what the trailers showed. It has action, adventure, drama and some suspense that will keep you glued till the end. It's neither funny nor too dark, and hence a properly balanced film. The dialogues are so crisp that I was literally smiling with excitement.Cinematography is mindblowing. The depiction of the Kolar Gold Fields is so stunning that you'll have a tough time finding an excuse for not watching it on the big screen. The action scenes were way above my expectations: each and every action sequence was phenomenally executed. Not many songs but all of them register big time.KGF isn't just for the Kannada-speaking people but for anyone who likes to watch action movies with a wholehearted execution. Once again, Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet. Just go for it. As for me, I'll now watch more of Yash and Neel's filmography. I know I won't be the only one waiting for the second chapter of this epic.",

In India there is a concept of celebrity fans who love their chosen celebrities blindly, and any movie that hurt one of their loved-one's movie is automatically a hateful movie for them. And one of the most famous celebrity in India is Shahrukh Khan. As \"K. G. F. Chapter 1\" was released the same day Shahrukh's 'Zero' movie was released, which became a major flop against all odds, while competiting K. G. G, all true fans of Shahrukh Khan are obliged to post their 1-star reviews here. DO NOT take these reviews seriously. Just ignore them.This movie surely have something the haters of this movie claim. There is intense heroism. The Protagonist of this movie indeed has somewhat super-strength. He can beat twenty people in solo fighting. At times he's showed as invincible. Now, here is something very interesting. This same thing declared as major 'flaw' of the movie is what makes this movie simply great.Before I give the reason of 'how' and 'why' for my previous statement, let me clarify something here. Contrary to what many people believe, the protagonist in this movie named 'Rocky' is not entirely invincible. It's just that his weaknesses are not disclosed directly. If you're watching the movie closely, you will notice that he's extremely smart as well. He chooses the best scenarios for his fights. Sometimes he chooses right time for his fights. And sometimes he creates appropriate scenarios that provides him certain advantages. Those advantages can be darkness, fumes, etc., as well as intense fear among his opponents (as whenever he hits, he goes for a kill, which scare is enemies intensely). And in situations when he realizes he would be forced to fight in absence of such advantages, his facial expressions show his tension. Hence, he knows his strengths and weaknesses, and he fights considering those.Now let me come to the point that I mentioned earlier. Certain scripts require the protagonist to have unrealistic or unusual human strengths. Normally such movies are superhero movies. But there is also a category of movies which utilize the same concept for non-superhero protagonists. The main focus on such movies is not on how the protagonist have such strengths, but on what happens even when he has those strengths. The story is written accordingly. If you have watched Baahubali, you would understand what I mean by this.K. G. F., although a very different movie from Baahubali, also explores the same concept. The protagonist here is extremely strong. But what happens when he needs to go to a Gold Field and work as a slave (this is basic the description of the movie.) And this is the main story. Problem for many, however, has been that for them too much time was spent on the buildup on the main character and the movies' premise. Thing is, this movie is first part of a two-part movie. And total length of these two parts would be somewhere around 5.5 hours. So we can expect a buildup of 1 hour, which would be surely very long for some. But once passed, the movie would surely attached the viewer to the characters. And in my eyes the makers of this movie has surely done this with the most interesting way possible. They have brought several very interesting scenes, and have delivered several very exciting dialogues during this phase. Musical score also creates a very good impact during this phase.This movie is a piece of art for several reason. It would make you love a character who is cruel, immoral, mean, and a killer. At times you would want him to kill people, and when he won't, you will feel anger for him. Most important aspect of the movie is that it's not created with chronological scenes. Instead the story is being told non-linearly, with back and forth flashbacks, which at time would feel unconnected to the previous scene. But those scenes would surely deliver you an impact that would strengthen the character or premise in your mind. Certain joints of entirely different kind of dialogues will be spoken by entirely different people in entirely different timelines. Even more, dialogues of a different timeline or location and spoken by different people are used over special scenes, and some in slow motions. Extremely thoughtful smart plays are designed for some scenes that could have been done in most simplistic scenarios. Several times dialogues are left in the middle, and then scenes are used to explain further. All this increase the dramatic impact of those scenes and dialogues by many folds. This might might have not been done the first time. But I'm sure no other movie has ever done this with such greatness. I've instantly become a fan of this movie's director now.One more thing I would like to add. Although the premise and description of the movie would suggest this would be a brainless action film, this movie is far from it. There is intense emotional drama here. In fact, this emotional drama, between a mother and her son, plays even bigger role in the movie than the action part of the story. This is what sets up the main theme here, and its impact is kept throughout the movie by using several perfectly well-times flashbacks of the duo's interaction.I will highly recommend everyone to ignore all the negative reviews and watch this movie. And watch with open mind. Don't care too much about whether the laws of physics or unrealistic feeling fight sequences. Once the real story will start, these same things that were giving you somewhat irritations earlier would start giving you goosebumps. This movie surely deserves an average rating above 8 here at IMDB. And it has this for the right reasons.",

            "content": "In 2014, we saw a new wave in Kannada Cinema by a newbie director named Prashant Neel. The movie Uggram, put the then struggling star SriMurali back on the success radar. Although the movie had a simple gangster plot, it stood out with its narration and the unique style of filmmaking. Almost 5 years after the director Neel is back with and how. With KGF, Prashant Neel has just put Kannada film industry back on the map. This most expensive Kannada movie has been simultaneously released in 5 languages and rightly so as it is a movie not to be missed.I'd rather not brief about the story. The movie is divided into two halves. The first half is about the shenanigans of the quirky badass gangster (or should I say monster?) Rocky Bhai. The second half has a much dark tone to it along with the build up to the Chapter 2. There is not too much to read into the script. But this time around the director Prashant Neel has corrected the mistakes that he had made with his previous venture Uggram. The editing is crisp, there aren't any unnecessary comedy bits or romance. The songs are well placed and the music Ravi Barsur really helps with the goosebumps. Although the camera moves very fast in the action sequences, they are not over the top unlike most movies. The slo mo shots as shown in the trailer really up the serious tone of the movie. There are also some surprise elements in the screenplay which is very new to Indian cinema. After a long time in Kannada cinema I have seen a movie with such good dialogue writing. The tone of the dialogues shift according to the scenarios, while they have lighter and mass appeal while addressing the lead character and they shift to a poetic tone with the narration. It is unfair not to mention the art and the costume department who have really worked hard to make this period film. The extensive use of sets, close up shots and the colour tone of the movie has worked out well for Neel to make it look like a proper period film.I have never been much of a Yash fan, but boy has he done justice to this role. He both overplays and underplays the character Rocky to perfection and no wonder he spent close to 3 years for this movie. He also fills in for the comedy part of the movie with great delivery of one liners. Big credit to the director to have given some new Kannada actors a chance instead of importing villains from other industries. Female lead Sreenidhi Shetty looks very beautiful and has done justice for a debutant. Hopefully we will get to see more of Vasishta Simha and Achyut Kumar in Chapter 2. Many other veteran Kannada actors like Anathnag, B Suresh, Malavika and the list goes on who have played key roles with less screen time. Some of the actors' appearance in the screen adds to the nostalgia factor.KGF finally shows that a movie can live up to the hype it creates. The movie might not have an extraordinary story line but it is the movie which can make every Kannadiga and an Indian proud. Go watch for the entertainment, goosebumps, acting and more importantly the art of film making.",

The sequence where the hero in the process of wooing his girl gets distracted possibly by a scene from his own childhood is absolutely Gold or should I say kolar gold. A must watch for any 80s and 90s action buffs. This ranks with Venkatesh's Shatruvu, Amitabhs Agneepath, and Sanjay Dutts Aatish. It is also heavily inspired by the first part of Baahubali.

I also liked Rocky's character may it be as a child or as an adult. The other thing that followed my liking was the story, the way how it avoided being goofy.Final Verdict: It would not be wrong if I say it a kind of story telling like in Bahubali.

Not because it was good movie but far form it. This movie is made for a specific target audience, a superhero fantasy movie for poor and dumb people. They knew what their target audience like and they delivered it perfectly.All acting was just over acting, poor VFX, tons of action but basically the same thing, bunch of bad guys coming one by one, hero swings his limb and voila one shot kill. If you like Anime inspired ridiculous dialogs and lots of slow motion wired poses of bearded men than this might be just right up your ally. But if you like well made movie with good story and script than avoid it like a plague.PS: I am pretty generous on rating the Chapter 1 but the Chapter 2 is by far one of the worst thing I have ever seen.",

If the move was trimmed and the choppy sequences and unnecessary narrations removed it would be less than a one hour movie.There is an overload of characters whose purpose is not clear. Lot of them look alike. There is unnecessary mother-son emotions thrust at various points, which becomes unbearable.

The camaraderie is solid,the punchlines too at some levels land well but given the screentime to yash the screenplay doesnt offers much room for other characters,there are some bits and pieces characters but none of them is memorable as i said they are sacrificed for most part run-time of the film to Rocky Bhai ( Yash ). Yash does the swagger pretty well, but the human part of him in the film gives us some best moments yes even more than the action scenes which have a been-there-seen-that film. KGF much tighter (although great screenplay ) with shorter lenght and developed characters could have been a better film but its not bad either. The biggest shame is you can spot some characters the way the anticipation is built up you can assume from miles away that a sequel is on its way. I'm going with 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "When the going gets tough, people start searching for a hero who would stand up for them and liberate them from all the pain and difficulties that they have been forced to endure. Stories of heroism have always been loved by the viewers, but the impact of such films become even bigger when people are going through a rough phase in their real life, and the movie ends up offering them a cathartic release. In the 1970's, India was going through a difficult phase economically, people were struggling to make ends meet; at that time Amitabh Bachchan's films became the voice of the people and because of the characters he was playing, he was often called as the angry young man. He was the hero, who stood up against the system that was crushing the common man with its policies and making their lives difficult. People look up to such heroes, because they give them hope for a better future; they see such heroes as the answer to their prayers; that optimism gives them the strength to stand up and fight again. Through KGF, Director Prashant Neel has made an attempt to recreate a similar kind of story, where the lead character is nothing less than a messiah for everyone.KGF is a movie that has been designed to give you goosebumps. The powerful dialogues by Prashant Neel, electrifying music by Ravi Basrur and swag of lead actor Yash is bound to fill your heart with so many emotions that you might be tempted to stand up and cheer for the hero and give him a shout out. This is the kind of film that makes you feel alive and ready to conquer the world. The director succeeds in making a connection with the audience and triggering all the right emotions inside them.KGF is not the first action or gangster film, but it manages to strike a chord with it's viewers like no other film because the story of this film is not that of a mindless criminal who indulges in violence for no reason at all, but instead of a boy who rises up to be a powerful force after facing a thousand hardships himself. This is the kind of story that people really associate with, because they see themselves in that hero. KGF gives the audience a hero they can truly believe in, a hero who genuinely understands the pain of the people because he has suffered it all himself. With so much injustice around us in the real world, when you see someone like Rocky standing up to fight against the evil, it feels cathartic.Actor Yash was truly born to play this role; I can't imagine any other actor to play this character. The creative team has done an absolutely stupendous job in creating the look of Rocky; it's not common for actors to sport such a long beard and thick hair, but Yash totally owns this look. Every time he appears on screen, he stands out from everyone else; every time he disappears from the screen, you want him to come back soon, that's how powerful an impact he makes with his presence. Looks and physical presence are not the only aspects nailed by Yash; the actor comes across as extremely believable every time he says a dialogue. In today's era, very few actors look as charismatic as Yash does on screen; he is easily one of the best looking actors of the Indian Film Industry.Action movies are known primarily for their action only, but KGF is quite different because it's also an emotional roller coaster. In the 1970's, mother's love was a basic ingredient in almost every film, and since director Prashant Neel is heavily inspired from that era, he has added a sub plot involving Rocky's mother and her tragic life. For Indians, there is no other human being who matters more to them than their mother; fully aware of this reality, director Prashant Neel has aimed directly at the heart of all Indians. Some of the most heartfelt scenes and dialogues of the film involve either Rocky's mother or when he remembers his mother. The dialogue writer deserves a lot of appreciation for writing some extremely beautiful dialogues. The final dialogue itself, spoken by Rocky's mother, deserves a separate award because of how powerful it is and the amount of goosebumps it evokes.More often than not movies start losing their grip in the second half, but KGF becomes a whole new monster in the second half as the story reaches the Kolar Gold Fields. The screenplay of the second half is even more engaging than the first half. The pacing never feels off as you are totally intrigued by the proceedings. This is what sets apart KGF from regular action movies; Prashant Neel has given this film a well layered story with its fair share of twists and turns that never allow your interest to fade away.The visuals of the film are absolutely stunning. The art direction team and the cinematographer have done a tremendous job in giving life to this world and presenting it to us in such a beautiful and realistic manner. The action sequences of the film won't give you a headache because they have been choreographed very stylishly.One of the strongest support that this movie gets is from music composer Ravi Basrur, who has created some heartfelt as well as electrifying songs for the film. The song of the mother, Garbadhi, will stay with you long after you have finished watching the film. Ravi Basrur has most certainly left a big impression with his work in this film and I would be definitely looking forward to what kind of music he composes in the future.On paper, KGF is just an action film; but in reality it's so much more than that. KGF is an absolute must watch for everyone who wishes to experience pure unadulterated joy, happiness, goosebumps and adrenaline rush.",

I saw the Telugu dubbed version.The elevations given for Yash's character is a lot, more than what we saw Jr. NTR get in the Telugu movie Aravindha Sametha Veera Raghava, yet seems this one is plausible as it's a period drama. One big dud is the lead actress whose character was not at all needed & had no logical place in the entire flick. Maybe she was a key role in Chapter 2, we're unaware at this point.Cliffhanger ending is given, making it open for Chapter 2, but with all the hype already placed for Rocky, will the next one live up to the hype?

It felt like the time I watched the ill-fated Bheema, which had some incredibly strong cinematography. But, Bheema had nothing else. KGF too, has nothing else. The story is one that we've all been accustomed to. The second half of the movie actually reminded me of the second half of Kuruvi.I'm trying to avoid spoilers here. So, let's see how much of the story I can share with you. Rocky is born in a desperately poor family. How desperate? His dying mother tells him \"whatever you do, become rich.\" So much for childhood trauma. Everything he does after this scene is to become rich.What I liked was that there was not a single frame where the characters could relax for a bit. It was all onward and upward to action city. In a movie like this, no one gets a breather. Neither the characters nor the audience. I was disappointed with the film because I wasn't engaged in the story. The screenplay is weak. Since this is \"Chapter 1\", I'm assuming that the vast majority of empty characters in this movie will have something to do in the sequel. If not, that's a waste of time for us for buying into these characters.I'm okay with the macho, immortal portrayal of Rocky. But, there's nothing new about him. You can take any character from past films such as Temper, Petta, Baasha or even Sarrainodu. You'll find these characters to be wildly entertaining. Rocky however isn't all that. He's grim and brooding. Even when he's supposed to be romancing the girl, he's just awkward. Heaven knows how the romantic angle worked out in this film.My final verdict is that this film is all pomp and no show, all style and no substance. You can tell a filmmaker's style by watching one or more of his films. I've seen parts of Uggram and the whole of KGF Chapter 1. I don't know what Prashant Neel is about. Is he trying to be the next Michael Bay or does he aspire to be Sergio Leone? Neutral colours isn't an aesthetic that can carry an entire film. You need sparks of vividity, Prashant. Make a better film next time. With better writing, settings and well etched out characters.",

It's all about his struggles, challenges he faced to be rich from utmost poor. For this the challenge and opportunity he gets is killing mafia don in Karnataka who is ruling KGF while Rocky (Yash) is also a rowdy in Mumbai\nStory is something not very new but proceedings are shown stylish on one hand and raw rustic on other hand which is highlight in the movie. Yash acting is very stylish and action episodes though exaggerating are entertaining especially in 2nd half.\nThe sufferings of people in KGF are shown raw and rustic which might be difficult to go with a section of audience. 1st half completely relies on hero characterisation and unnecessary fights, elevation sequences. No importance to female lead. Certain episodes are too exaggerating. Dialogues are long and confusing with unnecessary flash movements and sequences and background score in middle of conversations. Too much conversations and details are said when movie is processing which is not clear and irritates at some points while the same is said in climax portion simply which can be done at that time of movie portion instead of long dialogues or completely avoid those dialogues on that movements making audience to have more suspense in proceedings and reveal it in climax.\nWhile in 2nd half story picks up in KGF too much dialogues in middle disturb flow and makes boring. While these episodes are more rustic there is more scope of hero elevation . That unnecessary elevation in 1st half could be used here for better treatment. However it had flavor of Telugu film Chatrapati and same kind of elevation but there is no rajamouli,prabhas here so punch is little low compared with that film.\nStill climax hero elevation scenes where Rocky fights against goons is highlight part of movie as until then their sufferings shown in very unpleasant way which will be enjoyed by B,C center audience. But as I mentioned before these scenes can be elevated even more like Chatrapati which had same flavor.\nThen the final part when Rocky takes don position of KGF by killing present don is flat and hurried where again hero elevation is required more but it's not present.\nThere comes explanation to all the plans of Rocky to conquer KGF and beginning of chapter 2.\nOverall movie is boring at many parts and exaggerating at many parts\nBut elevation scenes ,fights,style workout too which makes this flick a hard one time watch",

He starts to follow his goal in Mumbai with nothing in terms of wealth but is himself god-gifted in terms of man-power. He wants to build a brand of his name- \"Rocky\" as seen on his bike. In after-sequences, he is shown to defeat every gangsters of mumbai with a mighty force of local ruffians single-handedly. Seeing this he is then called to Bangalore by one of the biggest crimelord there named Rajendra Desai for a seemingly impossible mission. He is assigned a task of assassinating the violent and cruel successor of Konar Gold Field's previous emporer- Garuda in the DYSS headquarters, where he fails to kill Garuda due to the presence of large number of armed guards. But then he enters Kolar gold mines alone breaking the highest security to reach Garuda and eventually becomes successful to kill Garuda surpassing all those thousand armed men protecting Garuda. \"Overall the plot is too weak and quite illogical\".Action scenes- The protagonist is shown to be unstoppable and almighty as can be seen in any typical South Indian movies. Here also action surpasses logic. Rocky alone is able to defeat hundred men equipped with weapons. What more worse is he infiltrates the palace heavily guarded by the almost thousands of trained servicemen without pre-planning and anyone's help. How he has got these powers is a mystery though. \"Action scenes are very unreal and out of mind\".Direction- The scenes in the movie are changing so fast that they interfere with the continuity of watching movie and eventually bereave the interest of spectators. Most of the scenes are shot in low light and the story is progressing so rapidly that it feels the mind with the sense of impracticable and unemotional things. \"The direction is the greatest downside of the movie\".Final Words- \"The film is not up to the mark. The story has no firm base. It is not explained that how Rocky became so powerful and popular from a harsh poverty. Characters of don are continuously changing in the first half. The sequences in the film are also illogically arranged. Oveall experience is very unrealistic and poor. There is a need of much more improvement in KGF Chapter 2.\"",

The dialogues seemed corny, voices seemed hammy and the story felt nonsensical.I realised this movie's true potential only when I decided to watch it again. But the second time round it had to be in the original language because that's the director's vision which I wanted to know. And oh boy how different it was then. A completely different film if I may.This is because the first Time around, I had watched it in Hindi. The dubbing artist did a really atrocious job. He sounded like a fool if I may. Which is why I wasn't able to take this movie seriously at all. The dub just doesn't have that impact that the original version has. I don't know how they settled for such a hammy actor. Go through the broken English dialogues. I swear you will cringe rather than laugh.Talking about the film, the story is great, cinematography and direction, credit to Prashant Neel, it is absolutely grand. BGM is the life of this film. Such hardcore BGM just elevates this film to a different level. But the main best thing about this movie is the hero. Yash is an absolute hero. What a look, what great acting skills he possesses and an insane physique which allows him to carry out the action scenes with total ease. He fits the role of Rocky perfectly and his some serious swagger. I loved his dialogue delivery. Credit to the dialogue writer and also Yash who delivers them to perfection. The dialogues give you an insane feel and I can imagine watching This film in Kannada and cheering and hooting at the dialogues. Kannadigas must o have surely had a blast. The Hindi fellow ruined such amazing dialogues and all he got from at least me was embarrassed expressions. However the dialogues in Kannada said by Yash gave me a feel that I cannot express in words.Kudos to Kannada film industry for making this absolutely wonderful movie. I'm team KGF now and completely stoked for chapter 2.",

There was no big promotion for this movie but when you have talent and you have worked hard, it pays. Same goes with this movie. One side our Bollywood makes crazy and senseless movies like Thugs of Hindostan and Zero spending huge amount of money and on the other side we have movies like this, no out of cost expenses and still the result is in front of you.\nI went yesterday to watch the movie in NY cinemas after waiting almost 1 week. I got tickets in just Rs. 80 but I am anytime ready to pay even thrice the amount is asked. This movie has made me prouder that I live in country with such great talents.\nTruly amazing.\nThe set was outstanding.\nThe background music was fabulous.\nThe acting of Yash and other supporting actors was superb.\nI have heard that this movie was released without any cuts. If I get an opportunity, I would just try to cut the songs which made the movie a little slow or I can say it was useless. Only the Rocky intro song can be included just to give Rocky a gift for his amazing work he has done in the movie.\nThe movie was almost 3 hours long but at this pace I would go on watch another 1 or 2 hours.\nOverall a 10/10 because I can't give more than this but, I would love to give 15 out of 10 to this movie.

            "content": "What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.",

Yash was super stylish and the audiences were going crazy in his Hindi dubbed dialogue delivery. Every one madly waiting for Chapter 2. Cheers YASH. The audiences are loving you and your style.

It just makes one so proud!The phrase that strikes one's mind on hearing the word KGF is Gold Mines. Well, time to redefine that!!\nIt's time for the Gold class and gold mass!!\nWhat a movie!! Top notch acting cinematography screenplay dialogues etc etc ..Yash has surpassed himself in every scene. An actor who has immense potential, you tap it and you have a character called Rocky!! Salaam Rocky indeed!What sets the hero apart from other story heros is that he is not too emotional or sentimental but plans for the greater good, is not consumed by everything happening. This shows so clearly when he is almost annoyed when people start looking towards him as their deliverer.Death of the mother-son scene, that guy who begs for deliverance and escape, and sacrifices himself for his wife and yet to be born baby is soo heart touching!!\nThat scene with the old man running around feeling his death nearing him is soo fear inducing, you can't stop yourself from feeling it so close. Also the girl baby birth scene is just so overwhelming.\nJust when you think one scene is the best you have another..seems every scene competes with others to be the best..that makes the movie a winner..a complete one..period!!\nThe climax is one hell of a scene.. that dialogue the Mother says about leadership is what takes the movie to another level..Just when you think the movie has reached its zenith with the fast paced script and excellent visuals you'd feel the only lag is music. Would've loved a more haunting and memorable humming for the intense scenes (likes of Ugram and Tagaru). The sentimental music is very good. Songs were a little disappointing.\nHope the music is improved in the chapter 2.\nAlso the English subtitles were a little awkward at places, they were not translated correctly in more than one scene.not sure if this is got to do with the different files used or whatever.Bestest part is the BELIEVABLE action scenes which are really great. \"Aaa Obba, That One Man!! \". Most of the action movies tend to exaggerate the stunts to ridiculous squabbles, thankfully here they're terrific and so very believable.Can't wait for the second chapter..seeing they've set the benchmark so high in the very first!! Wish them all good luck for the next part!!",

            "review_title": "Pathetic first half, phenomenal second half",
            "content": "I know, many people will mark this review unhelpful when Chapter 2 comes closer to release. But honestly those toxic fans are the reason why my hopes from this film were so high. When the trailer for KGF: Chapter 2 came, many people were saying that this film will mark the end of Bollywood. I saw KGF: Chapter 1 hoping that this film will be something like Baahubali (without the CGI of course). But no, this isn't any different from any normal South Indian film. In fact, it is pretty much what everyone hates about Bollywood. It has eve teasing, corrupt politicians, peaceful religion shown as good people and Hindus shown as bad people, unrealistic action and item songs.The film begins by mentioning Rocky (of course, the most unique name for a hero) is the most wanted criminal in Indian history, and yet there is nowhere that his account has been mentioned. Now I have several questions. How come one book is the only source of the people knowing about the biggest criminal to ever exist? How come no one else wrote about it? I'm 99% sure there must have been some Ravish Kumars or Arnab Goswamis at the time who would write this down at least in secret. And what about the TV channels who must have accidentally aired it before it was announced that it has to be a secret? And what about international news sources? If they can write about Dawood Ibrahim, why not about this? But anyway, let's not get carried away by just one illogical thing. There are a dozen more to come.Now, Rocky had been told in his childhood by his dying mother that he has to become the richest and the most powerful person in the world, and that's what he sets out to do. Except there is one problem - he doesn't even know what the most powerful position is. He goes in the side of the underworld and tries his best to establish himself over there, while the UN secretary-general probably laughs in the corner. Also keep in mind that the UN secretary-general is only the most powerful person in the world, not the richest. So now he has to get to a position without looking suspiciously rich. But don't worry about that, because Rocky is too busy singing Happy Birthday while killing bad guys.Speaking of killing bad guys, everytime Rocky fights, there are always like, a dozen jump cuts and lights flickering. He can kill his enemies and his audience who suffer from epileptic seizures. And speaking of epileptic seizures, let's play the drinking game. Every time the screen blacks out, you take one sip. By the end of the film you won't have enough space in your body to insert more liquid. Good luck in the toilet. And speaking of drinking, of course no South Indian film can be completed without harassing or verbally abusing a woman till she gives in. So there is the villain's daughter who is drinking in the public after blocking the road (it looked like a cheap parody of Watchmen). Now I don't know if the Hindi dubbing was so horrendous or the dialogues were actually so bad, but our hero starts speaking gibberish while beating her henchmen.But once the second half starts the film gets much better. Rocky goes inside KGF, and that is where the big story starts. At that point I have no complaints. In fact, it is where the film shows why it is so popular. However, there also some of the cinematography problems do exist, like the bad camera angles, quick jump cuts and of course, the screen going black. But the selling point of the film is the colour grading. That has been done very well, to the point that some scenes look like perfect desktop wallpapers. The ending looked very iconic, something that one will remember while leaving the theatre.The ideas used in this film are very good. From showing how Rocky goes ahead to touch the heroine while ensuring that the henchmen don't shoot him, to arranging the gun for the minister's murder - everything seemed unique, even if it was predictable at some points. The action is pretty much the same as any other South Indian film, and that is what makes it fun to watch. This is one thing that I find very annoying about Bollywood; it is trying to look as realistic as possible nowadays, because of which it feels like a washerman's dog. And I guess this is probably what all those people were talking about when they said this is better than most of Bollywood nowadays.I'd definitely look forward to Chapter 2 when it comes, because of how much suspense it built up in the end. It doesn't end with a question like why Katappa killed Baahubali, but rather one like what will happen next. Although it is pretty obvious what is going to happen next, let's be honest. None of us are in for the story. We just want to see some of that Yash.",

The writers efforts could easily be seen over the screen. The best art were analogies and poems used within. Archana Jois gave a splendid performance playing Rocky's mother, a strong feminist performace and very strong character as well as supporting role. Rocky played by Yash is potrayal of Sorrow, Anger, Heroism and Peace artform. Character is well written bit superbly potrayed. Srinidhi Shetty plays love interest of Rocky but fails to make an impactful performance. Mouni Roy in cameo appearence, adds glamour in her short screen time. Direction came as an icing to the cake where the storyline played at various timelines was so intense, that it developed a sense of enjoyment for 200 minutes of plessure.",

Later the boy named Yash grows,he get confidence and hairstyle! I thought he would entertain me but he just did fight of 2 minutes and over acting of talking. Then he meet a girl,show attitude and go. Later some big beared boring people bores more because they were usless. Biggest Problem was the cameraman,he even could not do a scene for longer than 2 seconds. Which was making me more sleepy.Then after a song came,which was looking in Hindi actually,I surprised that how Kannad film made Hindi song. But I get known that the item song was made specially for Hindi audience. Total waste of creativity actually. Later I was literally bored and I was skipping a movie for first time! The gold mines and labor in the presence of Indian government,What logic is this?Later I was eagerlly waiting for fight then in the mine Yash started a blackout fight,I didn't get how he did it,I mean fighting in dark mines!!Then again only Sultan Sultan could be heard. Over acting of each and every labor. At last,something very logical is seen,Yash kill a boss person with help of teleporting. But I never got known expect Yash,what other person has role?Overall,some scene (at last)made to not enjoy this fight.

First half dedicated to image builder for Yash and Second half for execution. Good thing about direction, Prashanth switched brilliantly from super fast action sequence with gangster war to Leader of weak people from Gold Mines.Performance: Yash is sure shot the star performer of this first chapter. Since from the beginning, he carried the momentum and he has all abilities to become next Bahubali of Indian cinema. I feel bad that Srinidhi Shetty did not get enough frame. Ramachandra Raju as Garuda look like Devil and perfect villain for chapter 1.Script: Story is really engaging and entertaining and credit goes to once again captain Prashanth Neel. He used teaching from mother as the way for hero's target in the life. Killing of innocents in Kolar Gold mines used as get link for killing of evil guards in front of all public. Even climax was really great but it failed to triggered wave of curiosity like Bahubali: Beginning.Dialogues: Action movie need good dialogue so that people can enjoy the action sequences with more entertainment.It is really good to see great dialogues in Hindi dubbed version. e.g. \"Duniya ki sarvshreshth Yoddha Maa hoti hain\"(Translate: Mother is the greatest warrior of the world).Music and Background Score: There was two songs present in Hindi dubbed version. First one was Salaam Rocky Bhai which remind you soundtrack from Bahubali. Second one was Item song by Mouni Roy. Music can be better for Hindi version as we missed music like Bahubali Series. Background score was really impressive one.Box-office: On Day 1, Zero has earned 20 crores and KGF has earned 18 crores due to less number of screen counts. This figure may be change in coming days or week due to better words of mouth.Last Words: This movie can be better plan to celebrate Christmas with your family and friends.",

It just makes one so proud!Ananth Nag Sir, hats off to this legendary actor. He makes you feel (and not just see and hear) the story in his own way.\nYash has surpassed himself in every scene. An actor who has immense potential, you tap it and you have a character called Rocky!! Salaam Rocky indeed!The first half is filled up with lots of characters and stories..the narration was a little fast there. The second half is brilliant, action packed, emotions sentiments and what not!! Hindi being used in first half is fine with the region the story set in. I found the heroines dialogues and reactions a bit weird. Wish her dialogues were better especially when she says \"he is my aashiqui\" (a little out of place for a Bengaluru hudugi). Or maybe I didn't follow those scenes properly. I just wanted the main plot to take over most of the times.What sets the hero apart from other story heros is that he is not too emotional or sentimental but plans for the greater good, is not consumed by everything happening. This shows so clearly when he is almost annoyed when people start looking towards him as their deliverer.Plenty of the scenes will make you just clap and whistle and go awwwe and ohhh!!Death of the mother-son scene, that guy who begs for deliverance and escape, and sacrifices himself for his wife and yet to be born baby is soo heart touching!!\nThat scene with the old man running around feeling his death nearing him is soo fear inducing, you can't stop yourself from feeling it so close. Also the girl baby birth scene is just so overwhelming.\nJust when you think one scene is the best you have another..seems every scene competes with others to be the best..that makes the movie a winner..a complete one..period!!\nThe climax is one hell of a scene.. that dialogue the Mother says about leadership is what takes the movie to another level..Bestest part is the BELIEVABLE action scenes which are really great. \"Aaa Obba, That One Man!! \". Most of the action movies tend to exaggerate the stunts to ridiculous squabbles, thankfully here they're terrific and so very believable.Can't wait for the second chapter..seeing they've set the benchmark so high in the very first!! Wish them all good luck for the next part!!",

Songs could have been a little modern (though the script calls for it), esp the one with Tamanna.\nNevertheless, full of adrenaline rush and eagerly awaiting Chapter 2.

The cinematography and the soundtrack are amazing and so is Yash, but there isn't much in the storyline. This is again another typical Indian movie where one person is given too much power. There are loads of fighting scenes in the movie which really doesn't make sense. Rocky(Yash) beats up nearly 20 people, alone. The transitions in every scene was too fast. So, that's a huge letdown for the editing team. Nearly 50% of the movie is just illogical fighting. Watch it only if you are a die-hard fan of Yash, and okay with more fighting than story.\nBefore you complain about Marvel/DC doing the same thing and people accepting it, let me tell you that those movies are set in a different universe and these superheroes have proper backstories to how they got their powers. Whereas here we have a normal human-being equivalent to a Hulk.\nThis movie is nowhere close to Baahubali.

The international view and the local, subcontinental view.While the film does fare extremely well when compared to the kind of material produced within the subcontinent, it is in no way a gem.If you look at it as an international audience then it will most definitely disappoint you. You will find yourself forcefully sitting through in the hopes of it getting better, but it never will.The storyline itself is fantastic but is ruined by the protagonist beating up crowds of trained gangsters, alone with his fists, repeatedly. Yep. It felt like half of the film was nothing more than poorly choreographed and unnecessary fight sequences. The only good thing in those were the entertaining taunts from the protagonist himself.Other elements such as our protagonist wooing over the heroine by repeatedly harassing her were not realistic either and clearly exhibit how such needless elements of the film industry contribute to the already poor state of women's right in the primary audience.The CGI was very convincing however, if there was any CGI at all. All the locations felt very real, as well the humungous crowds of people numbering in the thousands. A difficult feat to accomplish with such a limited budget.All in all, i would recommend that you do not waste your time watching this if you are not accustomed to the generic Bollywood or Tollywood flick. But if you are, then I'd say that perhaps it is worth a gander.",

I would have given it 10 stars if the main lead had played a major role in bringing people together rather creating a one-man show. The movie was a one time watch for me and I have seen something similar previously. Some scenes failed to create the push which people might have seen in Baahubali but still it is as good as that one. I prefer a realistic movie, so this is my rating which is still not bad.",

This definitely builds curiosityUntil the end of the 1st half the movie in the eyes of a critique is a disaster but will appeal to the audience watching this film. The story is basically how and why Yash goes to KGF with crazy elevations along the way. The screenplay is very nonlinear. The movie also focuses too much attention on Yash rather than story. There are too many villains and characters to keep track off which might lead to confusion. The thing that director Prashant Neel did amazing in the first half is the thrill. He will constantly move the story at 1000 kmph and there is always something happening giving you the full thrill!!!The second half of the film is a cinematic wonder for the mass appeal. It starts of with Yash in KGF (a crazy villanous place where people are enslaved and treated horribly) and he has absolutely no way to get out. It shows how evil the villian is. Yash then somehow does the impossible against all odds and beheads the villian. Although there is no thrill in the second half, in the climax when the villian's head gets cut off its absolutely crazy. You will want to hug the character and you will definitely become a crazy fan. At that moment you forget all the flaws of the movie and come out with blockbuster level of feeling.Although this is a nightmare movie for critiques due to the nonlinear screenplay and mind blowing elevations its appealing general audience.",

I don't think anybody else would suit to this role except but him.\nNow comes the actual review of the movie why this movie is Over hyped and Over rated.\n1.This film is awkwardly fast paced and it is so fast paced that we tend to miss the track of the movie. Feels confusing about too many characters at one time and has no idea what is happening in the movie. Within fraction of\nseconds somethingg keeps changing in the movie.\n2.The film has flashbacks within flashbacks and feels like dragging and disconnects you from the movie because of poor narration of the story.\n3. The director is a failure here because he seems to be in a hurry because the film looks that way and what he made was not a movie but a very big trailer.\nWhile watching the we feel like we are watching trailer but really a very big trailer or it feels like we are watching ad's non stop.\n4.The main focus was on hero and building his image but there is no proper story and also there is not much of an emotional connect except it feels a bit better in second half.\nSo clearly the film is overhyped and over rated but nothing new.",

I should say that the direction, camerawork and editing is excellent. It is on par with 300 and Sin City. The whole direction and medium used to narrate the story is superb and flows smoothly. Usually I get headaches in action movies, but this was well integrated without overpowering you. Its a must watch in a theater. The visuals on a big screen are great. If you understand the origin language - Kannada, you will enjoy the literary dialogue better, but subtitles are fair enough.I would also like to congratulate Prashant Neel and team for an outstanding effort. This movie is not less in quality than any well made Hollywood Blockbuster. Its screening in over 100 theaters in US and I would encourage people of all walks to see it once.",

Overall it's a clear winner and a landmark for Kannada Films. Actor Yash is seamless in performance, no flaws. There are bunch of villains such that you can't make out who is the main one!. Finally it's a 10 star for their efforts. Thanks for giving wonderful movie for Indian cinema and taking Kannada Film Industry to the next level.",

            "content": "The first thing you notice about filmmaker Prashanth Neel's ambitious two-part period crime film is the scale. The project is massive, in a 'Mad Max' meets 'Gangs of Wasseypur' kind of a way, where the action is as much about style, as it is about weaving an intricate tale spanning more than five decades, from 1950 till 2018. While one can see that the massive budgets have been put to good use with elaborate sets and a top-notch production value, one wishes that there was enough thought invested in the story as well. The non-linear narrative gets confusing at times and you come out just thinking about three characters which are Rocky, Seema (Srinidhi Shetty) and Garuda (Ramachandra). The remaining cast, while interesting, remains a blur.\nThe film clearly belongs to our protagonist Rocky (Yash), a kid from the streets of Mumbai who grows up to become a one man army. While his greatness is established in the first half, there are way too many scenes that go on to show how kick-ass our leading man is, which gets tedious, especially in the second half. All pumped up and in a gangster mode, Yash does all the heavy lifting here and has more than a dozen fight scenes, most of which are choreographed quite well. To match his angst is Miss Supranational 2016, Srinidhi Shetty, who delivers a confident performance as a feisty young girl and matches Yash's badassery scene by scene as his love interest.\nFor fans of Yash, there are ample moments to cheer and hoot for, and 'KGF: Chapter 1' will make for an entertaining movie outing. For those who are not fans, this one may be a bit too heavy, given that it is a dubbed version and that there are multiple characters to be tracked to make sense of the story. That being said, filmmaker Prashanth Neel has laid out the set-pieces quite well for a cracking sequel, which we hope, will be far better than this film.",

But does the team deliver to ensure the film meets expectations? Well, it certainly has its moments. The film's first half, though fast-paced, does seem a little long. But the second half, especially the climax, sets up the right premise for the second part of the film.The most exciting part of the film is its screenplay, with the non-linear pattern keeping the viewers engrossed. The growth of Rocky is shown steadily and the makers kept a clever story telling pattern right through, that keeps pace with the narrative. The director also brings out crowd-pleasing dialogues that brings out hoots and cheers from the masses. The transition between 1951 to 2018 is clever and maintains the viewers' curiosity as each character in unveiled.The most-awaited aspect about KGF has been its visuals and come release day, they don't disappoint. The art direction, cinematography and stunning locales add an extra edge to the film. From the dark, dreary world in KGF to the glitzy nightlife in Bangalore, everything looks top notch.Yash as Rocky lives his character to the fullest and has the crowd rooting for him with his majestic screen presence. The ensemble cast revolve around building Rocky's character, which each of them playing their part efficiently.The first chapter shows Rocky as the maverick mastermind who will stop at nothing in order to achieve his mission. While the end of the first chapter does provide a sense of closure, it leaves the audience yearning for more. If the makers wanted to build some momentum for its second part, KGF has certainly delivered what is set out to achieve.",

            "content": "Rocky is an ambitious boy, who wants to die as the richest and most powerful man. From the streets of Bombay to the fields of KGF, he embarks on the mission. And his tale is being retold by a journalist who chronicled his life in the 1980s.\nPrashanth Neel's KGF, which stars Yash in the lead, has become arguably the most spoken about Kannada film nationally. The expectations have been enormous. Does the team deliver? Yes, they do. The film has a fast-paced first half, which does seem a little long, but the second half and the climax sets up the right premise for the second part of the film.\nThe screenplay is the most interesting part of the film. The non-linear pattern keeps the viewers engaged, with the growth of Rocky being shown in a steady fashion. While there are a fair share of scenes and dialogues that bring out the hoots and cheers from the masses, the makers have still maintained a clever story telling pattern that assures one to also keep pace with the narrative. The film traverses from 1951 to 2018, while maintaining a sense of curiosity as each character is unveiled.\nAdding the extra edge to the film are the cinematography, art direction and the locales. Everything looks top notch and one is often left spellbound at the scenes. Be it the dark dreary world in KGF to the more glitzy nightlife scenes in Bangalore, all of them are shown beautifully. Yash, as Rocky, lives his character to the fullest and his screen presence definitely has the viewers cheering alongside him. The ensemble cast play their respective parts, with each of them playing minor building blocks in setting up Rocky's character.\nThe narrative in the first part builds the character of Rocky as the maverick mastermind who will not stop for anything until he reaches his mission. While there is a sense of temporary closure in the first chapter of the film, one also leaves the hall yearning for more. KGF surely seems to have delivered what it set to achieve.",

            "content": "I am from Kerala, and have never seen a Kannada film before. When I saw the first trailer of kgf my mind started saying that this will be my first Kannada film I will be watching. Since I don't know anything about the Kannada film industry, I can't comment on kgf's influence in Sandalwood but one thing I can surely say is that this film has taken Kannada film industry to an international level. According to me this film was much more risky than baahubali because its director and producer decided to make this pan India film exclusively with a cast and crew from their own industry (relatively newcomers). All the actors and technicians in this film were new to the non Kannada audiences. And certainly the risk paid off. Hats off to Prasanth Neel and Vijay Kiradangur.\nI got to watch this film only one week later due to limited screens. But due to positive response screens and shows increased.\nFirst half of this film was like fireworks, my ears got bursted. It was mostly like the old Amitabh Bachchan films. Its the second half which makes it a pan India film. More than the hero elevation scenes it was the mother scenes in the second half which gave me goosebumps. Her dialogue in the climax is what makes this film epic. There are so many amazing dialogues in this film most of them we have heard in the trailer. Coming to its lead man Yash, he is absolutely badass in this film. Truly a rocking star. I became your fan. Fights and bgm were rocking.\nIf I talk about the drawbacks of the film, editing is terrible especially in first half and there is lot of violence which fails to make it a universal film. The film ends in a plain way unlike bahubali 1 and infinity war which ended with a cliffhanger making audience restless for the second part. That's not the way you end a film whose second part is in cans. The villain character Garuda is not properly developed, there is lot of buildup given to him but nothing is shown clearly. Also the storytelling given through narration gets into your nerves as if audience are spoonfeeding kids. And confusion is spread towards various characters we see in second half, who is who?, what are they? etc.\nOn the whole, since kgf 1 ended in a routine way that's why unlike others I am not waiting restlessly for part 2 like bahubali 2 or endgame",

The love story seems very fake and the pitch perfect hero is really cliche to have. The lead actress describes her hero and I was feeling embarrassed on that scene. The action seems not so good, but the cinematography comes with a plus point in this one. The film is a really great entertainment and should have been watched on the screen, but it is not the greatest film india ever produced.So I am explaining it to you now why you all are being crazy like this.

I dont mind mixing the time line where the story is not linear, but what in all thats holy is up with thousands of cuts! Its so annoying. They shot it nicely, they got everything right then why not show it so the viewer can actually absorb whats happening. There is a cut almost every 2 seconds if not less. At points you'd think you're having an elliptic fit. I really feel sorry for people who watched it in a cinema. The goldmine sequence in particular was really poor, unclear and muddled up. In comparison RRR that has similar over the top action is amazing simply because they dont start chopping it every single second. I think they should re release this film with much fewer cuts.",

The movie correctly represents what the Indian masses want and they are in multitudes. The premise of the movie is age old with a protagonist who is larger than life and who rises from the bottom to obliterate the bad guys and deliver justice which the system has not been able to. Reminded me of \"Deewar\" (you have the sick mother and the boy polishing shoes). When he grows up he is now a paid assassin and contract killer Rocky with almost half of his face covered all the time. The villains are extremely nasty, cruel and the hero is honest, determined, powerful while the oppressed are downtrodden, extremely weak, famished and poor. This makes the situation favourable for conflict and pitched violence. There is some high decibel screaming, wailing, killing, explosion and destruction all in your face. ( I have a feeling that part 2 will have some more of the same with more intensity). All this for achieving power and accumulating gold. After bashing up the villains our hero is also quite a romantic guy mouthing suggestive one liners and innuendos to the haughty heroine. The style and swagger of the hero Yash is probably majorly responsible for the success of this movie. The huge colliery which forms the backdrop is indeed awe inspiring. The cinematography is excellent. A number of crowd scenes with night effect have been done skillfully. The editing of majority of the the movie adopts a unique style using a huge number 2 to 3 second shots stitched together which is quite a strain. The movie therefore has a large number of shots. The sound and the visual effects are in plenty and they are mind numbing. The acting is of the hamming type. Probably no one can be blamed since the production is designed that way. In any case the masses have loved the movie and the producers have laughed all the way to the bank. That is all that matters.",

Everything is just absolutely amazing to witness. I have definitely become a Yash fan after seeing him in just this one film. Also he got the girl...

Then its first song came Salaam Rocky Bhai and it increased my expectations and after the 2nd trailer my expectations were sky high.The good news is the movie lived upto my expectations. I am impressed by the direction of Prashanth Neel and I will watch his first film Ugraam now. Art pieces by Shivakumar, Cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda and Background Score by Ravi Basrur deserves a praise as they just helped the film to make audience stick to it.Let's talk about pros and cons:-Pros:-1. None other than rocking star Yash himself. Man what a actor!! Took the whole film on his shoulders. He carried that mass look and attitude which can make people scream or whistle for him. Half of my money spent was satisfied by him only.2. Action scenes were good they were looking much better than the ordinary south action.3. Mom-Son relationship is a great way to make an emotional connection to the audience.4. Set pieces and visuals (HATS OFF).5. Supporting cast was good in there roles.6. The technicians behind this movie and the director and lead actor all are fabulous in there respective jobs.7. Dialogues can make you believe that we are seeing an gangster movie.8. The plot of this movie is the important thing for the audience to watch this movie. The Gold Fields. It really adds a different taste in the movie.9. It has that heroism which we expect in a south movie.10. Songs are placed on perfect time and they are good.11. Climax will force you to get excited for 2nd chapter.12. The first half shows the gangster life and the 2nd half comes to the real subject and shows KGF. This becomes entertaining as we will get to see different scenes and scenarios in the whole movie.Cons :-1. The first half is dragged a little bit. The characters are so rapidly introduced that one will get disconnected from the movie for a little bit.2. Heroism attitude gets a little cringy and overly done in the whole movie.3. Even the second half looks like a dragged one. With the continuous display of same emotions again and again.4. Action sometimes looks over the top.So my rating is 8/10.",

The gold field environment (similar to the post-apocalyptic world in the Fury Road) caught my attention throughout the second half. The dark tone, grippy background score, and some meaningful scenes, made this worth the watch. Few scenes was written extremely well, but the casting let it down. But, as I said, the pakkoda was good!The final 10-15 minutes was so crisp, like a superfast express trying to make up for its delay. Well, did it reach on time?\nI guess I will wait until the next one unfolds. Hope KGF holds on-to its name.",

But the Yash and all actors somehow keep it grounded and story is unique which is good. And second half really pick up a nice substory and visuals which is must watch on theaters. Story is awesome and equally matches the cinematography and BGM. Thankfully the ending was just that quick and not to make it melodramatic fight with villain or else it would felt cliche. The movie sets itself a 2 Chapter which is why it's good to watch or if it was just 1 film than I doubt it would have helped to narrate with the speed it started.

Yash acts well and gets the character rightly, srinidhi shetty has a vry small role and she's okay,the actress playing the mother's role is heart touching and is decent. The storyline begins up nicely bt then at some point it became confusing fr me though it's vry attention catching and grabs yr mind.

            "content": "It is touted as the highest-grossing Kannada film, the fourth highest-earning Hindi-dubbed film after the Bahuubali movies and 2.0, an international success and was feted at the National Film Awards. It was dubbed to Hindi, Telegu, Tamil and Malayalam almost immediately after its Kannada release with much success. And Chapter 2 is in the making. Am I missing something here that everyone else seems to enjoy? And, to say that this is one of the films that give people a reason to watch movies coming from the South, as quoted in a blog and recommended to me, is just too much.Just how many times have we seen a child wronged at childhood to grow up with vengeance against the rich and the powerful as mighty as Sri Rama himself to be a Robin Hood to the poor? How many times have we seen unknowns infiltrating into gangs just to disintegrate the whole setup from within? Think Nayagan, Thalapathi and the umpteen Bollywood and Kollywood productions. Even the hero's nickname in the film is not original. I remember Sanjay Dutt calling himself as 'Rocky', a scrambler wielding kid-wonder who was able to achieve the unimaginable in an 80's crowd-pleasing matinee.The film narrates how a cartel enslaved people in a gold mine to extract the precious metal in secrecy in cahoots with the politicians. Even though it is made to appear that gold is smuggled from overseas, it was mined locally in a clandestine manner. Everybody wants to have a stronghold in its control, even gangsters from abroad. To get this message across, viewers have to endure senseless violence, ruthless decapitation, gravity-defying stunts and larger-than-life pyrotechnic display. Again and again, there are repeated scenes of the macho hero walking away, leaving behind a trail of a destructive cloud of explosions and cadaver.What spurred my interest while watching the movie was the fascination of man to gold. History of gold is as old as the modern history of mankind. It had been a fascination with Man for ages. The destruction of Aztec, as well as many of the advanced civilisations in the Americas, were solely because of gold. Rappage of India by Muslim invaders and 'traders' from the West was also due to this precious metal.It is said the temples of India in ancient times were so rich with gold that they could finance many of its international naval expeditions as well as create a conducive environment for research on science, mathematics and Nature. Its wealth became its very downfall as it also drew many barbaric tribes. The gold stock had to be locked away in underground vaults only which were only to be lost in the annals of history.The Indian diaspora has always looked at gold as their fixed deposits. In times of needs, jewellery is still there for the rescue. No need laborious credit application and credit ratings. The friendly pawnshop owners are always willing to take your piece at low-interest rates. Gold will go a long way.In one of the numerous Youtube presentations that I received recently, an economist was suggesting that perhaps with the amount of gold lying around in India, it could be used as leverage to secure loans for small businesses. Now that there is talk some countries are trying to put gold back as the golden standard as the value of currency instead of the Greenback, this could be a good option. With the colossal amount of gold lying around in India, this could be an exciting thing for the even big players to look into. But then, nobody is going to be so open to display their hidden treasures in public. It may attract the attention of the wrong kind. of thieves and legal pilferers from the internal revenue service. These significant changes require political will but the powers that be are quite content with the status quo. Many third-world leaders have parked their assets in foreign lands. Do they really care what becomes of the country they lead?",

It has been said, this movie got similar kind of response like Bahubali, in terms of action, strong script writing, character's acting. There's no doubt about it, that the movie has amalgamation of emotions and actions which works simultaneously from scene to scene. This kind of mixture, you won't see in Bahubali. Director,writer #PrashanthNeel, did an exceptional job which reflects his creativity, understanding of cinema very clearly. This is the USP of this movie, background score was icing on cake. On acting side,I 'm a bit differ, I can't imagine Bahubali without Prabhas, I don't think so any actor can portray the role with so much intense and conviction. In KGF, I can say #Yash can be replaced, his acting was also good but in some scenes his acting is not justifying to the character. As a rebel, doing action he's good, but as a wannabe lover he's ok but not apar (eg. in traffic scene, car driver scene). #SrinidhiShetty, as a heroine of the movie, I didn't see her performance according to her character, her role should be done by Illena /Tammanah, /CatherineTresa. Even the song, \"Gali Gali mei first hai\"- #MouniRoy got more attention as compared to Srinidhi. In this movie there's no known face of antagonist, but in KGF:Chapter2, we will be seeing #SanjayDutt as Adheera. Watch this movie for screen play and script, with exceptionally strong storyline.\nIt is 8 on 10.",

Her upbringing,teaching through her struggles shines throughout the movie especially in the climax. Some dialogue might come across as cringy but many strike a chord with viewers heart one such as mother are the strongest warrior. The cinematography is top rate and action in the second half especially in the last 30-40 mins forces you to draw parallel with Baahubali.\nAnd screenplay is written in such a way that keeps the viewers hooked with the growth of Rocky from streets of Bombay to the fields of KGF.The songs are alright. Rest of the Cast have done good job in the acting department. But the star of the show is Yash.KGF Chapter-1 unapologetically delivers what it set to achieve but it makes the viewers gasping for more of the drama.",

But I'm a good guy because I can 1v500 and no bullets can hit me. I kill a lot of people but who cares?

It uses its cinematic tricks to make a clich\u00e9d film which is committed to its hero wholeheartedly, but it is an achievement, because it tells a strong underdog narrative with a dark, gorey, meaty undertone. The film has been scripted in an entertaining way, and nothing feels dragged. Its a strong film which uses its strength to make an ultimate crowd-pleaser with vintage vibes. It is also a visually stunning film which has a good pace. But above anything, it works as a massive improvement over any entertaining mass film- since it is a larger-than-life depiction of slavery in times when there are not many movies showing this in Bollywood.",

            "review_title": "A well crafted cinema but not cult.",
            "content": "So I went to see this movie on the recommendation of one of my moviegoer colleague. I had earlier watched the trailer and it was indeed promising .\nI have learnt something after watching this kannada movie .\nI used to have this thinking that why in Oscar's among several others categories, there are these two categories , One is for \"Best director\" and another one is for \" Best movie\". Isn't it right to think that best director will obviously direct the best movie. So I used to think like when one category is enough why they are having two ?\nPreviously ,in Oscars ,Some times both the awards have been awarded to the same movie , sometimes not.\nFor example in 2017 Oscars , moonlight was the \"Best movie \" but for the best director award, it was given to Damien chazelle for la la land.\nObviously I was wrong to think like that.\nI had this confusion but never tried to solve this problem but KGF did this for me.\nIn short KGF made me understand why we need two different category and not one, that KGF can be nominated in the category for the best direction and has the ability to win it too but the same can't be said if it is to be nominated in the category of\" the best movie \"\nQuestion is why?\nKGF is a very well crafted movie but it's not the Gangs of Vasseypur which is considered as a cult , Where director took completely different narrative line to tell a story which never has been adopted before. The characters we saw , were never seen before.The same goes with \"Tumbaad\" & \"Andhadhun\" . The directors of these movies , have no references to follow from where they can take inspiration. These movies are very much original while KGF took heavy inspirations from other movies, like it took from 300 in terms of color and texture.\nKGF has a decent storyline which has been pictured very well that means editor has done his job superbly. Cinematography is outstanding. You will find great contrast, in fact in every scene. Black is like a new character in this movie. It will force your mind to concentrate on the characters . With a budget value of 80 crore, production value is top notch(Here it is appropriate to mention that gangs of vasseypur 's budget was 9 crore).It never feels for a bit that this is a regional cinema. Dialogues are well written. Infact some lines are very impressive. Background score is appropriate for a movie like this ,upto some degree feels like inspired from bahubali but not copied.\nSo where is this movie lagging? It will be harsh to judge this movie while comparing with world class cinema. We have to remember that this is a regional cinema. Where budget is generally tight. So you have to pour some commercial aspects too into the movie. Cause , at the end of the day money matters. Though, having so much good ingredients like story, camera work and production valve but it feels like we are watching a regular masala telugu cinema at some point where everybody's moto is to praise and worship the hero throughout the movie,where He can able to kill thousands of people with his bare hands only and not a single bullet will touch him. You will think when hero can be shot down with a gun from distance then why so many goons try to kill the hero with same old sword and knife. Again it should not be forgotten that these things have been done deliberately for mass purposes.\nIf you can put behind these things which I think you should, you will able to appreciate the movie which you must.\nThis is the 2nd picture of Prashanth Neel,(courtesy to IMDB) first one was Urgaam. When you will see urgaam you will start to feel the commonality between the lead characters of these movies. It seems what he had not able to achieve in urgaam , is trying to achieve here.\nI will give 7.5 /10 solely for director's vision and execution of this project. A well crafted movie but not extraordinary or cult.",

The story has the character of Rocky well justified. This when viewed through the story aspect, the character justification and \"uniqueness\" moments makes it good. No parts make us feel that the character is doing what he was not supposed to do or like its not what his character does. The blend is good when it comes to be an epic of a villainy oriented film yet shining with well character moments of the goodness and natural hunger.2. I like the film because of the quite unique and unseen ( in our parts at least) color grading and cinematography presentation of the film. Bhuvan Gowda stands high in this field of expertise.3. I don't rate the BGM. It fits this genre and to this movie excellently. Songs have memorable rhythms and sounding. Good work.4. As an audience, Yes intense story telling, u need to keep your cerebrum working high. Promising. I hope KGF 2 too will have good story extension, experience and experience.5. Need to agree that this is truly a character based film or an epic based on him. And it mainly shows the unjust in the gold mine seen through his hunger eyes makes him more prominent. The confidence, hunger, qualities shown at some instances is what actually BUILDS EMOTION FOR HIM/for the epic. The action, style just adds to it, but it also serves as the main dish for those cinema people who have toned their tongue to extreme mass movies.What I did feel was useless - nothing prominent this time, fits good under its niche.",

In most of the movies, most of the best scenes are shown up in trailer to make it interesting and when movie is watched we see those are the only scenes that are good in the whole movie. KGF does not get into this category at all.\nThroughout the movie something is constantly happening and viewer is constantly hooked up to screen in trying to find out whats happening next. Kudos goes to the director who has also written story and screenplay where the screenplay is so gripping and engaging and the direction is just awesome!!\nNext key aspects for the movie are cinematography, background music and art direction. The visuals are just stunning throughout the movie especially the shots in dark light. Background score is just superb and engages the viewer very well the with story. And surely the mining set is just awesome.\nLast but not the least is 'Rocky Bhai' Yash. He just looks awesome on the screen!!\nThe whole movie which is more than 2.5 hours seemed like it completed in no time at all and the climax was totally unexpected and the movie has stopped at a perfect stage setting for next chapter.\nEagerly waiting for Chapter 2!!",

If you looking for a toy then go to a toystore, not a grossary store..)Story-\nA Journalist and her team takes an Interview of a Retire Journalist about his book which Government has banned for some reason. As the story Continues it unfolds the mystery behind Narachi Limestone Co-op and Kolar Gold Fields.Review-\nAs personal experience this film comes out as a Mass Hit. There are some regular elements that we have seen in several film in kannada films. But what makes this one unque, is the direction, screenplay, story and how can we forget the Baground Music which takes it to another level. The first half seems as a long running introduction period and information comes like rain. But at the 2nd half it change the whole scenario. Certainly everything makes sense. The action taken by the characters, character dynamics, Atmosphere, themes everything. It starts to redefine the Mass-Class. At the end where it takes a major\nPick. Yes, it is damn risky but the makers takes it. Also it works. Apart from these, all actors gave their best.

            "content": "Rocky, born to a hindu mother, has no external signs of being a hindu, but as a boy wears a 'taweez', and is later addressed as 'sultan' and 'bhai', all of which are 'peaceful' style. The head of the hindu family running the hyper exploitative gold mine enslaving thousands of poor villagers, is hindu, but is bedridden and weak, and could not be glorified in any manner. The oppressed villagers enslaved in the gold mine, are all dhoti wearing people, never a skull-cap wearing 'peaceful', and never once has a 'peaceful' gold-digger shown in a vulnerable/weak position. Rocky never once shows his hindu identity. In the beginning of the film the never-ending done-to-death-cliche voice-over tutors us that as he needed a brand name, he changed his original hindu name to 'Rocky'. So convenient! One wonders why 'Rocky bhai', 'Salam Rocky bhai', both of which are 'peaceful' style lingo. The worst is when the festival of hindu kali godess, worshipped by the exploitative hindu gangster family, is shown to indulge in human sacrifice, and during the festival Rocky comes from under the water to slay the hindu son of the late Godfather.No one talks about Islamic jihad in India, and the slow never-ending genocide of hindus by the jihadis, and instead Bolly makes films showing hindus as oppressive and exploitative, obviously trying to counter the real-life filthiness of the jihadi religion atleast in films by showing hindus in bad light, and also to create a narrative that hindus are like their representation in the jihadi-funded films.KGF also does the same, as has been the lifelong project of Salim & Javed chichas, junky Nasirudeen, and the pigmy khans.KGF is a third-rate film, with zero artistic value, with a non-stop supply of done-to-death cliches, and its success signals the death of art in cinema, and the dead-and buried aesthetic sense of the audience,their hearts and minds destroyed by item numbers,innuendo and glorified violence and gory revenge-tales. The protagonist's interview revealed his sad lack of depth about art and politics. The films has made tons of money, but it is just sad, really heart-breakingly sad for cinema. One wonders how long we'll have to tolerate cheap copies of 500-year-old third-rate film-cliches, until real individuality breaks through, and minimalism and simplicity returns to empower us.",

I wouldn't mind it as the Director is not trying for an Oscar nomination here and its required for a great showdown.\nBut does it put the audience off may be may be a little bit. And as you think you are losing interest there comes a scene which will hold you back and believe me this will happen on more than one occasion.As you pass through the first half with some entertainment, some emotions and of course a little bit patience take a break and get ready to enter \"Kolar Gold Fields\" and the pure technical brilliance of the entire\nteam of \"KGF\".Start the second half the Director will take you on a Joy Ride have fun and you'll come out of the theater Satisfied.There are moments you feel perhaps you should spend some more quality time with your mother(The Ultimate Warrior).High octane background score, Very good cinematography and finally good editing, screenplay and Direction.\nAll the actors have done justice to the role given to them.The climax is something I could guess moments before as by now I was already in awe of the Director's caliber and moment has come for Prashant Neel to showcase his touch of brilliance.So Chapter 1 has been concluded at the right moment and the stage is set for a mega finale in Chapter 2 with all the threads open.I hope Prashant Neel will weave them efficiently and not disappoint because a lot of people by now are waiting for Chapter 2 including me.",

I regret not watching Bahubali at movie theatre in past, So I didn't want to repeat that mistake again. Also the word of mouth were very positive for the movie, So I decided to go there. I reached ten minutes late , Even after a week and constant availability of movie tickets the theatre was well Crowded. The movie was as expected . Typical south Indian movie in terms of physics. I always like the energy and storytelling of South Indian movies rather than actual physical action which audience cheers.\nThe story was well engaging , full of energy , some of the best cinematography I would say. But still I would say it was too much. For example the introductory scene where he fights everyone despite being chained or the scene where he pour over petrol in the bar and enjoy a cigarette, RIP Physics because in reality if someone even try to lit cigarette from a distance in that kind of condition he/she will get burn alive because petrol is volatile.

Hats off to the people who worked in the movie.This movie showcases the talent in Kannada industry. Its not always the hero that matters. Check this movie for direction, screenplay, background music, artistic sets, dialogue writing, the physique and body language of villains, acting skills of each and every character and the hardwork of thousands of backstage workers. Finally a fair share of credit to Yash for this mannerism and attitude filled heroism. Great respect to all he people associated with the movie.A movie that has sets and not VFX. A movie that took 3 years in the making. A budget of 85 crores which looks better than big banner 200cr Bollywood movies. There is nothing in one name, it all has to do with story and movie making skills.Its a new India today. Just having a big name will not win hearts for a hero. It has to be a strong story and skillset of people behind the screens.A must watch movie and definitely a movie thats worth your time!I am set to see this movie multiple times, WHAT ABOUT YOU?",

The movie plot is highly inspired by Mad Max 2 (1982). Just like Mel Gibson in Mad Max 2, Yash does not show more variations (intentionally as the story demands) in the expression meaning you can see hardly any change of expression through out the movie. Whether it's an extraction of gasoline or gold mining, you can relate this movie with Mad Max 2 (aka Road Warrior), be it in taking and long shots. Director has intelligently taken the KGF concept to make look authentic, viewers would not think of waste land, Lord Humungus and other similar character that you see in the Australian flick. Choosing of location, instead of VFX was a brilliant idea. Narration of gold value getting higher can reveal the plot being inspired by MM, if you have watched MM series. The story is more focused around hero which could have been trimmed to include more story building as you get bored of Yash. Overall, the movie keeps engaged with the introductions of more and more characters which keeps you bored through out first half. Second half goes steadily which gives you a breather to get involved in the story. Waiting for the sequel anyways for the rest of the predictable plot. Over hyped made this movie a huge Kannada hit else waste of time with head ache",

No interruptions in the name of songs, no loose talks, no time frame in the movie is supposed to be lost, else you might lose the connectivity. The action scenes, selection of place, set creation, BGM all are too mainstream. I personally thank all technicians and non-technicians behind this mega project.

They seem to be well fitted u like other movies where they try to force dialogues. Direction and DOP is outstanding. One scene where they shot a fight sequence with just matchbox fire as lighting is amazing.I felt I need to watch once more to relive whole movie.

It deserves 2-3/10 but i am just giving it a bit more because the dialogues felt a little powerful and the direction was average, but no portrayal of emotions by the action, it's just the volume of his voice which tells you whether he is raged or calm!!!! Total wastage of time and moreover now a days this type of movie has been influencing murders in the society because kids are just fascinated by the title of becoming a 'goon', like what the hell??!!! Not the worst movie ever but still not worth watching because if the creators wanted, they could have just made a 30-40 minutes short film on it, they just elongated it tooooo much, just another overhyped movie from the south indian cinema.",

He is the man of words.The DoP Bhuwan Gowda is just wow what a breath taking visuals (an idea just using match stick is brilliant) , BGM's from Ravi Basrur was increasing the pulse rates with the Mesmerising background songs from Ananya Bhat in BGMs synced the story lines perfectly, every actors in the movie had a story to tell about, surprisingly hero doesn't have many Dialogues in this movie, but for the rests the gripping Dialogues with indepth meanings touched everyone's heart. Don't know who decided to have Ananth Nag sir for Story Narration stunningly he is Irreplaceable and listening to his voice is awful. Take a bow editing team your hard work pays off. The character Garuda made his position strong as villain predominantly for upcoming movies. The Art work especially KGF shot location was complete plus to visuals, and last but not least the performance from #Yash is spell bound with his characterisation, Although there is extreme heroism in few cuts but story demands such elevation and required to hold the audience pulse for the screen play.Make up your mind few scenes shall never be missed while watching, when a mentally ill person narrates fiction story, when Ananth nag completes malavika's poetry, Mother Dialogues, Never ever miss voice overs.Finally the climax with nerve wrecking performances from every small character artists with brilliant taking was astonishing, the way scenes took the fast pace and the way it was portrayed with different narrations is amazing, If you blink you miss the link.As concluded in Chapter 1 the Story of the movie is just started, but where it leads to the end script we have to wait for Chapter 2. One question will haunt viewers for Chapter 2 would be how 'Adheera' character is still alive?.#KGFReview #KGFTechnicalReview",

            "content": "Kannada audience hail this as the baahubali of kannada cinema. Sadly it is not. Kannada audience are only praising this filmand giving it high ratings out of loyalty while overlooking all the flaws. This is a decent attempt at a big scale kannada film but fails narratively almost consistently. Alot of scenes don't have proper logic and don't make sense. The herione subplot is so tasteless and inconsequential to the plot, as well as the hero characters behaviour around her, it is actually embarrassing and cringe worthy. There are some good scenes in the first half but only a few. Second half also has a few decent scenes. The whole movie has excessive scenes of characters hero worshiping. It almost seems as if the director or writer didn't have enough content to pad the film out. Probably about 30 minutes of the film is just some side characters talking about some myths of a hero on an epic scale and how he will come one day and save people. All of that crap becomes so repetitive and just seems like window dressing for an excessively long film.\nAbout Yash: this is my first film seeing him in a movie. Seems like an okay actor but I don't think he can carry a film on this level. Most of the film is basically set up for hero worship and he just doesn't have a big enough of a screen presence to warrant all of that. A lot of the scenes with him just have him staring blankly mouthing some lines with raging background music without any real emotion coming out. It's actually quite unfortunate to watch the actor emote so little in this day and age considering the times and scale of the project.\nThere are also way too many characters coming in and out of scenes, too much to keep track of, especially if you're not familiar with the Kannada from industry. It becomes confusing and it doesn't help that in the second half all of the villains look the same. It's a problem to the point where it becomes annoying and confusing and it really becomes serious negative for the film in the second half in terms of engaging with the story on any level.\nOne real positive I can say is the cinematography. The production team really strived for a big scale but to compare this to baahubali is just a disservice to this film because anyone looking to this film to get their baahubali fix will be disappointed. I had to drive an hour from home and pay $20 for ticket so all I can say in the end as an outsider from the kannada film industry is that this was disappointing but has merits.",

            "content": "What's Passion? To work or put efforts on something repeatedly until you get it absolutely right, which one loves and holds close to the heart without getting distracted even for a second. In one of the interviews Prashant Neel, the Director had said that he has watched KGF more than 150 times while editing. He wanted to make his KGF, a near perfect craft. While shooting, Bhuvan Gowda, the cinematographer used to carry around 40kgs of the camera and its accessories on top while canning the sequences in windy and dusty region. The gigantic sets used to come down crashing after heavy wind and rains yet the Art Director, Shivakumar used to go back in erecting the same sets as they stood earlier. Yash, used to give multiple retakes with no sign of fatigue or feeling bored in that dust bowl.KGF will be made in two chapters. The chapter 1 is out and at the outset, it traces with pre-historical chronology world of events letting the audience know the importance of owning Gold and the battles for it. The chapter 1 deals with micro level of unorganized crime, Mafia and underworld. The Chapter 1 depicts about the greed and the race for one-up man-ship within many characters in getting the control of Goldmine, KGF. To enter into the Macro level of an orbit of world crime syndicate, one has to clear his way at the micro level. The dirt has to be cleaned to make way to the top. The chapter 1 ends at the doorstep of Chapter 2, which is meant to open for the Triangular battle between International mafia (for Gold), The interruption of India's Govt and Rocky (who valorously emerges out of KGF slavery, as a Messiah)The film is narrated through the author's (Played by Anantnag) First hand experience to a News Editor (Played by Malvika Avinash) As his book gets banned by the Central Govt. He traces the journey of rocky from his birth to establishing himself as the feared crime lord from Mumbai docks to Bangalore to finally his destined place KGF. The mother sentiment is well crafted and placed appropriately throughout the film. Though the story line is predictable and replicates Ugramm template. In KGF also just like Ugramm, many characters get introduced and thus challenges one's memory to remember the count of characters. Yash's introduction in an elaborated action sequence keeps everyone engaged and makes glued to the screen. KGF falters at few places in the first half. Yash-Srinidhi scenes could have been better. The army of supporting characters may be revealed more in the Chapter 2. It's the second half, which meets the expectation and ends with retaliating climax, leaving multiple threads open only to be tied later in Chapter 2 on another day.KGF, from start to finish, is full of high octane action sequences, The dialogues are sharp and effective, Music is average, but gets compensated through an outrageous BGM (some influence from the soundtrack of Hams Zimmer's \"The Oil\"(Dunkirk).On Technical front: The captain of KGF mines, Prashant Neel, the Director should take a bow for bringing his vision on screen. Editing is very sharp, multiple scenes are played parallel and also intellectually blurred at few places to showcase that the character had no idea about the things to come. Ravi Basrur's music is a downer, but his BGM raises the milieu in all the sequences. The cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is top-notch and world class (he will get all the awards if nominated functions PAN India level in 2019). The never say die attitude of Art Director Shivakumar should get all the accolades for erecting such massive sets of mines, in the midst of the dust bowls. KGF has used 90% of sets and just 10% of VFX for filming. KGF- Chapter 1 sets the stage for a macro-level showdown in chapter 2.",

It takes you to places, ot takes you through emotions but more importantly it takes you to a vast new level of inspiration. Bahubali was overrated, it lacked a lot of key ingredients which KGF creates from raw. This is no Hollywood. This is what Indian cinema should have been about all together.

Dialogue delivery is too good. Lyrics, songs and bgm takes u to different place all together.Screenplay could have been a bit slower in the first half. Narration was too polished for the subject of the film - meaning, mafia and Don stories r expected to be narrated in more slangish way rather than more pure kannada words. This the same case in all Prashanth Neel movies including Ugramm. But, not a big deal. Movie still keeps the viewers fixated.Overall a great movie and a good step to KFI to move forward.",

            "content": "A decade ago, the Kannada film industry was striving hard to make quality films to join the race with other South Indian films for a Pan India recognition. People who follow KGF from Part 1 have a huge expectation for this sequel and Director didn't disappoint the fans in Chapter 2. Quite a lot of detailing went into the script to bring out the true essence of KGF from Chapter one.Prashanth Neel will surely join the list of top directors in India. He deserves all praise and applause for his great work in the film. The storyline is quite simple but the way it was written and narrated makes the film stand out from other commercial films. The inclusion of Adheera and Ramika Sen adds value to the script.In my opinion, KGF Chapter 2 is one of the best commercial films made in Non-Linear format. The film travels back and forth with some interesting twists and turns to unfold the remaining story. Prasanth Neel outlined and sketched all the vital characters with a purpose. The theme of KGF is to glorify the heroic acts of Rocky Bhai but at the same time, each build-up sequence is carefully coined with emotional value. The audience erupts in theatres for all game-changing moments.Yash again proves that he is the best in business to perform a powerful role like Rocky. His screen presence with a rugged beard look and fearless attitude is precise for the build-up scenes. The introduction scene of Rocky in Chapter 2 is a treat to watch. The climax encounter with Adheera gives an adrenaline rush to the audience. There are quite a lot of goosebumps moments in the film and the best among all is the Police Station gunshot scene.Srinidhi Shetty plays a less impactful female lead but towards the end, she performed well to an extent. Sanjay Dutta as Adheera gets a stunning introduction but his role was sidelined in the middle portion of the film as Raveena share the screen as Ramika Sen. All the supporting characters are connected well in the plot. Prakash Raj takes the role of Anant Nag as narrator but it was not engaging as it was in Chapter one.",

If we ignore some of the exaggerated action scenes which are usually there in South Indian movies, it is perfect. Yash has definitely done a remarkable role as Rocky.\nThe downsides, however are that there are a lot of unnecessary scenes, which causes the viewer to disconnect from the movie. Now, it wouldn't have been much of a problem, but the fact that the main story itself is so extremely long, the movie could have been explained much better if some of those non essential scenes didn't make it to the final cut.\nThis, along with some more smaller issues, makes the story haphazard sometimes, and leads to getting the viewer confused as to what is actually going on.",

Some scenes in the mines reminded of Zach Snyder's watchmen with slow motion and detailed close up shots. Yash has a strong screen presence with his zero ducks given attitude. Although, some scenes made me really uncomfortable as they are gruesome and the background music makes it more intense. Definitely not to be watched with minors. But they can be forgiven as the story is gripping and you'll be completely immersed in massive sets, mesmerizing cinematography and breathtaking action sequences.On the side note, protagonists love interest has very little role to play, but the woman who has played mothers character makes you thank your mom once you reach back home after the movie.

But Rocky just nails it when he opens his mouth.. one liners with a lot of mass in it. The short and eye straining edits is the only drawbacks for audience seated in the front rows. But the movie delivers it's message and also has a few bits that will directly connect you to CHAPTER 2, a few people feel this was useless or had no relevance in the movie. This brigdes the narration to chapter to and can't just wait to watch CHAPTER 2. this piece of art is filled with moments tat will take you off the edge of your seat and give goosebumps every now and then. The movie has the right ingredients with sentiments, narration, flashback, action and a bit of love life.

            "content": "KGF Chapter 1 ( Kannada) Review :\nArguably one of the best in class Kannada movies released in recent times . This movie is no less than epic . It is high octane action saga movie . The genre of the movie is low level fantasy .\nPositives :\n1. Yash's brilliant acting and screen presence . He holds the aperture of the entire film with his massy and classy acting as Rocky Bhai . The film has many heroes . Each one of them adds their own dimension to the movie. Anant Nag's powerful narrative was integral in taking the story forward and setting the stage for KGF Chapter 2.\n2. Every Antagonist in the film has created their own powerful aura of fear in the hearts of the audience and the Hero.\n3. Prashant Neel has worked a lot on the script of the movie . The screenplay is so good that you can't take your attention away from the screen. I really like the the motherly emotions in the movie. The dialogues in the movie resonate in your mind even after you leave the theater.\n4. Ravi Basrur's music and background score takes the movie whole new level . The film has only two songs . It's very much beneficial in the case of the movie like KGF . The french orchestra in the song \" Garbadhi \" is a magical wonder .\n5. Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography has literally made every frame of the movie look like a Hollywood movie . He is no less than a magical behind the lens .\n6 . Art Director Shivakumar left no stone unturned in the detailing of the movie . The movie takes us back in time to late 70s . The set work especially in the mines is of a whole new level . I really like the Kaali Jaatre Set .\n7. The Editor's crisp edits and the fast moving transition always managed to keep my attention on screen.\n8. The top notch production value of the movie .\nNegatives:\n1. The lag in the first half.\n2. Very less screen presence for the heroine Srinidhi Shetty.\n3. This film was more suited for the youth , action film lovers and not for the family audience.\n4. I personally feel that the item song could have been avoided .\nFinal verdict :\nThis film is the pride of KFI. KGF has set the benchmark for the the Kannada film industry .My rating for the movie : 4/5.",

            "content": "Right off the hook, I can see the appeal of this film - it has incredible cinematography, a stellar cast and a killer soundtrack. Shots were crisp and tasteful, Yash's performance was wonderful and the soundtrack just elevated the film to a whole new level.\nHowever, all this hardwork was almost undercut/undone by the use of the \"classic\" South Indian film tropes, like random romance and overglorification of a male lead. The romance felt completely unnecessary and made zero impact to the plot (the plot would be same w/o it); it was a lazy portrayal of the romanticised stalking people call love on the silver screen but elevated to another level. The glorification of Yash's character was over the top as well and in my opinion kinda ruined the movie as a whole considering the movie is clearly targeted at a more mature audience and not 5-year olds. This also impacted editing of the film, which was generally a little frantic but was even more so during those 'glorification' moments. Some really beautiful shots were present but as they say 'too many cooks spoil the broth'.\nThe film industry is clearly evolving as the quality and style of direction is beginning to change but KGF gets held back by those cliche tropes in this case. I'm personally willing to forgive that as change doesnt happen overnight (these tropes have been present in South Indian cinema for decades) and KGF makes for a wonderful watch regardless. Look forward for chapter 2 :D",

            "review_title": "Jewel of a Kannada movie",
            "content": "It is the story of ambitious Rocky's partial journey towards power and riches. The story is told in a non linear format which travels to and fro between 1951 to 2018. The film wastes no time and picks up steam from the word go. The first half episodes build the character of Rocky and establishes him has a powerful maverick don. It breezes to the interval with its share of cliche punchlines, multiple hero elevations, goose bumps and item song i.e. Typical commercial format story telling but with lots of style and swag.It is in the second half when Rocky enters the Dark Dangerous world of KGF the film further elevates and transforms into cinematic glory of epic proportions. Director Prashant transports us into a total different world of slaves, atrocities and marauding army of warlords. The visuals are of world standards and some scenes leave you spell bound. The film ends with a twist and leaves you yearning for the part 2.The movie is Karnataka's contribution to the pan India audience and director Prashanth leaves no stone unturned in making it a master piece. His vision has been told with utmost conviction and clarity. This movie sets a precedent for the upcoming Kannada movies and new local talents to dream big. Prashant's screenplay and multi layered story telling keeps you engaged without a moment of dullness in the movie. I liked the way he has inserted Rocky's mother episodes throughout the movie. You can easily call him Kannada's Rajamouli.Yash as Rocky gets into the skin of the role with ease. He is the principal character and is present in 80% of the movie. He sets the screen on fire with his blazing screen presence, dialogues, fights and style. I would say this is his career best performance til date. Shreenidhi looks fresh but very little role to offer. The kid who acted as junior rocky and the mother role are fantastic. There is a long list of new villains who all perform well and are presented effectively, special mention to guy who played Garuda character. Anant nag as a narrator is adept. Should say the entire casting is perfect.All technical departments have done their part with finesse to enhance the movie to another level. Cinematography by Bhuvan, artwork by Shivu, BGM by Ravi Basrur and costume designing are exceptional. The sets are huge and CG extensions look very realistic and of great quality. Brilliant colour grading gives that extra feel to connect to that period and geography. Editing in certain fight scenes were a little cluttered but overall good.Hats off to the producer for his guts.Though the movie has its minor flaws in some places it is nullified by the fast pace and engaging story telling.Overall a fabulous movie to be watched only in theatres. If you watch it online or on television the essence and feel will be lost. A film not to be missed at all. I watched it in Kannada. Options available in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.# Supreetth.",

            "review_title": "Best south indian movie",
            "content": "It is the best movie in South India KGF Chapter 1 might be an astonishing wonder for one section of film-goers who haven't yet been exposed to world cinema. But, honestly, it is little beyond an overstretched exercise in hailing the protagonist as invincible. The problem with films that have invincible heroes is that none of the challenges that the screenplay poses turns out to be engaging enough. This, in turn, makes K. G. F Chapter 1 a less than exciting experience.Prashant Neel has packaged the film with all necessary massy ingredients: there are slow-motion intro sequences, exquisitely staged yet pointless fights, and excessive hype created around the protagonist's indomitable aura. There are a bunch of scenes that try to reinstate the fact that Rocky (Yash) is unbeatable. It's clear from the very first scene that he's in. Yet, the director chooses to drive the point home over and over again. The dialogues too are some of the campiest I've heard in recent times. It's like no one in the film speaks normally. Everyone speaks as if they've been preparing their cheese-filled quotes/monologues for years, just waiting to spit them out at first given instance.Character-building is one area that the film lacks terribly in. We have more than a dozen (main) characters being introduced but none of them (and I repeat, none of them) are well-fleshed out. Even Rocky's childhood is just a collection of massy moments: he is pushed to the limit; his mom utters philosophical nonsense, and the next thing you see, he's beating people up in a jiffy. When Rocky grows older, he beats even more people up. Basically, the film uses the tired formula of one-man-against-many to build hype around the character of Rocky. This is something good old Shankar tried more than a decade ago and emerged a winner at. Prashant Neel attempts the same; he's supported greatly by his cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda (who assigns splendid colours to frames, often giving it a neo-noir touch), composer Ravi Basrur (the songs are bathroom-breaks but the background score was pretty epic), and the fine-looking production values (the set designs are elaborate).Where Neel lacks in the screenplay, he tries to compensate with cinematic gimmicks. The heroine, unfortunately, is a mere prop. She shows up in a couple of scenes (and a song) that do nothing but stretch the film's first half. In a film such as this, it would be criminal to even consider a well-written role for the heroine. In fact, the protagonist's mom (who appears in flashbacks) and a struggling pregnant mother at the gold mine receive better treatment than the heroine. Well, here's hoping she has something more to do in the sequel.The villains? I like how Prashant Neel tried to bring to the forefront not one, but a whole array of them. However, none of them manages to leave an impression. At the end of the day, they're just brawny halfwits who are not worthy of even tying the hero's shoelaces. K. G. F Chapter 1 certainly has a better second half (once the film shifts to the gold mine), though that it isn't saying much. I wish the director spent less time trying to write scenes glorifying Rocky and instead, focused on telling a more compelling story with well-rounded characters.I agree that a gangster movie needs its share of crowd-pleasing moments and even then, K. G. F Chapter 1 isn't a lot beyond an overly indulgent star vehicle. I'm not exactly sure if it's the packaging that impressed audiences or the frequent massy reminders; it definitely isn't the screenplay. Yash sleepwalks through the role of Rocky - one which thankfully doesn't require the greatest acting capabilities. This may be a benchmark for the Kannada film industry, but it's high time they realize they're still way behind when it comes to quality content and story-telling, because well, a brilliant technical crew can only do so much to elevate a mediocre screenplay. I hope to.",

A great script and the direction,drives me to watch and appreciate a movie. I am movie buff someone who goes deepinto storytelling. I don't watch because of a hero or particular any person in the movie.At first, I was excited about #KGF,by seeing the trailer thinking it's worth a watch. Since the time the movie got released, I wanted to go watch it asap before the reviews are out but due to other commitments and high demand (houseful shows) couldn't get to see before the word was out. Looking at craze of word of mouth, my curiosity and desire to watch the movie tripled. By now, I knew the names of the characters and slight guess on plot (thanks to instagram memes)\nI went in with high expectations thinking what could b in here that's pulling all this crowd? \ud83e\udd14\nFirst half of the movie was the glorification of Rocky bhai. Fights and fights ...too massy meaty.. Felt like walked into another typical Kannada movie it's all about punch dialogues and exaggeration of the hero and his heroism. But still dint wanted to be disappointed. I had taken my kid along who was getting scared for the heavy backscore on every punch and fall. Holding her all through first half, I was waiting to hit the interval and kinda of given up on the movie\ud83d\ude2c... Thinking what did people like in this\ud83d\ude10After watching first half,Since I knew the names of characters I guessed my own plot. My early high expectations and eventually being slightly disappointed and with managing scared kid all through... started to feel the pain (body ache) of holding my kid...Post Interval- EL DORADO \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\nActual movie had arrived!! Got hooked to my seat.Blown away by the cinematic experience. Narration, cinematography, backscore, heroism etc etc... I was so much into the plot that I felt like one of them who is seeking help from Rocky bhai...The body ache due to holding my scared kid had vanished....I din't wanted to leave the hall\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb... had to pinch myself to see if it was real, it's a kannada movie that I watched. First half made sense on seeing the second half of interval. Why the glorification\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude07\nRightly said it's no less than hollywood movie... hardwork of 3yrs is evident..A Avatar of Kannada industry!! Proud to say Kannada movie making has arrived beyond glorification of heroes \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb waiting to experience #KGF2 Great work team #KGF ...

You simply can't ignore the terrific hard work that must've gone into bringing out the bold vision of its creator into reality. The movie is not without flaws, but if flaws can make humans interesting, then same holds true for a movie too. It feels like a glorious mix of amateurish brazenness and insanely professional level craftsmanship. The passion of its creator is palpable in every scene and every frame. It is bold, boisterous, audacious, thunderstorm of a movie.If you can ignore some minor issues and immerse yourself into the story, you'll find yourself thoroughly surprised and totally drenched in its magnificence. The music, the BGS, the cinematography, the script, the editing, the pace... oh my god the pace... you better bring all your neurons here as the film will overwhelm you soon if you ain't paying attention. I can write heaps of praise just for the audacity to dream something so epic, but I need to save some praise for its leading, ROCKING STAR, YASH!! The man is the most manly man I have seen on screen in a long, long time. I think what he has achieved here can only be compared to the magic of the other ROCKY (Balboa) that we all know. He has lived the character like his life depended on it. Why the hell is he still not the shining icon all over India yet? He himself is the gold we all discovered in KGF, ffs. He deserves every ounce of hype he's getting. He is handsome, sexy af, has eyes that can pierce your soul, expressions that arouse all sorts of emotions, has a face fur that can even melt straight men. He is powerful, complex, a reluctant messiah, the dark knight. He carries this movie with such power I haven't seen anyone do before. The man was born to play Rocky.If you still haven't watched this movie, I envy you because you are in for a heck of a ride. Brace yourself for awesomeness!",

The first half of the movie is a narrative mess, and this is greatly exacerbated by a weak translation. The result is that it's often unclear who the villain is or why we should care.

For this purpose the general chaos and confusion prevailing in Arabia, with which the whole country was in turmoil, has been presented as an argument. Bloodshed, loot and plunder raged on every side. Tribes were subjecting tribes to raids, and no one could have peaceful sleep at night from fear that some enemy tribe might raid his settlement early in the morning. Every Arab was fully conscious of this state of affairs and realised that it was wrong. Although the plundered bemoaned his miserable, helpless state and the plunderer rejoiced, yet when the plunderer himself was plundered, he too realised how wretched was the condition in which the whole nation was involved.Referring to this very state of affairs, it has been said: Unaware of the second life after death and his accountability before God in it, man has become ungrateful to his Lord and Sustainer. He is using the powers and abilities given by God for perpetrating tyranny and pillage; blinded by the love of worldly wealth he tries to obtain it by every means, however impure and filthy, and his own state itself testifies that by abusing the powers bestowed by his Lord, he is being ungrateful to Him. He would never have behaved so, had he known the time when the dead will be raised from the graves, and when the intentions and motives with which he had done all sorts of deeds in the world, will be exposed and brought out before everyone to see. At that time the Lord and Sustainer of men shall be well informed of what one had done and what punishment or reward one deserved.",

I also wanted this KGF movie to be really good and come out of illogical Pattern movies that currently going on, but they followed typical Southern Indian Pattern no difference in this movie.My Review:Pros:\n1. Yash appearance, Style, & Costumes\n2. Dialogues\n3. 2Nd galf was way much better\n4. Good Cinematography\n5. Good Story\n6. Anant Nag Narration\n7. Location was outstanding\n8. Production cost could see throughout the Movie\n9. Villans & side role acting was good\n10. GOOD Music and BGSWhat I didn't like about the Movie: cons1. Over build up of Yash, I felt every seen of Yash is a Introduction throughout the movie.\n2. 1St half was really Bad, looks fast forwarded\nVery Bad Screenplay, we can see inexperience by director very clearly.\n3. Fight scenes are same as usual pattern that there are carrying from last 15yrs are so. This is not a fantasy Movie so should have kept little realistic.\n4. Some camera work in fights & dialogues are too clumsy.\n5. Such a good story didn't build the Strong characters of Yash & Villans at the beginning. Felt some Fantasy commercial display and many things was left under audience assumptions. They could have taken inputs from Movies like \"OM\", \"Antha\" many old Kannada movies where they are very good in building a Hero or Villan character slowly.\n6. If you show Yash can kill 30 or 40 people holding guns while hanging in 1st half then you must carry the same plot in full movie, but in 2nd Half you show him as normal person who needs to plan and kill everyone doesn't add up... Either make it Fantasy or Action, this is a biggest issue in Indian Movies to mix up thing and we end up seeing Fantasy even in Drama Movies....If you see Movies like Company, sholay you can witness each roles character and connect with it... Why do people still remember Gabbar Singh even today, and post watching KGF except Garuda I don't remember anybody else due to its pace.7. Over do of Music, this is another issue in recent Kannada Industry, unnecessary usage of Background music on every occassion which losses it's weightage.\nThe best they could have done was carrying Yash upbringing and how he adoptes to the Underworld role and making contacts could have been as 1st Part and closing scene should have been that he making Entry to KGF and entire concept of KGF should have been a secret to audience as 2nd Part, there they could have had enough time to screenplay each characters and building them....This way we cannot make Kannada industry famous, we require lot to of Improvements. If we just follow Kannada movies of 60s to 90s, they always had a complete movie. Under direction of Puttanna Kanagal etc, they would not compromise on any single point whether it's Music, Direction, Screenplay, Dialogues, Character selection etc...The reason I'm giving 4 Out of 10 only to compensate emotional over rating by others, else this Movie deserves 6.5 Out of 10",

Even the slightest hint of the Main Story is not revealed.\nThe movie actually grips u throughout.\nThe narration is amazing.\nThe last 50 minutes of the movie is a full on guessing game.

And KGF did not disapppoint. A jewel in the crown of Kannada film industry and by far the best Kannada movie over last many decades. (Dr. Rajkumar/Dr Vishnuvardhan movies are not being used as a benchmark here). I hope this gives a shot in the arm to the Kannada film industry which it so desperately requires in catching up to its more far more successful, established and high grossing industry I.e Tamil & Telugu Film industries. I hope that Kannada film makers become bolder in their story script and screenplay choices and get the necessary funding / support from the industry. And for starting this evolution of cinema in the Kannada fraternity, I give this movie a 10/10.Simple Storyuncomplicated scriptsuper screenplay (some might say shabby - to them I say keep up shabby work)awesome fight sequences and ooh /aah momentsYash has done super but can take it up a notch more I feel. #onemanarmycinematography brilliantOverall a well rounded cinema experienceThings can be better\nremove unnecessary fight scenesromance is not necessary in this moviefor god sake - get a shave everyone (just kidding)I am sure the Production team will learn a lot from the critics and responses post the KGF movie release and will bring to us a meaningful end to this two part movie series. Here is wishing all the very best to KGF team.Looking forward to a jaw dropping Chapter 2",

            "content": "KGF Chapter 1! One of the best entertainers ever. Very stylishly made movie. Yash is a treat to watch as the hero. His Screen presence is one of the best for an action movie of this sort. He plays a kind of Spartacus in Karnataka during the 70/80s. The Screenplay is very fast and furious. The story revolves around Yash who is born in the low lands, looses his mother at a very young age and moves on to Mumbai. In Mumbai he becomes a Dons' henchman in style. Later on he is tricked by his rivals into visiting KGF to finish off a formidable villain.The downside of the movie is the many sentiment scenes that are scattered around the movie. Especially there is a lengthy sequence of a story teller narrating a story which tests our patience, because he is telling the story of this movie!. The heroine does not have anything much to do in this film, just like Tamannah Bhatia, who spends a few minutes to dance and entertain us. But she is wasted in such a role.The movie's strength lies in the overall treatment and making of the Visuals. Though a lot of violence is involved, it is the visuals that make this movie a treat to watch. The magnificent presence of Yash is the pinnacle in this kind of story telling. Background score sounds international and adds to the visual treat. The dialogues will be remembered for a long time to come.Yash has scaled new heights with this movie and he may find it difficult to surpass this kind of a powerful role in the near future.Overall this is a movie that is going to be remembered for a long time in Karnataka for all the good reasons.",

Costumes and looks of each n every character is perfect. Screenplay is more of introductory type but does not effect the whole story. Before interval kgf makes us more enthusiastic but after interval for 20 min that enthusiasm gets little down but after that it makes huge jump after a fight sequence which gives goosebumps n we think what will happen next. Overall its a well balanced emotionally visually n very much appealing to audiences movie. 70s n 80s era is perfectly shown",
