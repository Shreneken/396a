This must be the least coherent, most half-arsed, pointless movies I have ever seen in this sharade we call life.

Cinematogrophy: Worst than the first, but better than the second. Nothing to add there. Dialogue: ... let's not go there..All in all, i would give it a 1/10, because it was nice to look at some landscape for time to time. This review is short, because the movie was done short. it was bad from beginning to end, with horrible dialogue, with unstable emotions of both characters.. you get a sense of where this franchise couldve gone and done it right at the very end... but by then it meant nothing. god... I hate the writer who wrote it and I condemn writers like that back to wherever they came from.",

            "content": "'FIFTY SHADES FREED': Zero Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the blockbuster erotic romantic thriller series, based on the three hit books (beginning with 'Fifty Shade of Grey') by E.L. James. In this chapter Ana and Christian are finally getting used to a more stable relationship together, although it's still really kinky and abusive, when a stalker from Ana's past continues to ruin their happiness. The film was directed by James Foley and written by Niall Leonard (the same duo also performed both duties on the last sequel), and Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan once again reprise their starring roles (for the third time). The movie also costars Eric Johnson, Max Martini, Brant Daugherty, Eloise Mumford, Rita Ora and Luke Grimes. It's received almost unanimously negative reviews from critics once again (like the others), but it is expected to be another hit at the Box Office though (like the others). I once again hated it.Ana (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) are married, and finally starting to live a happy life together. Christian can't relax though, as he's constantly worried about Ana's safety. Especially when the couple realizes that Ana's ex-boss, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), who also sexually assaulted her, is out of prison and stalking her. Christian does everything he can to try to keep Ana safe, including commanding her on where and when she has to be somewhere, but Ana wants her freedom, and doesn't listen. The couple's new happiness is of course soon jeopardized because of this. \n \nI've hated this series from the beginning, because it makes a hero out of a #MeToo culprit (Christian Grey), and romanticizes stalking and sexual harassment. These are both things that the Christian character is guilty of doing to Ana, in the first two installments of the franchise. In this one his abuse towards her is at least seemingly consensual, but it still seems like the wrong message to send viewers (and readers of the novels). So I've always had a problem with the morality of supporting these films and books, and I don't understand why any intelligent moral person would. I've only continued to see each movie so that I can review them; in order to speak my feelings on this subject, and it's also just a lot more fun to review a bad film than a good one. This one is a really bad movie as well, and it's even worse than the first two installments. It seems like just a series of random pointless scenes strung together, by the weakest example of a plot that I've seen in a film in quite some time, just so they can give the viewer lots of erotic excessive sex scenes (as well as lots of pointless nudity). The movie really just feels like a well produced porno, but of course it's a heavy R-rated version of one (rather than X-rated).",

            "review_title": "Fifty Shades of much needed freedom",
            "content": "Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her mid twenties, saying this before the male critic hating and age generalisations continue, with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me. Very like what was said with the first two 'Fifty Shades' films.As was said before, my main reasons for seeing 'Fifty Shades Freed', wanting to see as many films of this year and of the latter half of 2017 (some released in my country this year) and that it just happened to be the film choice of a friend cinema film outing. General consensus of the group for the record being indifference and passionately hating it. Not because of wanting to hate it (have always aimed to be a fair and perceptive reviewer), following the crowd (have been known to go against the grain) or being someone who hates everything (generally am a positive reviewer and try to see the good in even awful films). And yes, am telling the truth about seeing it, have never reviewed a film without watching it.Oh and the whole \"why did you even watch it\" rubbish, from those who denounce anybody who dislikes the film as trolls for having a different opinion, needs to stop, because it comes over as ignorant and disrespectful. People are allowed to judge whatever they want and the two most common reasons for seeing a film is completest sake (if trying to see as many films of the year as possible) and family and friend film nights and cinema outings, so that answers that question.Which is the case here in 'Fifty Shades Freed'. Am not going to give it the lowest rating on IMDb, this is an extremely rare rating for me these days and reserved only for incompetently made films with no effort put into them. 'Fifty Shades Freed' has very little good with it, but there are also a few things good. It is the best of the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy, as there is a little more plot than the previous two, sadly this is not saying much.Some of the soundtrack beguiles, it has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality. Those lovely moments in the soundtrack, which should have been maintained more consistently, is the best thing about 'Fifty Shades Freed'. It also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot. There is one acting bright spot, which is Marcia Gay Harden who does very well with her role and is too conscientious an actress.However, the same flaws are all here. Other parts of Danny Elfman's score are one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The same goes with director James Foley, whose direction is far too mannered and ill at ease, he has done some great stuff like 'Glenngarry Glenn Ross' and 'House of Cards' and when you compare his work on those and that for his contribution to the 'Fifty Shades' films it's like somebody else entirely.Regarding the cast, only Harden is good. The rest fail to register in one-dimensional and in many cases underwritten and under-utilised roles. Eric Johnson phones it in at some parts and overdoes it in others as the painfully clich\u00e9d villain. More problematic once more are the two leads, and the chemistry is next to zero once more. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.Again, the dialogue does no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It would even be beneath actors and actresses who can't act to save their lives, and there is just as plenty of those around. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story, even though it is the film with the most plot it still is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long. Even with attempts to give more raunchiness and kinkiness, as well as edge, none of what goes on comes over naturally. Everything is horribly contrived and silly, with a climax that feels out of place and conflict that lacks tension and is instead unintentionally silly. The sex scenes are passionless and less than erotic.Concluding, while very marginally the best of the three 'Fifty Shades Freed' pretty dreadful still. It is very early on in the year but my prediction will be by the end of it the film would still be one of the worst of the year. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"Fifty Shades Freed\" (R, 1:45) is the third and final installment in the trilogy of erotic S&M-tinged movies based on the novels by E.L. James (after 2015's \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and 2017's \"Fifty Shades Darker\"). This one begins where most romantic films end - with a wedding. Having accepted the sweet marriage proposal of troubled billionaire entrepreneur Christian Gray (Jamie Dornan) at the end of the second film, book editor Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) vows her faithfulness and devotion to her beloved in the first scene of this film and he responds in kind. They're over-the-moon happy. Then reality sets in.Mr. and Mrs. Gray have to cut their honeymoon in France short when Christian receives a phone call about a data breach and fire in his corporate offices. They quickly discover that the perpetrator is an old enemy, but they're not sure what he's after. As Christian works his back channels to find out (and keeping much of what he finds from his new wife), the two of them struggle through many of the growing pains which most newlyweds deal with - but it all seems to come up in a very condensed period of time. Should she go by \"Mrs. Gray\" or \"Ms. Steele\" at work? (And should/does he have any say in the matter?) How much control should they have over each other's lives and activities? (especially since control has always been such a theme and point of contention in their relationship) Do they want kids? (How the hell did they not discuss this before they got married??) Oh, and how much personal security should she have? (Like I said, typical newlywed issues.) And then there's the growing threat from the someone(s) from their past - who is seriously f****ing with them... while they f*** each other... often.Yes, even with everything else going on, there are still plenty of sex scenes (both the typical kind and the kinky), but the sex (especially the S&M) almost takes a back seat to the plot at this point in Christian and Ana's saga. As in the two previous films, the conflicts feel contrived, but they do add some extra layers of drama to this story - and even some danger and suspense. In my opinion, the first film had the most exciting sex scenes, the second one had the best story and this one has the best mix of elements. None of these movies are going to be confused with high cinematic art, but they still can be pretty enjoyable, if you accept them for what they are - sexy romantic fantasy. After all, that's what E.L. James' series of books is about (as amateurishly written as they are) and isn't escapism one reason we go to the movies? This one is pretty entertaining in its genre, especially for fans of the books, and that's good enough. \"B+\"",

They give all to Anastasia and that was just to much to my like, they only part that I can applaud is the one that she is facing with valor that an unwanted pregnancy and she is willing to take care of the baby with or without him. That can teach some woman that you don't need a man to survival and much lest to father a child.

The romance between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan is the best I've ever seen in any movie in my entire life bar none. It's romance on such a totally higher level that apparently so many people can't even comprehend it, so they keep taking jabs. The Fifty Shades trilogy is truly a new subgenre of romance in its own right.Actually, when the three movies are taken together, the trilogy becomes much more than the sum of its parts and the story does look solid and beautiful. A virgin English literature student meet a 27-year-old billionaire and he introduces her not just to sex but a very particular kind of sex, for that matter. Anastasia struggles to navigate how possessive Christian becomes sometimes. They fall in love, break up, get back together, face more challenges, get married, face even more challenges, have a baby.The funny thing is, it sounds much more like real life than most other romance movies. Maybe that's why people hate it.And the filmmaker made a thrilling and titillating masterpiece out of it nonetheless.It's extraordinary romance for extraordinary audiences, and that's fine by me. And it's gonna go down in history as the most enchanting romance movie ever.",

The only good acting in the entire film comes from the banker. The plot is lazily thrown together and the attempts at suspense are god awful.

I will spare you the frustration. I even enjoy bad movies, I love having fun with a bad movie and making jokes about it to my friends while we watch it. I did that in this film but even that was not enough to make this an enjoyable experience. The \"BDSM\" in this film is a sad sad portrayal that only the oldest, driest, and most sexually frustrated wine moms will find arousing. A TSA pat-down is kinkier than this excuse for erotica. The sex scenes feel very required and obtuse. The ending is a horrible attempt to tie things up and make them feel complete, it is incredibly cheesy, as is every single bit of dialogue in this film.

            "content": "I went to see this one, like the previous two, because I thought it would be fun and also wanted to see the story end. However, the film is such as disaster that it made me reconsider \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and \"Darker\". While the first one was somehow interesting as it is the one establishing the story, characters and tone, and the second one was an extremely hilarious experience thanks to the public in the cinema who shot joke after joke about it, the third left me with a bitter taste of hollowness and nothingness. Even the other people in the cinema were feeling irritated and bored; about 20 minutes into the film they started walking in and out of the cinema hall. They had a moment, I guess, when they wanted to leave but remembered they had payed for the tickets. Really, it was no fun, no thrilling, no sexy and sure as hell not climactic. It was a bore with loose narrative threads and sex scenes as fillers.The supposed challenges the protagonists must face are laughable. First, there comes a flirtatious woman behaving in inappropriate ways towards Christian. Mmm...interesting, I thought! Then Ana knocks her down in a 40-second dialogue. Ok... I wonder what's next, what this new woman is up to, what Christian will do etc. Well, nevermind, we don't get to see her again except in a short scene hugging Eliot. Problem solved. \nAfter a \"Fast & Furious\" break, there seems to be a newer problem: Jack Hyde. There's some threatening and guns, we don't really know his motives and they really don't matter as long as the scenes drag the film further. No one cares anyway. It was not until very close to the film's ending that I truly felt the way it failed. When Ana wakes up in hospital, Christian tells her, with wet eyes, something like \"I thought I lost you\" and that's when everyone in the cinema bursted laughing.\nThe tagline warns us not to miss the climax. Well, I did miss it. The only effect this film had on me was intellectual frustration. \nIn the end, I need to mention that I appreciated Dakota Johnson once again for making the best of what was given to her in this film. She's the one that makes the film watchable by her rather good performance. I'm glad the critics remarked her. I hope she gets over this whole circus and manages to establish herself as the talented and serious actress that she is.",

They seems to be in a happy relationship but an old problem in form of former manager of Anastacia Steel is threatening their happy new life.That's it. More plot this movie doesnt provide. How it comes that this movie takes so long with such a bad plot? The gaps are filled with bad sex scenes, bad jokes every than and now and a relationship based on abuse.As a openly living BDSM follower this movie and the books hurting every inch of me. And not in the good way. If you really want to watch this movie, I recommend to do this with big attentation on details and you will quickly notice, that the 'relationship' between Anastacia and Christian are based on nothing more than abuse.Besides of this the acting is again not authentic or even good. For a happily married couple their is no feeling about this fact that you would think this is the case. You have to watch the second movie to believe it. But I dont want to talk the actors down, it mostly is because of the script.The scenery is again nice but only because of this I cant recommend the movie in any way. The movie music is bad as in the movies before this and dont fit to the actual scene which helps you with enjoying the film by laughing in the wrong moments.Why I still watched the film? Well, a running gag between my friends and me. After my first shocked reactions about such a bad movie based on such a bad book, my fellows like to watch my reactions which falter between disbelief, shock and second-hand embarrassment.If you never watched this movie.

            "content": "Like \"Twilight,\" the \"Fifty Shades\" series is one of those love to hate it type franchises. Despite its low ratings by users (scoring 1/10) and by critics (scoring 2/4), the third and final installment \"Fifty Shades Freed\" is a gorgeous and sensual masterpiece, with excellent sets and a great remixed score. However visually stunning, \"Fifty Shades Freed\" remains a teenage fantasy with outlandish melodrama and impossible characters. Despite this, \"Fifty Shades Freed\" is a charming film and highly watchable.Visually, \"Fifty Shades Freed\" boasts amped up, saturated color that somehow always trains your attention to the flushed parts of Dakota Johnson's face, like her perpetual berry pink lipstick. Everything is brighter and more alive in this film. Johnson wears shades of wine throughout. Stunning. Her wardrobe is also great, with lots of beckoning features like ties and deep cowl necks, etc. The visual aspects here suffuses the film with a heady attraction, such as through Dormer's eyes.Story wise, there is not much material to work with. The novel \"Fifty Shades Freed\" is based on is incredibly thin, and it remains so in film translation. A vindictive man kidnaps Christian Grey's sister-in-law out of jealousy for his rich life. What felt like a half-hearted attempt to introduce drama in the book still feels like that in the movie, and what's worse, the filmmakers chose a chiseled, good-looking soap opera looking kind of guy to play the villain too. This adds to the cheesy effect.If I had to criticize, yes, the supporting actors in \"Fifty Shades Freed\"--the villain, the friends, the security guard--look way too handsome and too much like Dormer (character Christian Grey). Really scratching my head at why they would choose to highlight the soap opera effect in this way.And also, while \"Fifty Shades Freed\" depicts more of a happy, honeymoon phase between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, there does still lurk a sense of unhealthy codependency. Much of this forgotten because the two look so dang charmed with each other with many touchy feelies, but by the end when each says they are each other's \"whole world\". . . Yeah. That comes across as disingenuous because the entire movie has been Johnson's character trying to convince Dormer's character that she needs to have her own life, or that she would definitely leave her husband to keep her child.\"Fifty Shades Freed\" is a thin gel of visual splendor and married lust over a cheese Swiss terrain of improbabilities, but if you are able to enjoy the surface attractions then you can enjoy this film. Just don't look too deep.",

            "content": "It's unfortunate that those living within the BDSM lifestyle have had to explain the misrepresentation of their lifestyle. Even more so during the emergence of the Fifty Shades Trilogy that misrepresents why someone would be interested in the world. Alas, it became a major phenomenon, a profitable film series and now we come to the conclusion of Fifty Shades Freed and all of my concerns of this franchise come to light.We open with a pretty montage of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey tieing the knot (no, not that knot, yet) and begin to embark in a happily married life. Meanwhile, Jack Hyde is envious of the couple and plans to seek revenge and do any and everything he can to sabotage their lives.By this point, I believe most fans know what they're coming into when it comes to this franchise, so even speaking upon the postives or negatives can fall on deaf ears. What I will say about the franchise \"positively\" is that they have maintained a certain level of consistency in the lazy writing and strange out of no where choices one makes. Christian still gets amazed Ana thinks for herself, the sex scenes still feel weirdly PG or PG-13 in terms of kinkiness and the plot goes into such a strange choices and decisions the characters make.While there is no helicopter scene, there are a few eyebrow raising scenes that are worth mentioning. One moment when handcuff's are involved in a pretty dramatic scene which turns out pretty funny, and seeing Christian Grey play the piano and sing blues music. But nothing tops a moment when he becomes drunk, and I almost believed it was Jamie Dornan just saying to himself \"it's the last day of filming, so I'll try to make it worthwhile.\"Fifty Shades Freed doesn't really feel like it frees anyone except the audience. I still don't buy the romance, and the ending montage makes me realize that nothing is really gained, as it has more so become more vanilla and less interested. But if your invested in the characters, feel free to get tied up one more time.",

There is no chemistry. It's like a forced mating at the Zoo. \nNext the plot. The villain out for revenge was a refreshing bit of action but that's about it. The Hollywood messaging is very irresponsible. Christian clearly tells Anastasia he is not ready for fatherhood. Anastasia conveniently 'forgets' to take her birth control, getting pregnant. When he tells her this is grossly unfair and he absolutely is not ready to be a parent, she lashes out at him saying \"that's what happens when you have sex you get pregnant!\". Um, no, actually, if you are responsible about birth control that does not happen 99% of the time. When you force a life altering change on your partner - that's sociopathic and plain nasty. \nOf course, Christian learns his \"lesson' when Anastasia's life is threatened. He has a gospel like revelation that yes, in fact, being a Dad is all he wants in life and Anastasia's forcing it on him was just what he needed for a full happy life. \nOh, man, the plot is wrong on so many levels. Wrong to feed such a garbage idea to young women. Just 'forget' your birth control and if he doesn't like it when you get pregnant, he's the one with the problem. Oh, and don't worry, he'll come around and be a super dad and you will all live happily ever after. Wow!",

The plot continues to build, with sinister forces threatening their relationship, everything from jealous catty women, to Anastasia's former boss who goes off the deep end and seeks revenge after Christian has him fired after he attempts to sexually assault Anastasia. Engrossing plot, and of course the erotic element is incredibly intense, as in the previous chapters... all until Anastasia ends up preggers - despite all prior agreements with Christian to the contrary, and a birth control regiment (by injection) that you could only screw up by trying. The rest of the movie descends into Anastasia coercing Christian into having a child he did not want (while surviving a life-threatening hostage situation with the former boss, but that's kind of irrelevant). A disappointing narrative to feed to women - that any man can be trapped into fatherhood, and he'll just come around eventually, learn to be a daddy, and the woman will get everything she wants. And that marriage automatically equates with parenthood. Yuck, and even worse that the author of the novels, and the producers of the films believe that women will go goo-goo ga-ga over this. Ugh!

Christian and Anastasia carry their relationship to the logical conclusion for many people in love - they marry. For dramatic tension, the characters of Christian and Anna tackle a number of issues which beset people in wedded bliss, including Christian's desire to control Anna versus Anna's desire for independence. Unfortunately, many of the best scenes have been spoiled by placing them in movie trailers - if you've seen the trailers, you can already figure out several important and pivotal plot points. To be fair, 50 Shades Freed was obviously a labor of love for each person involved. The actors all go above and beyond, and the direction and editing are more than adequate. The movie will not appeal to everyone, nor should it. However, the amount of hate and low ratings seen on Fandango, on Rotten Tomatoes and on lMDB is a testament to the number of minds in modern society \nwhich are screaming for sexual liberation. Why would you spend time watching a movie which glorifies something you deem objectionable? If BDSM offends you, why watch a movie with kinky sex \nfeatured at its core? Who is forcing this \"torture\" upon you? Unless you're paid to review movies, you don't have to watch anything which offends you. For example: If you don't like or want sex, it is a crime to have it forced upon you (it's called rape). in other words: DON'T REVIEW MOVlES THAT ARE ABOUT THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE, WANT OR UNDERSTAND; in the end, you will be much happier. Watch what you want - but try to keep an open mind, because most cinematic projects involve thousands of man hours of work, planning and execution.

For me, the end of a bad cinematic experience that did not make up for the time spent watching the films. Totally devastated by the critics, however, it was a box office success, as were the two films that preceded it. As I did in the criticism of the two other films, I emphasize here that I did not read or intend to read the original books, so I will speak only of the film, despite knowing that many problems related to the story told come from the bad original material.Finally, Gray and Anastasia get married ... and finally we have a film with some plot in addition to endless rough sex sessions. Yes, this film is what I think has a better script and a more interesting story, mainly because of its ending and the permanent threat that Jack Hyde will pose to the Gray couple. The film starts well, with an invasion of the offices of Gray companies and the theft of documents related to Christian and his family. We soon realized that the dream wedding is going to be threatened. The problem is that, even with this noticeable improvement, everything is still so predictable that a five year old child would be able to guess everything that will happen without needing, exactly, a crystal ball.Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson continue to be bad actors and do very amateur work, as in previous films. Eric Johnson, who even pleased me in the previous film, skids completely here and becomes a kind of conventional villain that scares no one. Kim Basinger ends his performance as an extra with lines, in a cameo that stinks of the vestigial sub-plot, severely amputated in the post-production room. The problem of bad dialogues is still very much present, and I start to think that this may be linked to the bad material from the film. It is also the film with the worst sex scenes in the trilogy. They look like machines that turn on and off, there is no passion or desire whatsoever. Okay, I'm not a fan of such intense sex scenes at all, but given that the film requires them, they could at least have done something better.It goes without saying that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the erotic material and the language used. The film had a good budget and, therefore, good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props, satisfactory editing work and a good soundtrack, composed by Danny Elfman and with good songs, like \"Love me Like You Do \".",

The first part of the film is so romantic! it's full of romantic montages at beautiful locations with romance songs on the soundtrack. But it also deals seriously with them trying to adjust to each other. The second half deals with them handling Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) who wants to destroy both of them.GREAT movie--a perfect date film! The S&M is confined to just two scenes which are needed for the integrity of the film. The locations are gorgeous-beautiful houses and boats. The songs are all great. There's plenty of sex and nudity too--mostly from Johnson. Great acting by the whole cast too. Never dull and SO romantic. I love this film :)",

Whoever didnt like it, or said it was a waste of time and money, well.. they do not share the same interests as me. and I'll tell you what, if you liked the previous ones, you'll love this one. it's got a dramatic plot twist, jokes, romance, happiness, troubles.. the acting was good, a few things could be improved, certainly, but it is a great movie, and if you love dramatic romance you will not regret watching it! too bad it ended..",

If you want more graphic sex, I'm told there are Internet sites ; if you want realism, watch the news.This instalment sees Anastasia growing up and becoming more independent, while Christian has to learn to deal with it. Compared to the other two films, there is more non-naked mutual enjoyment ; and also a little drama to keep them busy, and help them to mature.I came out of the cinema feeling happy ; and if we agree with P.T.

If you liked the other two-the original in 2015 & the second in 2017-then you should enjoy the wrap up. This one starts with the wedding of Dakota and Jamie and their honeymoon as they lead the jet set lifestyle of rich people. They return a little early, after hearing some disturbing news about Dakota's former boss, Eric. Eric is wanting some-at least it's what he thinks-well deserved revenge and compensation. Max, the head of security for Jamie & Dakota's safety, has plenty to keep him busy trying to find where Eric will strike next. There is the usual sex scenes and light bondage to keep you watching and there is a connection between Eric and one of the Greys that is reveled near the end of the movie. You also get to hear Jamie sing a song-Maybe I'm Amazed by Paul McCartney-while playing the piano. As the end credits start, there is a scene, but nothing at the very end.\nIt's rated \"R\" for language and strong sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.\nIt's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are a fan-my wife seemed to like it more than I did-it would be a good rental. It wraps things up nicely.",

With little else to keep me interested as the story stumbled along, I did enjoy keeping track of all the trendy names of various minor supporting characters. Unfortunately, director James Foley can't find a way to whip up any dramatic interest here whatsoever. In few words, this movie is the more of the same closing chapter of an inconsequential trilogy, that never took the time to say something interesting, or at least show us something interesting to see. The Greys become the old married couple who are so boring that even their sex doesn't look particularly new anymore.",

Yet at this point in the \"groundbreaking\" trilogy that bends the limitations of soft-core pornography within mainstream entertainment, who frickin' cares? I mean honestly. BDSM? Badly Designed Sexual Manipulation. I get it. It's sex. It's all about that glorious penetration that middle-aged mothers crave. But flippin' heck. Every ten minutes? Food-play, vibrators, in bed, in the super car and chained to a bondage wall. Fortunately, Christian only has to touch Anastasia once before she encounters a raging orgasm, so these scenes accompanied by cringeworthy pop songs don't last long (thank. God.).But if we're talking about storyline, then I'm going to reuse one of my most infamous lines from the first review, because I'm lazy much like the screenwriters were. I've seen more substance in a used condom. Oh, something that Christian clearly hasn't heard of, and is then surprised to learn that she becomes pregnant and has a temper tantrum? Wrap that willy! Or better yet, pull out! The plot in itself contains so many narrative fragments, including arguments over email addresses, an abduction and home invasion, that they simply act as causeways for the sexual lovin'. Even the pedestrian car chase straight out of 'Fast and Furious' ended with sex. Jeez. Wear a chastity belt or something! The story is a complete snooze-fest. Nothing happens!Johnson and Dornan do not care. They don't! The acting had less tones that a stimulating vibrator. He gets possessive, she dislikes it, they penetrate and the whole cycle repeats again. Did Johnson really lick his pubes? And did they honestly lather themselves in ice cream just to lick it off? Talk about unsanitary. I will say (and I can't believe I'm about to hand a compliment to this film) that Mia getting tied up provided palpable tension. Wow! The sheer dedication to that performance was incredible. *cough* But when Rita frickin' Ora is the best aspect of a film, something is obviously wrong. Wait! Scratch that. Goulding's \"Love Me Like You Do\" playing to a montage of scenes from the trilogy. Oh my word! I was howling!

The books are important, and all three films feel like a transition from a growth perspective - from middle school to high school to college hypothetically speaking. In the first film, Ana was this fragile, inexperienced girl who wasn't sure how or where she fits in. The second film you see that Ana has become more of a woman and in this final installment, it really shows how she's grown - bolder, emotionally stronger, rebellious but grounded. She stands up to Christian's dominant ways regardless of what he thinks or does, and as a result you see a more open, more playful and far more vulnerable side of Christian that nobody ever thought even exists. The films are more than the obvious BDSM lifestyle, the sex is just an element to a side of Christian, but it's the underlying story that matters. His childhood and upbringing, and how challenging he is. Surprisingly, Freed plays out very smoothly, making the film enjoyable for what it was/is. My only disappointment is how consolidated the film is in regardless to cutting out so much from the book, but in the world of movie making, this is expected. For those who actually understand my review, you will understand my explanation. The movie is 1:45 minutes and plays out pretty fast hence my disappointment with the consolidation aspect of it.

Being married to a controlling billionaire, Ana felt stifled by Christian's rules and security, but she enjoyed defying him to make her point felt. Their European honeymoon was interrupted by news of a fire set inside Christian's office building. Much later, Ana herself was assaulted in their own condo by an intruder who turned out to be her ex-boss Eric Hyde. Aside from trying to figure out why Hyde hated Grey with a passion, the newlyweds also try to deal with an unexpected guest. Since this film was shot back to back with the second film by director James Foley, it looked and felt just like it. There was not much improvement to be expected in the acting of Dakota Johnson and Jaime Dornan, though they did seem to be more relaxed already by now. Eric Johnson was one-dimensional in his portrayal of token antagonist Jack Hyde. The rest of the cast may be good-looking but were similarly bland, from Brant Daugherty (as Ana's stiff bodyguard Sawyer) to Arielle Kebbel (as the flirty architect Gia Matteo). The cinematography was still lush and vibrant, showing the extravagant lifestyles of the rich and famous Greys (their vacations, their houses, their cars), as well as what happens in their bedrooms. The sexy scenes were not as instrumental to the story anymore as they were in the first two films. These gratuitous scenes basically became fillers to stretch out a lame revenge crime story into 105 minutes. The best aspect of all the Fifty Shades films remains to be its musical soundtrack. There is nothing that immediately stood out as strongly as \"Love Me Like You Do\" or \"Earned It\" did from the first film, or \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" from the second film. However, \"For You\" by Rita Ora (who played as Christian's sister Mia) and Liam Payne, and \"Capital Letters\" by Hailee Steinfeld are definitely ear candy that deserve to be radio hits as well. We also get to see and hear Jaime Dornan sing \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" while playing the piano -- not bad. The paper-thin story actually centered around dreary side character Eric Hyde and his vindictiveness, than about Christian Grey and his BDSM obsession. There was clearly nothing more to tell about Grey anymore here. We see only Christian's petulant immaturity when dealing with adult relationship issues. While Ana had the more interesting story to tell, Niall Leonard's script can occasionally make her come across as flighty and annoying. Anyhow, at least we can see that these two really deserve each other! 4/10.",

It's a nice community to be a part of. \n I became a fan of this series 4 years ago on October 3rd 2014 which is an easy time to remember because of the 4th is my Mom and Dakota Johnson's birthday so I was at Walmart buying supplies for my Mom's birthday when I discovered the first book in the trilogy. So I scooped it up and started reading it that night and I loved it and wanted to get the other books so I ordered Darker and Freed from Barnes and Nobles 4 days after I finished Grey. Oh sure the series isn't a masterpiece or well written but who cares as long as you enjoy what you're reading then it's okay. \n So for 4 years this series has taken over my life and in a good way. Like a mention before this fandom is the best you can get into. I actuallly got my best friend Angel into this series and we saw Freed together in Chicago and I was glad I had someone to share this last film with who love this series as much as I do. \n Like I've been saying please pretty please DON'T listen to the critics about these films. Jamie Dornan (Christian Grey) and Dakota Johnson (Anastasia Steele) did an amazing job in their roles of these characters. You can feel the pain in Dakota voice during the scene in Feed where she tells Christian off and I love that scene because it shows how much Ana has grown throughout these films. Christian has learned to be more patience during Freed and not so controlling then he was in Grey and Darker. \n Favorite scenes in Fifty Shades Freed I won't do spoilers!\n* Wedding scene/Honeymoon scene \n* Handcuff scene \n* car chase and afterwards \n* Ice cream scene \n* butt plug scene \n* Christian drunk \n* Ana comfort Christian \n* Ana goes after Jack \n* At the end with the flashback scenes from the first two films.I had to written a review for Fifty Shades Freed the day after I saw the film in February for IMDB either it didn't go through or wasn't acceptable but I figured I'd re-upload it.

Frankly i don't know , as while reading the book ( they are truly very very bad ) i get this feeling that the lead characters ( even poorly written and stupid ) were struggling to work out their problems , both of them seemed to be in love with each other . so , what should we really dislike , the story ? characters ? or how they are written and played ? from artistic point of view both books and movies of this franchise are beyond bad ( I am your bosses bosses boss , ha ha funny , Christian snarling , Anna and her idiotic inner goddess the way these two use each others last names , you get the picture right ? ) but i have the feeling that people hate this franchise based of principle and because they have to , not because this franchise is , simply garbage . In real life when people love each other they don't give up they try , tooth and nail to save each other , Christian seems to have the potential to be a normal man , so i don't blame Anna for trying to save this ( using her words ) beautiful fu...ed up boy , whom i blame is the writer of the books and the director of these movies.",

            "content": "The tagline for the poster read \"Don't miss the climax\", that pretty much sums up the makers intentions, in completing what has been a silly soft-core kinkfest trilogy, based on the awful novel by E.L. James, the first film was cringe but okay, the second was only slightly better, I didn't have my hopes up for the final instalment, directed by James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross, House of Cards). Basically young corporate executive Christian Grey (The Fall's Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele (Dakota Johnson) are now married, and enjoy an exotic honeymoon in Europe, but this is cut short and they return to Seattle after receiving news of a break-in at Christian's corporate headquarters. Some computer files were stolen, security cameras have captured the perpetrator, Ana recognises it is Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), her former boss who was fired for sexual assault, meanwhile Ana is introduced to her new personal security team. Christian surprises Ana with a new house and has hired attractive young architect Gia Matteo (Arielle Kebbel) to rebuild it, she openly flirts with Christian in Ana's presence, Ana privately threatens to dismiss Gia if she continues the flirtatious behaviour, forcing her to stop. Christian goes away on a business trip, Ana promises to stay at home, but she disregards this and goes for a drink with her friend Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford), Kate is dating Christian's younger brother Elliot (Luke Grimes), she worries their relationship is fizzling, and she is suspicious of Elliot working closely with Gia. When Ana returns home, Jack is there waiting for her, he attempts to kidnap her, he is subdued by the security and arrested, Christian returns and they have an argument, Ana berates him for being controlling and possessive, she demands more freedom. Christian surprises Ana with a trip to Aspen, bringing along her friends Kate, Elliot, his sister Mia (singer Rita Ora), and Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk), whilst there Christian and Ana continue with their erotic sexual experimentation. But then things get complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant, Christian is deeply disturbed, he had plans for them, and is not ready to be a father, he is not ready to share his life with anyone else. Christian leaves and goes on a late-night drunken bender, the next day Ana is disheartened to find out that Christian had recently contacted Elena Lincoln, his ex-lover and former BDSM dominant. Shortly after, Jack has been released on a $500,000 bail, he calls Ana and demands a ransom of $5,000,000 in cash in two hours, he has abducted Christian's sister Mia and is threatening to kill her. Jack warns Ana to tell no one and to bring the money alone, Ana takes some cash, and a revolver she found from the house, she then goes to the ban k to withdraw the full amount. The suspicious bank manager Troy Whelan (John Emmet Tracy) calls Christian, she thinks Ana is leaving him, but then realises Jack's release and Ana's sudden large cash withdrawal coincide, Christian tells the manager to give her whatever she asks for, and races to find her. Hyde instructs Ana to get into a car parked in the alley and hand her phone to the driver to discard, Ana hands over the bank manager's phone which she took, she discovers the driver and Jack's accomplice is her co-worker Liz (Amy Price-Francis), Christian is following using Ana's phone GPS. Ana arrives at the drop-off point with the money, Hyde is now psychotic and vengeful, he attacks Ana, kicking her in the abdomen, Liz tries to stop Jack as Ana pulls out the gun and shoots him in the leg. Christian and his security team arrive, Hyde and Liz are apprehended, Ana blacks out and wakes three days later in hospital with Christian at her side. He is still angry at Ana's recklessness, and anxious about fatherhood, but Christian realises how important the baby is to her, they reconcile, and Christian's adoptive mother Grace (Marcia Gay Harden) assures him that she will not leave him. Ana returns home the following day, Christian's private investigator reports that Christian and Hyde shared the same foster family, he also blackmailed Liz into being his accomplice, Christian and Ana locate where his birth mother is buried, he lays flowers on her grave. In the end, Christian and Ana continue as a happily married couple, two years later they have a son named Teddy, and Ana is pregnant with their second child. Also starring Max Martini as Taylor, Jennifer Ehle as Carla May Wilks, Bruce Altman as Jerry Roach, Robinne Lee as Ros Bailey, Brant Daugherty as Luke Sawyer and Hiro Kanagawa as Detective Clark. Dornan returns very slightly to being dominating and possessive, but softens up eventually, and Johnson is no longer as na\u00efve, but dips in and out of being vulnerable and determined, and Johnson is a little pantomime villain as opposed to a dangerous threat. The sex scenes are still like a softcore porn movie standard, there are the odd kinky bits with sex toys and torture that are laughable and sometimes awkward viewing, it also plays too much on the glossy glamorous millionaire lifestyle, and the subplot of the vengeful ex-boss only adds a little thrill to proceedings, I knew this final film was going to be naff or disappointing, but I had to know how it all ends, overall it is a slightly lacklustre and almost forgettable erotic romantic drama. Okay!",

I thought this film would make me feel good about paying through the nose at the movie theater to watch it, but I was sadly mistaken.How can you take a powerhouse male such as Christian Grey, someone deeply f**ked up, twisted, and sexy as hell...and make a comedic family man out of him? WHAT? They took a lion and turned him into a kitty cat! What a sloppy trilogy. It was like Christian Grey didn't even exist. There was nothing fierce about him. Instead they want to take meek and mousy Anastasia and try to turn her into some bad-ass and it fails...horribly....A badly done character swap of epic proportions. Ruined the entire trilogy for me. Not to mention the sloppy story line. The villain was in foster care along with Grey, and was stricken with insane jealousy at his privileged adoption. HOW BORING. Same story-line from Blades of Glory, from the cut scenes! Worst $40 ever spent, seeing this garbage movie. They screwed Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.

            "content": "In the DVD of \"Fifty Shades Freed,\" there is a bonus track that includes E. L. James, the author of the novel and the screenwriter, describing how the work on the film was \"fun.\" She also indicates that her theme was \"what happens when you don't receive unconditional love and then come to accept unconditional love.\" In other words, James is addressing the eternal conflict of \"nature versus nurture.\"In the case of Christian Grey, the young lad was an abused orphan, who eventually received love from a caring mother and father who adopted him. While he still had some kinks to work out in his kinky fifty shades of grey, Christian is now described as an 'honorable\" adult. By contrast, the film's villain, Jack Hyde was also a foundling child, but one who did not receive love as a child. As a result, he is a deeply troubled adult seeking revenge on both Anastasia and Christian.This presentation of the nature vs. nurture them underscores the limitations of this shallow film. The action turns into a melodrama with the psychotic Jack Hyde on the loose. Consequently, it never truly explores the complex question of nature versus nurture. And, with the true protagonist of the story, Miss Anastasia \"Ana\" Rose Grey, we never learn much about her background. The viewer is begging to ask the question: What in her past had led to Miss Steele becoming so perfect?In the film trilogy, Anastasia has come a long way from the time she was in school studying journalism and wearing threadbare clothing that appeared to come from the Seattle Goodwill center. Now, it is the finest in lace garments (especially undergarments), gourmet cuisine, servants, trips to Paris, Nice, and Aspen, with Mr. Christian Grey. The focus in this third film is the story of the newlyweds-their marriage, their honeymoon, and the period getting acclimated to being husband and wife.With Anastasia and Christian having tied the knot in holy matrimony, it is inevitable that they may need to be thinking about little ones. As it turns out, prior to their marriage, Ana and Chris have never even discussed the matter of children! Now, Ana has forgotten to take her shots, and it turns out that is pregnant. This returns us to the question of nature versus nurture and, above all, how a little Grey baby will respond to living in a home that includes a strange \"red room\" and having a daddy with lifestyle choices that fall with the \"fifty shades of grey.\"",

            "content": "GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The Greys finally tie the knot and it's still a dim-witted love story in need of a safe word to stop all of this dreck.JIM'S REVIEW: I am now complete.Fifty Shades Freed is my official first film for the 2018 movie season and having seen all of this film series, I can attest that the film is certainly free from any sense of full-fledged exotica or just common sense. (Yes, dear moviegoers, I did my sacred duty and took the bullet for you on this one!)The film trilogy, the last one, thank goodness, is a conventional mix of soft porn and romantic fantasy, the type of tripe most middle-aged blue-hairs would carelessly blush and giggle to themselves as they experienced the second-hand sexual nastiness on the screen. But I'm afraid it's just \"knot\" for me.Love has pussy-whipped Our Sex-Obsessed Mr. Grey. He morphs from a male-chauvinistic playboy with sado-masochistic tendencies into a dull, jealous, and controlling dolt with sado-masochistic tendencies. This mundane movie shows less erotic sex this time around (lots of moaning and groaning though), less nudity (excluding Ms. Johnson's taut nipples that tend to overact slightly more than the actress), and less screen time in its less-than-two hours length (its strongest selling point). But this installment sure has an overabundance of hokum in its silly thin plot: Christian (James Dornan) and Anastasia \"Just Call Me Ana\" Steele (Dakota Johnson) have continually \"tied the knot\" in previous chapters, but this time, it is legit. They marry in the most opulent of ceremony that would impress the rich and famous class, let alone us commoners. But happiness soon eludes The Greys, as they adjust to their new arrangements as husband and wife. He: trying to fit in his extensive gym routine while making millions to keep new wife happy; She: juggling and jiggling her role as wife, lover, and a feminist. Oh, and She has one other issue: a psychotic admirer is stalking her once more! Typical soap opera fare.Both Ms. Johnson and Mr. Dornan continue to stay fit and are very well-toned. Acting-wise, they still remain flabby. Former Oscar winners Kim Basinger is nowhere in sight this time around and Mary Kay Harden is a mere walk-on. (Be thankful, ladies!) The rest of the cast is unmemorable, although Rita Oro, a singer a.k.a. actress, acts distressed in most of her scenes, even the happy ones, Brant Daugherty looks dashing as Ana's personal bodyguard, and Amy Price-Francis emotes a tad too much in her minor supporting role. Eric Johnson as the one-note villain, Jack Hyde, does seek to add a few notes to his evil character. All are lackluster at best, given the weakest of material to portray.Yet, the real fault lies more with the best-selling source. In adapting the purple prose of his wife's tawdry novel, screenwriter Niall Leonard never makes this melodrama believable. The dull direction of James Foley seems more interested in the luxurious trappings than actually creating an interesting movie. It is all so formulaic: Christian and Ana look hot and horny, begin to talk dirty, have foreplay with various hand-held instruments, cue music ballad for mood, show Ms. Johnson's breasts, glimpse at Mr. Dornan's dimpled derri\u00e8re, tastefully-shot short sex romp follows, fade out to next scene. Just dreadful...and not the least bit sexy.So, let me just end with one ripe laughable quote to belabor my point:\" Babies are caused by sex...and we have a lot of it.\"'Nuff said. Fifty Shades Freer may have come full circle, and it is hopelessly as loopy as ever.",

This makes me wonder: is this how easy it is to make movies for you guys? Have you seen so little erotic material in your time that this is what not only does it for you, but makes you utterly lose it?Is this, I ask again, the effort it takes to convince you that you're watching the best film ever made simply because it makes your naughty bits go crazy and IN SPITE of the fact that you're talking about vaguely rape-y Twilight fanfiction? Also, why are you doing this to movies, and why in a post-\"me too\" world?For all the abusive, powerful men being exposed on the reg and all the creeps who need to think things through before they ever again go near women, surely there's another half of the population that learned something during the past year? Surely we agree that this is, I dunno, kind of the wrong time to signal that you think the epitome of romance is the way in which the powerful Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) interacts with the shy Anastasia Grey nee Steele (Dakota Johnson)? Or are you just so suggestible when it comes to seeing handsome men and BDSM equipment in the same sequence that your only complaint is \"I wanted Matt Bomer\"?Fifty Shades Freed is the third film in the Fifty Shades of Grey series, and also the final one unless E.L. James pulls a Stephanie Meyer and rewrites the story through the point-of-view of the male, like this changes anything. NOTE: I wrote that last line before I double-checked Wikipedia and learned that the Retold by Christian series already exists, mostly because God does not.Many of our old favorites return, including Kim Basinger as Christian's former dom and \"Ana's nemesis\", Eric Johnson as a stalker of Ana (if only he had more money), Eloise Mumford as Ana's bestie who marries Christian's brother (Luke Grimes), and also Marcia Gay Harden as the Grey mother. The kid from Road to Perdition, now big enough to play Superman, also features.More stars appear on the soundtrack, many of them responsible for a bunch of love songs you and your besties cry to sometimes, ergo the movie has to be good (I personally blast Infected Mushroom when I'm sad but I won't act like I'm relatable). I wonder how much work Danny Elfman had to do? The score itself isn't his most memorable contribution.At this point, I could tell you everything this movie does that's typical of the series. How it jumps from each pointless event to the next without much cohesion, how hysterical its dialogue is, how inept the central chemistry is, how we're meant to root for this couple, toxicity be damned, or how the sex isn't as scary as they would have you think. What's more appropriate, I think, is that I ask everyone nicely to really look at what's happened in the world. What was revealed? What have we learned? And what part does this franchise play? Because trust me, it's not all egoistic entitlement on the part of horrible people. Some also vote with their wallet. If you need to see this, consider waiting for a birthday coupon or relying on a virus-infested website that links to someone's iPhone footage.I'm using words too large for the fandom. Let me start over. This film crap. You think horny fanfic count as intimidatingly sexy literature. You no tell when things are unintentionally funny and chemistry-less when you see muscle man in suit. Saying without ounce of irony that you \"want your own Christian Grey\" ammo for rape apologists. Finally: I no retain much faith in modern-day dating world anyways, I've used Tinder.NOTE 2: I know people who are proud that they grew out of their tween-era Twilight phase, only to start gushing over the erotic fan work based upon it. I have a few cases I need to be resting somewhere.",

Those who have a little more insight in that \"strange\" universe, which is BDSM, will not find themselves in any of these toned down movies and as far as rumors have it, the two main actors didn't even want to be in it in the first place. If this is really the case than it's safe to assume, that this is the main reason why you don't buy the kinky lifestyle of Christian and Anastasia at all. BDSM's major point is to explore yourself, reach boundaries and then willingly cross them, up to a point where you simply can't take anymore. In this third part you see nothing of this. It has become a romantic flick with a blindfold and some handcuffs and this \"Don't miss the climax\" slogan is simply a slap in the face. Instead of reaching highs by any means, this movie even tries to take a journey into the Action/Thriller genre and the nudity is a lame excuse simply for marketing reasons and to give the mainstream audience something to dream about. I could go deep into spoilers and take that entire thing apart, but this movie is not worth this effort. And definetely not worth your time or hard earned money!",

            "review_title": "Freed of Shades",
            "content": "This review of Fifty Shades Freed is spoiler free** (2/5)IT'S KIND OF ironic really that an erotic series which started out it's history as a Twilight sag fan-fiction where sex, BDSM, and safe words are prevalent the Fifty Shades trilogy has stayed surprisingly safe handed. Granted those points remain as the anchor in the film's storytelling. Also since starting in 2015 it never seems to have celebrated the kitsch like one of those '90s DTV erotic thrillers with boundary pushing titles such as Lethally Blonde. Plus it never takes the serious side of what kind of relationship that the author was aiming for when she initially wrote the books by taking a full-on dive into erotic obsession, it basically ends in the same route thus resulting in something that's horrendously tame, filled with mostly poor affairs, not too bad enough to be audience guilty pleasures or indeed good enough to be, well, entertaining. Fifty Shades Freed largely follows in that same route.Yet again, the result is as tedious as the previous films; adapted by James' husband, Niall Leonard again Freed doesn't have much of a story as such. Instead after an opening montage of Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) tying the knot of marriage, starting their honeymoon, can you guess where they end up? These moments are essentially stringed up vignettes thus compromising different types of porn. Of course, we get the handful of BDSMarital get-togethers (there are handcuffs on ankles, sex toy teasing, and all sorts of shenanigans involving ice cream, these are almost exclusively played out to a slowed down retro hit). And alongside that the film also gives us a handful of other types of porn, there's a private jet, a flashy sports car and finally workplace porn etc. Are you keeping count? No? We aren't either. If you remember it, the first one centered on an arc for Anastasia to go on, from virginal student to a sexually awakened paramour, but after the tedious second film, here there is no such luck on having that arc again. Then with what slithers of plot this one has to offer, it then takes in it's premise to turn into an afternoon TV style thriller, here it revolves around the return of Ana's former boss Jack Hyde (a terrible Eric Johnson) the creepy guy from Fifty Shades Darker. Often as far as revenge plots go, (some can be good), it is a slow, dull burn with tedious results and as per usual with the thriller premise the final thrill normally doesn't appear until the last few moments but here after some same ol' routes into BDSM it's left predictable and boring. \n \nIndeed Fifty Shades Freed certainly is some hokey stuff, but it's not all bad it's beautifully shot and there's a charming performance by Johnson (the female one) but yet again the third in the trilogy is as tedious as the other two and we for one are glad it's over. VERDICT: A tedious end to a damp squib of a trilogy which sees Johnson as the only one to be freed completely unscathed.",

Then the honeymoon of a life time begins no not your standard Benidorm weekender the happy couple embark on a round the world trip.The first peril that beseeches our happy couple is Anastasia wanting sunbath without a bikini on a semi naked beach where no one is wearing a bikini at this point Billionaire Christian must thinking \"Mo money, Mo problems\".Fear not make up sex can not be far away only to be interrupted by trouble back at the office with someone breaking into Christian's computers and sabotaging. The culprit is none other than Jack Hyde Anna's cruel boss from the previous film who has a dark vendetta against the Christian!You may have gathered I may not be taking this review all that seriously but seriously that's the key to enjoying this film. The minute to spend a second taking it in on a serious note your going to have problems.There gaping holes of logic for one that really require us to just shut down and follow the beats of the film (Or in this motion picture case abbs, cheekbones and breasts)Then some of dialogue is a little frowning in terms of Anna telling Christian he is \"Honorable man\" which yes is a compliment and sweet but let's be serious he still beats birds in his red room and tips ice cream down her privates so perhaps he won't be nominated for Pride Of Britain Award this year.\nHowever there is some funny writing (perhaps we could have used more of) involving security trying to restrain someone and ask Anna if she has anything they could use, with the red faced response she might have cuffs.The other aspect about the film is notorious reputation of the sex. It's the sex which is the selling point. It's the sex that has the groups of girls queuing up with their mates for their fun night out. But all in all it's really quite tame. Not just tame it really doesn't go for it when in terms of a trilogy surely there is an escalation to make each film bigger than the last. An opportunity to make it the riskiest one yet is not capitalized on here.Like some sexual endeavors this might feel like anti climax for the amount of work put in but a climax none the less, that at least ties up the franchise securely like the cuffs from the red room.Let us all just hope with their rampant sex life, good looks and billions of dollars the couple finally find some glimmer of ever lasting happiness.",

Anastasia and, her Dan Bilzerian-husband, Christian get married and shortly after go on trips every weekend with his seemingly unlimited budget thanks his trust fund. The whole time. In the beginning, Anastasia keeps giving Christian blue balls and this makes him very mad. He uses his very kinky accessories, such as, handcuffs and whips, that he keeps in his torture-esque sex room to get her really horny and then stop before she climaxes. To throw off the confusing plot even more, their honeymoon comes to an abrupt stop due to an attempted break-in to Christian's house. Throughout the movie we see flashes of Christian's roid rage that he takes out on his wife for minor mishaps, for example when Anastasia doesn't want to be called Mrs. Grey. Halfway through the movie, three new random characters get introduced, one of them being Elliot who gets married to a fat pig... this was really disappointing. I fell asleep after this part, so not really sure what else happened, but I can assume it was filled with 2-3 more music videos that result in hot, sweaty sex between Christian and Anastasia. As soon as the base drops, Anastasia slowly unzips his far-too tight Abercrombie jeans with her teeth and the camera pulls away before we see his millimeter peter aroused by Anastasia's nice DSL's. In conclusion, Fifty Shades Freed should've never been made. It was a horribly written and uninspired story that masquerades as romance but actually amounts to an exasperating account of a rich prick who uses a young and innocent girl with really perky nipples for deviant and rough sex. He only lasts like 20 seconds max... SOFT, but he's following Rule 3 so I have to give him some respect.",

            "content": "\"Fifty Shades Freed\" is in the middle. It is fatally not a pretentious, complex or innovative film. But, even in its simplicity, the last part of the softporn saga fails. Completely following the other spectrum, Fifty Shades of Grey is a cinematic series that now reaches its third copy and ending - so we hope and hope. This third film, more than the previous ones, fits the definition discussed above: it is a film about nothing - and here it is taken literally.Niall Leonard's script is the worst of the entire trilogy, with some dialogues and completely meaningless moments. After the wedding, Christian takes Ana to his honeymoon in his private jet, when we see the young girl surprised that he has a plane. We are already in the third film and she still doesn't understand that he is very rich? There are clear demonstrations from the beginning. The whole development of the villain Jack is also poor, mainly the story behind, which addresses his relationship with former secretaries and assistants, in a completely reversed blackmail dynamic. Of course, Niall didn't get much help from the original text either. Although the film covertly tries to address empowerment, it evidently fails to invest in a relationship full of red flags. Behind what the author understands as romance, there is a permanent macho behavior, of possession. And the work is macho in several ways. On her honeymoon in Europe, she wants to go topless, he doesn't let her. The alpha male's jealousy promises to become a key plot point. No. She questions, provokes, but she willingly accepts punishment (sex with handcuffs). That's the whole movie. She fulfills the social pressure of positioning herself as a non-submissive woman, but soon agrees with Christian's impositions. When she goes back to work, Christian Grey freaked out because his wife did not take her surname professionally. Anastasia makes a common sense speech in front of the spoiled boy. Minutes later she answers for Mrs. Grey.Anastasia has finally realized the ultimate dream of transforming the immutable man and enjoys, between one drama here and another there, all that Christian can buy. \"I need to work, I can't stay at home choosing the wallpaper,\" she is reluctant, and then she leaves for mini-vacations in Aspen without thinking too much about her obligations as a \"fiction publisher\". More than Christian's jealousy or psychopathic ex-boss, Anastasia's big fight is with herself. She wants to be a model wife, buy nice clothes, make dinner and then a naughty little love with her husband, have two children, a dog and spend holidays on the beach, but the world demands that she imposes herself, that she resist the desire to a wealthy and ordinary life. On the other hand, Christian chases her like a boy afraid of being abandoned at any moment, who fears being a father because he does not want to share his mother. The plot is a disservice to any type of search for sorority or female autonomy. The duel between the character of Dakota Johnson and the blonde architect is embarrassing because it puts the two as females in heat in the fight for the alpha male. What is most shocking is how the moment ends: Anastasia can only impose herself by asking her rival to call her Mrs. Grey. Then she is authorized by Christian to drive the couple's car.What becomes more uncomfortable is the superficial and childlike form of the script to simulate a life together. Christian's fears about fatherhood are not explored (in fact, his response to the woman when asked about the topic is a simple demonstration of how the work's argument is some rough and unrevised draft). Anastasia's desire to break free from something, as the title suggests, is constantly ignored. Conversations in bed between the two emulate cheap porn from the 1980s, and the film's puritanism does not allow for original sex scenes or to demonstrate that we are following the daily lives of two newlyweds. Added to this is the conflict with the woman who initiated Christian into sadomasochism, Elena, who is inserted into the plot just to try to provoke a conflict between the couple, but which is soon overcome. In the final scenes, while admiring her beloved, before calling him to the red room to once again spice up Mom and Dad with ice cream, handcuffs or blindfolds, Anastasia remembers everything they went through together. She also remembers her jet, the sailboat, the glider and the luxury cars. Marriage gave him the freedom to enjoy sex and money. Anastasia is free to be herself, without the obligation to be interesting.Speaking of the film's raw material, sex, what is most daring in the work is the fact that the main couple stimulate each other's nipples with their tongues, a moment that the director, at least, does not hide. In fact, of all the films in the trilogy, this is the one that most uses nudity, although it gradually makes it trivialized, but director James Foley simply does not know how to shoot sex scenes. He opts for short sequences, closed shots that prevent audiences from watching the action and an annoying pop soundtrack that completely breaks the proposal and which unfortunately is repeated throughout the film. These intimate scenes, which should evoke the couple's chemistry, are deflowered by songs at high volume. There are no moans, whispers, provocations or any other less lazy features that involve sound editing and mixing, resulting in scenes that fail to reinforce the relationship of lovers or cause any major impact on the audience.And the problems in the direction and editing with the music do not stop there. In a chase scene, for example, the director misses a happy track, simply because Anastasia is driving the car, completely ignoring the fact that a maniac is on the lead. In the photograph, empty plans for the context of the environment reign from panoramic views of the city, the houses, the apartment; all mostly well-lit with direct light, medium brightness and almost no color identity for scenes or characters. Who saves the day is art direction, with an emphasis on Anastasia's office and the visually interesting sequence of drinks before Jack's invasion of the apartment. One of the moments where there seems to be a contest for those who make the most mistakes is the sequence in which Ana and Christian argue, the morning after the young woman reveals that she is pregnant. There, we have the best moment of Dakota Johnson in the film and one of the really good points of the text, which show truths on both sides of the coin. But behold, the director decided to shoot the sequence with a camera in fap mode and in a more open plan than it should, with a dynamic that looks like the camera is hanging by a cable swinging randomly across the set, preventing the viewer from diving as it should in the scene and breaking the possible opportunity to save a piece of the film that focused on the couple.To all this highlighted above, we could also add the appearance and disappearance of characters that supposedly would have some importance, but are only there to take time (Gia, the architect); the creation of pseudo-dilemmas that are resolved either in exaggeration or in extreme lack - the suggestion of the case of Christian's brother that goes nowhere, the suggestion of a possible case of security Sawyer with Anastasia's colleague and the drama itself final kidnapping, which more mischaracterizes the villain for what he represented the entire film than makes him a villain of weight to be hated, something that the text does not even bother to fix, while pretending to develop a parallel line with the family history Grey and Christian's adoption.And when sex is not the excuse to link scenes, irrational twists appear, like action sequences that have no climax or tension. The director tells the audience that Anastasia is going to be in danger when she waives her husband's presence, or when she decides to go alone to a place without telling anyone. And just as we know that the risk is being planted, we anticipate that nothing will happen. And if in the first two acts of Fifty Shades Freed the feeling is pure inertia, in its third act the film leaves the tracks for good. To shake things up a bit, the feature decides to add something to his narrative that might minimally resemble a plot, hence we get a cheating suspense, in which a criminal designs a laughable plan. Afterwards, everything is resolved and Christian Grey is ready to be a family man. Almost two hours pass before all the promises of conflict are fruitless and the happy ending comes.The final chapter for the franchise lacks any merit. The film repeats the same themes already discussed, but now there is nowhere to go. The characters are shallow, the conflicts are predictable, the villain is inconsistent and the sex doesn't seem real. It is a futile attempt to, once again, romanticize an abusive relationship. A narrative disservice, which asks the public to accept the need for a man to depend on a woman to achieve his own redemption, while she needs to be trapped in something, but is too inferior to understand what happens around her. It is a poor story, which becomes forgettable as soon as the final credits start to rise.",

            "content": "I was probably one of the only people on the planet who gave Fifty Shades Darker a very positive review. Its smut, just like all the films in the franchise but it was stupidly entertaining and I quite liked it. The films are nonsensical in plot but I felt that film had a bit of direction and better chemistry than the first film. Naturally, I decided to check out the final in the trilogy. Boy oh boy, is this bad. Its terrible. Easily the worst film in the series on all fronts.Anastasia Steele is now Anastasia Grey, as she and Christian tie the knot. Everything seems peachy at first- romantic vacations, passionate sequences, lots of sex. Then, there;s a stalker. Someone from Ana's past is trying to harm her and she an Christian need to boost of security and be careful of this new danger. Ana also starts questioning Christians loyalty. Thin, thin plot of course. I don't mind that so much if what I'm watching can be redeemed in another way. Not happening with this entry, its bad all around.The dialogues are so freaking bad, it has to be up there with some of the worst in film. I completely forgot the line but there was one where Ana was mad at Christian after she came out of the shower and then she starts putting her underwear on and says the most cringe thing ever. Really wish i could remember it. Somehow, the awkward sex scenes are awkwarder and you know what way stale. The film series has run out of gas in that department as these love scenes could have easily been outtakes from the first two films. The plot is nonsensical and nothing happens till the last twenty minutes. Its not even a fun time now just boringly dumb. Its too PG to make a statement in the BDSM community.I don't know about Dornan, but I quite like Dakota Johnson and the silver lining hopefully is seeing Dakota Johnson in more work in the future. And now, probably the worst trilogy of all time has finally come to a close. Freed felt like such an unnecessary effort which makes me wonder how uneventful the books must be. Yes, there are moments here and there but nothing that's going to leave a lasting legacy. Better now that its gone.4/10",

This means a) lots of sex, b) she occasionally lets him handcuff her, c) he tries to boss her around, b) she doesn't (always) let him. But other things lurk in the shadows of rich folks' lives...And here we detour from geek movies to sex. At least, that's what the adverts would have you believe. But this third and final episode in the 50 Shades saga is surprisingly light on flogging, cuffing, and reddened buttocks. Dakota Johnson flashes her perky boobs every now and then, but episode 3 is as unerotic as its predecessors.Instead we have a glossy view into how tough life can be if you are very very rich. OK, so we may be able to pop into the Lear jet for a quick weekend in Aspen, but that hardly makes up for an unwanted pregnancy or a deranged stalker. Curiously, those elements are what made this movie more entertaining than I expected. Once you get past the leather and buckles - and maybe that's your thing, maybe it isn't - Anastasia and Christian are quite likeable. Their goals and aspirations are not that different to everyone else's, it's just that they come with diamonds and Ferraris attached. And the final resolution of this everyday tale of beautiful, filthy rich sadomasochists is so comfortably middle class you wouldn't believe it. It removed the danger represented by Christian's Red Room and made everything cosy and safe. The mums and grandmas in the audience loved it. As the sole male in a cinema of matronly types, this was not a comfortable viewing experience for me. Nor, with the occasional exception of Miss Johnson's breasts, was it particularly titillating. Yet, in a slight and undemanding way, it wasn't unpleasing.",

            "content": "TL;DRThin, boring plot strung together by uninteresting and unnecessary scenesStrangely placed and unsexy sex scenes, with nearly no BDSM (the initial draw)Iffy acting and bad writing compliment each otherAn underwhelming 'climax'--------------------------It wasn't too long ago that the Fifty Shades of Grey was a common subject of conversation (and subject to much ridicule). Originally written as fan-fiction to Twilight, it became a pop icon and made a huge impact - at least that's what it seemed to be at the time. Still, as with many initially popular things, it proved to be just a fad; a graphic gimmick that soon lost its novelty. At first a graphic, poorly-written book, then a graphic, poorly-made film, the Fifty Shades series was ripe for laughter and fun (even though most of the fun was laughing at how awful it was). This was a single joke however, one that wore thin by the second film (and second book). Still, people don't like giving up too easily, and somehow these films have profited enough to warrant the third and final film - its 'climax' as the tag line jokes. So does this film give us a climax to end on a high?It's difficult to recount much of the plot since it's absolutely not the top priority (then again, it's tough to tell what any priorities were). It's largely a few weak plot points that somehow culminate in an underwhelming thriller-esque climax. Of course all these plot points are strung together by dull conversations and embarrassingly awkward sex scenes that seem forced and just shoved in as an after-thought - almost as if they made the whole film and only realised at the end that it was Fifty Shades and they need some sex somewhere.God knows what happened to the BDSM either. Other than one very tame and brief scene, it's almost no where to be seen. Softcore has never been so soft. Not that I'd have enjoyed it with more hard sex scenes, but since that's the initial draw for the audience, they ought to feel fairly cheated that the film really doesn't deliver on its promise. As beautiful as Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are, their sex scenes together are rarely sexy. Not even the circumstances in which they get it on are sexy; whereas porn finds turn-ons in plumbing and pizza delivery, Fifty Shades Freed finds turn-ons in eye-rolling and ice cream.It's a shame also that the characters of Christian and Ana are so bland. This isn't to say that it's all down to the failings of the actors; Johnson and Dornan have certainly proved their talents, but in other projects. Perhaps the fault instead lies at the director James Foley and writer Niall Leonard, for having an uninteresting story with blandly drawn characters. Still, it was always going to be a challenge considering from where they had to draw their material. The cringey acting compliments the bad script, both proving awkward and dull.Fifty Shades Freed is just about as bad as you would expect. With a lacklustre story, poorly drawn characters, sluggishly slow pace and unsexy, forced sex scenes, it doesn't matter how attractive the leads are or how funny it all is, this is just proof that sometimes fan-fiction should just remain fan-fiction.",

And I really got a sense during this movie, that they took the parts of Twilight that made it so awful (James, Victoria, the lot), and somehow morphed into garbage with incomplete sex scenes.I was in pain this movie was so bad. I only gave it such a high rating of 3 stars, because I've had the misfortune of seeing worse movies.The plot, like I said earlier, was pretty much the deal with James and Victoria and Twilight with different characters and incomplete sex scenes.The movie is mostly a show of Ana shirtless. And I hear a lot of people say pornography is degrading to women, and I'm not saying it isn't, but this is worse.\nAt least with porn, you do one job and you do it well.\nInstead this was a woman showing her breasts continuously, being sexed by her disgusting husband constantly, but without it actually fulfilling the duty of pornography, because we never see the man's junk, just her shirtless continuously. Sometimes we just see her breasts for the sake of seeing her breasts. Sorry, but if I want to just see different poses of a woman's breasts over and over again, I'll go follow tittyporn on Tumblr for free.The didn't have enough substance to be a story; the movie didn't have enough(or any for that matter) dick to be porn.\nThe one Harlequin Romance book I finished, Wrong Bed Christmas, had more story than this garbage.",

This movie was the worst of the trilogy, mainly because storyline was weak and the script was extremely corny but the stalker background story made it slightly interesting. The sex scenes became tedious after a while, because we have seen the couple do every position possible in the previous movies, and the acting wasn't that great. Anyway, in this last chapter of the Fifty Shades trilogy, Christian Grey (Jamie Dorian) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) have finally tied the knot but Anastasia is finding it hard living the Billion dollar lifestyle, which is totally controlled by Christian. With a new threat on the horizon, the couples life is in danger, so Christian hires bodyguards to watch over them 24/7. Anastasia then finds out that she is pregnant, which puts a strain on there relationship because Christian doesn't want to be a father, so the newlyweds new life together doesn't have the best of starts. The stalker then demands $5million from Anastasia, because he has kidnapped Christian's sister but Christian manages to take control of that situation, even though Anastasia went behind his back to make the transaction. With Anastasia getting hurt during the dramatic confrontation with the stalker, Christian comes to terms with the pregnancy, and they live happily ever after. Awful storyline! I was expecting the franchise to end with a bang but every aspect of the storyline was boring and uninteresting. It seemed to be a battle for control between the couple, and with all of the money in the world at there fingertips, they really needed to put a twist in the plot to make It relatable and interesting. Anyway, I think you can tell that I really didn't like this film but I'm sure the readers of the books would have enjoyed it. Disappointing!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by James Foley, 64, who also brought you At Close Range, various Madonna projects, the great Glengarry Glen Ross, Fear, The Chamber, The Corrupter, Confidence, Perfect Stranger, 12 episodes of House of Cards, 2 episodes of Billions and Fifty Shades Darker. He's obviously not new to the movie making game, and I'm quite a fan of some of his work but this movie wasn't adapted for the big screen that well. With the writer of the books, E.L. James, in the producers chair, I can't totally blame the director for the end result and judging by the profit I can't really see them complaining. With the high popularity of the books, I'm not surprised that audiences flocked to the cinema to watch the trilogy but I haven't heard a good word said about the franchise. That's just proof that hype really does sell!Budget: $55million\nWorldwide Gross: $369millionGenre: Drama, Romance, Thriller\nCast: Dakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Eric Johnson, Eloise Mumford, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Max Martini, Jennifer Ehle, Marcia Gay Harden, Callum Keith Rennie and Bruce Altman. 2/10",

Even for the antagonist \"Jack Hyde\"; the treatment that is given is hilarious and saddening at the same time. despite Being shorter in duration compare to the previous two parts; it succeeds in getting us bored. Draggy sequences of Love and Sensuality is way beyond the level of acceptance. Repetitive nature and glaring similarities on many occasions do disrupt the whole ambience. They clearly turned up the heat for this last part of the Trilogy but forgot the other immensely important aspects. For example, Whenever a Situation that was definitely in desperate need of Tension came up; the writing just gone sideways, ignoring even the basic textbook build up of a Thrill.; instead it turned itself into a Bleaker outcome in regard of that. Zero suspense whatsoever. On the other hand Cinematography on Lavish locations and a Soundscore that fits the Luxurious Lifestyle surely grabs our attention in Every frame but that's just about it.

            "content": "The international best seller that changed the world is a topic of much debate. Tasteless porn vs. incredible love story, this series has two extreme groups fighting for superiority on what is the truth to the Grey series. However, since many people don't read these days, Hollywood has brought a visual representation to us to help stem the tide and get more people discussing the content of E.L James work. And so, yours truly, alongside some very kind friends, heads into the trenches to give you another review on what is what in the movies. Let's get going!LIKES:The Romance: The romance, as the fans will call it, has finally improved to the levels many wanted it to be from the start. Fifty Shades Freed finally has our actor's chemistry mixing well to portray a more realistic love story than what I've seen. Rather than bland, uninterested looks, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan finally have some heat into their acting actually seeming to love each other than just tolerate. The drama that fans want is packed into their on-screen time, a nice balance of overdramatic anger, passion, and desire in their little game of domination cat and mouse. While still unbelievable at times, the magic finally raised to a new level for the final installment. The Jokes: Such a dark delicacy as this requires some more adult humor, and Fifty Shades Freed's writing is able to bring this humor to full blast. Clever alliterations, metaphors, and puns are well integrated into the goopy, lovey dovy, romantic bologna this movie is famous for. These comedic devices are well-timed and well-delivered to maximize the punch that comes with it and had my friends and I chuckling. Had there been a few more of these moments, the movie's writing might have gotten even more points for creativeness and magic. Semi-Tasteful: Despite the sultry atmosphere contained in these films, the censorship is still decent enough to add some class to the movie. Rather than diving into the pornographic details that some of the fan-base loves, the movie keeps the camera work on the upper areas, straying away from the lower anatomy. Even the love making scenes have been tempered a bit to not dive into XXX levels, but it barely skims by this. Still, the small bit of class gets my nod of respect. The Ending: My friends and I agreed that the nice little nod to the series as the end was a good way to cap of the series. Simplistic and predictable yes, but for those super fans, it is the emotional finesse you may have come to expect in the series. And for the beginning credit, and only clip, it's the ending that had many in my showing ahhing in delight. The Music: My final nod is at the director of music, who once again picks a slamming song track to represent the emotion of the scene. A combination of genres, the selections are worthy of another soundtrack worth purchasing, assuming you are into those kinds of things. \nDISLIKES: The Sex: Let's get this out of the way. No surprise, I'm not the biggest fan of watching two actors make strong, awkward, and often strange sex fantasies come to life. And Fifty Shades Freed was more than happy to throw a lot of these vivid images at me. While a bit classy, these scenes didn't fit into the story as much for me, nor did I really appreciate how fast and rapid they were crammed in. The positive side is that these montages are at most 3.5 minutes long, but I'll never look at ice cream the same way again.... Ewwwww. Secondary Characters: I don't remember the books quite well, but I'm fairly certain the secondary cast goes farther than their cinematic doppelgangers. Yes, I know the story is mainly about the star-cross lusters, I mean lovers, but this supporting group of families and friends should be you know... more supportive. So why were much of the supporting band reduced to mere minutes of screen time with little to add to this tale? A few clips of beautiful people, a tempting dramatic flair that goes nowhere, a shallow proposal that is cute but lacking, and some shotty presentation of key story elements are all they contribute. After such integration in the first film, I had hoped for these components to strengthen as well, but they failed on this aspect for me outside of the fact that so many of them were pretty to look at. Boring Tension: Let's face it, the story is not the best part of these series, but I had hoped that the antagonist would have had more bite to his coiffed hair. Fifty Shares Freed did little to amplify the deadliness of Hyde, outside of making him look and sound even more insane. The promise of a man with more brains and strategy was lost to low grade soap opera antics that just served as an example of poor planning. I've seen better villains in a cheesy soap opera, and this anticlimactic climax was so disappointing to see fail. While many may not be looking for super excitement, this reviewer would have liked to see more bite than bark. Oh well, at least more room for love, right?The VERDICT: Overall, Fifty Shade Freed has improved in regards to the romance that this series has tried to sell. The heated passion between the main characters took some major steps towards progress in this series, alongside the jokes, the soundtrack, and the nicely packaged ending. However, the story itself is laughable, with all these plot points and known character diluted into less concentrated beings that are only there for a quick head nod out of the series. Fifty Shades Freed is a glorified soap opera on the big screen, and therefore not worth the price of admission in my opinion, no matter how passionate, emotional, and hot it may seem. Save this one for the privacy of your own home and your imagination. My scores are: \nDrama/Romance/Thriller: 5.0\nMovie Overall: 4.0",

'Fifty Shades Freed' however I am not able to say the same things about. Everything I enjoyed in the first two films is gone and everything I didn't enjoy remains. Needless to say that's far from ideal.This time around the relationship just did not work for me. Firstly, it didn't feel evolved enough. It still felt like 'Ana' was completely clueless as to how a lot of aspects in their life worked. There were countless questions she asked that would have made perfect sense in the first film, but not the third. Secondly, all the charming inspirational stuff from the first two was gone. In those films 'Christian' felt like a 'James Bond' type character with the wealth and the gadgets and the charming persona. This time around they just bickered like a couple of teenagers for most of the film. At no stage did 'Christian' come across charming. He simply came across bitter, jealous and unreasonable. Everything in the film feels so half-hearted. The love scenes are about as bland as you could ever imagine. This has been a problem for me right throughout the series. The whole \"bondage, play-room, dominatrix\" (whatever you want to call it) was so boring. It felt like a complete after-thought and yet it was the point of difference these films possessed. Also every plot point in the movie is just completely phoned in. Entirely unrealistic and yet still somehow as straight-forward and uninteresting as you'll ever see in a cinema-released film.It's lucky this is the last film in the series I have to say because if the films continued to slide in quality at this rate they would become unbearable pretty quickly. There's very little to like this time around and if you have fond memories of the series from the first two films, perhaps consider giving this one a miss.",

The movie goes from bad comedy, to mystery, to bad romance movie in an instant. It also never seemed like the two main characters were ever in love. All they enjoyed doing was each other, and every sex scene seemed pointless. It felt as if the sex scene were there only because they had to be. I think most of my entertainment came from trying to figure out what emotion I was supposed to be feeling, and figuring out why they loved one another.

Throughout this flick, this Fat Cat scourge is shown running amok along America's roads, bridges, interstate highways--and even along its logging routes: no public by-way is safe from these self-centered speed demons. Viewers also will detect during 50 SHADES FREED that these greedy One Per Centers constitute a major predatory drain on the U.S. cash money supply, thinking nothing of waltzing into our banks and traipsing out with five million bucks (depriving we 99 Per Centers of approximately 50,000 individual ATM transactions to fund such necessities as diapers, bathroom tissue, and loaves of bread). Furthermore, movie patrons who've seen the first FIFTY SHADES offering will perceive that deplorable moguls such as \"Anastasia Steele\" tie up so many of America's surgeons with their constant desire for augmentation that cancer has yet to be cured! It turns out that many if not most of these Billionaire Monsters are unwilling (or unable) to have kids by the old-fashioned, traditional method. Instead, they use a Real Life selection process far more grueling and torturous than anything seen in such Dystopian Youth Flick series as MAZE RUNNER, KINGSMEN, DIVERGENT or THE HUNGER GAMES. The main takeaway from 50 SHADES FREED is that U.S. billionaires in general--and Christian Grey specifically--have to compete to gain a post-natal silver spoon in their mouths IN DETROIT AREA FOSTER FAMILIES!! Nothing could be more cruel and grueling than such a fate worse than death, as Truth Teller Jack Hyde--Christian Grey's Detroit foster brother--points out here more than once!",

The series main story-line of the chases, gratification, then more delayed gratification then even more build up for a huge climax for part 3. But, and there is a but, the final stages were awkward, and fumbled for a huge let down. A few romance scenes were awkward and did not fit into Fifty Shades Freed. They looked like outtakes from the first two installments such as awkward editing from flying to suddenly driving a car, and having characters crammed into and out of scenes throws Freed's rhythm off. The off rhythm creates plot holes of how and why did this happened? My wife told me the final installment edited out character developments, and parts of the story were left out from the book! The last quarter of Freed is a good story if one did not see the first two parts, which makes me wonder should part two just been made longer. 5 stars,",

Honestly, I still need to see the first two movies, I know some might think it's pretty weird that I went to see this final installment without seeing the first two, but it was part of a fun single friends Valentine's Day celebration. So first I'll share what I enjoyed in this film. I liked Dakota Johnson as the lead, Anastasia Steele (now Grey) since they get married. I think Johnson plays Anastasia well, I especially liked the scenes where her and Christian are fighting and she confronts him, her acting skills are shown off there especially. I think Jamie Dornan fits the look and overall style of Christian Grey well, although his acting skills are lacking. The sexual side works well, the steamy sex scenes work because of the sexual chemistry between the two. Now for what I didn't like. Like I mentioned before, Dornan's acting skills do need to be improved upon, especially if he desires bigger, better roles in Hollywood. Yes, he has the look and he's sexy, but I felt like there were times where he just wasn't bringing it all, where his performance seemed rather wooden. Also, I feel like the Hyde subplot could've been a good bit better, juicier and more interesting, was kind of let down by that. I guess that part is supposed to be thrilling or something, but wow it's just not. Granted, I did not see Fifty Shades Darker and maybe I need to see that to fully get that subplot, but even still, I never once felt tense or thrilled because it was just handled poorly. This is a film that is trying to stay afloat on a very thin plot, and has a male lead that is just not a good actor. I understand the appeal, I do, but we have porn or erotic novels for sexual thrills, I don't get why people like these movies. 3/10 for Fifty Shades Freed.",

But then there are may little things that dim the lights on this outing - less sincere chemistry between the lead couple, too much meandering in wealthy parties, an unshaven Christian Grey (just to keep up with the styles) and the addition of some unsavory characters who attempt to add tension but without enough back story to make it work.The plot - Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Ana (Dakota Johnson) marry and believing they have left behind shadowy figures from their past, newlyweds Christian and Ana fully embrace an inextricable connection and shared life of luxury. But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending before it even begins.

Fifty Shades Freed sadly was a complete miss when the film did not improve from the others. It still fell under its terrible writing, stale performances, and a plot less erotic romance movie that not only had no story but did not add anything new to its genre. I am only excited that the series is coming to a conclusion. Not a good one. But it does wrap its story and why Christian Grey has had his issues with wanting things a certain way.The plot follows right after the second movie. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) both get married. They go on their honeymoon with several trips to Paris to a hiking resort. And have lots of sex. The sex scenes were not that appealing to even be categorized as an erotic movie to begin with. Meanwhile, Anastasia stalker Jack (Eric Johnson) from the last movie were she rejected his offer of being with him. He is so obsessed with Anastasia that he is willing to go extra lengths to sabotage Grey's company and her life. That is basically all there is to the plot. No progression to the story. Just seeing Christian and Anastasia traveling. While he gives Ana a lot of rules that he wants her to obey which she does not listen. And a stalker that is suppose to build up to the climax of the movie. The script is filled with clich\u00e9s and terrible dialogue. Which also does not help with the performances. I thought the performances would improve through the sequels. Apparently not. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan both give stale performances like they are reading straight out of the script. At least, it is a little better than Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies. The direction does offer some beautiful landscapes and cinematography shots of Ana and Christian's traveling. Filled with a worthwhile soundtrack. I have never read the novels. I am not sure how steamy the sex sequences are. But I feel like the film does hold back and censor it down. There are several sex scenes that may excite the erotic enthusiasts with the genre. Overall, Fifty Shades Freed is a bad film. It serves well with concluding the trilogy and a mid credit scene that will have the fans go aww. The film brings nothing new to the table. Performances were stale, direction and plot was dull, and the script is terrible with clich\u00e9s. I do not recommend the film. Unless you are a huge fan of the novels and the previous films.

            "content": "It's been 7 years since the controversial book FIFTY SHADES OF GREY arrived on the pop culture scene. The story of college student Anastasia Steele and young billionaire Christian Grey, their flirtations and their involvement in the BDSM scene took the country by storm. At first many wondered if the movie could make it to film with the sexual fetishes involved. Silly question. If money can be made then of course a movie will follow. The movie based on the first novel came out to huge success spurred on by the controversy that surrounded it. That was followed by a second film since the book was part of a trilogy and a third later. That third movie, FIFTY SHADES FREED, arrives in disc this week. Not having read the books I have to assume it remains faithful to its source, unsure if that's a good or bad thing.If you've never seen the other films but plan to, realize there are spoilers in this review. The film opens with the wedding of Ana (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) followed by their immediate departure to Paris for their honeymoon. This is interrupted when a call alerts them that his office building has been broken into, files stolen and a minor fire started. They rush home and in checking CCTV footage discover the person responsible is Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson), Ana's former boss who was fired for sexual assault on Ana.Christian has a security team assigned to Ana for her protection as the search for Jack begins. Determined to keep her life as normal as possible Ana continues to work for the publisher she always has, though she's been promoted to the position Jack once had. A call from her best friend Kate (Eloise Mumford) has them meet for a drink after work even though she promised Christian she'd go straight home. When she does arrive home she's threatened by Jack who is taken out by the security team.This sets in motion the pattern of the relationship in the film for the pair as Christian becomes angry at Ana for not following his instructions alternating with their numerous sexual proclivities. This time their adventure into the \"red room\" where they enjoy their BDSM moments takes a nasty turn and Ana stops him, telling him this time it's about revenge rather than love. She then tells him that she needs to be able to have time with her friends. To show he loves her Christian then plans a weekend away in Aspen for Ana with himself, Kate, his brother Elliot who is dating Kate and his sister Mia and her boyfriend Jose. After returning home Ana discovers she is pregnant, something they had discussed and planned for later in life. Christian, rather than be happy about the situation, is enraged and the two fight. Seeking advice he gets drunk and turns to his ex-lover, angering Ana in return. A kidnapping involving Mia by Jack, who's been released on bail, and an attempt to save her by Ana brings the final portion of the film around.So is the film any good? Well there are several things that one needs to know going in. If you haven't seen the first two films and want to see this one, find the others first. Or you can look online and find out what happened in those two before watching. If you fail to do so nothing will make sense to you here, it depends on your knowing the story and can't be watched as a stand-alone film. The film is gorgeous to look at. The cinematography by John Schwartzman is stunning. His list of credits is impressive and he makes what could have been a standard movie look amazing. He captures the beauty of the various locations of the film as well as the intimate moments between the characters equally well. Director James Foley, known for a number of hit films, turns in a solid job as well but with the source material to control much of what happens it leaves him little leeway to put his own mark on the movie.The acting by the leads is solid but the story provides them little more than caricatures to play. The range of emotions bounces from one extreme to the other with little nuance between the two. And in a world of #metoo Hollywood continues to push the standard they've set forth providing plenty of bare skin for Johnson who seems fond of doing her nude scenes here and perhaps one posterior shot of Dornan. Criticisms of the novels the film is based on discussed the poor quality of storytelling and that becomes obvious here. It is by far the biggest problem with the film. Plotlines that should be major issues are wrapped up with quick asides and the lack of depth in the characters is apparent. Were it not for the wealth of Christian odds are the sensuality that some find in the series wouldn't seem erotic and be more abusive, a controversy that has surrounded the series in both book and film formats. In the end I found myself not quite entertained but not completely offended either. The movie was just...there. It won't be remembered like the classic love stories and romantic films of the past. Instead it becomes a novelty, a movie wrapped in salacious controversy that isn't likely to garner praise or repeat viewings. If you're a fan you'll want to see it, if curious you'll probably check it out and if not the odds are you'll pass it by.",

You see more in a single episode of an HBO series.And the plot, again quoting IMDB:\"Anastasia and Christian get married, but Jack Hyde continues to threaten their relationship\"Like with Darker, that all happens in the blink of an eye. You sneeze and you'll miss the bulk of the plot.

It's like watching linoleum curl on a hot day.We aren't watching it for the plot anyway, just give us the cream filling we are actually buying the ticket for, otherwise give us an actual plot.you gave us neither.",

            "review_title": "Empty Way To End The Series",
            "content": "After watching the final conclusion of the romantic fantasy thriller \"Fifty Shades\" series, I was left asking myself \"what was it that I was watching\"? Even though there are a lot of clever ideas to bring to the final chapter of the franchise, it will leave you without a thing to think about afterward. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" showcases that this film is a romantic fantasy made to look like a rape fantasy, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" uses the philosophy that being sexually mistreated as an adolescent gives you the courage to embody erotic intentions into your adulthood. And though this final installment is more tamer than its predecessors, there is nothing very positive in its morals.The film proceeds as Anastasia Grey (Dakota Johnson) marries Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Their journey that lead to their marriage had the typical couple struggles, their preparations of starting a family together are cohesive, but another lady, Gia Matteo (Arielle Kebbel) comes into their lives and tries to wreck their marriage as she becomes a bit too flirty with Christian. And these tempting moments are highlighted with promiscuous activities such as bondage with handcuffs and eating ice cream off the lower crevices of their anatomy. But the grandest moment of their marriage is that an evil intruder named Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) is continually making Ana's life a living hell. This leads Christian to hire top officials to protect her.The whole stalker angle is just a mere distraction as nothing is fully fleshed and that Jack is only on to create tension and that his presence is just unimportant to the viewers. He's just a little villain to cause some mischief for the sake of cheap tension. In fact his subplot is nothing but filler demonstrates how little effort was put into the screenplay. The intentions now shift from a women involved in erotic role-playing to a cheapened direct-to-video thriller.And that leaves us wondering about the martial woes this couple endures throughout. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, it's strange a film of this calibre would be released. Ana seems to be ignoring the obvious red herrings that describes the traits the movement clearly opposes. Christian is controlling, aggressive and can be quite tempering towards her. He follows her everywhere to make sure she's not doing anything behind her back. He's a liar, rich and toxic to the max who uses her as a trophy wife for the sake of his own ego. She may not like his self-serving attitude, but still takes in his requests and they think it's all right because they're in love. Are you serious?Of course the crew is only recreating the writings of E.L James' novel and that it's just a harmless adaptation. That's fine except that the script was written by her husband Niall Leonard who could have found alternatives to better the scenarios. But no, it's better to show scenes of two people eating ice cream on their body parts.Just to show I'm not completely negative I'll say this movie still succeeds in providing rich cinematography. The score is backed with wonderful pop songs to keep you in the mood and the acting from Dakota Johnson is pretty decent. And for the record there really is never a mundane moment.There's not very many films that invite you to the world of sexuality, but when it does, it gets dumb down to an extended soap opera with little going for it except some petty naughtiness.",

            "content": "Fifty Shades Freed reviewed: Now I know what you are thinking, why the hell did I see this movie in the first place?? Especially considering I have never seen any of the other Fifty Shades movies. Simple answer, a really hot Tinder girl invited me out and her idea of a first date was seeing Fifty Shades Freed; although I had less than zero interest in seeing it, I did ascertain that walking into that cinema with that girl will be really good for my ego...that part was true, unfortunately though, the walking in only lasted a few seconds and the movie lasted a few hours, therefore the price I had to pay is that I am now brain dead, RIP me; I don't even know how I am managing to write this, at the moment. Okay fine, I should probably talk about the actual movie. I don't know how many of you are familiar with the concept of Dada Cinema, but basically it was a term created for something that had no plot at all, zero, nilch. I can say this is probably the closest I've gotten to discovering a film that can fall within that category. Birdemic, Woodchipper Massacre, THE ROOM...movies I intentionally watch due to their ineptness, all of them have more plot than this movie. The closest it does get is a stalker plot involving Anastasia's ex boss, but this is treated more as a sub-plot, except it really is the only plot, so how exactly does that work? I'm not even sure the writers can answer that one. Okay, so let's get to the important thing: the acting, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, Bella and Edward if they were naked throughout half the film..there is a theory that if actors hate each other in real life, they are often able to use that hatred to create great chemistry on screen; take for instance Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in 'The Notebook', their onscreen feud has become infamous, but what did we get out of that? A new genre classic. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan got half way there...their onscreen feud has become somewhat famous as well, unfortunately though, where other actors were able to use that hate to bring emotion to their performances, these two simply look like two people who can't stand the sight of each other, who are now being forced to perform sexual acts for a third time, due to contractual obligations. I can honestly say, I have never before seen a big budget film, based on a popular series of books, with two leading actors phoning it in as much as these two - and that includes Kristen Stewart and Robert Patterson in 'Twilight', yep, I just typed that sentence. There were several sex scenes during this film where I started laughing hysterically; I'm guessing my date thought I just felt uncomfortable but nopes, I was legitimately amused watching these two trying to act. Now that said, I will stick up a little for Jamie Dornan here...what the hell was he supposed to do with this little ass wipe of a character?? Are we seriously supposed to be routing for him? The guys is a sociopath, not only that but he is a self involved, whiny, mama's boy. There were two thoughts running through my head throughout the majority of this film, the first was hoping that they'll kill him off at the end so that Anastasia can inherit his millions and end up with somebody else, even the stalker, I don't care, just anybody except him. The other thought was how the hell this movie was going to end, seriously, how do you end a movie with no plot? Honestly, I won't out of common courtesy, but I could type out the entire ending right here and I won't feel like I have spoiled a damn thing, that's how insignificant the ending to this trilogy is. Now I will give two compliments to this movie though: one, I thought the soundtrack was actually really good and two, I loved the cinematography, especially during the wedding scenes - whoops did I just spoil the movie's first 90 seconds for you - you'll live, but I'm serious, this was good stuff, so good actually that, just like with Twilight Breaking Dawn *sigh*, I'll probably be making my videographers study these shots...lol no wonder I can't keep an assistant. \nIn closing though, I'm not going to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, it doesn't even reach the top 100 mark, but it is a dull and phoned in effort that only exists to cash in on the success of a popular book series and while those books were infamous for how badly they were written, this is simply too unmemorable to become infamous for anything.

I read all three books and even though I think there never should have been more than the first book the author got as creative as she could with it. Leave it to a woman to take a character like Christian Grey and have him end up married with 2 kids. Men like Christian Grey don't get married and have kids. It should have just been an affair a young woman experienced. Having said that its obvious the author ripped off Twilight but took out vampires and put in sex. If you've read or even watched both franchises that should be incredibly easy to see. I thought this movie was pretty much exactly like the book but better. It was much better than Darker and more entertaining than the first. Their sex isn't as kinky anymore but hey, that's marriage for ya. To sum up my biggest complaints with this franchise were casting Jaimie Dornan who is a mediocre Christian Grey and a bland actor in general and not showing him full frontal. I never understood that. Even Michael Fassbender did full frontal in that movie Shame and that was just a movie about a sex addict. 50 shades is notorious for sex so why not? But like I said the most annoying thing is all these idiots who watched these movies just to b***h about them.",

I suspect that the girl in 2015 and the young woman in 2018 enjoyed all three movies just about the same. Over the series It sort of went from the crazy of teen years to the more serious of the young adult.The actors are enjoyable, they give weight to their characters and i belive that just like you cant think of Legolas (for example) without thinking Orlando Bloom, you wont be able to read the novels or see the movies and imagine other actors in their places.The ending was good and it make me leave the cinema with a feeling of satisfaction and a smile.",

            "content": "From a neutral point of view and recognizing exaggeratedly-low quality standards, one could say that the franchise has come from more to less, a decline that has bottomed out. Although the first entry had the benefit of doubt by those who got E.L. James' books as a toxic literary venom, also visually looked acceptable and attractive, adding the surprising boom it received thanks to artists as The Weeknd, Sia, Beyonc\u00e9 and Ellie Goulding whose commercial triumph of their pop hits belonging to the soundtrack, and furthermore, it breaks new ground for a studio by being one of the first movies to materialize a polarizing sexual practice (BDSM) \"without taboo whatsoever\", yeah, this must be discussed when it only shows the breasts of the leading role; does a lightness strengthened by movie ratings guarantee higher grosses? A set of factors that ensured an almost general magnetism for audiences with the idea, as it ended its worldwide run with a whopping $571 million dollars. Two years later, \"Darker\" hit cinemas, and all the minimum possible expectations disappeared. Only a heavy-handed few expected a better made and structured sequel, so do I, but a really few correct shots and the musical success that went to ZAYN and Taylor Swift by \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" were the only two saveable components of another pathetic and cheesy loving mess that, personally, served as a definitive signal to understand that this romantic follow-up movie was one of the worst in the history of cinema. Today, the lucky climax comes to theaters again produced by mega-studio Universal Pictures, now things are sweetened in excess, because of being a story about sexual maturity - by the way that never really happens - of a twenty-seven-year-old self-made millionaire and an English literature college student, it becomes a story about the usual post-marital problems between a dominant man and a now-empowered woman who wants to have children but not to stop screwing \"hard\" with her husband, nothing suggestive, a headache with new levels of humiliation before a mostly-great movie studio. It's possible to define the incongruousness, incompetence, absurdity, pedantry of this script in just one two-word line, which is paraphrased by the great actress Dakota Johnson through, sadly, the role giving her worldwide reputation. That affirmation takes place in the initial scenes of the film, where they want to celebrate a major event, and she said it with such insolence that is offensive: \"Is it yours?\" (She's talking about a private jet with two beefy security agents on the doors.) What? How is it possible that after a year and a half sleeping together in the same bed, an enviable salary and an almost-a-trillion-dollar grossing she doesn't know that she must stop talking nonsense, he's your husband now, you know he has tons of money, don't you?, with just one sentence, this film provoked an absolute suppression of a serious and rigid review, therefore, I simply sat down on that dark seat to capture blunders and blunders from the beginning of the action to the arrive of the closing credits, I survived miraculously. The situations are odiously synthetic as the same film contradicts its convictions, it gives vain power to a woman, who a few seconds later, is tied to the cold bed, being crippled with the sexual deprivation of her husband, I think It isn't the prototype of tale that feminist movements request right now, nobody wants to see a film that preaches one thing and practice another, a pure-marketing joke like this cannot be accepted. As well as many of the unsatisfactory lame present-day audiovisual productions, the script intends to endow a kind of artificial empowerment to Anastasia, however, the plasticity doesn't last long due to the poor and incongruous material Johnson gets: At what point does Anastasia Steele become Vin Diesel in Christian's onerous car? The failed granting of female power is worsened by a harmful mix of genres, a tendency in excess in the chaotic second part. You will suffer a love, maturation, action, kidnapping story, a thriller, a cheap comedy and, in short, a miserable and comical hotchpotch of genres in the worst effective ways conceived by Hollywood. Absurdities emerge from the script like hotcakes, here another one of them: Christian keeps unreasonably an eye on his wife due to a writer with \"presence\" who discusses possible contracts with the firm, nonetheless contemplating his obsessive and maniac jealousy, he hires a handsome bodyguard who could easily be the one to get his dear girl off his side, wait a minute, what? Is that logical? Although there are no plane crashes, labor harassment, suicidal chicks or older \"friends\"; there are incredibly unbearable plays deriving from such rich issues as responsibility, marriage and motherhood.Normally, in my reviews I talk about performances in a positive way, i.e., if such a component isn't a strong point in the film I opt to omit it, however, most of the time I evaluated them since they are a fundamental part in the harmonious ensemble that made up a feature film. With surmised anticipation, \"Freed\" has broken the rule. I'm ready to write, with the utmost respect and humility, about Jamie Dornan, Eric Johnson and the remaining cast, except Dakota, who performed lousy characters, at least, that keeps it coherent. Watching the opening scenes and instantly perceive the lack of naturalness and estimation in performances is awful and sad, there is no soul or charm, they're deprived of any dynamic or potential, just unmotivated, they seem the first labor opportunity of college actors, it's terribly unacceptable. Likewise, the leading male character never loses that look of concern or that frown when some fatuous vicissitudes arise in the script, we never knew about which \"fifty\" shadows they've been spoken for more than three hours, he simply seems to be an eye-candy and something else. Dakota Johnson is the only one who impregnates a bit of love on her character, half-heartedly. All right, she's tender, na\u00efve and unnecessarily submissive, but Johnson knows how to turn the card around and get the spectator to try to accept her motivations, an event that never happens. It must be noted that \"Freed\" plays a similar role to \"Dunkirk\" for British singer and songwriter Harry styles or \"Mudbound\" for Mary J. Blige, the radical difference is that Rita Ora doesn't get the expected result with a pastiche character. Another damsel in distress who must be harmed by a stupid villain is unhelpful for this multifaceted woman to show off all her talent, but at least, compared to other characters, crying gagged in a chair surpasses many of her co-stars.It's cumbersome and delicate to talk about this feature owing to its nature but it's a matter to discuss: the sexual scenes. It's not a secret that for many people the main motive inciting them (mostly young people) to attend a theatre is the curiosity to watch them surrounded by a considerable number of people, a couple having peculiar erotic relations, intimate acts portrayed on the screen smoother than the explicit and bawdy descriptions by the author in the books. Inside a tub, at Mia's, in red rooms, black rooms, cars or beds, any clich\u00e9 and \"coveted\" place will have the shameful DNA of \"Freed\". Artistically, they aren't a feat of art, shots that focus on Anastasia's panting mouth or Christian's muscular back, arrhythmic sequences in which you can feel the lack of feeling between these actors. Nor does it have much to brag about in visual terms. From Seattle cold landscapes to luxurious closed spaces, the movie is, almost entirely, locked in the city and in burdensome rooms, only a couple of scenes were filmed in a forest. Metallic colors predominate and a beautiful white is only glimpsed at the beginning, a necessary contrast of repetitive dark nuances. In a nutshell, visually, you expect on the screen, again and again, Johnson's breasts and the same black shoes that Christian wears in two different scenes.Easily the best part of all this suffering: a fantastic musical accompaniment. And we don't talk about the work done by Danny Elfman, usual composer of the franchise, we refer (again) to catchy hits from artists such as Julia Michaels, Hailee Steinfeld or Rita Ora and Liam Payne, who take part of a score that will be the next playlist for millennials for a while, electronic danceable sounds provide a kind of uninhibited tone to the scenes, the sad thing here is that even these songs are inserted in a wrong way, I mean there is no cohesion between harmony of a song and the timing of the moment, besides, there are some hits really wasted thanks to falsely ingenious intros. Christian closing the door of his red room in the face of his audience is a cynical sign of the little importance that the demanding public meant to this franchise. Seeing women and men dressed as the bride and groom going into the theater reflects the scope achieved by Universal's movies in the mind of most fans of books and movies, however, the opposing group, the disillusioned ones and/or detractors, has to make do with an ending very similar to that of \"The Hunger Games\" saga- with a scene almost identical -, which concludes the story as badly as it was developed. \"Fifty Shades Freed\" by James Foley finally says goodbye to the goose that lays golden eggs, bye bye melodramatic loves and dopey plot decisions, gone are those dark times, the light has come not only for the protagonist, also for the public. The short summary created by the flick in the third act, shows the abysmal decay that the movie suffered, simply to conclude with an ending as stereotyped as the film itself. The movie franchise was a very tough nut to crack, but Universal Pictures has broken hearts this Valentine's Day, because its great love, that lover which gave it exorbitant amounts of money, is gone forever, so they say.",

Jennifer Lawrence, Blake Lively, Margot Robbie, Amanda Seyfried.. oh the list goes on of the women who would have played this role much better. The franchise obviously made a lot of money from the books but ruined the films. Thank goodness it's over!\nYou would think they would have learned from the first two reviews!

            "content": "The third and final entry in the \"Fifty Shades\" series has arrived with the release of \"fifty Shades Freed\". The story opens with the wedding of Anastasia (Dakota Johnson), and Christian (Jamie Dornan), and follows their honeymoon in the lavish locales of France.\nThere getaway is cut short by an act of sabotage at Christian's company and it soon becomes clear that a person from their past has taken things to a dangerous level which requires Christian to implement security measures for Anastasia and their extended family.\nIn between the intrigue presented by the threat, we also have numerous scenes of nudity and eroticism as Christian is not going to give up his dominating needs anytime soon.\nCombine this with a new revelation that threatens to disrupt the crafted and controlled world he has created for himself and Anastasia; the tensions rise between them making a dangerous and stress-filled situation even more complicated.\nWhile the film does have a better plot and is more engaging than the previous films in the series it is hampered by many of the same issues that hindered the series. The two leads have zero chemistry with one another and their supposedly highly erotic scenes are so routine and by the numbers they lack any form of excitement or real titillation. The film also has this message that behavior that would be considered highly unacceptable in others seems to get a pass for Christian as he is a handsome billionaire. He is a very selfish and controlling individual who demands obedience. While Anastasia does have a strong enough character to stand up to him, she tolerates behavior that would be considered unacceptable by many and seems very quick to give him a pass when lavish gifts and trips are bestowed upon her. I wonder how romantic and acceptable his behavior would be if he was a struggling musician who did not have the financial resources to create fantasies and buy his apologies. I know the film is supposed to be romantic fantasy but this really annoys me as he exhibits much of the behavior that is considered unacceptable and to be avoided at all costs, yet it is all wrapped up in a sweet bow of forgiveness.\nThat aside the series does seem to be losing steam as the last film earned less than the original film and \"Fifty Shades Freed\" is tracking to open well below the last film as well. Fans of the series will likely enjoy it as a satisfying finale, but I really expected more from the final moments of the series as after following the characters, the ending seemed very anti-climactic.\n2.5 stars out of 5.",

At this point in my life I was l evolving out of my traditional, Church based beliefs in so many ways. I am still a Christian but just a much different one. What I love about this series is the love story and passion this couple had and how both learn to adapt to be with each other as that is the most important thing for both of them (and in any relationship). For those who think it is all about sex, you are missing the true mark of this story. NOW, about this movie!!! My daughter and I both agreed this was our favorite of the three because it did a really GREAT job of taking the best of the book and making it into a 2 hour movie. It took the best parts of the book and accelerated it into a very good movie that stay true to the book. I absolutely loved it!! Every 10 mins, it encompassed a part of the story from the book in a respectful way and I never felt like something was missing!! It was my favorite of the three movies!!

Christian Grey is supposed to be so handsome when he walks into a room all heads turn. Christian Grey is supposed to be fierce and when angered makes you quake in your shoes. The scenes where he is supposed to show anger and being feared instilled not fear in me at all and if I was Ana, I would have laughed not quivered in fear. Yes, poor casting is what doomed this franchise, in my opinion.",

They are just too polarizing and shallow without actually dealing with various qualities of this film in order to find common ground of discussion for both lovers and haters.I want to concentrate on the plot as something that both audience groups must have noticed. No I will start of as the simplistic reviews I was criticizing, but yes, the plot is boring and half-witted. I mean I really didn't have any expectations at all (I survived the previous two movies just alright) except maybe I was looking for a change in the narrative, maybe reflecting upon all the critics. But no, it is still the same. The film tries to get your attention (again) by boasting about the fortune and the stuff Mr. Grey can buy and really, this was boring in the second movie already. And because there is no chemistry between the leads, it totally looks like the only appeal Grey has towards Anastasia is his body and money. I will take a wild guess here that in the book, as I haven't read them, it goes from wild sex to love, but here the love is not visible at all. And the wild sex neither, I mean it is kinda your everyday sex with few extra tools, nothing steaming hot, just normal stuff. For me, the hotest one was in the car to be honest - the only one with some passion in it.So this is kinda the first part of the movie - money display. The second (they both mingle) is about Jack Hyde's revenge and here we get from boring to boring and stupid. Jack Hyde is on one hand almost a ghost, a genius who can break into data highly secured centers and apartments and can utilize just a small time window to follow Anastacia as soon she escapes from her detail in that R8. But on the other hand, he is a dummy who gets caught like a small child because he's not careful enough. Then we go through completely unnecessary Anastacia's silence towards Grey as she is forced to meet Jack - totally illogical right? What was her plan you say? And are we supposed to believe, that that driver woman blackmailed by Jack, risking just a new porn video online, would commit such a deed risking being guilt of kidnapping, murder and possibly other charges, spending therefore a lot of time in prison? I don't think so.Although I am a guy, I do enjoy romantic movies sometimes, but this one is not romantic, is not interesting and doesn't make lot of sense. I went to see it openminded and was disappointed anyway.",

            "content": "First, let me give this movie the microscopic credit it's due... there's more nudity in this movie than probably the first two combined, which for a movie that's supposed to be about a hot, sexual, BDSM couple, you kind of need that. So, if you like seeing Dakota Johnson's bare breasts fairly often, you're in luck here.And that's where anything good about this movie stops dead in its tracks. First, and this goes for the ENTIRE franchise itself, you don't actually see any real BDSM-style activity happen until literally the last ten or twenty seconds of the movie. By that I mean you don't see Ana actually being a submissive in a BDSM sense until then throughout all three movies. Everything else is nothing more than either kinky sex that probably half of the population has done at one time or another, or... nope, that's pretty much it. This movie is actually the first time in the entire franchise that safe words are even mentioned, which is a HUGE part of BDSM and is the very first thing discussed by any couple that partakes of that kind of lifestyle. Like, when Christian is spanking Ana 'so hard' (insert sarcasm here) in the first movie, a safe word would have been pretty damn important there. What's more, the time she does use the safe word is because he's teasing her with a vibrator and not letting her orgasm. Now, the moment immediately following that make it seem like she's upset that Christian was using orgasm denial as a means of revenge on her, but that's not how the scene itself actually played out. For one, he was using the vibrator on her for maybe a grand total of five seconds before she's ready to blow, does maybe a couple of seconds of orgasm denial and teasing with her while saying that's how she makes him feel, and suddenly she's safewording out because the physical sensations are too much? She's handled hard spankings, ben wa balls, and butt plugs just fine up this point. If she'd safeworded in a way that showed she was pissed he was doing it for revenge purposes and that upset her I wouldn't have a problem, but she did it because she was saying it was too much. For a sexed up girl like Ana, who can't get enough of Christian, that just made it completely contrived to create tension.As far as the villain part of the story... well, that was just flat out annoying. Not even boring, just flat out annoying and insulting to law enforcement. First, we're expected to believe Hyde is some kind of James Bond/Mission Impossible super spy that can (a) get into supply closets in Grey Industries using a visitor's key card (don't even get me started on how Hyde got in in the first place because either his security are morons or, well, see super spy comment), (b) hack what I'm sure is some pretty damn high level security encryption for the company's server room using a science fiction high tech 'reader' on the touch panel, and (c) plan a pretty damn high tech looking bomb in said server room. The suspension of disbelief here is just beyond acceptable. What's more, they have video evidence (which admittedly is shoddy at best but the movie says it's a crystal clear view of him) of him in the building planting the bomb, and the guy somehow breaks into their super secure penthouse condo with not a single member of security knowing about it, grabs Ana, and puts a freaking BOWIE knife to her throat before getting taken down by security. If that wasn't enough, Ana is visited by the detective for the case, one who thinks its unimportant to get all the facts right away so certain details can be forgotten with time, and says Hyde has a bail hearing (which this movie things defendants need to actually request instead of it being one of the legal rights and part of due process) and that he's going to argue that he was just trying to \"talk\" to her about him getting fired after assaulting Ana in the last movie. Right, so, the movie expects us to believe that there's even a slight chance that a court of law would believe a man who literally bombed a building and then broke into someone's condo to hold them at knife point with the intent of kidnapping her, with witnesses to this fact no less, when he says he just wanted to \"talk\". That they even pull the whole 'it's your word against his' bs is so utterly insulting to law enforcement it's disgusting. So, of course, a guy with probably no money (because from the look of him he's spent it all on cocaine or heroin. Seriously, the guy looks like a career drug addict in this movie) is somehow able to post $500,000 bail and get out to wreck even more havoc. Right, sure.Then there's the whole pregnancy thing because Ana apparently forgot to get her (I'm assuming it's Depo) shot that we are only NOW hearing she actually takes. Of course, this doesn't sit well with Christian, who promptly freaks out. Of course, abortion isn't even mentioned as a possibility. This leads up to a whole situation where Christian's sister is kidnapped by Hyde, which sets up a whole ransom plot that is just annoying as hell because no person involved at this point acts like a rational human being, and Ana is sent to the hospital because she was slapped twice and kicked once in the stomach. Apparently, this is enough to put a perfectly healthy twenty-something woman in the hospital to such a degree that its implied she needed surgery (she's taken to a surgical ward according to the wall signs so what else can we assume?). There are twelve-year-old children who do that to one another on the playground and are fine literally a minute later. And you can't say its because she's pregnant because she's only seven weeks along by this point, and the doctor says the baby is fine so it wasn't like she was in the process of miscarrying. This is basically E.L. James and her husband (who wrote the screenplay) trying to manufacture fake tension to garner sympathy for two characters who deserve none.Beyond that, half of the movie is scenic B-roll footage, sex scenes... some of which literally come out of no where for no reason, and utter nonsense like Ana suddenly becoming incredibly skilled at high-speed evasion driving in a major city landscape, buying a house strictly for the purposes of Ana telling their architect (who irrationally wants to tear down a gorgeous old mansion instead of restoring it like any sane architect would do) to piss off and stop flirting with her husband, and Christian knocking some guy out for creeping on Ana in a nightclub because... we needed yet another scene to prove how possessive and protective he is of Ana I guess.Ironically, Christian's very creepy possessiveness is still very much in force in this movie and shows itself right in the beginning of the movie when he gets angry at Ana for taking off her bikini top on a beach where just about all of the women there are doing it. This, of course, is ignored by Ana and they just jet ski back to their boat because by this point she's clearly suffering from Stockholm Syndrome which is the only way she would still be with and marry a sociopath pretending to be a dominant.This movie pretty much insults the entire demographic it was intended for. It insults those interested in the BDSM aspects by completely disregarding everything about that particular lifestyle that involves safety and both parties actually caring about one another, it insults romance fans by making Ana this weak-willed girl who only has the appearance of strength because Christian says she's tough and wilful, and it insults pretty much every other kind of movie goer by throwing completely stupid, inane, and utterly unbelievable plot lines at us that would be laughable if they weren't so offensive to anyone with a decently functioning brain.I didn't have to pay to watch this movie and I still want a refund for the time I wasted on it. Dakota Johnson is a very attractive woman and the multitude of naked or panty-only scenes were nice enough, but throwing some skin at the audience doesn't make for a good movie, it just makes for a cheap skin flick that didn't deserve a franchise with a Hollywood budget.",

Sam Taylor-Johnson read the novel and realized it was a love story. The first 44 minutes of the film depict Ana's journey from innocent virgin to the discover of her libido. You can watch those 44 minutes and savor every second for their perfection.\nFifty Shades: Darker, in the novel told by Ana continues her journey into Christian's world.\nFifty Shades: Darker, in these films the new director decides that, since he's a guy, he will rewrite the story and tell it from Christian's viewpoint: BIG MISTAKE.\nEverything he does is wrong.\nFifty Shades: Freed, in the novel tells Ana's struggle to force Christian to GROW UP. It's a tough assignment but she works hard at it. Christian thinks from a guys point of view that EVERYTHING about SEX should be controlled by the guy. At EVERY turn Ana shows him how wrong he is. \nFifty Shades Freed: in the movie, all the parts about Ana are either cut or minimized, It's Christian's way or the highway. Even the final scene where she must defend herself from Jack Hyde's sinister plan, to how she has to keep Christian out of the way, or Hyde will mess his sister Mia up. The movie cuts to Christian chasing after Ana, finding out ALL the nitty gritty of why she's doing this. By the time he gets to the scene it's like he's the Conquering Hero arriving to save the day. Bullcrap. Ana is the Heroine. He's just there to supply the male appendage.\nNO, NO, NO, NO,\nThese are ANA's storiies. Christian is simply a bystander to her growth in knowlege and love.\nThe director misses the entire point of the novels. \nThe ONLY redeeming value is at the very end, the editor inserts movie clips from 50 Shades which show how the story SHOULD have been told.",

There's not real passion, emotionally it is flat. I'd recommend 365 days over this anytime. At least the actors are cast well and have some passion, emotions going on. Not just plain coldness pretending to love each other. And her empowered self is just not working. She is just not a leadership material. And the sex scene after a car chase? Seriously?

There is no real story in none of the three films -unless you call a jealous boyfriend with sex troubles and the attempts of his girlfriend to fix them -a story.

            "content": "Let me start by saying I love the books, can't stand these movies. This final one was slightly more watchable then it's predecessors, but only slightly. I found the plot more engaging, at least this one has some suspense. The acting is horrible. While Dakota's acting was semi tolerable as Ana, Dornan as Grey literally was so laughable and unbelievably lacking I could barely stand to watch it. He was so 100% wrong in the role of Grey, it was painful to watch his attempts. I don't think he's a horrible actor but this role was just not suited for him. His entire persona missed the mark, which ruined the entire series. Absolute worst choice ever for the role of Grey.The scenery is lush and nice to look at, which helped make the movie more enjoyable.Music was hit and miss, mostly missing the mark entirely. I think in 1 or 2 places, it was perfectly suited, while in all the others it completely ruined the mood and tone of the scene. Sex scenes? I was struggling not to laugh out loud at them. Dornan and Dakota have zero chemistry and their awkwardness seeps into every scene and just annihilates any tiny possibility of sex appeal. Also incredibly stupid is that these are films geared toward women, and still in every film we see mostly Dakota naked and practically nothing of Dornan. I don't want to see Dakota's nipples over and over, I want to see more of Dornan. Duh. Obviously a man was in charge of this film. The entire movie felt unbelievably cheesy. I couldn't help but laugh at parts of it, the cheese factor was so high. Dornan is not intimidating at all, Dakota is not convincing as a strong female character either. They are both so watered down that it becomes a nauseating lukewarm concoction of blech. Loved the books. Laughed through every one of these movies. I desperately hope that in 10 years or so they will remake this trilogy and do it RIGHT this time. Casting is everything. Find a Grey that fits the part. End of story.",

Firstly, it wasn't as great as I remembered from way back and the storyline seems awkward. The movie makers are trying to sell \"sex\" way too much and it gets BORING by the third movie. I'm fast-forwarding the sex scenes now (also sex must be dry/rough because there's zero foreplay sometimes and he enters? Ouch!) Also do you really have so much sex like every second every day? They get turned on at the sight of each other (I'm 25 and I've been there too) but this is wayyy too much. Almost as if they're really pushing the sex-narrative sheesh. Enough already.She's a fresh graduate virgin who is deflowered by a 27-ish-old Billionaire (super hard to believe, he should at least be 30 but who cares abt being realistic) and she's immediately super into Rough Sex/ BDSM now which is ridiculous. Her fears and vulnerability arent showed enough IMO. Being there, it's a broad subject with a lot of grey area, but none of that is shown. They could have at least made this movie to create some positive conversation surrounding this topic but no, it comes across as something only traumatised sadists would do. There's no curiosity from her end. And the character Ana makes weird unnecessary noises throughout the 3 movies (not moaning, but hmmmm's and mhhh's and sighs and random giggles when no joke was made) it's totally awkward for the viewer.These movies really don't do justice to the books at all. Some reviewers were correct, this is soft porn and really has completely forgotten the actual storyline and it's just a bunch of different sex scenes slightly connected with some dialogues now.But I enjoyed watching the fights, his backstory and his vulnerability showing. Wished the directors would have explored that side towards the latter part and removed the sex scenes because YES WE GET IT, he's into BDSM and he's great at sex. But gimme a break, please!The 6/10 stars are on the entire trilogy.",

            "review_title": "Good, but had plenty of issues",
            "content": "Like many women, I've read all 3 books about 20-30x over, enjoying the story. I fell in love with the books because Christian's character is so raw and beautiful because of his tragic upbringing, and then turning his life around and becoming a confident and successful man. The scenes in each book when he tells Ana that he loves her profusely and is vulnerable, I connected with Christian and made me want to be with a man like Christian. \nAnd so far, for the first movie, the script was pretty much on point with what happened in the book, which I can absolutely accept as a good sign. One of the biggest thumbs up I can give for Fifty Shades of Grey is the first red room scene Ana did with the crop: that was better, in my opinion, then how it was written in the book so, that was perfect! I understand that they wanted to present the beginning of Mrs.Robbinson into the story, but the whole walking on the trail to the pond part was a little boring and could've been done a little differently. I would've wanted a little more dialogue to have been put in for the movie, but I understand that they have a time limit.\nFor Fifty Shades Darker, I liked the way, in the book, that Christian and Ana meet up again. The movie version was ok, but it was more raw and more of a emotional and connecting reunion in the book. I liked the sex scene in Christian's old bedroom. It was good in the book, but I also like it in the movie, so I'll accept both versions. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't put the dance auction in the movie, because part of me feels that that scene was what would help the audience see a side of Christian Grey that loved Ana with a passion and would've been fun to see Christian bid on Ana for the dance. I'm also upset that they never mentioned Dr. Flynn because the scene in the book where Ana and Christian go to see him at Flynn's office to discuss the idea of Ana marrying Christian would've been perfect for the movie because it would've explained more about Christian and how he is and how Ana felt about their relationship. Lastly, the scene where Ana comes home to Christian's apartment after Leila almost attacked Ana was almost too short. There wasn't much of Christian looking very vulnerable and trying to fight for Ana. In the book, I loved at how vulnerable and open Ana and Christian both were when they were telling each other their fears about Ana not being good enough for Christian, Christian being afraid that he might;ve been the reason that Leila had a mental break down. What annoyed me almost the most was the fact that Ana arrived at the answer that Christian punished brunette women because they all looked like his mother: in the book, she was shocked to figure out that information, so for her to say it like she already knew was almost annoying because if you want the movie to match the book pretty well, then you need to keep it pretty consistent. Again, they could've put a little more dialogue into the movie to understand more of the story, but I understand that they have a time limit.\nFifty Shades Freed, um... I felt it kind of slipped through the cracks... I don't know about everyone else, but the movie in my opinion had WAY too many jump cuts!! It's like: in one scene, if someone is supposed to say: \"Thanks for having us over today,\" the scene in the movie sounded like \"Thanks for having...,\" like it wasn't overly finished. I think they cut out WAY too many scenes and expected the released version to be $1M product. If people have looked at how long the movie is: it's under 2 hours, like 1 hr 45 minutes! The other 2 movies were 2 hours - 2 hrs 15 minutes! The movie was WAY too short! They could've put SOOO much more in the movie! I understand that the director wants to put their own spin on the movie, so they'll add scenes or change up the scene to experiment with it, but changing it is not always a good idea. When Ana comes home and is attacked by Jack - that was an ok idea, but to me, that was a little expected, and I liked the book version better. Along with what I mentioned about jump cutting: In the first 2 movies, you don't know about the importance of Christian using condoms when they have sex, so that Ana doesn't get pregnant. The fact that they randomly put in a scene when she goes to see Dr. Greene, when she was never mentioned in the other movies. Yes, Christian mentions her name once in the first movie, but that was such a short part to where her magically appearing to let Ana know that she's pregnant was cheap and wouldn't make sense to the audience unless you read the books to understand the story. They didn't even show the scene where Leila came to see Ana to talk to her before she found out she was pregnant, which would've been good footage to put in the movie, but they decided to cut that out too, which I think was a poor decision. They didn't even put in the movie where Ray gets into that car accident, and then Ana goes to see him in the hospital, which would've also been good footage, which was a poor decision to take out. The hospital scene with Ana was too short, which could've been a few minutes longer. They didn't even give Ana and Christian any dialogue at the end with their son at their new house, which would've been nice to see them talk with their son a little, to have something other then 2 seconds to see them, and then end the movie. Also, the fact that they took out the scene where Christian and Ana go to Christian's parents house to see the family was taken out of the movie, so that was annoying, and I was almost more annoyed that they put Christian singing and playing the piano in the scene where they go to Aspen instead of at the parents house. I just don't like the fact that they were switching up the events that happened in the book and putting them in different parts of the story. Even when they go to the nightclub, I hate the fact that they took out Christian hitting the guy in the club. To me, that shows his devotion to Ana and the fact that they took it out was really upsetting, and they should've known how taking that out was going to make the fans feel. That's something that someone who has the books would review because if you don't read the books, how do you know what you missed in the movie?\nI want to clarify: I AM NOT prejudice in any way, I do not have any issues about it, but the character change was a little baffling for me. In the books, they don't describe the looks of Ana's assistant Hannah, but from what I know, Hannah is not an African American name, so that had me almost rolling my eyes. Ros, Christian's coworker, assistant, whatever she was, was describes in the book as a red headed women, but then turned to an African American woman, so that was a little bit of an eye roller. They described Detective Clark as a blue eyed man, but had an Asian-American man play the role... These little things may not mean much to the audience because it means that these actors get jobs and get paid, but it's almost annoying when they change the characters up that much to where someone like me has to point out the differences and ask why, that's saying something.\nOne slightly good thing I can say about Fifty Shades Freed: I wasn't overly in love with it, but I liked the scene where Christian takes his revenge on Ana for changing her mind. The book still had a good scene within itself, but I feel like the movie gave me a clear image that matched the book at how angry he was and I could hear and feel his anger, his fear for Ana's safety, and his enjoyment of settling the scores.\nI just wanted to point out one last thing: As I mentioned before, I've read the books from cover to cover 20-30 times, and I felt all the emotions of the characters down to my soul because the characters are alive with emotions that you feel what they feel. In the movies, I felt like the characters were barely scratching the surface. Example: Christian (book) is a controlling man that has a quick temper, but loves with a passion and is raw. Christian (movie) is a controlling man, but is very chill about almost everything, doesn't get angry quickly, and silently shows how much he loves Ana. I wasn't overly feeling the Christian Grey that was in the book, I felt like I was watching someone that wasn't Christian Grey, but someone else. There's a reason that I like the books more, not just because that the entire story is here in the book, but because I feel the true emotion and the rawness of the characters in the book. I'm happy that I've seen the movies, because they've given me an idea of the visual story line of books. I can admit that, in my opinion, I think that if Jamie Dornan was closer to the Christian Grey character in any of the 3 movies, I feel like it was the first movie. Watching Fifty Shades of Grey, I felt like Jamie was closer to the Christian Grey in the books, but then melted away by the Fifty Shades Darker, and then changed completely by Fifty Shades Freed. The question of will I ever buy the movies, more then likely, I won't because I had so many issues with almost all movies to where I'll either find the movies for free on some random website, or I'll just watch clips of the movies because none of the movies were anywhere near perfect. There were some good points in each movie, but not enough to make it into the history books as one of the best romance saga's ever in the history of movies.",

            "review_title": "The book is better than the movie. Don't waste your time with an eyesore of a movie.",
            "content": "Like many women, I've read all 3 books about 20-30x over, enjoying the story. I fell in love with the books because Christian's raw and vulnerable character. And so far, for the first movie, the script was pretty much on point with what happened in the book, which I can absolutely accept as a good sign. I understand that they wanted to present the beginning of Mrs.Robbinson into the story, but the whole walking on the trail to the pond part was a little boring and could've been done a little differently. I would've wanted a little more dialogue to have been put in for the movie, but I understand that they have a time limit.For Fifty Shades Darker, I liked the way, in the book, that Christian and Ana meet up again. The movie version was ok, but it was more raw, emotional, and connecting reunion in the book. I liked the sex scene in Christian's old bedroom. It was good in the book, but I also like it in the movie, so I'll accept both versions. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't put the dance auction in the movie, because part of me feels that that scene was what would help the audience see a side of Christian Grey that loved Ana with a passion and would've been fun to see Christian bid on Ana for the dance. I'm also upset that they never mentioned Dr. Flynn because the scene in the book where Ana and Christian go to see him at Flynn's office to discuss the idea of Ana marrying Christian would've been perfect for the movie because it would've explained more about Christian and how he is and how Ana felt about their relationship. Lastly, the scene where Ana comes home to Christian's apartment after Leila almost attacked Ana was almost too short. There wasn't much of Christian looking very vulnerable and trying to fight for Ana. In the book, I loved at how vulnerable and open Ana and Christian both were when they were telling each other their fears about Ana not being good enough for Christian. What annoyed me almost the most was the fact that Ana arrived at the answer that Christian punished brunette women because they all looked like his mother: in the book, she was shocked to figure out that information, so for her to say it like she already knew was almost annoying because if you want the movie to match the book pretty well, then you need to keep it pretty consistent. Again, they could've put a little more dialogue into the movie to understand more of the story, but I understand that they have a time limit.Fifty Shades Freed, um... it was a complete train wreck! I don't know about everyone else, but the movie in my opinion had WAY too many jump cuts!! It's like: in one scene, if someone is supposed to say: \"Thanks for having us over today,\" the scene in the movie sounded like \"Thanks for having...,\" like it wasn't finished. I think they cut out WAY too many scenes and expected the released version to be $1M product. If people have looked at how long the movie is: it's under 2 hours, like 1 hr 45 minutes! The other 2 movies were 2 hours - 2 hrs 15 minutes! The movie was WAY too short! They could've put SOOO much more in the movie! I understand that the director wants to put their own spin on the movie, so they'll add scenes or change up the scene to experiment with it, but changing it is not always a good idea. When Ana comes home and is attacked by Jack - that was an ok idea, but to me, that was a little expected, and I liked the book version better. Along with what I mentioned about jump cutting: In the first 2 movies, you don't know about the importance of Christian using condoms when they have sex, so that Ana doesn't get pregnant. The fact that they randomly put in a scene when she goes to see Dr. Greene, when she was never mentioned in the other movies. Yes, Christian mentions her name once in the first movie, but that was such a short part to where her magically appearing to let Ana know that she's pregnant was cheap and wouldn't make sense to the audience unless you read the books to understand the story. They didn't even show the scene where Leila came to see Ana to talk to her before she found out she was pregnant, which would've been good footage to put in the movie, but they decided to cut that out too, which I think was a poor decision. They didn't even put in the movie where Ray gets into that car accident, and then Ana goes to see him in the hospital, which would've also been good footage, which was a poor decision to take out. The hospital scene with Ana was too short, which could've been a few minutes longer. They didn't even give Ana and Christian any dialogue at the end with their son at their new house, which would've been nice to see them talk with their son a little, to have something other then 2 seconds to see them, and then end the movie. Also, the fact that they took out the scene where Christian and Ana go to Christian's parents house to see the family was taken out of the movie, so that was annoying, and I was almost more annoyed that they put Christian singing and playing the piano in the scene where they go to Aspen instead of at the parents house. I just don't like the fact that they were switching up the events that happened in the book and putting them in different parts of the story. Even when they go to the nightclub, I hate the fact that they took out Christian hitting the guy in the club. To me, that shows his devotion to Ana and the fact that they took it out was really upsetting, and they should've known how taking that out was going to make the fans feel. That's something that someone who has the books would review because if you don't read the books, how do you know what you missed in the movie? I want to clarify: I AM NOT prejudice or racist in any way, I do not have any issues about it, but the character change was a little baffling for me. In the books, they don't describe the looks of Ana's assistant Hannah, but from what I know, Hannah is not an African American name, so that had me almost rolling my eyes. Ros, Christian's coworker, assistant, whatever she was, was describes in the book as a red headed women, but then turned to an African American woman, so that was a little bit of an eye roller. They described Detective Clark as a blue eyed man, but had an Asian-American man play the role... These little things may not mean much to the audience because it means that these actors get jobs and get paid, but it's almost annoying when they change the characters up that much to where someone like me has to point out the differences and ask why, that's saying something. I just wanted to point out one last thing: As I mentioned before, I've read the books from cover to cover 20-30 times, and I felt all the emotions of the characters down to my soul because the characters are alive with emotions that you feel what they feel. In the movies, I felt like the characters were barely scratching the surface. Example: Christian (book) is a controlling man that has a quick temper, but loves with a passion and is raw. Christian (movie) is a controlling man, but is very chill about almost everything, doesn't get angry quickly, and silently shows how much he loves Ana. I wasn't overly feeling the Christian Grey that was in the book, I felt like I was watching someone that wasn't Christian Grey, but someone else. There's a reason that I like the books more, not just because that the entire story is here in the book, but because I feel the true emotion and the rawness of the characters in the book. I'm happy that I've seen the movies, because they've given me an idea of the visual story line of books. I can admit that, in my opinion, I think that if Jamie Dornan was closer to the Christian Grey character in any of the 3 movies, I feel like it was the first movie. Watching Fifty Shades of Grey, I felt like Jamie was closer to the Christian Grey in the books, but then melted away by the Fifty Shades Darker, and then changed completely by Fifty Shades Freed. There were some good points in each movie, but not enough to make it into the history books as one of the best romance saga's ever in the history of movies.",

The movie is not fast paced or an elaborate plot masterpiece - and it does not intend to be. It is about trauma, love, pleasure, pain and the messiness of life for the unpretentious watcher.

All three of these movies could've been combined into one movie with about 2/3 of scenes removed. It felt like it took forever to watch. Apparently, the books these movies are based on were all written within 2 years -- and it's quite obvious. With proper editing, this whole trilogy could've been condensed into one (hopefully good) book.The acting in this one was probably the worst out of all of the movies in the series. It was particularly bad towards the end of the movie when Mia is held ransom. Very exaggerated and far-fetched.Overall, Fifty Shades Freed is as a forgettable movie as its prequels.
