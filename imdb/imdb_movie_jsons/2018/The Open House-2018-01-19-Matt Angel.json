            "content": "I watched a Netflix original film a while back called, \"The Ritual\" and it was pretty good. Not perfect, mind you, but it had me and my fiance's full attention and though I would have done some things differently, it worked. So I was looking for a horror movie in the woods and though this one was not totally in the woods the description made it sound interesting and it also made it sound like a supernatural horror...IT ISN'T!!! It is a very stupid and lazy home invasion movie that seems to promise some revelation at the end, but doesn't! The story has a father being killed leaving the mother and son in a tough situation. The mother's sister offers the use of her house in the woods since she is not using it and trying to sell it. Why the sister who is obviously loaded doesn't just help the mother with her bills is beyond me, but hell, I can deal with that. The catch with the house is that every Sunday there is an open house and the mother and son must leave during the time it is happening. After the first open house, strange things seem to happen as you guessed it...someone is now in the house. I was hoping something sinister was going on during the time on Sunday like demonic events, but no, the dude in the black boots is terrorizing mother and son while they throw red herrings all over the place and you get to watch him kill both of them and get away with it. Great ending...So my guess is, if the writers of this film made The Sixth Sense, the twist would have been Bruce Willis' character cures the kid because there were no ghosts. The revelation would have been nothing! People theorize the killer is a serial killer and that his MO is hiding in houses during open house events, but that is unlikely. For one, the house was not being lived in, like a good deal of open houses. What, he is just going to hide out until he decides there is not anyone there? No, I am guessing he took offense to the mother almost hitting him so he went there to get even and decided he liked it so he was going to try again. Still sucks. I imagine the writers of this film with their man bun and puffing on their vapes thinking this was a totally clever ending and the only people who like this thing being hipsters themselves. What it really is, is lazy ass screenwriting. The film was not all bad, as I did think the actors all did a great job and they did a good job making me wonder what was going to be going on; however, once I figured it was just a home intruder and not anything supernaturally sinister going on I began to lose interest. The ending made me want to punch the writers of this in the face. By the way, turning off the pilot light of a water heater will not cause the water to go ice cold immediately!",

            "content": "The Open House is a Netflix original movie and presently sits at no.55 on the IMDB bottom 100. So the IMDB community deems this to be the 55th worst movie ever made. I have to disagree, but there is no denying just how atrocious it is.It tells the story of a mother and son who move into an open house after a tragedy befalls their family. As per the usual trope weird things begin to happen in the property.The trouble is, well.................there are a lot of troubles but first of all the movie is..........wait, honestly I don't even know where to start here.Awfully paced, dreadful characters you simply can't care about, a billion unanswered questions, the film ultimately goes nowhere at all! Basically the only redeeming features the film has are marginally decent cinematograpgy and a beautiful setting.The Open House is fully deserving of all the poor ratings, it's the absolute pits.The Good:Beautiful locationThe Bad:Cliched to incredible levelsUnlikeable charactersServes no purposeThings I Learnt From This Movie:Nothing, in fact I'm pretty sure it caused brain leakage so I've probably forgot some stuff",

Cheap and easy.This film is the opposite, it's deceptive and not in a \"ahhh wasn't expecting that\" sort of way. More a feeling of being completely ripped off and dissatisfied kinda way.\n We honestly really enjoyed a good majority of this film, so many things that look like they're building up to a really good twist at the end. Mysterious characters, red herrings, things that could be linked together in a really cool way.How naive and utterly wrong we were.There is no point to this film. Literally, why was this film made?\nIt's like they employed a really good writer for the first half of the film who put together a brilliant structure and then some idiot decided to take over and realised he/she was in over their head. \nBy the last shot I was honestly screaming \"DO NOT ROLL CREDITS\" and my sister had to restrain me when the goddam screen went black.This review may seem extra, but I have never been so angry, frustrated and disappointed by a potentially great film.I urge you not to waste your time. I have to go cool off and try and forget the fact I ever watched this piece of rubbish.",

            "content": "There are some good Netflix exclusive movies out there, but there are also a number of poor efforts, and \"The Open House\" is one of those stumbles. While it is definitely a bad movie, I didn't find it quite as bad as most IMDb users here have found it. The production values were good for what had to be a non blockbuster budget. Also, the first half of the movie does have a little mood and eeriness. But otherwise, the movie pretty much screws things up. I could live with the setup being somewhat familiar, but the execution of the setup is quite badly done. Most of the movie (especially in the first half) unfolds at a REALLY slow pace, with no real strong thrills or plot turns to keep the viewer actively engaged. The lead characters also seem very dim-witted, not seeing that something is seriously wrong before things turn very serious. Also, while the movie seems to be setting up for some surprise plot twists and turns, NOTHING about this setup pays off in the end. There is no real explanation as to what is happening and why, and what we have seen before the ending seems just to have been padding before the very unsatisfying conclusion. While I will admit that the movie could have been a lot worse, I really can't see it entertaining any particular viewer.",

Not one answer to the who what when where or why of this s....tfest. This was my first 2018 review of pure crap, and when. I say crap, I'm being nice. AVOID at all cost. There are enough reviews on here to read that concur this movie sucks major ass. There is absolutely no plot to this film....NONE And to the writers of this garbage.

The town has several creepy and odd individuals that talk about the house the family is moving into. After settling into the house thats up for sale, they begin to experience odd things that terrorize them, and there is nothing the cops can do, just some kids trying to scare the newcomers they say. Unfortunately the film is just that, thin and has been done over and over. And with a sub-par ending that left me disappointing and unfulfilled. Who or what is it? And why is this happening? You'll never know. The only redeeming qualities is the beautiful scenery, but to be fair nature doesn't need good directing to be beautiful. The sound score is also ok, adding some tensions to the predictable scare scenes. The characters are very one dimensional and only a few actors do a respectable job with their character. Don't get me wrong, some actors do an ok job, but most of the acting is very averagely performed. The scare scenes, while averagely done, will be scary to some light weights, but for horror veterans, you will not be tense and see it coming because the film is a regurgitation of countless other films.Over all I wouldn't recommend it, I know you can find a better film to watch.",

            "content": "Saw 'The Open House' on Netflix a while ago, being fond of horror/thriller regardless of budget (even if not my favourite genre) and being intrigued somewhat by the idea. Being behind on my film watching and reviewing, with a long to watch and review list that keeps getting longer, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it.Unfortunately, despite not reading any reviews purposefully before watching, am going to have to agree with all the reviewers who hated 'The Open House'. A film that started off pretty good, but ran out of steam very quickly and rapidly got worse by a second half that makes one not want to keep watching. Never judge a film without seeing the whole thing and wanted to give 'The Open House', so gave it a fair chance.As said, 'The Open House' started off pretty promising. Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton give surprisingly good performances considering the material, especially Minnette. The soundtrack has some nice moments (i.e. \"Silent Night\"), when it isn't being intrusive and annoying.However, so much brings 'The Open House' down. The rest of the cast struggle to do much with so little to do and the direction is so phoned in and pedestrian, one gets the sense that the director showed no interest in the film at all. Too much of the soundtrack is intrusive and annoying, made worse by the excessive and obvious sound effects that just cheapens the mood. The film looks drab generally and like it was made in haste.Where 'The Open House' most underwhelms is the writing and story. The writing is incredibly lazy, it's awkward in dialogue, very confused as a result of not tying things up or going into full detail and doesn't feel complete. The story suffers from a very limp pace, apparent early on and gets slower and slower until an interminably dragged out second half. It further suffers from feeling too much like a short film stretched out with a lot of useless padding. A few of the characters are reasonably likeable but the inconsistent and illogical motivations bring them down. For a film billed as a horror, though it's more a thriller with horror elements, there is very little interesting and nothing remotely scary. They are too few and are far too predictable, anaemic and weakly timed to make impact, with the dull pacing and obvious sound effects cheapening them significantly. In terms of the thriller elements, 'The Open House' doesn't engage let alone thrill, the start intrigued by feels wasted by how quickly everything runs out of steam. Worst of all is the ending, which is so abrupt, unresolved and incomplete that one struggles to even consider it an ending, the film just ends and leaves one scratching their heads in confusion and feeling cheated.Overall, the potential was there but the execution far from was. Really bad, unless you're curious about seeing it it's best to keep this house closed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "In The Open House, Logan (Dylan Minnette) is an aspiring runner hoping to attain glory on his high school's track team. But his life takes a tragic turn when he witnesses his father getting hit and killed by a driver having a heart attack in a parking lot. Unable to afford the rent of their home, Logan and his mother, Naomi, are able to relocate to Naomi's sister's mountain retreat until they figure out their next move, provided they leave when the realtors who are trying to sell it have their open house days. Almost immediately, eerie events start happening inside the house. Objects are moved seemingly by themselves from one room to the next. The pilot light keeps getting turned off. And the realtors who are trying to sell this mountain house are strange, and so is their new neighbor, Martha, and the repairman sent to fix the furnace. It gets really bad when Logan and Naomi return home to find the dining room table candlelit; the police dismiss this as the behavior of bored teenagers. With only their new friend, a local named Chris, offering to stay with them and help try to make sense of the increasingly creepy happenings, Logan and Naomi must find a way to catch the mystery person lurking in the house, or die trying.\nPerhaps the only good thing about this horror movie is the music. While the acting isn't bad and there's some initial hope that The Open House could be a satisfying scary movie, viewers are ultimately left with nothing but the feeling that 94 minutes of their life was wasted. There are some nods to The Shining and Psycho that suggest perhaps the filmmakers are savvy enough to make horror movie magic with a small budget, but it doesn't take long to see that the overuse of genre clich\u00e9s -- such as the sudden burst of music and the jolting camera shot that merely reveals another character appearing seemingly out of nowhere -- reveals an amateurish ineptitude that might lead the viewer to wonder if they're being ironic. Is the movie a spoof of horror movies? It's unclear.\nViewers may be frustrated with the ending, or lack of an ending. Basically, it's like a whodunit without telling you whodunit. Teen horror fans are better off sticking with the classics.",

A father dies and after his wife and son temporarily move into her sister's house. All sorts of weird stuff happens. You think it's all supernatural but it just turns out to be a guy who likes torturing and murdering people. And, he then tortures and murders the pair....end of story.If you like seeing people being brutally tortured, then this is the film for you. But for folks who don't delight in seeing pain being inflicted on others, don't watch the movie.

Solid performances, Dylan Minnette, who's always pretty good put in a solid performance, I thought the scenes where he lashed out in anger to his mother about his father's death were very well played out, films so often go way over the top, this had a sense of realism.When you think that the budget for this film was $100,000 I think it should be applauded, many films with budgets many times that size fail in so many ways, this was a good hour and a half of escapism.It's not to be taken too seriously, and we didn't get many answers, but that's life.I quite enjoyed it.",

The movie stars Dylan Minnette, Piercey Dalton, Sharif Atkins, Patricia Bethune and Aaron Abrams. It was written, directed and co-produced by rookie filmmakers Matt Angel and Suzanne Coote (who also play small parts in the film), and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. The movie is well shot, and acted in my opinion, but it's also completely pointless, and a waste of time to watch. Logan Wallace (Minnette) is a teenager with dreams of being a champion runner. Then his father is struck and killed by a car, while Logan is watching. He and his mother, Naomi (Dalton), move into her sister's house, while it's in the process of being sold. They soon realize that there might be powerful supernatural forces there, that are unhappy with their presence. \n \nThe movie is a pretty routine horror/thriller flick, but (like I said) the production values are decent, and Minnette gives a good enough performance in the lead. The story, and character development, isn't horrible, until the end of the movie. That's when I felt like the whole film was kind of a complete waste of time.

That's essentially the best way I can put it.It's about an incredibly annoying teenaged boy and his mother, some time after his father is suddenly run down and killed, trying to sell their house. At night, the pilot light is shut off suddenly while the mother, Naomi, bathes, forcing her to go to the basement to reignite it every night. The implication seems to be it's some kind of ghost.the son, Logan, is a stereotypical insufferable teenager with no redeeming qualities or charisma at all. He spends all day doing nothing, and occasionally having flashbacks of his father's death.At one point, there's an instance where Logan chases someone into the basement, and it turns out to be his father, but this is apparently just a nightmare and not a ghost.other characters include Martha, who is said to have Alzheimer's, and does nothing. Also there's Chris, who apparently flirts with Naomi a bit.Virtually nothing happens for the entirety of the movie, until the very end when suddenly something or someone kills Chris, needlessly tortures Naomi and Logan, then disappears momentarily so Logan can be a complete idiot roaming around the dark basement swinging a knife around, inevitably \"accidentally\" stabbing his mother to death because he's a complete and utter moron and asshole.Then the something or someone re-appears, chasing Logan out into the woods. He finally comes across Logan at daybreak, and kills him.At no point do we ever see or know who this something or someone is that apparently kills everyone. Maybe they were the same something or someone that killed Logan's father at the start, but there's absolutely no hint of any connecting threads between them.

Having said that, I gave this movie a chance because I got the ad on my email and thought it was interesting.The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because\na) There were some moments where I was genuinely scared/grossed out\nb) I am a fan of Dylan Minette's work and I think he did great here (although most scenes looked like mini-trailers for 13RW season 2). Too bad that this was his follow-up, he needs a movie more suited to his talent\nc) The soundtrack was nice and creepyBut the buildup, character development, plot resolution, nothing was there. The ending reminded me of the old movies, but even in those, there was a storyline and an explanation. I had to restart the movie TWO times because I felt I missed something! I was not understanding anything,SPOILER ALERT: For example, you see that the killer ends up going to another open house to continue this rampage. But what connection does he have with the schizophrenic neighbor? First you see her walking around the house, calling it HER property. My brain immediately thought that the killer was her husband, you get to see this is a big, strong man of a certain age.Why would an attractive woman and her teenage son move from Cali to a mountain house with NO WEAPONS, NO DEFENSE GADGETS whatsoever? Hell, even a kickstand, a taser gun, a baseball bat, something. I find it hard to believe that a 17-year old aspiring athlete was not able to beat the sheet out of the old stupid killer.And specially knowing that weird things were going on around the house, both were so unprepared and defenseless. A little hard to believe.Anyway what bothered me the most about this movie is that there was no justice at all. Later into the movie we learn that the dad's death might have been no accident, someone might have killed him on purpose. But it was not confirmed. Then this killer going after a woman and her geek son. For no reason at all. Not cool.Needless to say I wouldn't be watching this again.",

First off, I started watching The Open House for a few minutes, and then decided to see what the reviewers on IMDB thought. That being said, I was hesitant to continue watching until a friend of mine said they liked it, so I resumed watching. \nI have to say, this movie was not at all what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be more of a supernatural haunted house ghost story, but clearly the Netflix description lists it as a \"Thriller/psychological thriller\", which off the bat, lets you know that you will be in for some twists and turns. \nSPOILERS AHEAD: \nThe beginning starts off in typical horror movie fashion: A mother, father and teenage son are all happily living together. Then tragedy strikes and the mother and son need to leave their home and venture to a relative's house in the woods. From there, weird and strange people show up, leaving you wondering who is out to get the family, and who is not. I found myself questioning each supporting character's motives as they stopped to say HI to the mother and son, or interacted with them in other ways. Who should they trust? Who should they be wary of? It's very much like real life. When you are in a new environment and you don't know anyone, you're on guard and making sure that you are cautious of who you reveal too much information to. We see this when the son cuts off his mother's conversation with the strangers she meets. \nClues within the movie are subtle but if you pay attention, you will pick up on the \"why\" right away. The son points this out when he discusses the actual process of an \"open house\". He states that you give realtors the run of the house, and strangers come in when you're not home, and have access to the house. And who is to say whether or not the realtors check the entire house before leaving? It's random. And that is the point of the whole movie. Randomness. Some crazy person sees an open house, decides that the house is big enough to hide out in and observes the family members while they are sleeping and stalks them while living in the basement. He finally seizes his opportunity to torture and kill them, and then moves on to the next open house. Do we know who the killer is? No, but my assumption was that it was the boiler man, given the fact that we see a shadow similar to his stature in one scene when Logan gets up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and we see his shoes, which are clearly workman's boots. However, I was kept guessing until the very end, even so far as to think perhaps it was the police officers or even the neighbor's supposedly dead husband. . My guess as to why many people did not like this movie was because of the unsettled feeling they were left with, because it hits too close to a thought of \"wow, this could happen to me.\" And indeed, it happens more often than we are led to believe. Was I left unsatisfied? In a way, yes. But that is the beauty of a well-written psychological thriller (NOT A HORROR MOVIE), it leaves you with questions, leaves your mind to be riddled with feelings of uneasiness and unsettled thoughts. After all, how well do we really know the people we deal with everyday? The people we let into our houses without a second thought about what their backgrounds may be...this movie makes us think, and maybe, cautions us to be more aware of who we allow into our lives and into our homes.",

Seeing that I went into it expecting something pretty terrible. Now, while I can understand that this film has faults a plenty, I can't quite grasp it having a score that low. Let's get into some analysis.The problems the movie possesses are as follows. Firstly, it's a bore. There are long periods of the film where it feels like nothing of significance is happening. Now that might not be entirely true when you find out what is actually going on at the end of the film, however the audience not being let in on this information is still going to be bored and uninterested. And therein lies probably the biggest flaw the movie has. There is a genuine threat to these people in the movie, but the audience has no idea about it. How can that ever be considered a good idea to have in your movie? Finally the amount of red herrings this film has that ultimately lead to absolutely nothing is absurd. There was a chance to be clever along the way, but the film makers just completely by-passed that option.So why didn't I hate this film as much as everyone else? A lot of people are going to hate this movie for its ending and the path it chose to take. I actually respect it for it. At least, I respect the idea. The execution left a lot to be desired. The idea though was actually quite bold and attempting to be unique. I also liked that it didn't fall into the lazy category of slipping into the supernatural side of things, although there is at least one dream sequence is the laziest of all types of film making. So no this isn't a good film, but I also don't agree with its score being as low as it is.",

            "content": "The Open House feels like the horror film you would get if an AI studied human horror films and tried to make one.The basic premise is this: a woman and her son travel to a big house in the middle of nowhere and stay there. Spooky things start happening.This itself wouldn't be too bad, but the actual result due to the writing and execution is an incredibly meaningless checklist of generic cliches, lazy jump scares and stock characters wrapped up in a giant blanket of red herrings.Perhaps the most fundamental problem with the film is that it doesn't understand Chekhov's Gun - the idea that something purposely introduced into the story should come back in a meaningful way. The best example is Logan (the teen character) and his ability to run fast. The film keeps making a massive deal of how he's an excellent runner, almost \"Olympic standard\".In any sane, good movie, this would follow the rule of Chekhov's Gun, and Logan would later use his running ability in some useful way. Like outrunning the murderer, or sprinting to get help.But in this film...no. Him being a good runner is irrelevant. It's never brought up in a meaningful way, it's just some random dialogue the characters keep harping on about for absolutely no reason! Beyond bizarre.And this continues. There are tons of things that the film inexplicably makes a big deal of, that turn out to mean...absolutely nothing.Why does the camera focus on a huge pile of wood blocking a mysterious hallway in the basement? No idea.Why does Logan keep staring into the trees with a horrified look on his face? No reason.Why did the father character get run over at the start of the movie, and was it deliberate? Never explained.This even extends to the main villain: who is he and why is he even doing anything he does isn't explained.In a good film, like The Thing, ambiguity like this can be used to create a deliberate sense of unease and dread. It can even leave you thinking about hints in the movie for years to come. But in this movie there are no hints and there is no meaning...it's just meaningless and incredibly dumb. The killer kills people because he's a killer in a horror movie. That's it.Added insult to the injury of the meaninglessness of the film is the fact that it expends tons of energy *pretending* that something is going on with pointless red herrings. Everything from creepy neighbours to people panicking in the house and leaving without explanation.People materialise in the road and disappear, and the killer can move around completely silently despite being 8 foot tall and wearing massive boots.There's no supernatural element to the story and no reason for any of this - again, what? Why on Earth would you write the story this way, and then explain absolutely nothing?Good horror films have logical reasons for why stuff is happening, regardless of whether it's supernatural or not. Heck, good MOVIES in general follow this rule.But The Open House is not a logical film, and this makes it a completely lazy waste of the viewer's time.",

The writers feel sure they'll scare you by putting most of the action in the dark. About half way through I wanted to turn it off but then decided to see how bad it could actually get. Even I was surprised that someone got paid for a plotless, pointless, sophomoric story that doesn't deserve even one frame of film.

Not only that, but it was that bad it motivated me to create an account on here just to post this review. The first 30 minutes of the film was good. It introduced the characters and you didn't know who to trust i.e. The neighbour. It set itself up to be a good movie. However, the second half of the film is why it's got such a bad rating. With half an hour to go there had been no action, no jump scares, no real sense of where the plot of this movie is heading. Finally, with 15 minutes to go, action was taking place and with a good ending this film could save itself. Instead, the film just ended with all the main characters dead. NO explanation to absolutely anything that had happened the previous 100 minutes, no introduction to the killer, no idea why the killer is doing this, the film simply just ends. No questions that, you, the viewer, have probably wanted answered at the end, were answered. You have literally no idea as to why anything has happened. Lazy writing and directing. Surely they must have known it was a bad ending, because I refuse to accept that they looked at that end and said it was good to go.

A thriller lacking thrills is not a thriller at all, it's just an \"er\". It's a simple case of building several plot points and not finalising any of them. Nearly every single detail is left unanswered which ultimately delivered an unfulfilling experience. In fact, upon reflection, nothing was answered. Absolutely nothing! Who was terrorising them? Why them specifically? Is it just open houses? Who was the schizophrenic neighbour? Why did she stroll (coincidentally might I add) in the middle of the night? What was in the basement? Why did she go down there in her towel!? Now she has to shower again! Urgh, incredibly frustrating! Breadcrumbs were sprinkled throughout and yet no one followed them. I would go as far as saying that the first act was pretty good (well, average at best). Setting a moody tone revolving around grief once the father gets decimated by a car after buying a carton of eggs. The remaining hour relinquished all suspense by attempting to focus on a broken mother and son relationship that had no characterisation to begin with. Oh, and a few mandatory jump scares for safe measure in case you thought this was good. Sadly, another failed Netflix original that had more holes than a sponge.

I mean, how original or authentic can a horror movie be when we are flooded with them for decades now. There's nothing wrong with clich\u00e9s in a horror-flick, the predictability actually makes up for a big part of the fun of it! What's important is if it's all done in a good and solid way. So let's look at this movie in an objective way: how are story, dialogues, tension and scares, acting, etcetera?Well, the first three quarters of the movie I had a good time. Albeit a clich\u00e9, the premise of some damaged family coming to live in a strange and creepy house where they are faced with whatever kind of horrors, always works for me. The photography is fine, the settings in the mountains and in the house itself are great, the slowly building-up suspense kept me on the edge of my chair and above all: the acting of mother (Piercey Dalton) and son (Dylan Minnette) is very strong and convincing. I became a huge fan of Dylan Minette in \"13 Reasons Why\" and here he proves to be equally good (although I would like to see him act a totally different character for a change, here he plays almost exactly the type of guy as in \"13 RW\"). In the last 20 minutes things get in a higher pace and here the script unfortunately falls flat. Horror-convention dictates that by this time in the movie we gradually learn the real nature and origin of the menacing evil (be it someone we met in the course of the movie or someone who with some twisted logic turns out to have a grudge or even some supernatural force), but here we are kept totally in the dark even up until the very end of the movie. That's not good. Maybe a director or writer wants to create some deep and artistic meaning with this, but it's utterly unsatisfying and feels a bit like an insult to us as an audience, sitting the movie through and waiting for a decent closure. The grim fate of the two main characters surely deserves more than just: \"that's it, the end\".Furthermore I had the eerie feeling that all kinds of promising hints and twists were introduced that eventually led to nothing. Like the scene in the beginning where Logan takes out his contact lenses, it's presented as a chilling and sinister moment (with very strong photography) but it never gets any follow-up, or it should be the mirroring scene of the intruder taking the lenses out of Logan's eyes himself in the end. With no purpose whatsoever, Logan still runs like he has X-ray vision through the nightly forests and fields. Then there's all this innuendo about the bad relationship between mother and recently deceased father, and some more of the father having had secrets - nothing is done with it. The stalking attitude of neighbouring shop-keeper Chris is creepy enough, but when he eventually stays over in their house to hold watch there (and we as the audience are of course made to think that they invited the devil itself) his story-line is suddenly cut-off (literally so!).On top of all this there are the usual bad decisions that people in this kind of movie always seem to make. Why not phone the real owner of the house (being your own sister/aunt!) from time to time with rightful questions as: who's this weird neighbour lady and what's wrong with her, is there a problem with the heating and how should we fix it, do you know a guy Chris from the local shop and is he reliable, what's wrong with the lights in the basement and how can we fix it? All in all, an in the end waste of a potentially good premise (clich\u00e9 or not), of a first hour or so of effectively building-up of suspense and of two great actors.",

And the lack of explanation and closure to the ending doesn't work well at all, makes the film all the more worse.2/10: A load of rubbish, even for a Netflix original",

            "content": "\"The Open House\" is arguably one of the most uninspired, ill-conceived horror films and one of those flicks which makes passion and intellect not at all a prerequisite for cinephiles to precede analysis of the film. The dumb core idea, apparently broken down by the filmmakers as genius, is so shallow, so disrespectful to the paying movie lovers, that it can easily be counted among the most unjustified realized stories that have been allowed to torment the eyes of the viewers since the Lumi\u00e8re brothers and the invention of film.The film is the realization of a crackpot idea: what if you made a killer horror film in which the killer played a purely random role throughout the film?In concrete terms, it comes about as follows: establish a clich\u00e9d plot beginning, consisting of a family tragically torn apart, think about a suitable setting, original, comprehensible and creative, so for example a setting in the middle of a property that is to be bought, which is why the small family of two, who want to get back together away from old hustle and bustle, have to spend days in shopping malls and diners again and again because of the open house visits. Make the viewer believe in a thousand silly connections, such as a conspiratorial meaning to the actually meaningless beginning of the plot, or danger, due to the open house setting. Make sure that the dialogues underline, no, substantiate these actually meaningless connections, such as by the expressed fear that in the absence of the nuclear family, strangers have entered the house. But don't forget subplots with supporting characters, such as a creepily intrusive flirting acquaintance, or a semi-irreverent woman who exudes danger but isn't actually dangerous at all. But in the end, the most important thing to remember is to make the actual \"resolution\" of the plot even sillier than all those muddles thrown into the ring before for oh-so-clever distraction.Matt Angel's total failure on this feature debut is a waste of time and another indication of the destructive force that streaming services are to cinematic art. The wasted cast and the film's atmospheric wrapping, which ends up being worth a damn, are further evidence of this. \"The Open House\" is a work of art - uninspired, self-indulgent and with the not uncommon arrogance of many a pubescent teenager. A film to be avoided.",

If they did then they should get their money back! They don't know how to write a beginning, middle and end! I'm not saying that I, myself, could do any better, but from other movies I've seen from other writers, this is one of the worst and botched jobs I've ever seen!They didn't give the characters any real depth, and the antagonist... they didn't bother coming up with a main identity, explaining to themselves and the audience who this antagonist is, apart from showing bits and pieces, and what his motivations are. The furthest we got was to determine that this person was a male and stocky in build. Other than that, nada. Another reviewer thinks that, from what little we saw, the antagonist looks like the plumber. Maybe they're right. Still, what is his motive?In thrillers and horrors, like any other genre, we're supposed to be cheering for the main character(s) to come out on top, but that can only be done with some depth of character, and this movie, as I previously said, lacks any sort of depth in both storyline and characters.There are holes in what is supposed to pass for a plot.All in all, it's a horrible movie and not worth being viewed even once!Netflix, I know you wanted 'original' Netflix movies, and I enjoy some of them, though I know that they're not 'original' Netflix movies - I've seen them before. But, you really should have skipped on this one, as it's horrible and does nothing for the reputation you're not only trying to build, but also maintain!

            "content": "We're in the risky month of January once again and when it comes to watching new releases in entertainment, it's usually a coin toss as to whether or not a movie will actually be good. Ever since Netflix began to release original films, I've found myself holding out hope that fantastic independent films will slowly begin to make their way onto streaming services, instead of failing at the box office. Well, if one of Netflix's most recent films in The Open House is any indication, then we're still a very long way from something like that ever happening. Not only is this one of the most non-scary horror films that I've seen in recent memory, but it's also one of the worst films in general that I've seen in recent memory. People talk about how bad a movie is, but sometimes it just has to be seen to be believed. Now streaming, here's why I think you should check this movie out just to see how bad it truly is.Starring Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton star in The Open House, a film that (after a tragic event) follows them as they work on selling their home. Shacking up in a family member's house up in the mountains while they set up open houses, creepy things begin to happen to them. What's disturbing them? Well, without giving anything away, literally nothing is ever explained to you throughout the movie. It's almost a joke that this film was even made because not a single portion of this movie is terrifying and not a single plot point is interesting enough to hold your attention for two seconds.Look, I've said this before, but it's really not necessary to make a horror movie to scare the hell out of someone because it's all about atmosphere and visuals. When the It hit theatres last year, it wasn't the kind of film that needed to throw scares in your face, because it focussed more on its characters and made you just care about watching these kids hang out and hope they all make it out of the film alive. So, when a movie like The Open House manages to simultaneously provide incredibly weak characters, laughably cheap set pieces, jump scares that you can see coming over ten minutes before they happen (and that's not even an exaggeration), and a conclusion that's pretty much a slap in the face to every viewer for even watching the movie, then I have nothing good to say about it.From the small films that Dylan Minnette has appeared in, to his larger role in last year's new series 13 Reasons Why, I've always enjoyed watching his performances, but even he was incredibly one-note here. Every time something would happen in their house that was supposed to trigger chills from the audience, it felt forced and quite honestly, every single set piece was a re-creation of another horror film. Yes, it's practically impossible to not draw inspiration from other movies these days, but The Open House just felt uninspired from start to finish.In the end, I found myself chuckling if a character died, laughing hysterically at each jump scare, rolling my eyes when a new plot point arises that you already know the outcome to, or just plain being bored at the bland imagery. The funny thing is that this movie has an ending that I didn't exactly see coming, but the way it ends actually makes the movie worse than it already is. It's still very early in the year, but I'll be shocked if this doesn't stay my most hated movie of this year. The Open House is truly an awful film and unless you get a kick out of terrible horror films, then I would advise that you steer clear of this one.",

            "content": "Oh, Netflix, how've you made a huge mistake. The first time I saw this trailer, I thought it had a neat concept. It had the potential of a great mystery. But, oh boy, was I dead wrong!The movie starts with Dylan Minette (I won't bother you with the character's name) whose father has a tragic accident as he witnessed it happened. The family has financial problems which prompts them to move. His mother's sister offers them an open house she has yet to sale in the meantime until they get back on their feet. As soon as they start staying there, weird things start to happen.The first few minutes starts well, but then descends into a black pit of turd. Why do I find it so horrible? I mean, the actors are fine, the camerawork's great, the cinematography's beautiful. It's just the execution and the storytelling.are so unfathomably stupid, clich\u00e9d, and have been done to death. False jump scares; weird, possible red herrings; characters who are oblivious to what's happening around them, who does stupid things. By the end, I was just laughing because of how ridiculous the conclusion is. The only saving graces are Dylan Minette and Piercey Dalton. They really tried to convince us with their conflict that stems from their grief. Their dramatic moments were the only highlight of this movie, which are so few and far in between.It's infuriating to see such hackneyed work that looks gorgeous and has some great acting. If this were to be released in theaters, it would flop so bad. Don't bother wasting your time on this.",

While they're staying there an open house is scheduled to show the home to potential buyers. At first the home seems like it's haunted, then as the movie ends you find out it is something entirely different. SPOILER ABOUT THE ENDING!\nI think most people were upset because the filmmakers switched the script on the film. It wasn't paranormal at all, but a psycho killer who plays with his victims for a while before he goes in for the final kill. This particular psycho likes to find his prey by visiting open houses and hiding in the house after the real estate agent leaves, then he slowly taunts his victims before deciding to kill them, and then he moves on to the next open house to find his next victims.",

            "content": "Reading through the reviews on this site, this film has been getting quite a pummelling from the reviewers. First of all, I can fully understand why; the movie is basically a softcopy of Black Christmas, a movie in which a man in the house kills off its occupants one by one and we never see his face, except for an eyeball through a keyhole, and this is something that in the past worked really well but now, in a culture more in tuned and excited by the Serial Killer horror film, it doesn't quite excite. I've always preached that the monster that can be explained can be more scary than those that can't, as the purpose makes it more fleshed out.And by far the thing that makes this film very difficult to embrace or enjoy is the seeming omnipotence of the film's killer. He is massively overpowered, to the point where it literally feels like the movie's writing team trying to find ways to make a character suffer - he even manages to remove the contact lenses worn by Dylan Minnette's Logan with extreme precision. There's a point where the writer's should've had him make some mistakes, or let the character's get the upper hand on him because towards the tale's end, it just becomes uncomfortably exploitative.\nHe is well shot though, like the rest of the film - you get impression of his size compared to Minnette and Piercey Dalton, and enough details like the shape of his face and the colour of his skin to form an image in your head, but you are still annoyed by the vagueness of his character beyond a sadistic murderer.In fact, one thing I can praise this film for is how well made it is. The camerawork and the cinematography are particularly stellar, in how they very ably layout the property for you to see where everything is in relation to one another, show what's going on the background clearly, note things that matter, such as Logan's eyesight problems, or Naomi's photography hobby that played a role.The cast is small, which is something that doesn't help the film - it feels a bit too sparse, and the film is quite empty as a result - but they are reliable. Dylan Minnette is one of the best young actors today, who does a great job of acting realistically scared for someone in his position, and also pulling off the film's physical work, and Piercey Dalton in her feature debut as his mother, who is a very realistically grieving, conflicted person in this position.Other positives include the soundtrack design in how it builds both shock and tension, much like John William's Jaws score, and how it is comparatively more well made than horror films of a similar ilk. However, it's overly bleak, unfulfilling tone, whilst exceptional, is the big reason why I could never watch this film again.It is, however, CERTAINLY not as bad as some say it is.",

I bet he is annoyed to have played there. When the end comes, you hope all the time for a smart and well thought out end. However, you will be extremely disappointed if you find out that it has nothing to do with each other. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Even attributing this rating was exhausting.

We simply don't know for sure and probably never will, unless there is a sequel. I've decided I'm okay with this and it's made me apreciate the movie in a whole new way.I have my own theory as to what happened. If you pay attention, there are quite a few clues throughout the movie that point to a very likely conclusion. I hate that I will never be certain, but there are a million other movies I can watch if I crave that kind of closure. This is clearly not one of those movies. It made me think outside the cookie cutter thriller/horror box. It made me question my expectations. It made me realize that the reason we get upset by these frustrating, anti-climatic endings is because of our innate need to control and correct imbalance and injustice. Sometimes life is just unfair, bad things happen and we'll never know why. Give it a chance. The movie is decent. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but well worth a watch.",

I was invested in these characters. I was expecting supernatural elements or something. I was expecting the fact that the son was training to run in the Olympics to be foreshadowing. Maybe he could outrun his pursuer?It's a slow burn through most of the movie. Things disappear from the house, or get misplaced. The house is broken into and vandalized.

The Open House is none of these things. So at this point, I'm reeled in, and then the perpetrator appears.Now the movie, in the LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES, becomes torture, literally. These characters do not even remotely deserve what happens to them. Suddenly, the kid is knocked out in the driveway and gets cold water poured on him, but it gets better. The mother is tied to a chair in the house, and the perp decides to break all of her fingers one-by-one, and then it looks like he busts out bolt cutters, or something similar. Now we have Hostel.

This defencelessness is heightened by the lead's terrible eyesight, being effectively blind without contacts or glasses. This is very sophisticated drama, and the actors and director manage this with consummate skill. However, such realism, which by its very nature can be time-consuming to portray, may well not be everyone's cup of tea. And the length of the buildup does tend to immunise the viewer from a lot of the scares that repeat. It did for me, but not for my brother, whom jumped twice as often as I did. The tragedy mentioned is revealed only in the behaviour of the leads, a delicate thing, and why I give this piece a high score, with only one flashback late in the movie to make the circumstance specific. That was a plus for me. There is very little gore or splatter and certainly no special effects.

The ending was probably done in that way to allow for a second, and I wouldn't be shocked to see an Open House Part 2 made. Solid performances, Dylan Minnette, who's always pretty good put in a solid performance, I thought the scenes where he lashed out in anger to his mother about his father's death were very well played out, films so often go way over the top, this had a sense of realism.When you think that the budget for this film was $100,000 I think it should be applauded, many films with budgets many times that size fail in so many ways, this was a good hour and a half of escapism.It's not to be taken too seriously, and we didn't get many answers, but that's life.",

Plus, it seems like this movie is getting hammered by terrible reviews from everyone who is unfortunate enough to see it. So, instead of a review, I have a few questions;1. To the writers responsible for this abomination; have you ever seen a movie before? Do you understand basic story structure, and how every successful story has to have a clear beginning, middle and end? Where was your road map as to how this movie was supposed to unfold? I am just struggling to understand what the thought processes were here.2. The movie had everything going for it; Decent premise, a great trailer, an extremely talented cast, a nice soundtrack. How did it derail so profoundly, to the point of it almost appearing intentional? No one releases garbage like this and is proud to have their name prominently displayed in the credits, so what gives?3. If this is a suspense/thriller, why all of the jump scares? It's too tame to be a horror film and not smart enough to be a real thriller, so whom may I ask was the intended audience? There is salty language, nudity and some disturbing scenes, but everything rolls out like a Teen Nick special. Who were you targeting, and were you aware that you were going to fail everyone with this project?4. Lastly, what in the name of all that is sweet and pure in the world was the conclusion of the movie about? I would not even call it a real conclusion, as nothing is truly resolved, but were the film makers attempting to evoke a vastly superior film (Funny Games), failed miserably, and said, \"You know what? The movie is done. Just release it as is. Someone is bound to like it\"? I cannot for the life of me think of a single person I would recommend this film to. I just wouldn't do that to anyone.This is one of those rare movies that doesn't accomplish anything, which makes it that much more embarrassing as it had all the cards stacked in its favor. The writers should be ashamed that they unleashed this dirty diaper onto Netflix, and Netflix itself should be publicly shamed for allowing it to soil their service. One of the worst movies I have EVER seen, don't even bother watching it out of curiosity. Please, do not waste your precious time like I have.",

There are so many threads the story could have used and built upon that were simply ignored. The plot wasn't even something you can rate because there wasn't one; at best it was lazy writing. Unless....Consider that many \"crimes\" happen exactly like this. There is no explanation. There is no understanding on the part of the victims as to why they are targeted, why they are dying at the hands of a stranger. Many criminals such as the one portrayed have no real reason that rational people would understand as to why they are killing people, why one family is targeted when others are ignored. The story is told from the point of view of the victims - they wouldn't know the reasoning or the rational behind the killer's choices.I'm not saying this excuses the laziness of the script.

It was about average for Netflix based film.\nThe cinematography has the same problem as most horror movies, \"let's make the lighting bad to signify darkness\" or \"let's constantly zoom the cameras in and out to create suspense\" blah blah blah, but it's not so bad that it's distracting. I think the DP did fine if I'm being honest, just relies on all of the stereotypical tips and tricks for cinematography.The acting is pretty meh, but I think Piercey Dalton was pretty good. The director, Matt Angel is an actor, and it seems like he doesn't really belong in the directors chair. The shots, the acting, everything just looks like it was done in one or two takes.And while certain parts of the story are silly, and it seems like one of the female characters (who had a lot of mystery around her) seems a waste of time, everything else is digestible enough. The biggest problem is the antagonist, who just does things to be evil. I won't go any further into detail since I don't want to contain some spoilers but it is a little silly.But the film does have good aspects. There is a lot of suspense and mystery within the film, and you are genuinely left guessing about what's happening next sometimes. Along with that the story is somewhat engaging. I do care about what happens to the leads and like I said, Piercey Dalton did a good job.All together, this is a deeply flawed, but somewhat redeeming film, that is worth checking out if you have a lot of free time. It's not \"So bad it's good\", I just feel like the production team had some talent mixed in with the unimpressive leadership behind its creation. I feel like that alone has a lot of critics flocking to insult it, but I feel like it gets an unnecessary amount of criticism. It's still not very good though.",

It's obviously just a psycho killer that goes around to open houses, plays some kind of mind game with the owners to frighten and terrorize them before killing them and moving on to the next open house.

The point is that this type of thing could potentially happen to people. It isn't the point WHY the next door neighbor is weird. The point is that some people are just oddballs. You don't need a complete explanation to enjoy a good psychological, edge of your seat thriller. The film exceeds in acting, cinematography, and direction. It has some wonderful dialogue two between the leads. Imagine yourself in the situation (a situation mind you that can potentially happen) and you will feel quite unnerved by the end. Not every motion picture needs to answer every question. In fact, the best thrillers are always the ones that are realistic and make you think that this type of thing could happen to anyone.Highly recommended!",

At this point, everyone becomes a suspect, the kooky neighbor, the over-friendly store attendant, the plumber, the cops, and even Logan himself. Halfway through the movie I confidently said I've got the invader figured out and was just riding it out until the movie ends.\nBoy was I wrong.I won't spoil it for you but you have to wait until the end credits to figure out who the invader is. Like literally, you have to read the cast credits. Then it's up to you as to how you will react. A Forbes review got pissed off, it has a 3.2/10 rating in IMDB, while I just laughed and figured to just charge it to Netflix's aggressive expansion for content in 2017-18 (see The Ritual, 1922, Gerald's Game and Hush.) As long as you don't have a lot of expectations and you have 90 minutes to waste, you might actually enjoy it.",

            "content": "Wow there are a lot of bad ratings and reviews for this movie. I wonder if I saw the same movie.Maybe everyone that watched it didn't understand the point? Most reviewers are saying that there's no conclusion, or it leads to nowhere. That's not true. There is a conclusion, it's just not the one we've been trained to expect. We expect in horror/thriller/suspense movies to find out who the bad guy is and they get their comeuppance. You find out that the killer has been in the house the whole time and he's an escape convict/lunatic! He's making calls from inside the house! But the babysitter wins in the end! That's what we want. A finality. This need to overcome the evil and scariness.But real life isn't like that.There are so many little bits in this movie that ties it together. You can tell from the beginning that Logan is closer to his dad than his mom. His parents fight and they try to hide it, but she's stressed and you can tell that she's feels like her husband isn't taking the fact that they're both jobless serious. This leads to her outburst blaming him for the situation she and Logan end up in. Or how Logan said that he wished his mom was dead instead of his dad, and he ends up accidentally killing her. Or how she thinks that Logan is toying with her with the hot water heater because they already have a strained relationship and he didn't want to be there in the first place. And the fact that he gets extremely upset because he sees that Chris is flirting with her, because he thinks that his mom doesn't/didn't care about his dad or even him. Or how we're introduced to Logan as he's running his best time. He has aspirations of the Olympics. But in the end, his running fails him. He was nearly frozen to death and practically blind. I'm not surprised the intruder could find him, I probably could have with my nonexistent tracking abilities. The thing is, this is a family that is falling apart and that had *nothing* to do with the intruder in their house. That's the point. The intruder has nothing to do with them. No history to the house, no history to the people.Sure there's some supernatural ninja ability, but it's inferred in the end, that this guy goes from open house to open house doing this, so he's probably got practice toying with people and being stealthy. However, this is also very similar to a lot of movie serial killers. How many other movies are there where the killer has some unnatural ability to keep getting up or sneaking on their victims? It's nothing we haven't seen before.But Logan even says that he finds the idea of an open house creepy, and that's the whole point of the movie! You put your house up for sale, you give your keys to a realtor, random people that you don't know walk through your house judging your curtains and cabinetry and the state of your floors, and then the realtor just locks up. Maybe they do a cursory walk-through to see if someone is lurking, but maybe they don't. And what if someone stays behind? What if they are homicidally inclined?We don't get to know who the killer is because *they* don't know who the killer is. It could be anyone.

            "content": "All in all I found the story, acting, dialogue, cinematography and direction of the film to be more than adequate and entertaining.Aside from a few 'off' bits of editing, very infrequent the film felt like it had been put together with apt attention to detail and care.Particularly the scenes shot within the titular house gave good scope in ensuring the viewer could feel the size and expanse of the house while also inviting them to get a sense of its layout.This contributed to the audiences involvement as the film created decent suspense through a tight cast of potentially suspicious individuals.This is where the film succeeds most at being a suitable suspense thriller. The supporting cast is just quirky enough, just suspicious enough that they could be perceived as a potential threat while otherwise coming across as mostly harmless. This keeps the audience guessing and trying to piece together the cause behind the house's suspicious events.Who is involved? What is their motivation? These are all points we are invited to analyse and guess at as the film progresses.-Spoilers Ahead-While the identity of the home invader is never revealed we are given intentionally selective shots that reveal his shoes, silhouette and the shape of his figure. This successfully keeps audiences guessing while revealing enough to give us a sense of how this invader is bigger, stronger and can easily overpower the main cast, as a result the threat feels real.Many other reviews for this film seem to take issue with the fact the ending is left open or vague. I will admit personally, after analysing, guessing and trying to create possible outcomes in my head during the film others are not wrong to state that the ending can come across as a little bit of a let down. To bash and completely say that it ruined the film seems highly unfair though. It comes down to expectations versus reality. Not everything needs to connect, not everything needs to be explained, because in life everything is not simply always packaged up in a neat little bow for us. The frustration this generates in viewers I feel almost points to how successful this film can be. That uncomfortable feeling it leaves audiences with is a success within itself by not playing into people's desired or generic expectations.So the film doesn't pan out as one would expect. The film sets up for an ending where it feels like the invader is targeting the family in a very personal manner - in fact with the use of the family photo, the flashbacks to the father's death and the intentional use of the song that was played in the beginning of the film when the father died, it all pointed to a bigger picture and deeper meaning behind the father's death (was the one harassing them involved in some way?) My imagination was running wild. So while the ending does reek of wasted potential, it is not necessarily as poor as others seem to think.Despite the ending the film still managed to keep me thinking and guessing, in suspense for these characters and trying to imagine the bigger picture. If everything had gone as I had suspected I might've been vaguely amused. However, the brutality, seeming meaninglessness of the ending by going a more daring route actually added to my enjoyment I believe.For those that didn't get it - we invite strangers into our lives our homes in all manner of ways - the question is, can we trust all of them?The film ends with the sense this is a man that has done this before and intends to do it again. Why? Doesn't really matter. It's real enough and vague enough that you can put yourself in the main character's shoes.Overall this was an enjoyable evening film - one I'd recommend to anyone with an open mind that wants to watch a decent thriller.",

I was just as frustrated as they were about the quality of this no-suspense suspense-thriller-horror movie, but there are real one-star movies out there, and this simply is not one of them.With that out of the way...\nAs other reviews have alluded (to or stated outright), you've seen this movie before, just never this vanilla. Actually, \"The Open House\" isn't even vanilla, it's flavorless-like the unsweetened horror movie! That's another gripe I have with this film; it really doesn't feel like a horror movie at all. It's a thriller with a horror plot. But let's not split hairs.The only things that stopped me from walking away from this movie after about 30 minutes was Dylan Minnette's acting. Even if Piercey Dalton got plenty of screen-time, it's Dylan's believably freaked-out teen jock character that was the one element of the movie that likely kept me and the other 428 reviewers watching. Piercey Dalton's role as a very recently widowed mother just wasn't convincing. Her behavior just isn't consistent with someone who's just had a loss, though it is very, very predictable.Predictability is the name of the game here. You wont be surprised by anything in this movie, aside from how ridiculous the characters' behaviors are. Something I'd add that I haven't seen mentioned is the use of cameras and sets (cinematography, if you will). How that one seemingly simple aspect of a movie can have a huge effect on how a movie feels. If you've ever seen a few Scandinavian films, then you'll know what I'm talking about-long, still, unbroken shots with zero dialog. The camera simply observes the characters like fly on the wall. \"The Open House\" could've used this to great effect. Instead, it used the very typical horror movie style of cinematography that's constantly following each character around and capturing everything they say. With this approach, there's nothing left for you to \"digest\"-nothing to think about. Yes, the writing is borderline awful, the acting is just on-par. There are absolutely more things than cinematography that went wrong with \"The Open House\", but better use of the filming equipment and a different way of using the set and setting could've ramped-up the suspense that was there, and ultimately would've made this movie at least as good as most horror fare. Anyways, there's really not much more to say; this movie's a stinker. Let's just hope some writers somewhere are cooking up some much, much better horror for the future!",

Almost everything that happens turns out to be meaningless in the end, and the climax isn't that exciting, either.I will call it a good movie for those exact reasons (among others). There is actually almost nothing in the plot that is unrealistic, or even particularly convenient. The story is about a woman, whose husband just died, temporarily moving to what is currently an \"open house\" (i.e. potential buyers come to inspect it) along with her son.Some guy terrorizes and then murders both of them, and that's that. There are a bunch of additional plot elements that invariably end up not mattering in the end, and you could certainly call that bad writing - but if you consider the movie a demonstration of the randomness and lack of meaning in real life and real murder, then it actually does a fairly good job. Unlike most poorly rated movies, the dialogue and atmosphere in this one isn't bad at all. In fact I would say it's doing an unusually good job of displaying a believable dynamic between the two main characters.There are a number of reasons why I am willing to excuse the largely meaningless plot as being part of the point, which I would not do for other movies. One is how realistic and down-to-earth everything feels. Another is the straight-forward bad ending. Consider just how helpless the main characters are.

Hands down the worst movie I've seen in 2018 - granted, it's only mid-February, but I bet it'll hold the title for most of the year, if not all of it. I say this as someone who will give almost any movie a chance. Repetitive, boring, uninspired, and a truly awful ending that was a massive letdown. I also felt as though the torture scene between the killer and the mother towards the very end of the movie was gratuitously violent, without much of a point. I'm fine with gore and violence, but it needs to contribute to the plot. This was definitely a scene that didn't contribute much.",

The ending should be used in universities as an example of one of the most horrific way to conclude a film, it should become canon to explain what you need to avoid doing when making a film.The main characters are dumb beyond belief and at some point you'll just give up trying to get what they're doing.

At one point a character remarks that an unexplained noise (that was meant to be spooky) was probably just the \"old pipes.\" Because we all know how noisy 15-year-old pipes can be!

You start to notice the cliches and the characters' actions become kind of stupid. Things start to happen that aren't really logical and don't make any sense. The movie starts to throw in cheap jump scares that your average bad horror film would have. Despite all of this, it really isn't that bad so far.But then the last 15 minutes come. This is when the \"action\" starts. Naomi is tortured and killed by someone in black (who doesn't even show up until now) and Logan escapes into the woods. Soon after, the man finds him and kills him, too. Then we see a car driving down a road towards the open house. That's the end. Seriously. That is literally how this film ends. No actual resolution. No questions answered. Nothing. I bet the writers thought that it was smart or \"deep\" to end the movie without giving any answers. It's not. It's actually stupid and incrediblly unsatisfying. The whole point of a mystery thriller is the suspense of finding out who is the one behind everything, but the movie gives us so little characters, and the ones they introduce, we learn nothing about. The film tries to trick us into thinking it is this one lady, who is their neighbor, but we know nothing about her, like who she really is and what her motives could possiblly be. There is this one scene about halfway through the movie where she shows up in the middle of the night and is acting completely insane. The character that witnesses this doesn't really react and is never brought up again. Every time they see her after that, they acted like she didn't do anything. There was no reason for this scene except for the fact that the film was trying to convince us that she was the antagonist. And is she? I don't know. If she is, why would she be after them? I don't know. If it isn't her, who else could it be? I don't know. There is literally no one in the movie that could be the villain. It would have to be a guy, with us getting a very small sample of his deeper voice and with his credited name being just straight up \"The Man in Black\". There are like, 5 men in the movie, and one of them is killed by the villain, and the others are barely introduced. I hate to say this, but the movie thinks you are stupid. It thinks that it can get away with such a cheap ending, and sadly, it kind of does. Unless you want to see a disappointing \"horror\" film, I would recommend you stay away from this one.

You don't hear anyone trying to stop or screaming or anything just a car coming fast and running him down. Tie that in to the methodical attack on the rest of the family and it seems like someone was out to eliminate this family. Why? Maybe the father owed the mob, they had no money, the mother said he was irresponsible and left them with nothing. Was he a gambler, they killed him and his family over debt? Was this a vendetta killing of sorts? Did she have an affair and break it off or a previous marriage gone bad that left such animosity to lead to this? A revenge killing? Well guess what you will never know, make up your own theory, one is as good as the next. You may want to watch it over and over to see if there are any clues missed throughout that reveal the killer. I recall that at the beginning the mother and father are discussing something, but stop so their son does not hear, basically hiding something from him that they plan to share. However I don't recall what and I'm not interested enough to go back and see. That I think is the point. This writer may have been trying to create a discussion piece, a movie that people will pawn over, watch and rewatch like a puzzle you are trying to figure out; who the killer is and why (it was Colonel Mustard in the study with a candle stick).

The limited information and flashbacks the viewer is shown imply something 1) very unlikely based on the setting or 2) more sinister than anyone acknowledges.

It seems to be relying on the unknown being frightening. The plot pushes beyond the general scope of the \"suspension of disbelief\" and doesn't offer enough of thrill to pull the viewer into the movie as films such as The Strangers manage to do.",

The son goes off to the kitchen which still in shot. In the background a door opens. The mother returns from the other side of the room, its clear she didnt open the door.

She attacks them and screams \"get out of my house!\" She nearly kills them, but they fight back and kill her. End of movie.Or:Someone comes to the open house who knows there's something valuable hidden in that tunnel under the house. He sneaks in over and over to try to find the buried money or treasure.

            "content": "It's a rare film that can do so much, so well and for so long, and then completely destroy itself as badly as Netflix's \"The Open House.\" But I suppose that's just the way things go. What begins as a wonderfully dreary and darkly touching tale of tragic loss and raw emotion stumbles and falls flat with what is perhaps the most infuriating third act I've seen in years. It's a shocking and indeed heart-breaking failure, feeling so misjudged and so contrived, that the entire experience implodes into a raging storm of fury and annoyance for the viewer.And it is for this reason that I can say with some certainty... \"The Open House\" is perhaps the single worst film of 2018.Gifted student and athletic runner Logan (Dylan Minnette) is left reeling after the tragic death of his father. Grieving alongside his mother Naomi (Piercey Dalton), Logan is left cold and hollow, in a constant state of depression. The two decide to get away for a while in order to deal with their pain, taking refuge in a large vacation cabin owned by Logan's aunt, which is currently listed for sale. However, things might not be what they seem, and it soon becomes clear that there's something dangerous happening. The two are plagued by mysterious sounds and strange occurances in the dead of night. Has Logan truly lost his mind in his sorrow? Or is it something- or someone- else?Written and directed by the duo of Matt Angel and Suzanne Coote, \"The Open House\" is such a frustrating film because for all intent and purpose, it starts off spectacularly. Their collective direction is methodical and deliberate. Their writing and handling of characters keen and thoughtful. And the performances of Minnette and Dalton are nuanced and exceptional. It's a movie that clearly has some great ideas behind it, and plenty of juicy themes for Angel and Coote to sink their creative teeth into. The movie spends much of its time delving into and dissecting the impact of grief and depression, and how it can destroy us from the inside. It also has some good ponderings on how we choose as individuals to deal with loss.Such a pity then that it essentially throws this all away. While I will not spoil the proceedings, I must comment that the film's fatal flaw is that it lacks any degree of satisfying resolution. It spends much of its first hour building up to something grand... building character and themes, with great misdirections and subversions of expectations. And then it trades it in for a sub-standard and clich\u00e9-ridden climax with predictable twists and turns that any fan of horror will see coming from a mile away. It's just so... dreadfully out of place in contrast to the rest of the film. I see many echoing these opinions, and I must agree. It's a film that feels incomplete... and utterly misunderstood by its own creators. The third act is not even out of left field. It's out of a different freaking dimension hidden somewhere behind the left field! A dimension where up is down and right is wrong, and where the rules of logic, reason and storytelling do not apply.It's a film that ultimately left me feeling absolutely betrayed as an audience member as the credits began to roll. Like I had wasted my time while the directors were snickering behind my back.There is almost no way to describe \"The Open House\" without breaking out into a string of profanity and venomous insults. It's just atrocious all around- all build up and no real pay-off. Coming from a creative team who clearly didn't know how to write an ending, and just tossed together a slew of anti-climactic twists without thought or reason, squandering the immense potential and good-will it had built up to. I'm sorry Angel and Coote. But you done failed. Big time.\"The Open House\" easily earns a 1 out of 10. It's among the most pointless and unlikable films I've ever seen, and I have serious doubts that I'll see another film this year that I could possibly hate more.",

I feel somewhat bad for the actors, cuz they're talented and believable, but now they're in this pointless, low rated movie where they just end up tortured and dead thanks to some anonymous psycho boot-wearing man with dirty fingernails. Also, Logan urinates, flushes the toilet with the lid open and doesn't even wash his hands afterwards. Maybe that's the sense moral of this movie; stop being gross. I really can't tell.",

There are some creepy moments, but when the culprit finally makes his appearance, it invalidates everything that happened before.I don't always mind the killer winning in the end, but when the protagonists have done nothing but suffer from the start of the film, it just makes for a total let-down. No revenge, no nothing, just 'evil wins, and look he's going to get away with it again'. What a gigantic waste of time. If I wanted that kind of reality I would just watch a tru-crime show or something.I don't always need a happy ending, I feel the need to stress this, but if you're going to torture and kill the protagonists, at least throw in a sin or two that they are guilty of, or maybe some overconfidence, or some contrast between how happy things are versus how dark things get in the end. None of this, just an absolute bummer start to finish.Meh.",

I will make a broad critique and then more in depth critique that contains the spoilers, so if you haven't watched and actually want to waste your time watching this movie, do not read the latter part. Will say when I get to it.First the broad critique. The only reason I gave this 3 stars and not 1 star is because the acting from the characters was for the most part done decently well. Not really their fault they had such a bad storyline and stuff to work with. It's the story itself with absolutely zero plot to it and so many things that just didn't make any sense that made this movie absolutely terrible. I am a movie buff. It is hard to make me not like a movie. So, if I am rating it bad, it is REALLY bad. I kept waiting for something to happen to tie all the loose ends together and explain the point to the movie and it never did. It just ended with no questions answered and left you going, huh???Okay, this part will contain a couple spoilers. First off, it was obvious the father cared about the two of them, especially his son, so them having a fight and the mother being like he didn't care about either of us and all, really didn't make sense. They had financial issues and arguments, but what couple doesn't sometimes? There was nothing that led to her having that argument with him. There was nothing that really led to her actually believing her son would be messing with her like that. The story really needed a bit of a better backstory if wanted to make the issues between mother and son more believable. Then, I thought maybe there was a point to killing the dad in the beginning. I guess the only point was to create some animosity and give them a reason for leaving their home? Then, it never shows the intruder. What was the whole point to the intrusion? What was the point in setting up the table like they did? The boy said it felt personal, but there was never anything finally showing why someone would have something personal against them. Then, why the heck would the son leave his mother behind when trying to make a call? She had her fingers broken, not her legs. Would have made more sense for them to want to stay together, or better yet, they told the police to check back in the morning. Would have made a lot of sense to lock themselves into an upstairs bathroom or something til the cops came back and found Chris dead with tires slashed. You know the intruder couldn't have been one of the cops or they wouldn't have been trying to call the cops back. So basically you just have dad dies, family moves, family gets killed for some unknown reason making a lot of stupid bad decisions, friend comes to help in middle of it all and gets killed within minutes of settling in. All without reason or rhyme. It's like a slasher film that is just there to bring you gore without substance, only the gore is short lived in just the beginning and end of movie, so not even so good for that. Total waste of time.",

            "content": "Angel and Cootes' script is rough to watch at times, too many times, to be honest. The concept, though generic as it may be, held promise, but the indecision is a killer that just keeps hacking at moment after moment in this movie. A strong beginning worthy of any horror story setup quickly falls short as aimless and almost random moments clog the film's story. The effects are minimum, with most the film forcing the viewer to latch on to creepy atmosphere, character play that feels detached, and shock gags that seem more at home on shows like 'Evil Things' or 'A Haunting'. With on exception. The final act- my favorite part. It was bloody brutal and horrific in its cruelty. Still not enough to save \"The Open House\". Overall this is a sad \"should'a', could'a', would'a'\" experience through and through. The beginning should have catepolted \"The Open House\" into a nightmare setup. The mother-son in unknown environment,torment both by circumstance and evildoers, should have brought out scares and fears that took aim at the true plot, and the ending with the reveal and terrifying nature would have hit home and satisfied horror fans. But hey- \"should'a', could'a', would'a'\" -right.",

Their answer seemed to be a house that the mother's sister was trying to sell. The house was basically a mountain mansion, fairly isolated except for a couple red herring characters; an older neighbor and a seemingly nice guy who works at a local store. The son is also suspect as it is implied that he may be breaking down mentally after witnessing his father's death. I figured it could also be supernatural, as their belongings were moved around the house, but I was open to any possibility. I didn't have a real problem with the movie until the end, when the happenings in the house were revealed to have been caused by a complete stranger whose face is never revealed. There were many close-up shots of gratuitous violence, which was completely senseless. I'm supposed to believe that some random person came in for an open house, stayed for days or weeks, killed three people, and left to go to another open house? Sure, Jan. I'll give it to the writers, yes, someone living in your home secretly is scary as hell. Open houses don't seem super safe, and the mom and son were desperate for a place to live, but it is lazy writing to not give the killer a motive, nor reveal who the killer is. I'm ok with an ambiguous ending if it's written well, like Session 9, but this was just so abrupt and senseless. If I'm going to grow attached to two characters, make their deaths mean something. There were so many ways they could've taken the story, and to end it like they did was just terrible.",

            "content": "When it comes to Horror, one might recognize two distinct plot types: first, the supernatural kind (ghosts, evil spirits, demons, hauntings, exorcisms etc.); and second, realistic horror (murderers, torture, home invasion, being hunted by man or beast etc.). The distinction os derived from the fact that while supernatural Horror can be frightening to the point of sleeping with the lights open (don't judge me before you watch a few Asian ghost stories) - the fear factor in realistic Horror comes from the same fear we feel towards murderers: it could be anyone and it could happen to anyone. It's real and nobody's is 100% safe. The Open House of the latter kind and indeed shakes the viewer's vey foundation of trust and security.The story is relatable enough, invoking feelings of empathy and pity even if not connection (at least I hope none of you would relate, and if you did, I'd offer my deepest sympathies). Following the death of their husband and father in a freak accident (driver has heart attack and dies, vehicle runs over man), mother Naomi and teenage son Logan move into aunt Allie's mountain house due to a resulting financial crisis. Huge house, pleasant neighborhood, kind neighbors (albeit a bit peculiar) with the only downside being the house is up for sale. Every few days Naomi and Logan must vacate the premises of their new home in order to allow realtors to present it and prospective buyers to tour it. Following the first open house occasion, Logan begins to suspect somebody has invaded their home and means to harm them.From that point on - things become increasingly discomforting leading to a crescendo of a horrific conclusion. As I need to refrain from any spoilers - let me just say that the realism factor of The Open House is very bluntly maintained in the end, as the viewer is left full of unanswered questions and rather frustrated. It took me two days of contemplation and reading quite a few online reviews to understand the sheer genius of the plot. Unanswered questions, untied loose ends, more question marks than facts - that is how most of the truly horrific crime scenes in history were concluded. Case closed due to lack of evidence. Many suspects, no arrests or convictions. The Open House leaves us in this exact position, same as such a crime scene would have had we had the misfortune of sharing the characters' fate.However, let's be bluntly honest. A film is not judged according to two days of research and contemplation. Most of you, I reckon, would finish watching this film and feel cheated, frustrated and disappointed, and justifiably so. Nobody (let alone Netflix) can demand of their audience such patience and consideration. True, in this case they would be quite rewarding, as one would really understand the depth of the horror the film presents. But that's not how films are judged, nor should they be. Adding to that the fact that many of the red herrings and bluntly obvious hints presented through the plot end up being completely unnecessary and nothing more than a cheap deception tactic - and you get a film that I personally can only rate high due to research and lots of thinking. Others prefer watching a film without turning it into a project. So, few of you would probably recognize the ending as fantastic and innovative, but most of you would be rather angry for having wasting your time.",

I haven't previously very much liked Netflix' own productions, with the exception of the excellent Black Mirror, which I didn't watch until just recently, because I assumed it would be crap too. I don't understand why Netflix wants to associate crappy movies like this to their name, because it's really going to need a miracle to lure me into watching another movie carrying the Netflix logo.So what makes it bad? If you've read any of the other reviews, you already know that the script makes zero sense. We have a mother and her son who after dads death and financial problems move into aunts huge house up in the mountains. They can live there as long as they get out of the house every time there is an open house as the house is on sale. Big house, weird things happen, things change place, neighbour is strange. Everything is a bit \"creepy\" and most of the movie is about them going around the house looking all serious and worried.Here follows a major spoiler.. or a time saver if you will.There is no proper plot at any point really. A few characters are introduced and there are red herrings that make you think if some people are up to no good, but in the end almost everyone gets killed and we get no reason why. No resolution or a reason. The finale is just so insanely bad and frustrating. There is someone in the house who suddenly - after making small pranks for a few weeks - starts to crack fingers and kill people. We never get to know who he or she is or why this happens. There is a scene in the end where we see the nutty neighbour strolling in the woods as the boy is trying to escape the killer, but nothing points to her being the killer. Other than the fact that she happens to be in woods.My guess is that the movie makers had a grand idea that they are going to make having an open house a scary thing, that some nutcase might stay in the house and start terrorizing. The final image shows a car driving to another \"open house\", which makes it seem that the killer was just a random killer going from open house to another. But you can't just throw in random scary things and then have a random ending, you need a plot.The acting is ok and the movie actually looks pretty good, with proper color grading and nice drone shots up in the mountains. Those make up for one extra star.Avoid.",

Then strange things start to happen and then they end up getting terrorized. Point of the story, you never know who yer letting into yer house. Someone stuck around in the massive house until their job was done. I'm watching it a second time. I liked it that much. I love the kid who acts in this he's absolutely adorable!

The antagonist was never introduced nor did they have any reason for attacking the protagonists of this movie, really unreasonable and confusing. Feels like this movie was just compiled of random scenes and characters doing absolutely irrelevant actions creating a messy plot, if we can call it a plot, to be quite frank it really seemed very unorganized, nothing felt reasonable in this movie. When you do not have a strong premise for any actions in a movie, it is incredibly hard to create and justify the reasoning behind actions, so we can see in this movie, everything was utterly pointless creating a large mashup of boring and drawn out scenes leading into nothingness. Another thing i would like to point out, the sound effects used in this movie were absolutely dreadful, an utter pile of dire garbage sound effects thrown in every random scene to make it more suspensful for no reason, since this film did not have clever jump scares or scary moments the directors were reduced to creating suspense purely by sound effects, which failed miserably. Interestingly enough this movie does not have an ending so to speak or you could say the ending was so stupid it was laughable. Overall, a really bad movie, would never recommend to anybody, nothing original, plain stupid actions mashed together hoping people will enjoy it. A big fail of a film, do not watch!",

It is true that possibly they could have better excuted some parts of it, especially towards the end, to wrap it all together. Some parts of the film were unclear.

            "content": "I registered JUST to write this ONE review.I have loved many unpopular movies that get complaints like \"It didn't make sense!\" or \"The ending left too many questions.\" So trust me: this film is NOT a case of artful ambiguity or clever deliberate frustration of audience expectations, or a film that's \"playing with\" or \"overturning\" the clich\u00e9s of the genre. This is just poor writing. It feels desperate and awkward.The movie SAFE (with Julianne Moore) is one that raises predictable audience expectations regarding the genre (disease-of-the-week-made-for-TV-movies) and deliberately has them all dead-end or fizzle. Open House is not doing this, so don't look at all those 1-star ratings and think this might be a misunderstood arty gem. It is not. It is not LET THE RIGHT ONE IN; it is not THELMA; it is not GOODNIGHT MOMMY. It is not a clever art horror movie. It is generous to call it a movie.The son is an aspiring track star who actually has pretty mediocre speeds but who cares cuz his dad is dedicated to his training and the fam seems so happy. But the son's talent, dreams, ambitions, and Dad's sharing of all those have nothing to do with anything that happens later, at all. Of course the cliched thing to do would be to put the son in a situation where the track and field training pays off and because of his practice and pluck he's able to get out of a situation with sheer speed. Such a trite trope would be an improvement. Instead all this backstory is irrelevant, as the characters receive no momentum or impetus from what we learn of their lives before things go south. Every single last thing we learn about their very thin lives is utterly irrelevant to what happens later, and this is not some clever meta-point about pointlessness or over-done tropes.Then there's just the ineptness. There's the weird neighbor lady who can't remember whether her husband is alive or dead. She has nothing to do with anything. Then there's the strangely familiar cashier at the convenience store who is thinking of buying the million-dollar mansion in the mountains (?!) so shows up for Open House when it's not showing hours and so they let him in and don't check or notice when/if he leaves. He is also irrelevant. There's the tense and brittle sister of the mom whose unexplained wealth gives her a very well-kept mountain mansion she never uses so has been on the market forever, and there seems to be some tension between the mom and her sis. All of this turns out to be irrelevant as well. Then there's the strangely pushy real estate people who bring a little Kafkaesque humor to the situation; at one point the obsequious assistant is discovered in the home way past showing time who nervously gives a twitchy \"We ran late\" explanation before dashing out. Also irrelevant, having nothing to do with anything else that happens. Then there is the big imposing figure in big heavy workboots who somehow soundlessly glides through the shadows of the home unheard by people feet away from him. No explanation of who he is or why he's there. Then there is the by-now-curiously-common catacomb beneath the house (lots of those these days) with a tunnel going nowhere, blocked by rubble. No explanation of what/why/how/etc for that. Then there are the strange noises coming from down in the basement, heavy industrial sounds. No explanation.Workboots guy kills the convenience store clerk, tortures the mom, then chases and kills the son, after the movie has spent over an hour NOT basing this on ANYTHING. This movie is bad, and not in a funny, interesting, campy, unique, or any other conceivably redeeming way. It's a malicious insult to the unnecessarily good acting.",

            "content": "So after watching this movie I am left wanting more, not more because it was so good and leaves you with a feeling of such greatness that only more it it will satisfy, but the more feeling of \"that's it????\"!! It was a total WTF movie and ends leaving almost every story line without any type of conclusion. Aside from the fact you meet a couple characters that seem to be an integral part of the story, however they could have never been in the movie and it wouldnt have made a difference. The neighbor lady who you meet in the beginning and how she says the sister emailed her about them coming? They are staying in her sister's house that they are trying to sell. There is no talk to the sister about this, nor is there anything from the sister about it. You also meet a plumber who says hes been I the house before, butbyet once again there is no mention as to when or why he has ever been there the plumber does end up leaving you a bit suspicious of him, but his time was a complete waste. Now getting to the mom and son this is what really drives me insane with suspense films. So the first night the incident with the car and the neighbor lady, he is woken up by a knock at their door and a car in the driveway shining its lights into the house. Now just like any suspense movie he goes out to investigate, he walks out after the car leaves and looks around. Then of course you are surprised by the lady who is standing behind him. Ok I get it, you want to play up the craziness of the neighbor, however the next morning the son explained nothing to his mom except for the lady being there. That's it, no car, no knock, no strange feeling about everything so far. Now come to the next day, open house day. So they are awoken by the realtors who are selling the house. They were told to be out of the house by 11 am sharp, but the realtors foyers say 10 am. Now given the fact that it is an hour early there is once again no mention of the earlier start time. Which brings me to the assistant realtor. When the two return home at what seems like10 at night, the house is dark and the door is unlocked. Now they walk in and the home is dark, no sound, no lights, and no one in sight, but them they are startled by the realtor who says they ran late and just rushes out the door? Now you may not think anything of it , but at the beginning of the scene you hear the realtors discussing a sign in sheet and making sure everyone signs in. When that happens and the open house starts you see thevrwaltor greeting everyone that walks in the door. Then you see it, the boots of what you are lead to believe are the \"bad guy\". You also know this because of how they are captured in the frame. So getting back to the realtor, he greets everyone that comes through the door, which by my understanding you would also say goodbye to everyone, am I right?!?! Well you are later left to assume someone didnt leave! Well now for the laps in the main story line. So they mom.and son are there, carrying on as a mom and son would. Oh and they just lost the dad of the family, but it doeant matter, because it really doesn't matter that they lost the dad because that has no bearimgnon the main plot! So they are carrying on with their lives. So at one point things start to seem strange, the son's bowl of cer eww al is moved from.one from to another, his phone also disappears, and when the mom is showering the hot water is turned off. Now the hot water just stops, which is completely wrong, especially how she then goes down and check the water heater and it is turned off. Ok, so far just in one night we have the son's cereal bowl moved, his phone goes missing, the water heater is shut off, and, now this is a big and, and the son hears someone in the basement! Ok at this point you would have thought, son and mom have a conversation about all this? Nope! Nothing, not until 2 more days go by and things continue to happen but again no conversation until the mom bursts into the soms room and tells at him for messing with her over the last few days. The son who at this point has had several things happen to him doeant say anything other than, it wasn't me. So now that we've established the flaws in the characters and the main story let's jump to the final night. So after returning home from what again seems like a 15 hour open house/showing the mom receives a phone message from her sister. The sister says we just got notified someone broke into the house! So what do they do? They drive home and walk up to an unlocked door and of course, walk right in! Now when entering the house they are met with music blaring, a table has been set and candles are even burning on the table. So they then decide, I think we should call the police! Well that is a joke in itself. the police are there and the \"check the house\" top to bottom. But as you guessed it, they couldn't find anyone! Well you would think if they couldn't find anyone it would be because the house is so big they seem to be in the wrong rooms at the wrong time. Wrong! They search a basement that has corridor type rooms that are literally no bigger than a closet and are made of stone! No where to hide! Well needless to say the cops leave and the son makes the first statement that makes sense, we shouldn't be here! Well of course, they stay there. So while this is happening you find out the \"bad guy\" I mentioned earlier, really didnt leave! He was, you guessed, in the basement! So after a few scuffles in the house between the bad guy and mom and son, the son manages to escape, but not because hes smart enough to fight back and run away, no. He escapes after he mistakenly stabs his mom and the bad guy wrestles him to the ground and with his hand over the boys mouth, removes the boys contacts and throws him out the door!?!?! Ok I guess the bad guy wants a challenge, no it turned into a classic Michael Myers or Jason scene where no matter how fast or how far you run, 5 seconds later he is there, and you die. Well I hate to say but that's it you die, the son dies the mom dies. With this happening it leaves you completely missing out on the story lines that were created, sister and sister's house, crazy neighbor lady, cops that were supposed to return in the morning, all the cliche thing that are introduced in your typical suspense movie. This was a complete waste of time and I would highly recommend passing on it. Oh and I left a few other thing out of this review, but it doesnt matter! None of the things that happen in this movie matter!",

First of all the suspense was reminiscent of Halloween build up, and you had your red herrings and suspects, and even thought well maybe it is the mom or the kid doing something? But all that guessing is for not, because the writers gave up on any pay off for those threads. Instead they make the stalker/killer completely anonymous, even going so far as to have him remove the contacts from the kids eyes so he would be blurry. Interesting choice I say to myself, where will it lead? NOWHERE. They start to have him torture the mom, and then he just stops. You then think, ok now we get a payoff for the kid doing all that running in the movie and its going to be a cat and mouse game in the woods with the kid having to run faster than he ever has before...right? Wrong. Nope the kid just ends up staying in the woods and finally coming out for a drink of water only to quickly be dispensed with...off screen. And that's pretty much it. A stranger plays games in a house for no real reason, we don;t even know if he's a psycho. A mom and a kid are scared to death, yet for some reason sleep so soundly the stranger can just walk around and take pictures of them, move their stuff, and they wake up just scratching their head trying to figure it out. Even though there is one land line phone, it makes a sound like an extension is off the hook, Even though cell phones can call 911 without a sim card, they have 2 that can't. Even though the police say they will stop by in the morning, they don't. By the way if this town is so QUIET, why are they so uninterested in a break in even if it was a kid prank?? Why does a big expensive house have no security system? Why does the kid leave his mother with a broken hand knowing the killer is still around. WHY?? Because the writer's wrote half a story and then proceeded to try to unpaint themselves out of a corner by having all the characters lower their IQ suddenly, and technology goes wacky. OR I think they were shooting and got to the point where the would be boyfriend is murdered, the mother being tied up and tortured, the kid just coming back to his senses and the phone wrings on set...\"Hey Its Netflix, they say we have to wrap up shooting today...\" and this was the end result...",

People were murdered by a serial killer, and the murderer goes on to keep killing, until he or she is caught. They never show who the killer is, because he is just a random person, who stalks his victims and gains access through their open houses. The end of the movie shows him driving his truck and turning onto a road that has an open house sign, implying he is searching for a new family to kill. The concept is great, they could have executed it a little better, but it was entertaining enough. Wondering if there will be a sequel.",

The buffoonery starts in the opening scene where the teenage son is running down the street. He asks his father for the time, and it's 5:07. They talk about how this is going to open the doors to scholarships. Note: serious runners want time down to the hundredth of a second. Well, dad is soon offed in a parking lot accident. So what's mom and son to do without him? The answer of course, move into aunt's vacation home in the mountains she just so happens to have on the market. You know, because exploring the \"horror\" behind an open house inviting strangers into YOUR home should probably have something to do with the protagonists' house being for sell and not one they're merely staying at. Instead, it's like they're on vacation and this is only one of the numerous terrible plot points. Hope you like characters who don't talk like humans. You're going to get a lot of that in The Open House. There's the creepy neighbor who reminds the widowed mother that her husband died on meeting her. There's also an overly friendly guy working retail whose sole purpose is to be everywhere.I hope the inept team that worked on this reads this review, if for no other reason so they can learn the following about horror:\n1) Having the hot water in the shower repeatedly turn off is not scary. \n2) Making multiple trips to a \"scary\" basement unharmed diminishes the threat. \n3) Returning \"home\" after an open house to find a phone on the table is not scary.\n4) Filling your movie with red herrings doesn't automatically make sense of the ending.\n5) The one time a horror movie sets up the protagonist as a track star and he gets not payoff.IMdB, you removed the message boards, but can you please add a feature where users can select cast and crew to a personal list which flags all their past and future work?",

In short, nobody in real life would ever behave the way the movie's characters do. So it is in The Open House. A recently widowed mother and her seemingly none too bright teenage son move into her sister's palatial mountain mansion because she can't afford the rent on her own house after her husband dies. The catch is the house is for sale so she and her son must leave for the realtor open houses every Sunday. During the first open house, a sinister figure seen only from the knees down comes to the showing. After it's over and they've returned home, son says to Mom that open houses are weird because you give people keys to your house so they can look at it when you're not home. But how do you know they ever leave the house? Therein lies the entire plot. Given the massive house and the number of rooms in it, of course the ominous stranger who possesses those legs we saw earlier is still there stalking them. These two are so ignorant of what's going on around them that the homicidal stranger climbs into bed with Mom and she doesn't even notice. How idiotic can a movie character get?

(kid \"lost\" his phone in the beginning of movie) so they eventually call a plumber, the house looked suspiciously like the shadow figure seen earlier briefly in the house at night (same gut). he checked the heater, said it should be all good, also \"found\" the kids phone by it. weird that the kid or mom didn't see it before unless it was literally behind the whole thing. STRONG suspicion. again though it never seems to pan out, the voice seemed different at the end as well.\nall kinds of weird stuff happening, cops called ZERO times, not until the realtor told them \"the house has been broken into\" where they race to facecheck without phoning the police before THEY personally rush to the house.\nwhich doesn't make sense due to their passive, write-offish nature the writers gave them. they are inconsistent characters, they make no sense, they are poorly written.\nanyway they see a creepy living room setup with a candle and stuff, the phone rings, nobody there again, just another weird ominous phone call. finally they call the cops. cops do nothing, they \"checked the house\"\nthey stay in the house because they don't have the \"money\" for a hotel.\nso call a damn family member or friend.\nthey get owned. also killer makes it look like the kid did it basically.\nbasically there is no real clues or indication who the criminal was, I guess it was some random psycho? nothing was explained. \nthe movie needed more characters, like the game clue. you want the audience to try to figure out who and why. that's what would have made this interesting.\nof course not ALL horrors need to follow this formula, but that is majorly the direction this movie was headed formula wise. and it failed. it's not a slasher, it's not paranormal. it was written very much as a slow burner mystery horror thriller, it had such an identity crisis near the end.",

There is an open house conducted every Sunday so the pair have to clear out during the showings. When they arrive a series of odd events and even more odd supporting characters make an appearance. I can't even begin to describe how the plot develops beyond that because it was an unpalatable mess. There was no real structure to it, people come and go who you think are part of the story and then are never seen again. There is no sincere attempt to explain anything. Just weird, unconnected plot points that add up to dead ends. Acting was ok if not phoned in. It was as if the writers just threw together a loosely connected series of scenes without any plot development and topped it off with a cheap and nonsensical ending.

A co-worker warned me not to watch this, and I thought she was crazy since it was a good movie. . .then I got to the end. It's as if Netflix couldn't decide if they wanted this to be supernatural or just a crazed killer. This was really a good movie and then they just ruined it with no explanation at the end, and honestly the \"Open House\" has nothing to do with the movie. Clearly we're led to believe there was a death in the house and that leads to some unexplained things happening, but that story is never developed, and we're left with a faceless (non-supernatural) killer in the end. Since we are shown a vehicle at the end, and the neighbor, Martha, acts strange throughout the movie, I went back to the scene at the little store when they first met Martha to see if the vehicle at the end was in the store parking lot earlier, which would've given a little closure. . . . it isn't, don't waste your time. Here's what I was thinking the whole time (and what would've made the movie much better): Martha and her husband used to live in the home and she was forced to leave after his death. So now you have his spirit haunting the house, and her disgruntled for having to vacate, leading her to terrorize the new family. That theory was blown out of the water when the hot water heater repairman acknowledges that Martha does indeed live down the street, and no one in the movie mentions that she ever lived there (despite her making claims that it's her property in the beginning). Hmmm now I need to go see if we're ever shown the repairmans vehicle.Very disappointing, the movie had real potential and was enjoyable until the end. Some people are giving the movie a decent rating because 90% of the movie was good, but when the 10% that is awful is the end and failure to tie the story together, you don't get partial credit. Don't waste your time. You'll be like me, watching, thinking it's a really good thriller and the reviews were harsh and then you'll be sadly let down at the end.",

There were some little scares that startled me and I was waiting for more intense moments. There were some. \nAlso I usually don't even notice some small mistakes in movies, but in this case they straight up bothered me. And also the logic or rather illogic aspects such as you can't call for help with no SIM in your phone. Or the stairs that were broken and then not broken etc. The son who heard and felt weird things in the house, but then didn't bother to look out for his mom when she went alone in the basement. And the way the boy really disliked the friendly male neighbour and then all of a sudden called him for help. At times I thought even why the hell they stayed in this house..didn't they have no other place whatsoever to go to or to stay in, any relatives or smth. And speaking of relatives, why didn't the woman ask her sister what's up with this weird house and the neighbours etc. \nAlso the bad guy of the movie was so weird and his actions didn't make any sense whatsoever - breaking the mom's fingers, not taking the phones, but rather just taking the SIMs out and the way he killed everyone was also very random. I mean yeah, there aren't a lot of movies that actually kill their main characters at the end and it is always refreshing to see something different, but in this case they managed to ruin even that. The ending just didn't do anything for me. It was random, flat, not interesting and okay yeah it left me wondering oooh will the killer go to some other random house that is for sale and does weird things to the people in it or maybe to the open house visitors. But what are the chances that a house that is for sale and has open house days has people living in it. Oh yeah right, this movie doesn't do well with logic. \nOverall this was so disappointing that I just can't give it anything other than 1 star out of 10.

When Logan's beloved father dies in a fateful car crash, him and his mother, Naomi, fall on economic hard times. Unable to financially support herself and her teenage son, she moves into her sister's reclusive mountain chalet home until they sell it. On Sundays, the pair had to leave the home until 5 pm so potential buyers can look around. When they returned, strange things started to happen, objects began to move around, loud noises and items went missing. They soon realized they were not alone and in the house with a sadistic killer. Living in the mountains there makes their chances of survival become more cat and mouse.\nThe Open House had the potential to be a good independent home invasion thriller, but with so many inconsistencies and lack of connection to any of the characters, it became tedious.

            "content": "I haven't read yet this as a potential theory (though I'm sure it's out there), but here goes...My thought:is that the killer is neighbor's (Martha) husband, and they're actually working together. She's acting as if she has Alzheimer'st to cause confusion & add to the oddities/terror of the soon-to-be victims. When Logan escapes the house and runs to the woods and hides behind the log, Martha wanders extremely close to him, stares into the sky, then wanders away. I believe she actually saw him, got close enough to (again) add to his terror, walked away w/o interacting...and went straight to her husband to tell him where she saw him so that he could hunt him down to finish it. Add to that, it is possible her husband (and killer) is the plumber...which would additionally tie together some of his comments (being familiar/having been there) and finding Logan's phone, etc.Or....the actual killer is someone not introduced to the audience and everyone else in the movie is truly 100% innocent. We see stories daily in today's world/news of people being attacked or murdered, but we never actually find out all the details for closure on the vast majority of them. This movie captures that aspect amazingly in either of the above approaches. Look at this movie as if you were reading a news story, or the police involved...you have very little to go off, but at least have a couple additional possible clues that we normally wouldn't in real life.Kudos to this movie breaking the norm that 99.99% of movies follow to give the audience full closure. This isn't the first, and hopefully is not the last, movie where the ending either isn't fully explained or isn't fully a traditional wrapped up happy ending. We don't always get all the answers, we don't always get our way, life isn't always fair.ps: this is my very 1st movie review on IMDB, after giving ratings reviews for countless of them. After reading many reviews, just felt strongly enough to put in my perspective and thinking this was a MUCH better movie than most reviews give it credit for.",

The movie actually had no plot or character depth. Odd characters were thrown in without any ties or purpose to the movie. Characters acted strange and you'd think their strangeness would have something to do with the \"plot\" but it didn't.The flow of the film was not cohesive. The nightmares the son was having I thought had to do with the plot, it didnt. Sure it showed his struggles with his father's death but the way in which it was showcased made it seem as though it would be apart of something bigger. That something bigger never came. Those creepy camera angles/shots were pointless and were of a great waste.I felt like I was watching the day to day life of any family. I also feel like the writer of this film was torn between trying to build characters to show how they process grief and rebuild their relationship and making a horror film. He seemed to have gotten mixed up somewhere inbetwen that process because character development and the suspense and horror were both lacking and very premature.What was up with the \"mysterious\" basement? Why even give it such great focus?I kept watching in hopes that it would get better but it never did and by the time it was over I felt so cheated.How can you have a murderer with no background, no identity, no reason? No one aware of him existing. Why did he kill? So many questions. The murderer was not developed, even he had no depth or true presence.If you watch this you'll be confused and frustrated.I don't like to give such negative views but I had to be honest.

Ironic since those answers usually nullify the terror and suspense that proceed the final act. Instead, it leaves us with far more questions than answers, an unusual approach to this genre. The best things about this one is its scenery and its acting - both above average for this kind of movie. But the lack of answers - ANY AT ALL - takes away from that. We get dropped into the middle of someone else's story but know nothing about them or their motives - an interesting concept. And when you get over that initial viewing, it's quite unnerving to think about going through what the family does. It's actually quite realistic in that way, a way most horror/suspense films can't touch. The twist in this one is that tragically, like most victims in real life, sometimes we just don't get the closure we want. Unfortunately, there's just something about it that fails to satisfy. The acting is on par - nothing Oscar worthy of course but solid; the cinematography is solid but the natural setting more than holds it own. Yet there's something missing in its entirety. There are no answers, and I was okay with that after a few moments of me being really angry at whoever thought this was a good idea; the second act is where it falls into the Stupid Trap, where the cops are called and they stupidly think nothing's happened and everything goes just as you suspect. Perhaps that is where the movie loses its charm. The ending stands out - how well its received depends entirely on the viewer - but is again nullified by the typical genres go-to for everything: dumb down the characters inexplicably despite their previous actions.Overall, there are way better movies that accomplish all of this and more without a Netflix budget.",

            "content": "\"Mom. Have you ever thought about how, like, weird open houses are? I mean you give your keys to someone you hardly know, they stand in one room and welcome in a bunch of complete strangers, and those people just roam around the house. And the realtor doesn't check the house when it's done right, they just... turn the lights off and go?\" If that quote doesn't scare you, then I doubt this will. The Open House really has no plot. It's plot is thin, even for the horror genre. Right now the word coming to mind is \"stupid\" and \"waste of time\" when it comes to this movie, if you can even call it that. I'm labeling this as a spoiler review, even though I'm not sure exactly how you spoil this movie, because nothing really happens? The first three fourths of the movie is spent alternating between scenes of Dylan Minnette panting after finishing a run, Dylan Minnette listening to music on his computer, Dylan Minnette walking around the house and then showing his mom in the shower. Obviously this movie was made cheaply because everything feels so insular, and only three or four characters seem to occupy the town where the mains have moved to. The killer isn't seen much until the last twenty minutes or so when he then kills a minor character, kills the mom character and then kills Dylan Minnette's character. All within twenty minutes! The garbage pacing makes it seem as though not a single thing happens for at least an hour. The fact that the killer is never shown doesn't add any real fear, and it basically makes the ending even more unsatisfying than it already is. The two leads had no chemistry, and the necessity of showing the death of the dad is questionable at best, but I'm guessing was included to simply add to the runtime, which only clocks in at about an hour and a half. There's a saying that if you can't make a movie good, at least make it short, and I'm guessing that was the mantra of whoever was behind this.",

It didn't reveal who the killer was and what their motivation was . Thus rendering the previous part of the movie senseless .In short this film takes a long time to get where its going and goes nowhere and leaves the viewer cheated,the Ending makes the viewer want to shout \" WTF ! \". yes it is that type of ending!\n \nI am starting to get ticked off with these Netflix movie type of terrible endings;",

But once we determine the intruder to be human, there's one really good scare and then it's all down hill from there. There is no explanation as to who the intruder is, where he's come from, why he wants the house or why he only started this deranged stalking with these two people. Surely if the mother's sister was having issues she wouldn't have let her sister and nephew stay there. You'd think, right? Maybe she hated her and this was payback? Maybe she'd taken out a huge life insurance policy on them and paid the intruder to kill them. Who knows? Those ideas at least would have given the story some closure.

Perhaps too many cooks ??The run time is 1 hr 37 minutes, and whilst this isn't a long film, to quote Mark Kermode, it is overly long and baggy, so much so you could probably have left the 37 minutes on the cutting room floor.Unfortunately, it makes for a poor effort in a time when poor movies are not suffered by the viewing public.

No reason, no carefully laid out path to follow, just terror. But that's why we watch horror movies (even though this might be better classed as a thriller), to be afraid, to be disturbed, to think. Or at least I do. I can imagine he's the neighbor's husband or the man almost killed in the road. Or maybe someone completely random who gave in to his demons.

I could follow the story line. I like a simple chronological narrative.\n2. There were the weird characters that I assumed would be involved in an amazing \"ah haa\" ending that would offer a lasting impression (because these types of characters are in my thriller/mystery films). I don't necessarily like characters like this but I expect them in mystery films. (Spoiler for remainder of point 2.) What I liked most about these characters is that for once, they didn't have anything to do with explaining the ending. They were just weirdo people. No links to the confusion of the film other than themselves being a little odd.\n3. I think the strange occurrences in the house were reality-based i.e., the characters could realistically 'get away with' thinking they're not losing their minds enough to go down the supernatural path.\n4. I think many of the character's choices in response to ominous situations were realistic, because it's easy to rationalise away these simple strange occurrences. For example, \"I thought I put my phone there. Hmmm. Now it's not. Okay, probably left it somewhere else\". Rationalised - easy-peasy.\n5. The film held a consistent tone of unease thanks to the camerawork, direction, score, lighting and editing. The production of this film is pretty effective.\n6. Decent acting. Not over-the-top or unbelievable or cringe-worthy.\n7. The final act gets pretty brutal. The ending will feel unsatisfying for most viewers but I kinda like that for a change.The story line is so basic, really.\nI suppose I'm giving the movie only four stars because I am someone who likes a satisfying ending. The movie suggested there would be some amazing explanation by the end, or did it really? I've seen so many mystery/thriller films that I've come to expect twist endings, or a real Woooooow Wow ah-huh moment. When I got over my little hollywood brainwashed disappointment, I was left feeling sad for the characters and proud of the films creators.",

The plot feels like something that would have made for an average episode of a horror anthology series, ruined by making it an hour too long.I will admit that, at first, I was intrigued by certain events. Was the threat going to be supernatural, or human? Why did the realtor's assistant act so strangely? How did the kooky neighbor fit into all of this, and what was the deal with the flirty store owner? The goings-on in the house were appropriately creepy and served to ratchet up the tension factor while my brain tried to figure out what was going on. Unfortunately, my interest soon began to wane as the film drug on and on with no sign of livening up the proceedings to give us something new to think about until the final twenty minutes when, mercifully, some things finally begin to happen. And, as it turns out, most of those plot devices mentioned earlier end up being either red herrings or a whole lot of nothing.There really isn't a whole lot of imagination going on in \"The Open House\", despite first appearances. The execution is quite misleading in making us think there's something far more elaborate going on than what the movie actually reveals it is. One can't help but feel duped at the end. Tricked, if you will, into thinking the film had more to offer. Oh, suspense scenes are carried out with a certain aplomb, but when it all amounts to mediocrity in the end, was the journey there really worth it?None of this is helped by the fact that the film seems to struggle with its tone--something that can probably be attributed to the fact it had more than one director. The tone of the ending, in particular, feels out-of-character and as if it belongs to another, darker film entirely, given that until then the proceedings felt so very much like an expensive episode of a TV series.I'm tempted to give the film another star it doesn't deserve simply due to the fact that Dylan Minnette is nice to look at, but I'll refrain.",

Not a single bulb can be taken elsewhere in the house?Twice the mother goes downstairs in her towel just after getting out of the shower all soaked, surprise! When she gets downstairs her hair is almost all dry! That same mother can't pay the restaurant bill but spends money on getting her pictures developed, why is that? Hello priorities. At the end, the son has ice in his hair and eyebrows, ice that will not melt inside the house.

They entire opening of the movie which was pretty engaging was completely without purpose, and it contrived to lead to a setting that was also great, but in the end served no purpose either. Hinging the story on the idea that open houses are scary (they're not BTW) would have been better served if they had just stayed at their suburban home which they would have had to sell to cover the debts, instead of having to move out because of the rent into some holiday cabin of the super rich sister (who for some reason can't help her in any other way, and who we never see or hear from again) which is a super evocative location, but a set up for a completely different movie.

For a moment I thought it was heading down an interesting path and it certainly could have been a lot better if they had taken the time to sit down and actually think about what they were writing. But instead we get this. The movie goes from being semi interesting to suddenly making little sense. The characters witness things moving around their house and yet go on with their daily lives like nothing is happening. If that doesn't upset you, by the time the movie is supposed to hit its peak point you already have lost interest and the killing scenes further upset you because you never see the killers face and he some how knows how to magically move around without being seen. The climax or lack there of is literally just a huge disappointment and by the very end you are left wondering what, who, and why the whole thing happened in the first place.

            "content": "This may be a a long-winded one, with lots of spoilers, but I'll give it a go.I'll start off by explaining my 3-star rating; which according to numerous prior reviews, is high. I give one star for each of the main characters, and one for the setting. But it ends there.First off, although I'm a fan of horror, I'm not a huge fan of psychological thrillers, especially ones with rampant stalkers/murderers; I prefer a paranormal element, or at least something clever or unique. Having said that, the movie looked compelling and I gave it a shot. I watched the entire film, even though the last couple of minutes hinted at a disastrous ending. I wasn't disappointed.Let's start with the positives. Both main characters were decent actors; and the setting, this monstrous palazzo, was beautiful. I'm a sucker for secluded houses or cabins in films. The husband is killed at the beginning in a somewhat baffling and curious manner, that really had no connection or tie-back to the story. And what was the deal with the camera reminding us he forgot to get milk? I filed this away, thinking it would come back and be significant, but it never really did, other than the hesitation when mom also bought milk later in the story. Were we supposed to think that had the husband remembered the milk, that extra 5-10 seconds delay would have prevented him from being run down in the parking lot? We will never know.Thankfully, the movie quickly moved past dad's death, and we were on our way to the mansion. But again, we know mom is having huge financial problems, and with the husband dead, it's gotten worse. Could not her sister, the one who owns a second (vacation) home the size of a small castle, throw her a couple of grand?They arrive at this gorgeous home, by my estimation, several million dollars worth of real estate. And it isn't an 'old' house, it's a new modern build, so mom saying the noise in the basement is just the 'old pipes' doesn't register. Sure it may have been built atop an older structure, but it's not likely. And what's with the rotary phones? It's not like the decor was from the '70's. The basement was also is curious. The stone walls, which was very obviously faux brick/stone, actually looked quite cool, and I thought 'nice choice' for whoever added that touch to this wonderful. It wasn't real though, as I think the director had intended. And why did we get a glimpse of a basement passageway that led to a dead end, stoned piled up to the ceiling? They never followed up on this, or even revisited this creepy basement hallway. Another red herring? Was it a hidden tunnel that led underground to their crazy banana bread making neighbor? Your guess is as good as mine.And I'm sorry, but a 6000 square foot mansion does not have one 60-gallon water heater. Not even close.The whole 'Open House' concept was never fleshed out. If you name your movie after something as specific as this, there should at least be some connection, explanation, or clever plot twist. There wasn't. There was just a couple of random open houses with non-nonsensical characters running the show.Even though I liked the character they met in the clothing shop, his actions are completely ridiculous. First of all, anyone who pulls up to that house saying they're interested in purchasing it, better be at least driving a BMW 7 series, and have a $25,000 Rolex on their wrist. No looky-loos. This guy did not strike me as a person who had a few million burning a whole in his pocket. Also, later on, the fact that he volunteered to spent the night with complete strangers, was even more ridiculous. But I imagine his re-arrival at the house acted as another potential red-herring, keeping the audience guessing if in fact he might be the killer.Past reviews mentioned the continuity issues of their arrival at the home (day/night/day) so I won't add to that. However the ending went abruptly from night to daylight, and the boy was still running with his flashlight on, miraculously, not yet succumbed to hypothermia.Having Police tell you there's nothing more they can do when your home has quite obviously been broken into, is baloney. This was clearly a break and enter, they would have fingerprinted, photographed, etc. Also, one officer cannot check a 6000 sq. foot home for intruders. Even with both of them searching, clearing that house properly would taken hours. One person clearing (the other Officer was apparently keeping the mother and son company), doesn't work. Anyone hiding could just move room to room, and avoid detection.I enjoyed the first 2/3 of the movie, I would have given it 6 stars. But it quickly deteriorated into a free-fall. We never know who the killer is - is he the plumber (looked a lot like him); the crazy neighbor or her (dead/not dead) husband? Was the plumber the husband? Was it someone who sneaked inside during the Open House and never left?There is no tie-in, no attempt to dispel any red herrings, no sense to the ending. Brutal violence, a killing spree, crazy neighbor lady wandering through the woods in the middle of the night, the killer pouring water on the unconscious boy (inducing hypothermia?), removing the kid's contacts.All absurd.The director/writers can't claim they intentionally left an ambiguous ending because they wanted the viewer to draw their own conclusions. Conclusions based on what? Random red herrings that never panned out? Nothing made sense, there was no attempt at unifying 90 minutes of confusing plot, wrapping it up so that we'd walk away thinking, \"oh, I get it now.\".Never happened.I agree with the 1-star reviewers on the ending. cheap cop-out. This was a non-conclusion. It's as if they had filmed an ending, than said, you know what, we're fifteen minutes over, just cut it here.Just cut it here.Full of promise that abruptly fizzled.",

I guess it's up to the viewer to know why. No aspect of this is ever revealed, except that the villain is some kind of random psycho who likes open houses. Maybe???This movie could have been redeemed by inserting a story element revealing that (for example) the husband of the sister who owned the house was a secret killer who didn't want to sell the house. Although I just thought of that story element, i truly think that is more thought that the writers put into this screenplay. They could have spent less time with the water heater to include something, ANYTHING, that revealed more about the killer.There are a lot of good low budget horror movies out there, but The Open House isn't one of them.The only horror that I got from this movie was when the credits rolled and I realized the time wasted on this movie.",

Sure there are few subtle hints sprinkled but ultimately this one falls disappointingly flat at its conclusion.Wasted potential? Very much so.

I agree with the other review describing it as a \"frustrating watch\" because thats exactly what it is.I would have given it a star for the supporting actress, and another star for production, but the writing is so bad, it effectively erases any positive effects.

Regular weekend open house tours for prospective buyers are held, where Logan and his mum are required leave the house for several hours.Strange things start happening, noises from the creepy basement, the water heater being turned off, Logan's phone and glasses going missing. Initially Naomi thinks Logan is playing pranks on her, until she wakes to find an unknown man in bed with her, who subsequently ties her up and breaks her fingers.The outcome for Logan and mum Naomi, isn't good, but we never find out who the murderous man is, we only ever see his boots. We don't find out how he got in the house or why he wants to harm them. The ending is disappointing with no explanation about anything.There is one scene where Logan and his mum arrive home after the open house afternoon has ended and the Realtor's assistant who is running the event, looks flustered and panicked, again, we never know why this is.Then there is Martha, a strange woman in her sixties who keeps bumping into Logan and Naomi. First she says she's a widow then claims she isn't. In one scene Logan hears noises at night, goes outside and is startled by Martha who tells him to get out of her house.Naomi is told by a plumber that Martha has Dementia, but I'm sure I saw a part where Logan goes into the woods, where Martha claims she lives and the house has been knocked down. So does Martha exist, does the plumber exist? And why are all the characters in the same clothes everyday.The film was entertaining, but there was a beginning and a middle and pretty much no ending.

Putting it another way, if you cut out the swearing and nudity this could be (should be?) A Lifetime Movie of The Week.

I tried to square my feelings for this movie in my head before writing a review. Was I just mad how it ended? Did I not \"get\" it? In the end there is nothing to get though and without spoiling much I'll just say the last 10 minutes feature laughable makeup, horror movie cliche pile-on (the phones don't work!

Maybe the Open House sign at the end of this movie was to signal crazy cult people that this house had people to kill. Or like in Hostel, the guy had paid for getting to kill them.

Everyone is complaining about there being a lot of questions left to answer. I also dont understand this. The two main characters left at the end, the mom and Logan, are both dead, obviously. And just like in The Strangers, we never find out exactly who the killer is. That makes, in my opinion, the story more real and scary. The scary truth is, people break into houses, torture and kill people for no reason what so ever all of the time. Not every serial killer in the world is caught. The very ending of the movie shows someone driving off to another open house (via the sign on the road he turns down), hinting that it's the killer and he's going to do this again, and it probably wasnt the first time he killed people by hiding out in an open house. It really doesnt take half a brain figure out what's happening and to close any \"unanswered questions\" you may have left.I dont know if the creators of this movie were inspired by The Strangers, but Open House is very reminiscent of it, which I found really entertaining.

No questions were answered, the plot had so many holes in it, and the script seemed ridiculous. I was not convinced with any of the dialogue; it all seemed canned and unbelievable.\nThe music was good at times. But what in the name of all things holy was up with those scenes with the suspenseful music, where nothing even happened? For example, at one point, suspenseful music crescendoed while Logan walked in the basement. The camera focuses on a bunch of wood, and then the scene ends. What the hell? Was that wood supposed to be a foreshadowing of something? At another time, intense music builds up and ends with the camera just focusing on the woods outside. There were multiple instances of this. It's like the directors went to film school, learned about suspenseful build-ups, but completely fell asleep while the instructor covered how to use them. There has to be, like, a reason!\nI'm thoroughly astounded that Netflix picked this up. You mean to tell me that a Netflix executive watched this, liked it, and made the conscious decision to pay for this movie? I honestly can't believe that.\nMy honest (but maybe a bit crazy) suspicion is that this movie was made by artificial intelligence. A crude, experimental AI algorithm designed to configure a set of factors such as sets of characters, plot points, sets of dialogue and such, into a set amount of time. And the Netflix community is unwittingly the user testing group.\nThere's no other serious explanation. The dialogue was so forced and unrealistic. The characters weren't believable. The plot, especially, was incoherent.\nAI is breaking into everything, and it has to start somewhere. If this really was AI, at least in some capacity, calling the shots as a director, I'd say it was a good first effort.

It just happens that a lot of times, what most of the audience finds good and worth celebrating (e.g., Marvel/Disney) I find lacking and worthless; and what the masses find bad and disgusting, I end up liking and sometimes even defending if I find it worthy of being called art. So, after reading the comments referring to this movie as one of the worst ones ever made, I assumed that I may find a jewel in a pigsty.\nBut I couldn't!\nThe audience is right one this one: this movie sucks. Everything that's being said about it is true: lame plot, unnecessary characters, a senseless ending.\nThey why a 4/10?\nWell, for one, the whole first half of the movie (when you're watching it and you think that this has potential) was pretty good - not amazing, but it kept on flirting with the kind of horror that is so difficult to execute but so gratifying if the movie pulls it off: depressing horror.\nThe second half just forgot about the combination of depression and horror and became horror that is depressive, meaning, it watered down to a level of realism that it's just worthless in a movie. And I mean realism in just ONE fact out of all the implausible situations, the fact that (SPOLIER) strong killers do tend to kill everyone without leaving a hero\" alive at the end (SPOILER END).\nIf you REALLY need to watch this, just make sure that you are doing something else at the same time (ironing clothes, shampooing the dog, running the treadmill, etc.) so you don't feel that you've entirely wasted that hour and a half of your life.

Almost immediately and before he has time to react he gets knocked out by the killer, who pours water over him, in an attempt to slow him down I guess. He then goes upstairs, and lays next to the mom in her bed. She first doesn't notice him until she looks at some photos that were taken of her while she was asleep, turns around expecting her son to be there and freaks out when she sees the stranger in the bed.We then wittness some torture of the tied up mother, son wakes up tries to help her hut ends up being responsible for her demise. Nonetheless he can escape to a creek where the killer catches up to him and kills him.We then see the killer drive to another open house and that's were the freaking film just ends... We do not get to know who the killer was, why he did what he did, where the connection to the family was, if he did that before and whatever happened to the senile neighbor... Nothing.

It takes forever to actually get to any of the meat of the plot, with the first 3/4 of the movie spent faffing about. When things do finally happen it happens all at once and the characters do every possible bad choice they could possibly make.The villain is never revealed, his identity kept hidden for no reason other than to withhold the information from the audience. His face is literally never shown. When he arrives at the house all you see are his boots. When he shows up in the background skulking about all you see is his shadowy outline. This serves absolutely no narrative purpose, there is no mystery to unravel as to qualify for a mystery there has to be hints, clues, bread crumbs for the audience to puzzle over.So when the climax hits (in the last 1/4 of the movie) everything goes wrong all of a sudden and like I said, all the characters make the worst choices possible, for no other reason than that is what the writers wanted them to do so that they could get to their ending.Ah the ending. It sure... eventually stops and shows the credits?? It isn't an ending story wise, the movie just... stops.I feel very bad for the actors, most of them are rather fine actors, just written to be absolute idiots. They squeeze out the best performances possible with very little to work with. The music score is positively incompetent. The typical 'Scary thing is happening!' violins show up but... nothing is happening? Legit. It plays randomly and for no reason. Nothing creepy is happening, nothing interesting is happening, the camera is just lingering on stuff.So yeah, hard pass on this movie. There are far better bad movies to watch.",

Started well, then slowly built the suspense with mom and son's arrival in the town and the clearly not all there neighbour and the weird real estate guy reaching out for Logan in his bed. Then we get the mystery card Chris thrown in. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Meanwhile, the water heater keeps getting turned off, which actually made me laugh. Water heaters don't run cold when you turn them off, they just get gradually cooler. This was a really dumb oversight. You just knew with all the red herrings they were throwing out that the water heater guy would have to show up and get added to the mix. Maybe this was his revenge for all those stupid house calls? If that weren't enough, the writers even have the mom turn on the son. Keep how hard the writers worked to throw all this misdirection at you in mind for later in this movie when they apparently all died before completing the thing.In the middle of all this, the creepy is being served up in the form of mother's bare bum in the shower while the son talks to her via the open door. Later, he hears noises so he rushes in and gets a good look at his mother in the buff, not quite having got the towel on. Later still she asks him if he'd like to stay in her room, which he agrees to. But does he get on the floor or in a chair? Nope. Teenage son starts to crawl right into bed with mom (yuck!), but gets detoured outside to find...well, a surprise and an icy reception. Come to think of it, that was one of very few chills in this crap fest of a movie. Back upstairs, mystery killer gets in bed with her instead. At this point, they could have revealed Jason from Halloween and I wouldn't have flinched.Spoilers coming - be warned.When killer guy breaks mom's fingers one by one, we get to thinking this is very personal. What terrible thing has she done? Arrange to have her husband killed maybe? Sonny even notes it seems personal when he sees the earlier table set. Two misdirections totally wasted and left unused. Later, we cut to the basement, where Logan is searching for his mother and accidentally stabs her, presumably to death. Wait a sec. We suffered through all this drama just to have the son senselessly kill his mother? Well okay, but you owe us! So off we go for a run in the woods with no contacts and very little vision for poor sonny. One of them has to get away, right? Nope, chased down and killed by the faceless killer. Which seems like it could have happened earlier, instead of turning him into a human Popsicle.Final scenes, and here's where the crowd gets ugly. We get no explanation, no killer identity, no motive, no nothing. We get the family vehicle being driven by mystery killer back up to the house. That's it. Roll credits.Did the producers think this was clever or cute? No, it was just a wasted investment of time, you naughty movie people. Remember earlier when I mentioned all the effort that went into the misdirection? The writers must have used up all that creativity early on and ran out at the end. Never have I watched a movie of this kind end without any answers to all the \"plot\" they spun out. What were the writers and producers expecting from this? If it was a pissed off audience, congratulations. If you watch this, skip right to the end. You'll know as much as you did from the opening scene.",

            "review_title": "A Solid Horror Film",
            "content": "Randomly watched the new horror film on Netflix, The Open House, and I have to say that it's one of the few horror movies in recent years that had me glued to the screen and biting my nails. The other two were The Invitation (I guess more of a thriller) and The Devil's Candy. I can't figure out what the universal dislike for the film is. I was surprised that I had enjoyed it and thought I'd write what I liked, loved and didn't like about the film.WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT:The story explores a mother and son's process of grief and reconciliation.Death and grief are used to create an emotional and logical fog that blinds and confuses our protagonists as to what's going on and how to behave. I like how this is thematically reinforced by the film's focus on our main character's poor eyesight and macro shots of his eyeballs when removing and inserting his contacts - while using POV shots to show just how blind he is - when his glasses go missing and with the use of silhouettes and his revolving door of nightmares that can't be distinguished from reality. During periods of intense grief, people suffering inside this emotional and mental fog often make a series of bad decisions that can quickly spiral out of control. You can experience a sort of dream like state where life passes you by and people move in and out of your life like ghosts. Everything seems inconsequential so it's hard to distinguish between good, bad and evil. This explains one critique of the film where we are warned that the main characters aren't really paying attention to who is coming in and out of their home or to what's going on. People kind of pop in and out of existence. This is not out of character for people who are lost inside the abyss of grief. This is thematically reinforced by the neighbor who recently lost her husband and is now suffering from alzheimers. She's lost in a fog of grief and a disease that will eventually kill her.An innocent open house can turn into a nightmare. It helped cement the film in a version of reality that felt real. I liked how the film explored the danger of allowing strangers into your home without much consideration.WHAT I LOVED ABOUT IT:The killer is incredibly intelligent, methodical and committed to his murderous goals. He's quiet, imposing, cunning, confident and in control. I loved how our protagonists were outmatched. His motives remain a complete mystery, which makes sense. I'm tired of stories having to explain why an insane killer does what he does. It was his bad parents, ghosts, drugs, the Devil, the government... whatever. Sometimes people are just evil and that's that. No explanation necessary. We're just along for the very tragic and inexplicable ride.It's not gory or full of needless swearing.The film is well cast and their performances serve the story well.The film uses shadows and silhouettes to hide the villain instead of a mask or computer. We never see his face and he only says two words the entire film.Pacing throughout the film is well controlled. The tone is consistent, even if a little too heavy sometimes.It made me very uncomfortable. The camera is always framed in such a way to leave enough of the negative space to see the background and heighten your paranoia as a viewer. Gore Verbinski and his DP used this to great effect in The Ring and Matt Angel, Suzanne Coote use the same technique in The Open House with good effect.It was a simple, simple story.The ending is unconventional and open ended.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT:The killer is too smart and the story structure telegraphs - at least - one moment so well that I knew it was coming.The direction seemed a little off here or there for some of the supporting characters. For instance, I couldn't figure out why the real estate agent was acting so nervous, as though he had done or seen something bad. It feels like we're missing a scene that explains why or it was simply heavy handed misdirection. Did he see or hear something that made him so nervous? We'll never know.The color correction and palette didn't work for me. It was too blue at times and the colors felt... muddy. That could be video compression, but I don't think so.Some scenes felt rushed.I wanted the main character to have at least one or two decent victories before the end. The villain is such a badass that this never happens and leaves something to be desired.Production design was lacking, but I think that's more of a budget thing. However, it would have been nice to see the production design play more of a role in the character's development.The music telegraphed too much too early, felt a little overdone and a little cliched.There were things that were set up that were never used - like a stair that breaks at the beginning of the film. I guess that isn't necessary, but it does beg the question as to why so much focus was placed on that broken stair. Maybe I missed something.The supporting characters weren't developed enough. I wanted to know more about Chris and see him have his own moment that fleshed him out. Same thing goes with pretty much everyone outside of the mother and son. I would have been fine with ten extra minutes that let each character shine a bit so we miss them when they're gone.Despite these flaws, I really enjoyed this flick and recommend it for some casual, horror movie watching.",

It's so terrible I want a prorated refund from Netflix for the 94 minutes they stole from me.Here are some legitimate questions/comments for the people who let this movie make it this far.-If you had a filthy rich sister, who had a giant vacation home- and your husband dies- wouldn't she pay your rent on your crappy little rental house so you don't have to uproot your entire life and kid? Instead, she has you move into her giant vacation home- that's for sale. Spoiler alert: As a real estate agent I can tell you with complete confidence that when a house is listed for sale it can be sold at any time. Like, even the day they move in, or the day after, etc. Having to move again in 30 days when you still don't have any money, and now have to find another new place to live sure makes a lot of sense.\nSince you moved up to the vacation home does that mean that the teenage kid no longer has to go to ANY school? The characters aren't likable and by midway you're actually hoping they die.The killer just happens to have a large bucket of water available to pour on the kid's head in the middle of winter with snow on the ground? Why would you call a practical stranger over to spend the night on your couch? And in a giant house how is there not a bedroom for him to use?How does the kid end up in the middle of nowhere in the woods? If you were running to escape a murderer wouldn't you run down a road TO civilization, and a phone? Or geez, even to a neighbor's house?He can't make 911 calls supposedly because there isn't a SIM card. Um, you can dial 911 even when your phone isn't in service with a carrier. His mother, who was in a bedroom, somehow ends up downstairs in the basement screaming for no reason. Kid goes downstairs to find Mom and she yells his name standing literally right behind him and he turns and stabs her not realizing it was her. I think I've seen that one a time or two. And then some stinky cheese when she tells the kid to \"run\" since we know he's a fast runner. Didn't see that coming.-The real cheddar cheese is the last scene where you see an open house sign- and the killer drives in that direction! You mean he's going to go to another open house and do the same thing again? No way!Ok, I have to force myself to stop typing now and step away from my computer. I could just keep droning on like this movie did. The guy named Dan Angel who put his name on as the writer, director, producer should quickly deactivate all social media accounts, change his name, and recreate a new identity.

            "content": "I generally shy away from plot-twisting, content-reorienting flicks, but after watching the trailer for The Open House, it had me intrigued. That was until the last twenty minutes of the film.First, the cinematography was brilliant. Lighting, hues, angles, and the locations were stunning; even the shots of the landscape illustrated the story's setting in way that most viewers readily forget when they are watching a movie.As for the story, the film opens with a horrible accident affecting both son and mother. The family copes by staying at a relative's house that's on the market and is currently hosting an open house (re: the movie title). As the plot moves along, the relationship between mother and son builds, leaving the viewer with a sense that the traumatic incident in their past can start to resolve itself. The acting between Dylan Minnette (Logan) and Piercey Dalton (Naomi) melded into a seamless, integrated arrangement of blended emotions. For example, the scene at the diner where the mother has trouble with the credit card and the son pulls out money to handle the bill. The movie's writers nailed the tone. Even the fraught, emotional scene where the two are angry at each other after Naomi receives Logan's phone from the repairman. All great examples of contextualizing dialog. So what went wrong?Whether it was production costs, time constraints, a last minute rewrite, or someone's attitude spoiling the whole project, I was left scratching my scalp. \nThroughout the film, the viewers get to peek at interesting tidbits that make for a build up of an interesting whodunit or a Two Thousand Maniacs!-inspired town with a dark, cult-like reputation for handling strangers. Martha shows up in several scenes to relate sometimes contradictory accounts and statements. The camera follows Chris, the flirtatious retail clerk, as he tours the house and makes a suspicious dip into the ominous basement. Even the realtor's assistant gives off an air as if his being in the house after hours is seemingly innocuous. Finally, the plumber makes what would be a simple troubleshooting fix into a repair that takes quite a while for something as simple as a pilot light being turned off. These instances would ultimately negate themselves by the end of the film, a confusing amalgamation similar to the nutraloaf that prisons dole out as punishment-food for a prisoner's bad behavior. Simply put, the last twenty minutes were as painfully confusing as watching a beaver build a dam in a bathtub. I'm honestly glad that the movie didn't require payment for admission because my foot might be in someone's ass at Netflix's headquarters.To those people responsible for The Open House's release, stop trying to placate your audience's sensibilities with cheap, derivative schlock in place of honest, thought-provoking writing.",

By the end, who cares? Likewise, the treacly attempts to make us feel something - ANYTHING for the unlikable central protagonists were transparent, useless and totally ineffective, and the kindly neighbor, the friendly store clerk, the RE agents - NONE of them were relevant to this thing's missing thread. Ultimately: recycled moments do not a plot make and a meandering, unstructured series of stepping stone ideas, poorly executed: result in nothing more than a totally useless, maddening waste of time.

This movie started off with enough potential and then fell horribly, horribly flat.Whomever wrote this piece of junk should not quit their day job, as writing screenplays is quite obviously not their specialty. Don't waste your time with this disappointment, because you will not get your half and a half back.

I felt compelled to write this review to defend, as for the most part this movie really works. It isn't perfect by any means but at least worth a 7/10. I score it higher as I'm a fan of this new wave of slasher movie much like 'Hush' and much earlier 'When a stranger calls'.There is an eerie tension throughout the entire movie and some genuinely scary and brutal moments. The damaged single parent dynamics work well with the pace of story and the acting very believable. Some of the supporting characters perhaps were a weak link but not detracting from the value of the film.If anything, for me, the idea that a maniac could stalk without any rhyme or reason is truly terrifying and at such a cost to this poor family. The fact that no backstory or motivation to the killer is explained just adds to the authenticity of 'The Open House'.",

I got really suspicious about that guy Chris, when he was caught looking into the front door of the house, and he claimed to be interested in possibly purchasing the place. Really, on a retail cashier's wages??3. So was it Alzheimer lady who did it? We are lead to believe that the antagonist is a male, but the person never made a sound, so it conceivably could have been her. Otherwise, we really have no idea about the identity of the killer.",

Things that were hinted at like zooming in on the milk at the store and when they moved were never explained. Neither were any of the characters like the weird lady who obviously had something going on that I was so curious to find out what it was. The movie started to get stressful when it was OBVIOUS that there was someone else living in the house with them. Stuff would be moved or turned off downstairs when they both knew they were upstairs. It got even more ridiculous when the son let his mom go into the basement herself right after he made the point that he heard some stuff down there. It was also insane that they didn't even mention half the stuff they noticed to each other. Near the ending at one point, when the kid was running away from the killer, he literally could have ran out of the front door that was already opened and had a car out front that was already started, but instead runs out the back door. It literally reminded me of that part in scary movie where the blond girl was in her backyard with the signs \"live or die\" and chose die. The worst part of all though is that absolutely terrible ending. Did they run out of money? Because all that happened is they quickly killed off the main characters and it ended. No explanations or anything. I can't believe a movie ending could leave someone so frustrated.

I recommend it if you're bored one night and can't decide what else to watch on Netflix.**SPOILERS**Let me start off by saying I definitely have mixed feelings about this one. It was by no means a spectacular blockbuster, but I have to give it some credit for providing suspense and great acting by Dylan Minnette and Piercey Dalton. Some people are rating this movie a 1/2 out of 10 and I personally think that's just unfair.. I have seen movies that were WAY worse than this, so rating it that low is way too harsh in my opinion. It got me to jump, kept me intrigued, and the fact that you hardly ever see the killer throughout the movie even though you know he's there made me feel incredibly uneasy. The cinematography and ambiance were great as well. For these reasons, I'm giving it a 4/10.With that being said, there are definitely flaws as well. One of those flaws being how people in the town (even the real estate agents) were acting so strange, as if they knew something bad would happen or were in on it somehow. But in the end, any questions that may arise about those characters are left unanswered. It's like nothing was tied together and useless things were added to the movie just to take up more time. I almost feel it was pointless to add those typical \"small town so everyone knows everything\" characters because the killer ended up just being a random psychopathic serial killer anyway. Like honestly, what even was the point of Martha...? I was also very disappointed with the ending. The buildup during the movie was so good and I was really counting on an awesome twist at the end, but unfortunately the audience is only left with a billion unanswered questions and disappointment. I just feel as if it started off with so much potential but fell short and left way too many loose ends.",

If I had to put into one word the emotion that I feel upon viewing this film, it would be 'Regret'.the creators knowingly made it JUST good enough for JUST long enough to get you invested enough watch what turns out to be the worst 3rd act in cinema history and the laziest ending in living memory.  'Oh I know let's make a film that is so bad it will ruin a person's day...'I didn't even pay for this movie and I want my money back, I literally want the creators of the movie to come to my house, give me $14 and a written apology.",

Those are my kind of movies and they don't make enough good haunted house movies to suit me these days. The movie was a bit slow with no real shock value. Even when the strange man came in and laid in the bed with the mother. I thought it was gonna be her dead husband. She got up and and went to the bathroom and came back and got in bed with him. How the hell do you not notice a strange man in your bed? The movie ended up with this man whose face you never got to see killing both the mother and son. They both acted like they knew this person but it was never revealed to the audience who it actually was. As the credits rolled I waited to see if there was gonna be some actual true ending but there never was. I was really pissed off that I wasted my time. I expected more from Netflix cause they have lots of good movies and shows so I was truly disappointed. Dylan Minnette is an up and coming good actor and he tried his best with this script but they gave him little to work with. If you wanna see him in something much better check out 13 Reasons Why.

But in today's ridiculous ADD-addled instant-gratification-worshipping movie culture, I have to give it a 10 in a futile attempt to help restore the balance against a storm of insanely clueless negative responses from folks who seem to have developed their critical faculties through years of intensive study of the Pokemon canon.So right off the bat, ignore all three star (or fewer) reviews. These are all almost invariably written by people who casually toss around terms like 'cinematography' and 'pacing' to appear as if they have the slightest shred of a clue of what these concepts mean or how they function in a good, non-Pokemon-related movie. Well, guess what? Yep, they don't.The Open House, surprisingly enough as it turns out, is that all too rare example of a truly dark and unsettling Netflix horror movie that makes few or no concessions to the familiar expectations of its viewers, in an age of audiences weaned on cookie-cutter CGI superhero/monster fights popping up every five minutes and scripts that explain every point in idiotic detail so that actually paying minimal attention to movies is hardly necessary these days. In its refusal to compromise itself to please lazy viewers or to soften the edges of its darkness, it is very much a throwback to old school horror classics like 'The Changeling' and 'Let's Scare Jessica to Death'.I won't spell out the story or spoil anything here, but I will address the movie's central, cunningly crafted enigma. Yes, there ARE questions left unanswered, deliberately so. In an age when crudely obvious explanations are so often shoved down audiences' throats, it is telling that such an approach draws such rabid animosity from so many. It used to be that movies left viewers something to chew over afterwards, to talk about with friends and have some fun trying to work out or interpet among themselves. I guess those days are long past us, sadly, as the insanely hostile reception for this intelligent, well made chiller proves.The simple fact, however, is that by the end of the movie reasonably intelligent viewers should be entirely capable of working out what was happening, and why. The clues are there, admittedly a little thin on the ground, but perfectly obvious to anyone observant who can reason deductively and put 2 and 2 together without cheating. For the filmmakers to have said anymore would have been to spell things out crudely and destroy the sinister mood of the movie, as well as being insulting to the audience's intelligence. But perhaps audiences today prefer being insulted to having to think for themselves? Judging by the responses this film has provoked, it appears that they do.",

Was there a stranger living in the house (The Boy)? Were the two lead characters dead but didn't know it? (per the Others)?

Unfortunately the ending was so muddled with so much left unexplained I felt like I had been ripped off in a sense (and not in a Sixth Sense kinda way).Anyway this \"could\" have been a good movie until they ruined it by not explaining it.

            "content": "I'm pretty sure there's a couple of unspoken rules about horror, first being that somebody has got to survive, and another being that the killer has to have a motive. This movie messed both of them up, ending up being pointless torture/horror. Or well, rather, \"I think house viewings are stupid,\" the essay.First off, the son getting away then being killed at the end? A pretty big middle finger. Especially since he didn't even see the killer - could've easily been left alive.As for the killer, so it's somebody that bunks in open houses, basing his entire shtick on incompetent realtors, which... weak. And to make something like this work, for example how the Night Stalker (killer) still freaks people out, you need really good writing and camerawork on how terrifying it is to have your stuff messed up with. Something this movie kinda tried but utterly failed.I honestly started thinking the elements will build up to a story - everyone suggesting it's just some townie that's upset the house is being sold; the neighbor lady having alzheimer's and going between saying her husband is dead or that he's alive - imagine if a creep took advantage of her and lived in her house only to get angry when something happened to the house next door. I would've taken that over \"random faceless killer kills people randomly for random reasons. Random.\". Plus the whole bait and switch ... pretty sure the only people who enjoy that are pretentious kids, and the majority of watchers want to see foreshadowing and stuff come together coherently.All in all, a waste of time. The characters did end up growing on me so I'll give it a 2 because of that. And only a 2 because once I started being invested, they got killed off senselessly. Bad writing, there.",

Then you relight the pilot and presto...instantly the 40-gallon tank is hot again. Um, nope.There's an alarm system they never use. Townspeople who randomly act weird with no explanation. And all kinds of things that happen with no real reaction from people who should be freaked out and searching the house. (Insert a dozen other sloppy plot holes here...)The kid goes to the basement, sees the water heater is turned off...he didn't do it, mom didn't do it, so... umm, he just relights it.

            "content": "I'm literally writing this review so that I can expunge this movie from my headspace and never think of it again.Adequate beginning..It starts with good drama, several moments of introduction that bring you along with the widow and her child.. Ok.\nWe are driven into the mountains by a plot point that could not have been stranger.. The woman's sister says \"Stay at our house that's for sale. But, you'll have to clear out every Sunday for the open houses.\" Huh? Why? Who offers their house as a temporary abode to decrease stress after a death and then says \"I know your husband just died horribly leaving you with a ton of bills to pay, but you have no job, so move all of your stuff into a giant, remote, mountain house that we could take off the market.. but were not going to. Also good luck paying for diner meals with even less prospects of a job in the boonies! Bye sis!\" Even on Birdworld, that's kind of a dick move.Then a series of weird people start to loom about while the tension increases.. The neighbor shows up acting crazy. Meh, it doesn't stop the boy from becoming besties with her, while she helps to train him for some sort of running down the street in angst medal at the teenage angst olympics. They award extra points for dramatically stopping in the middle of a country road without a care in the world of who's driving towards you. The realtor and her confused assistant. Spookily lurk around and watch the family sleep? Huh? Nobody writes a letter to the realty agency? A random dude from the supermarket that immediately starts showing up to check on them. Also why does every character tell them that they stopped by during the Open House? Is that a mountain country code word? Then in the middle of a randomly gratuitous shower butt scene. THE HOT WATER GOES OUT.. AGAIN! This is the driving plot point that moves the entire movie forward. They argue about the hot water heater going out. There are phones found near the hot water heater. The pilot light won't stay lit! Various repairmen show up with ominous admonitions that they'd \"been there before\" oooooooh scary. My feelings during this 2/3rds of the film was man, they better hope that doesn't show up during the inspection, because adding a new hot water heater to the sale of this giant remote \"cabin\" in the woods will cause holy hell with the resale value. But.. still doesn't begin to explain what the hell is going on. Tons of long drawn out moments. focusing on a basement door. spending 38 tries re-lighting the pilot of the water heater. (IT JUST WONT STAY LIT!) Dramatic racing pauses. The son has a problem with the mom making friends. The dad is never mentioned again.. except for when it's posited that he may not have been killed by accident. wait, what? During strobe like flashbacks of a horribly mangled Dad, blood pouring out of his mouth. \"Hi confused he gurgles, I'm dad.\" Long moments where the house phone randomly rings and nobody cares.. Get on with it. What is happening here? Is this supernatural, is there a problem with one of the cookie characters we met? Did the dad fake his own death?The sister calls and says that the neighbor told her that their house was broken into, how the hell did the rumor train follow that idea around the mountain? So the mom stops the son during one of his epic runs! That somehow took eleven hours from noon til dark, and as a personal side note, Why is that kid allowed to run on random mountain roads with zero reflective gear? Not safe mom. They rush home to find the candles lit, the phone on a pedestal and christmas music playing?From this point on the movie and this review will go downhill faster than a homemade redbull racer. The dude from the store show up. Wha? It's ok mom, i called him! Hooray, maybe the son is ready to bury his grief. And their new friend is staying the night, Hooray! Things are looking up.Then everyone dies.. I wish it was a little bit more detailed than that. Literally some unknown dude, kills the friend, steals the kid's contacts, breaks the moms fingers, and vanishes again. Then the son stabs the mom, THE SON STABS THE MOM (oops) She tells him with her dying breath, to run, and does he run? Nope, all that training was for naught. He hides in the woods until he's killed by whoever that dude is.Cut to a random California driveway where a car that we've never seen before pulls into a random driveway.. On the fencepost, a sign that reads OPEN HOUSE. What?",

The plot is unnecessarily convoluted, especially considering how little of it actually matters...which is to say, virtually none of the character building, worldbuilding, setting, or even the actual linear events catalogued by the film ever come to fruition. Literally none of the plot matters. Instead, the film ends up being somewhat similar to \"The Strangers,\" but only if \"The Strangers\" had absolutely no payoff at all and left the audience wondering why they'd bothered to spend 90 minutes of their life staring at a screen. 90 minutes that could've been spent doing absolutely anything else.If I could give this flick 0 stars, I very much would. I feel bad for the poor cast, being made to jerry-rig such a terrible script into something resembling reality. And what of the ending? Well, if you're interested in films that vaguely trail off, and if you like to see shallow metaphor delivered by lingering camera shots, then maybe you'll appreciate it. If you want something that feels like effort, or like anyone on the creative team actually cared about the project, then maybe pick something else. Anything else.Rarely do I loathe a film so much as to post a negative review, but this lukewarm retread of horror's most overdone tropes did its absolute best to make good on none of its promises, and my rage at being so misled drives me to heap as much abuse as possible on this godawful movie.My advice would be, of course, to watch *literally anything else.*",

            "content": "The second movie Steven Spielberg directed is a relatively unknown television title called The Duel (1971). The main protagonist is an ordinary family man, who is driving an ordinary car home to his family through sparsely populated territory. Fairly early on, for some unexplained reason, this man manages to piss off a psychopath driving a huge 18 wheel truck, who makes it his mission to ensure that our protagonist never sees his home again. What ensues is a tense, vivid cat and mouse game through no-man's land. The driver of the truck is never shown and the movie leaves you wondering why this all took place. It doesn't matter. It is one of the most intense experiences I have ever had in television. Even though Spielberg was still a beginning director en still very much honing his craft, you could tell from this movie that he would one day become one of the greats. Some people are just blessed with talent. And then there are directors who make movies like The Open House, the second movie for both Coote and Angel. We should all give props to the editor that cut the trailer, because it sure made this garbage look good. The premise is somewhat like that of The Duel. Dad dies and mom and son are left to fend for themselves. The mom has no job and can't take care of herself and her son, but instead of going to look for a job, they decide to move into a huge mansion, owned by her sister, in some deserted stretch of woods and mountains, where they are then, yes, continuously confronted by the fact that they have no money. And again, for some reason, some psychopath takes an interest in them and procedes to make their lives hell.Nothing will make you lose all sympathy and caring for the main characters faster than them doing stupid stuff. And the stupidity comes in abundance, from the mom going into a cold and dark basement wearing nothing but a skimpy towel 3!! times in a row, to the son going out in the middle of the night to check out some creepy stuff going on in the driveway. His phone goes missing from where it was 5 minutes earlier and even though they are the only two people in a 5 mile radius, we don't think much of it. A normal person would call the police and sit tight. You basically stop caring whether they live or die at some point.For the first 70 minutes or so however, the movie is entertaining. The directors know how to add in some good jump scares that literally had me off my feet. After watching the final 20 minutes for the conclusion, you realize that this is all this movie was ever going to be. On top of that, it contains some needless cruelty that really did not need to be in there. Here are some of the things you can expect: (spoilers)-Like The Duel, the killer is never revealed nor is his reason. In this case however, it will leave you staring at the screen why you just sat through this pain.\n-There is a token crazy female neighbour who comes into the screen at the strangest times to freak you out. Is her husband dead or isn't he? It doesn't matter, because nameless psycho killer was there.\n-There is the mysterious guy from town who seems to want something from our main characters. Why did he go into the basement and was he all of a sudden gone, to later pop back up unexplained? It doesn't matter...he gets killed and nameless psycho killer did it all without telling.\n-Our psycho killer is a huge guy, but still is blessed with supernatural ninja powers enabling him to move through any room unseen and at will. He also has the ability to make the whole house shake.I have read this in other reviews but would like to say it again: whoever gave this mess the greenlight at NetFlix needs to seriously consider another career. To people looking for a frightening experience, you can do a lot better. Give an oldy like The Duel a chance ;)",

Instead, about 2/3rds into it, I began worrying because there was no contender as to whom it could be that would be satisfying. Sadly I was more right than I imagined. I could've lived with a cheesy last second rant/montage revealing some hidden history here and why the killer did it. Sadly, we just get the most unsatisfying, lackluster, and cop-out ending I have seen in recent history. The great camerawork and performances given in this movie don't even come close to holding it up against an atrocious screenplay.",

I am a huge horror fan, and I have seen some really bad horror movies. This is NOT one of them. Now on to my review about this movie. I will really focus on what worked, I won't even really comment on what didn't work since everyone is spewing it too much any way. I really enjoyed the initial sense of confusion the film brought, is it a ghost? Or is it a killer? Were they set up by the sister? What is with the neighbor? Will they live? These are all great senses of confusion the filmmakers brought to the table in a horror flick, you shouldn't know where the film is going and it creates a great deal of confession as a viewer- which I really enjoy. These types of atmosphere for horror are rare, but when done right- can keep you watching it till the end since you don't have a feeling you figured it out at any time.My favorite aspect is the unexplained backstory- Halloween (78) is a great example of why someone (or something) can be so scary- because we don't understand it. We shouldn't need backstories explained out for why someone kills people in scary movies. Again this is a horror movie, if you want that level of detail- check out MindHunter. This is about creating a villain that is so uncomfortable- you don't understand them at all. (Side note on this: this movie is riddled with homages to the original Halloween). And no- you as a viewer should NOT be connecting with a horror villain like this in order to enjoy the movie, you would feel confused and weirded out. That is how the filmmakers want you to feel.Lastly- this movie did a great job making everything look and sound great. I think the score was fantastic and the locations were beautiful. Even down to the small shots of the basement tunnels. My main and only complaint is this film does require a larger sense of need to suspend reality. Although- I can't think of how many times I lose my cellphone and \"swear\" I just left it plugged in. I think this movie tries to show you a sense of confusion within the characters that makes you feel bad for them. They are not in their \"right state of mind\" to begin with, however- most people don't call the police or move when you have misplaced something. How many times have you left a light on and swore you turned it off? It creates this sense of how do you even keep track of those things when large issues are on your mind? IE money and family death. I see it too often in people who don't usually watch horror movies: \"I would never go back upstairs\". Overall, this was decent. It didn't have any hype that I knew of, I just turned it on and watched it. It's fun and has a lot of moments that keep you guessing- until the end. I also didn't find the end confusing at all. I this the final shot made it pretty clear what happened and what will happen again.",

This was an ugly movie. An ugly execution, an ugly set, a character who made ugly choices this movie was just a trainwreck. It was a complete waste of time, unecessary details were added every 20 or so minutes and there were still so many unanswered questions by the end. How does the killer get into the open houses? Why did our main character keep his eyes open when a strange man was sitting on top of him trying to remove his contacts? The (main characters) aunt clearly has money, so why didn't she invite her sister and nephew to live with her for a little bit? I understand small details are needed for a movie to be fun to watch and try to solve along with the main character but this movie only added information because why not? I feel like the plot was okay, but (as I said before) it was so poorly executed and the acting was so mediocre that this movie wasn't enjoyable.If you want to watch this to kill time, then by all means, go for it.

            "content": "When Netflix recommended me this movie, I thought it will be good since the one who is playing the main role is Dylan Minette who performed very well on 13 reasons why.The first part is good, like it was really planned and scripted. But the good part only last right until the road scene only, where they saw a man standing in the middle of the road and thought they bump into him but the guy disappeared. After that, the movie will just give you a boring weird jump scare, weird characters, unrelated characters, unrelated circumstances, and no info about what is happening, its just that, all you is someone is in the house. They didn't even introduce anyone except Martha and Chris, so you wouldn't know who is this psycho guy killing people. And because of that, I don't find it scary at all but instead I really find it weird and awkward. While watching the movie, I didn't think, or have any speculation, guess and analogy and it is because of lack of info in the movie. And to make it worse, they made a vague ending that makes the movie vague. They didn't even indicate how the guy can get in, is he a man with supernatural powers? The doors are locked yet he is inside but at the last part of the movie, the guy is human and is physically alive. (I really thought the guy is flying, creepy lack of clues)I graded the movie 4/10 because the story is bad but the camera positioning, quality, and the actors acting is so good. Logan and The \"Mom\" has committed a good and wonderful performance. It could be better if the storyline is so good.Expectations: Right after the road scene that I said earlier, I thought it'll be a good movie. Like, good as old horror movies but it really fails me. Speculations like maybe Logan saw the guy in the car who killed his father and at the ending he saw it again killing him and his mother (atleast he died with purpose). I thought Marta can give information about something, or chris, or the guy who fix the heater but none of it happens. I thought they will be introduce around the town and the director/writer will let us think \"who among them is the killer\" but ta-duhhhh none of it happens. The only details they gave us is the ending part it tells the viewer that there is a psycho guy who can get inside the house and yeah, he will start killing because its a \"creepy\" legend story about Open House",

At a first glance, it looks very intriguing.I just want to mash my keyboard to sync with my frustration that lives on to this very day.To summarize, the movie is the perfect example to why one should always check IMDB before pressing that play button.On the plus side, my girlfriend held the remote when we decided to watch this movie - so she's no longer allowed to hold it.. and surprisingly - or not, based on this movie, she agreed to this!Now I'm off to research why this have more than 1 star in average rating.Cheers",

But I think the direction that it goes is pretty cool. The killer is reveleaved to be a guy who likes to go to open houses and murder anyone in the house. It's simple. I don't know how people can't wrap their heads around it. It's the closest thing to a real life event as you can get. There's no grand scheme there's no personal connection to the killer. He's just a serial killer who enjoys the chase. Plain and simple. I loved the ending. It leaves you feeling different than a lot of movies like this. I applaud that.",

I would have preferred an overdone cliche or deus ex machina to what they've offered in the climax.

One annoying part was that the hot water would suddenly go cold while the mother was in the shower. It was a standard hot water tank, and anyone knows that the water doesn't suddenly go cold, but gradually gets colder. But relighting the pilot seemed to make the water get instantly hot again. And the hot water tank was in the cellar (which was very dungeon-like), with no lights.Also kind of dumb was that they were living in a huge house that was being shown each day by realtors. Anybody could come in, wander around, and find lots of places to hide after the people left.The whole movie seemed so bad that I assume there was a reason; Netflix isn't stupid, so I'm guessing they either wanted a movie so bad that people watched it to make fun of it, like many cult classics, or more likely, it was a parody of all the bad horror films from the past, with the overly dramatic music, stupid characters, almost no plot, etc. This, to me, makes sense but I haven't seen anyone else propose this theory.

That would have been great...but no... no reason... no twist. and what was the point of that crazy lady from that one single scene? 3. It draaaaaaaaaags. Slow pace is fine if you put good dialogue.

This guy is hiding yet comes up random times and is never seen? Really? He pranks them. He annoys them. These scenes are suppose to be scary but seem just silly. When he finally attacks, I wasn't scared. I was like ..meh. Just annoyed because I was still thinking what the hell is happening. Why a three and not a 1? There's one good scene.

            "content": "Warning: Many spoilers ahead. But, don't worry about it because the movie is so horrible it's not worth seeing. The script was terribly written, the movie tripped over itself constantly, and it was full of plot holes and useless scenes leading up to absolutely nothing. I came across this movie when I was going through my Netflix feed, searching for a scary movie to watch. Until, I stumbled upon Netflix's almost-impossible-to-avoid 'featured' section (which is mostly Netflix Originals). The first movie in this section was 'The Open House'. From the looks of the graphic design and the trailer, it was a horror movie. At the time, I was particularly in the mood for a horror movie, and the trailer was well-made and it was presented as though it had an interesting plot. And to make the movie seem more promising, it starred Dylan Minnette, who plays Logan in the movie, and Piercey Dalton, who plays his mother, Naomi. Although I've never heard of Piercey, Dylan was one of the main characters of the popular Netflix thriller '13 Reasons Why'. His performance in the show was not only fantastic, but it seemed like he had good taste in choosing shows and movies in which to take part. \nNetflix was setting up expectations from the start, and I'm sure that this was their intention with the way they plastered Dylan on the cover.\nSo, at this point, I was already popping my popcorn, but can you blame me? My high expectations had already started to sink, when the movie began. The screen was pitch-black, with generic high-pitched scary movie \"strings\" music overlaid onto the escalating pants of Dylan Minnette. \nThe first frame appears, it's Dylan running, his father holding a stopwatch, telling Dylan that he broke another running record. \n\"Ok,\" I thought to myself, \" he's clearly fast at running, this scene will play a crucial role somewhere in the movie, maybe when he's running away from a murderer or something\". It didn't. At all. Exhibit A, useless scene number one. \nThey enter the house to tell their mother (Piercey Dalton), who is preparing dinner, about the record break. She tells Dylan to wash up for dinner. \nAs he enters the bathroom, he dramatically removes his contacts, and clumsily reaches over to a pair of glasses laying on the sink...it was literally right there, and he knocked over like two bottles trying to reach it, clearly an attempt to accentuate that he's completely blind and helpless without glasses or contacts. This foreshadowed probably one of the silliest and least thought out events in the history of horror movies. I'll explain later.Dad drops the eggs in the kitchen, and goes with Dylan to the store to buy more eggs and Naomi urges the dad to also get milk. \nThey pull into the store parking lot, dad gets out to get the eggs, and as he exits the store, a car comes out of nowhere and plows dad. At this point you might think, ok, this is where the story picks up and gets interesting. Maybe the dad was involved with some bad people or a hidden past that's coming back to haunt him. Nope. Just cuts to the next scene, the dad's funeral. No talk of who was in the car, why they killed him, if they got away, not even whether it was an accident or on purpose. I guess the directors just thought they didn't need to include that, or it would be too much work to build a plot that's remotely interesting. Maybe, we'll find out as the movie progresses. Nope. You don't. Plot hole, much? And the worst part is, the dad forgot the milk.At the wake Naomi's sister tells her that she can stay at her mountain house because with her husband gone Naomi can no longer afford rent. \nSo, Naomi and Logan decide to move into the house. It's the middle of the night, the road is empty, they're driving to their new home and a man in black (that's literally the name of his character on IMDB) is ominously standing in the middle of the road. They swerve, and miss him, turn back and he's not there. At this point, Naomi's nose starts to bleed. I thought that maybe here was when the story would start to pick up, maybe the nosebleed is hinting at something paranormal. Nope. It's not explained later on, and doesn't occur again. Useless scene number two. \nThey go to the grocery store, to finally pick up that milk that the father had failed to retrieve, and they bump into an old woman named Martha. She gives them a rather odd welcome to the town, making it seem like she would add something to the story. Nope. She's just a creepy, random old lady. Her character makes absolutely no sense and is completely useless to the movie. Her only purpose was to be creepily hint to or foreshadow absolutely nothing. \nThey pull up to her sister's huge house and for some reason it's morning now, even though it was night just a second ago at the store. I guess they ran out of time for that day because they were too busy wasting time making useless movie scenes and wasting everyone's time. \nLogan is exploring the house, and he stumbles upon a typical scary movie \"don't go down there!\" basement that never has working lights for some reason. \nWhat made this movie even more pitiful, was that there was an LED light bulb visible in this scene. They didn't even put in the extra effort to try to hide it. So, the basement had no electricity for some reason, but the rest of the house did?\n At this point, I was only hoping that Logan was going to the basement to look for a fusebox. \nHe continues deeper into the basement and comes across a pile of wood and stares at it like it's a pile of baby bones or something. He goes back upstairs and one of the steps of this \"super expensive\" mansion breaks. Wow, I'm shaking. I wish you could hear the sarcasm in my voice. \nThey go to sleep and Logan is awoken by a strange noise. He looks out the window and there's a car with its headlights on pointing to the house, and it honks. Logan goes outside to see what's going on, and if you guessed that the car vanished, you're already getting the gist of the way this movie works. You don't hear it drive off, or see it driving out of the long driveway. Was it the same person that killed his dad? Was it a hallucination or ghost? Nope. But, the movie will make sure you never find out.\nLogan weirdly stares at a fake lawn animal, like he did with the pile of wood. I realize now that he liked to stare at things with no significance, as if they do have significance. After he shakes himself out of his trance, he turns around and Martha appears behind him. Yes, Martha. Out of nowhere, in the middle of the night. She asks Logan why he's living in the mansion and then gets scared and does a frantic old lady run into the woods. \nLogan goes back to sleep. Unnecessary scene number 4.\nIn the morning, he wakes up to a hand getting close to his face, like it's about to grab it. This interaction is paired with some more high-pitched 'strings', like that's supposed to be scary or something. It's the realtor who's selling the house trying to wake him up, telling them that they have to leave because of the open house and to return in the afternoon. \nThen, there's a scene where the people from the open house walk inside. One of the visitors is a pair of evil black boots. I know it's a pair of evil black boots because the music suddenly switched to ominous and they didn't show the visitor's face as he creepily stepped inside, one evil boot at a time. \nSo, they go out to eat and shop, even though it's been flagrantly stated in the movie that they are low on funds, which is why they are living in that house in the first place. They guy behind the counter at the clothing store starts making small talk with Naomi, as he sees that she's new in town. Logan gets triggered, has a tantrum and they leave, because nobody can strike a conversation up with his mother without him getting defensive. \nThey get home and there's an extremely weak jumpscare. It's the realtor leaving the house after cleaning up. I'm still confused as to why the realtor was scared, because he had been hosting a open house all day? He freaks out like he just saw a ghost and hurriedly scurries out of the house. Yet, another plot carrot that they dangle in front of your face that leads up to and means nothing. \nLogan and Naomi are watching a movie. Logan goes to get more popcorn. \"Evil Boots\" opens a door in the background for some reason, no one even noticed it. Then, the phone rings and all you can hear is echoing, meaning the call is coming from within the house. So, Evil Boots is calling them from within the house. He doesn't say anything over the phone, so he called for fun I guess? \nAfter the movie, Naomi takes a shower, and Logan brings a bowl of cereal up to his room. He notices that his phone is missing. \nHe goes downstairs to find his mom's phone to call his phone, and he sees bowl of cereal has been miraculously transported to the table downstairs. \nEvil Boots, a 6ft tall, grown man (he's shown later), somehow snuck up and downstairs in his hefty boots, taking bowls of cereal downstairs and opening and closing doors without anybody noticing, let it also be known that there was only one staircase in the house to the upstairs, so he somehow snuck by Logan during this entire interaction. \nLogan hears Naomi scream from the bathroom, runs upstairs, and busts open the bathroom door, getting a glimpse of his exposed mother. She tells him that the water went ice cold randomly.\n Naomi goes into the generic scary movie basement to light the pilot. The presence of evil boots is clearly prevalent in this scene, but instead of killing her, he shuts the basement door. Because, killing one of the main characters would bring this painfully and unnecessarily long movie to a much needed halt. \nLogan and Naomi go out for a run and there's another useless scene with Martha. She seems to have no recollection of the encounter with Logan from the night prior. \nThey go back home and see the cashier from the clothing store, peering through the windows. He claims tha",

No reason to focus on if the old woman's husband is dead or not if you aren't going to show us who it is at the end or a picture of her husband.\n2. It felt very rushed. It went from the suspense of the dinner table being set when they got home to someone going through the house killing people.\n3. It was pointless to break the mother's fingers torture style other than a cringe factor.\n4. Who waits until you are right behind someone before yelling their name in this situation?? You yell from the stairs!\n5. I don't care how cold he was, after running up and down stairs, your adrenaline pumping from being chased and saving and killing your mom, and being wrestled to the ground and struggling, you would not still be too shakey to walk.Now, I feel like from the other reviews, I need to defend the ending a little bit. I'm not going to argue whether it was a serial killer or someone who was seeking revenge and may now be a serial killer. I believe that the audience not knowing who it was increases the suspense that it could literally be anyone. It gives a feel of The Strangers to me where it could be just a random person for no reason, so I kinda liked not knowing. I just wish that not knowing, wouldn't make all the other hints and clues in the movie not matter.

The problem is we wanted everything tied together to a greater, more interesting ending/explanation. But nope, just your average serial killer targetting specific victims. you also never get to see the killers face, or so you think... but if you pause at JUST the right times you can see his face almost perfectly in a couple scenes.

I dont get whats so hard to understand about the ending? Its clearly a serial killer that preys among open houses. He stays for the visit and doesn't leave? It shows him driving up to the next \"open house\", so we know \"why\" hes going to the next open house, we know \"what\" his mission is, we sort of know \"who\" he is. There's nothing Confusing about this movie at all, except at first i thought this was paranormal stuff happening vs someone physically, but was easy to figure out.",

There's some great elements - the acting in particular from Minnette and Dalton. ((spoiler)) The former really pulled at my heart strings and I genuinely was upset in his last scene - which I can't say I often feel for horror movie protagonists. They're sympathetic characters and while their goals aren't fully fleshed out, they've got a decent bit of depth to them. Their set up and the movie's first half are quite strong in that regard - on top of some decent cinematography and mood. The threads laid out there eventually fall flat, however.So much seemed to be put out and then never picked back up. Why the constant preoccupation with the boiler over anything else? Why were the realtors so off? Why replace the glasses? What happened to the whole set up feeling \"personal\"? Martha in general and what happened to our olympic runner? It honestly did not feel \"clever\" that the movie didn't make use of moments (such as Logan getting sick or Naomi blaming his father for their situation OR harrassing the mother-son duo on the same level as some vapid teenagers playing ding-dong-ditch), just empty. I think it would have been neat to have it edge into weird towny territory, which could have filled out some of those connections. I may be biased, admittedly because ((spoiler)) I'm pretty tired of horror movies with empty connections between victim and assailant. It doesn't feel scary anymore to know \"it could happen to you,\" just unsatisfying as a viewer... but that's just me.Overall, not an awful watch but if you're looking for something to really sink your teeth into, I'd look elsewhere.Also, as a contact/glasses user, there's no way he could have taken those out of Logan's eyes so smoothly.

            "content": "As soon as I started this movie, it became clear what I was getting myself into. After a father dies in a car crash, his wife and teenage son move into a new house to get over their grief. It's an overdone premise with no originality to offer, but the cliches don't stop there.\nOver half of the jump 'scares' in the film are mere misunderstandings - accidentally surprising someone or bumping into them by mistake. Along with loud sounds heard off-screen, the 'horror' elements are treated without care and executed lazily.\nThe dialogue and characters are often forced and unrealistic. The subplots of the son's running career and mother's photography ambitions are thrown in without purpose, just to fill screen-time (it barely passes the 90-minute mark). Scenes feature dark basements, shaky flashlights, creaky wooden doors, and mysterious locals, adding to the canned atmosphere throughout.\nThe film isn't all bad, however. The performances from Piercey Dalton and 13 Reasons Why's Dylan Minnette are solid. They perform well with what they're given, even if the dialogue is difficult to deliver realistically.\nThe cinematography is well done too: beautiful landscapes, elegant wides, and voyeuristic birds-eye-views. These shots hold long and racket up the suspense, though without any effective payoff.\nThe relationship between mother and son doesn't feel like it belongs in a horror film. The movie is almost split in twain; half about a ghost and half about a family drama. Bouncing back and forth between these is a nightmare for tone, scarier than the 'thrills' the film attempts to provide. 2014's The Babadook combines horror with family drama well; even when it's just the mother and son, there's a constant unsettling feeling and when the creature does show up, it hits like a truck.\nAll in all, The Open House is not worth any viewer's time. Its performances and cinematography are good, but the constant cliches, poor dialogue, unoriginal writing, and generic score weight it down. Not to mention the weak ending, predictable plot and worst of all, it's not scary. There are a few good moments scattered throughout, such as the hauntingly beautiful \"Silent Night\" sequence, but repetitive scenes and overall lack of creativity cement this as a failure. It's beyond the point of being a 'so-bad-it's-good' flick like The Room, Birdemic: Shock and Terror or the Sharknado series. The Open House isn't enjoyable, just bad.",

This movie literally made no sense what so ever. It's a monstrosity of a movie. Me being movie fan of horror and thrillers was offended on how crappy this movie was. I'm very disappointed with how this all played out. You my as well remove it from Netflix. Literally wasted an hour of my life from watching the movie and writing this review I could be eating or doing something better with my time like eating food or sleeping but I'm so pissed of that I had to write a review of this dumb a** movie. My revie is pretty accurate if you ask me. I mean how do you have random weird people just kill you in a forest for no reason. It's very confusing and leaves you with a bunch of questions that Likely won't ever be answered. I've made a great decision on nominating this worst movie of the year and made me want to chuck my remote at my TV. It had multiple suspicious creepy people in it but didn't link to the plot which there really wasn't one. This is literally the movie- Logan's (kid) dad dies and mother can't support logan because they are broke. Moms in need of a place so moms sister lends her an old huge creepy house that's for sale up in the mountains in the middle of no where. Then creepy shi* happens mostly jump scares so it kind of sucks. And it makes no sense these people have no background indormation and the son logan mad mom just end up dying bc some random guy kills them. You don't even know who they guy is and why he did it. Maybe he is psycho but I know I am from watching that movie. To be fair I'm alright with a movie leaving behind some questions or a final thought. But when a movie like this just leaves out so much information it's doesn't make sense it's like they didn't even finish the movie. When I found out the ending I thought wow I would of fathered clean my room and be productive for once. Sorry for the spoiler but just so you know this movie is a disgrace and is just depressing if I could rate in for rotten tomatoes it would be at 1 or 0% fifty shades darker did better. What's even more messed up is Netflix rated it the top movie to watch. Whoever watched this played yourself. RIP movie.",

But alas, nothing was ever explained, nothing happened with the open house aspect - in the end, it was just a creepy house and they were killed for no apparent reason by a no-name dude.I think what makes it really bad is the writers seemed to know how to come up with good ideas that made the movie interesting, but they just literally decided not to have any of them go anywhere.

The director has no idea at all how to create suspense, ambitiance or any type of scare factor.

At this point the film would have become a cult movie if she had used the rocking chair as an escape vehicle by rocking herself out of the room, down the stairs and away to freedom. Unfortunately she just sat there; such a missed opportunity.\n2) most of the film is spent with Mum or Logan (her sun) going up and down the stairs to the cellar to relight the boiler. I have a boiler too although I've never considered that me relighting it would make s great central plot for a film or any other type of entertainment for that matter. The film would have been much better if they just bought a new boiler.\n3) Logan (the son) is the worst hero ever in any film, he's a complete whirl with absolutely no survival skills at all. The film would have been vastly improved if they had cast a boiled potato as the hero.\n4) the film just ends, they forgot to make the last ten minutes which in some ways was a relief. However to the writer/Director/producer if you ever again have the misguided idea that you should make a film again please have a point.",

The acting is bad and seems forced in many instances. Character development of the staring actors is inadequate and supporting actors seem to be thrown in with even less development. As for plot, you'll waist the entire film asking where it is. Cinematography is decent, but not good enough to add another star to the rating. There are plenty of thrills and chills, if you like cliche' \"oh look there's the bad guy\" moments. Ultimately the film generates 99 questions, but answers not one.

Tragedy strikes. It's a good setup. I like horror/thriller movies with a baseline that guides you instead of just mindless scares. After this strong introduction however we slide right into 'been there done that' town and don't ever leave.I've seen movies like The Strangers and The Pact, with their 'unexpected twists'. It's a well thought out concept that's been used (succesfully) in many movies before. Plant a few people in a big-ass house that they're relatively new to and you've got yourself a paranoia dreamscape. After the family moves to the mountain house we have a few interactions with seemingly random other actors that make such brief appearances I can't even remember their faces. And I get what the writers are trying to achieve: this family is isolated and everyone around them is odd and uninviting. But for viewers that's just plain boring. There's no rational motivation behind the main character's actions.The ending, if you'd like to call it that, leaves one completely unsatisfied. Where the movie started with giving me high expectations, throughout it those expectations dropped drastically. Yet I'm still disappointed by having that slightest sliver of hope of an at least somewhat credulous explained ending destroyed.Don't watch this movie unless you're ready for a sour aftertaste.",

Somehow the killer has moved his mom downstairs without Logan seeing or hearing him even though he has to carry a person with him.\n3. Why was it important to the plot for the father to die? The only logical reason for the plot would be that he came back to haunt them (which ties in with my first theory of the killer being a ghost) but that makes no sense.\n4. So many \"manufactured tension\" plot devices: the argument between Logan and his mom, Chris disappearing after going into the basement, the shady maintenance man etc......why were they important?!\n5. Was the old lady even relevant to the story?\n6. Why are the law enforcement in movies so goddamn stupid? \"Yeah kids broke in and set a table in your dining room. They also played Silent Night to creep you out..\"\n......\n.........\n............WHY WOULD KIDS DO THAT?\n7. Why was the identity of the killer a secret? Does that somehow make him scarier?\n8.

This movie is terrible. Not in a B movie so bad that it's good, its just terrible. There are many things wrong with this movie. There is nothing believable in the outburst of the son wishing his mother died rather than the father. No angst or back story to their relationship that would make this relevant.At one point the killer sets up a candle lit dinner table with a phone, then rings it when might and son approach it. Later he climbs in to bed next to her. Only to brutally beat her tie her up break her fingers, kill her house guest then knock out the son pour water over him and leave him unconscious outside. All seems very thought out and calculated like there's a purpose. But there isn't.The movie is set up with the killers face being in the shadows, you're shown clues throughout the film, the shoes, oh look Chris has those shoes, the old lady with Alzheimer's is it her, she's creepy, is her husband really dead, why do they bring him up, why was she in their garden at night, etc etc etc you get the point it's the story of every teen horror ever, unseen person will be someone you know...It builds up at one point you think oh it's turned in to a supernatural horror, but no, the old \"it's just a dream\" cop out was used.After both mum and son are dead for no reason (except the son is the one to accidentally killing the mum so that at least has an answer) at all and the completely unnecessary violence toward them and the killing of Chris who was set up as the misdirect you pause the movie and see wait there is only a few minutes left how will they wrap it up, ill tell you: you just see a pick up truck driving along to see another Open House sign and the killer changes direction to drive towards it. The end.So in conclusion main characters die, for no apparent reason, no motivation, no climax, no idea by whom only to see at the end it's some nameless nutter who does this sort of thing at open houses.It almost feels like someone had a bad experience at an open house and this piece of badly written rubbish was their tantrum.Netflix has produced a few of these movies now and it seems they believe in killing off the main characters like they have watched GOT and missed the point. Needless killing and unresolved story lines work in a series not a stand alone movie.The only redeeming feature are the beautiful location.",

What the hell were the writers thinking? The film started out really promising and I was excited to see Netflix delve into the horror genre with its originals. The open house idea was also really creepy and pretty original. It was the ending that caused me to give this such a bad rating, who even was the killer? Why were they doing it? What the hell did it have to do with an open house? It seems to me like the writers had a decent idea and just couldn't seem to work out what the story was beyond the very basic ideas. It turns a potential 7/10 film into, for me, a 3/10 (that's pretty generous). If you want to see a semi decent film that will excite you until the last part, then go ahead.

Also, I thought that hallway in the basement might have been explored more. I was thinking that maybe when the son went in the basement looking for his mother he would have found the blockage at the end of the tunnel removed and would have found something weird or interesting, or interestingly weird. We also never got to find out who the killer was. It was strange that the neighbor was walking around when the son was trying to hide from the killer. Was she involved? Guess we'll never know.

So when I saw it previewing on the front page when I logged on to Netflix, I was excited to give it a try. It started off fairly well, I think it showed some promise and I actually wanted to keep watching to find out what happened next. It kinda gave me Get Out vibes and I was enjoying the beautiful shots of nature and the aerial views of the mountains and landscapes. Reading through the reviews here, I find that most people did not like the acting. I actually liked the acting some of the time for some of the actors. Dylan Minnette, for example, had some good scenes (SPOILER: especially when he ends up being found by the killer after a night of trying to escape through the woods) but for the most part I wasn't particularly impressed by everyone else's performances. While I haven't seen 13 Reasons Why, I hope Dylan Minnette is able to move on from this project to something much better. I admit the characters weren't very well developed and so when some of them died, I found myself more irritated than sad. Some characters seemed especially suspicious, however, they ended up not really mattering to the story whatsoever. They were just there to rack up tension. I was willing to maybe push that aside if the movie turned out to have a good plot, but alas the third act came around and where we might expect resolution and closure, we were given nothing. Nothing is ever explained, no motivations are revealed. There were certain plot points and characters that were brought out and teased but, in the end, were just left hanging. While watching the movie, I found myself theorizing, trying to pull these different loose ends together, the death of the father, the suspicious townspeople and real estate agents, anything to try to explain what and why these events were happening. The plot could have gone off in any direction, ones that would have been much more interesting than the direction it got. When I finished watching the film, I just started ranting out loud. It was really annoying as a viewer to just be given this ending.And I get it. Sometimes (SPOILERS AHEAD) bad stuff happens to good people, people in grief. Sometimes, people just get killed by people they never knew for no reason other than they were just extremely unfortunate and happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and easy to get to. These are things that happen in real life in the world around us all the time. And sometimes we may never find out who these killers are or what their motivations were (just as we never find out who the killer in this movie is or why he did what he did). Maybe that's what the writers were trying to do here. I don't know. All I know is that many people are mad, including myself. I have feeling that if the plot had just been better, something that could have connected some of these plot points or characters and at least given us some resolution than maybe the ending of this movie would have been acceptable.

It boils down to a retelling of an old classic \"the call came from inside the house\" short story. Except it's not short, it's feature length. Surprisingly though, it doesn't actually feel too drawn out. Most of the scenes feel like they serve a purpose towards the payoff of the movie. The problem is that there is no payoff to the movie. The longer the movie went, the more confused I was about what the motivation of the mystery man was going to be. The main characters didn't really do anything that would make anybody mad at any point in the movie. The only thing I could think of was maybe it was a drifter living in the vacant house, and his goal was to keep the house from being sold. That wouldn't make sense though, how would messing with two random people with no intentions on buying the place accomplish that? Maybe it's the guy the mom was flirting with in the shop, and he's just a crazy perv? Turns out I put more thought into the motivations of the killer than the writers of the movie. He has no motivations, he has no mass (makes no noise the entire movie despite appearing to be well over 6 feet tall and fairly T H I C C, and wears a heavy pair of boots), and he has no face. It's a shame, the movie wasn't perfect, but the buildup was well done, the vibe was creepy and isolating, and it captured me enough to be really looking forward to the payoff. The movie was shaping up to be a well above average horror until the last 10 minutes or so.A couple side notes that I don't think are worth writing full paragraphs about, but worth mentioning:\nToo much of the tension in the movie is based on the viewer preparing themselves for the obvious loud jump scares that they see coming. The plot lends itself so well to Halloween-esque eeriness that it shouldn't have had to rely so hard on loud noises.The movie's bleakness meter is off. It starts off bleak, and only gets bleaker. HUGE SPOILER: The fact that the entire happy family we saw at the beginning of the movie are dead within an hour and a half at the hands of an unnamed, unmotivated killer is pretty depressing. Not even knowing WHY the killer did it leaves us with 2 dead characters that we were attached to with absolutely no closure. I know that's how life is sometimes, but this is a movie, not life. It's supposed to have closure.Don't watch this movie if anybody you were close to died recently, mostly due to my last point. This movie is an existential tragedy disguised as a horror-thriller.To finish on a happier note, the acting in this movie was really good. All of the characters were very believable, and it felt like they were going through what they were supposed to be. At no point did a badly read line pull me out of the movie, which happens far too often with horrors.Overall, there is a lot to criticize, but enough to praise that it's worth a watch if you just want to get nervous.",

That is to say, this particular movie is egregiously guilty of the same thing that many horror/thrillers are: a picture-perfect introduction to a happy, successful family who are riding the leeward edge of a (slightly) emotional, happy event. In this case, Logan had just run his fastest mile yet, an event that lead to conclusions of a promising future. This sugary exposition is a cheap trick to maximize the amplitude of the emotional swing that the audience feels, most likely in a bid to force the audience into an emotional contract to keep them watching. This trick has been beaten to death so violently by the movie industry that its presence is an immediate turn-off for the experienced viewer.After the introduction, the plot is force-fed down the audience's throat, leaving viewers no opportunity at all to engage in the pondering, mystery, and conjecture that makes watching a thriller so engaging.I will now list just a few of the dangling questions:\n1. Who is the mysterious murderer?\n2. What really happened to the neighbour's husband?\n3. What is the significance of the water heater?\n4. Why did the killer choose \"Silent Night\" as the track he set at the dinner table?\n5. What was the significance of setting the dinner table?\n6. What was the significance of taking Logan's contacts out, telling him to run, then strangling him the next morning? Why so much effort?\n7. What is the killer's motive for the murders?\n8. Why did the killer kill Logan's mother in such a complicated way?\n9. At the end of the film, we see another car pull into the road up to the house, presumably to attend the open house. However, none of the guests from the open house are harmed during the movie, so what are we supposed to conclude (there is no material for conjecture here)?\n10. Why was Logan's dad so deep into debt?\n11. Why did the neighbour show up so often?Honestly, this movie was such a hot, steamy pile of cinematic garbage that I was obligated to create this account expressly for the purpose of this negative review. If you are reading this as a filmmaker, PLEASE do not dilute the film industry with content of such preposterously low-quality.",

            "content": "Netflix originals hold a special place in my heart, so I was exceptionally disappointed with this drivel. I was taught growing up to always start criticism with a genuine compliment, so I will honor my southern upbringing with this; the actors weren't awful. In fact, if given a script that wasn't steaming garbage, maybe they could have made something passable out of it.. but no one can spin straw into gold. There were countless directions the plot could have chosen to go in but instead of tying up any loose ends it felt as though they said \"screw it, lets make the ending mysterious and let everyone decide for themselves\". The finished product (if I may so generously call it that) is no where near \"ambiguous\" and nothing short of pure laziness. For the most part the story is the trite, overdone spiel you see out of every other D-list movie: tragic death, single parent, moody teenager, creepy house, broken light switch... you get the picture. The only thing missing is the jump scene with an ominous figure walking past the doorw-- oh.. wait.. never mind. Ok ok, I'm done being a jerk. There were just so many ways to turn this around into something reasonably awesome. For example;the fixation with milk. This could have come into play with the mother/wife lamenting, \"If he'd gotten the milk like i'd asked... just one more second inside the store.. the car would have missed him.\" or something along those lines. But no, just going to make the audience stare at milk for a while until you start to feel a little weird about it. Martha and her \"dead\" husband. The recently-widowed neighbor, Martha, who is supposed to be made scarier and more dangerous by the discovery of her Alzheimer's diagnosis? Her husband could have not actually died and been the killer, stalking the mother after his wife began to \"leave him\" mentally due to her illness, and maybe the mother reminded him of his wife in her younger years? Or perhaps he truly is dead but Martha, unable to accept this, has taken it upon herself to have the beautiful house next door that - perhaps - he had always said he wanted? Who knows. Poor Martha.the killer obviously stalked the mother. The candlelit dinner? Offing Chris, the only other competition? Picture of her late husband in the trash? So, obviously, there was some attachment to her, yet this NEVER comes up during her actual torture/murder. And why break her fingers individually? What does that do for anyone involved?the kooky real estate duo. mother and son real estate team? a veteran and a newly-licensed kid trying to gain experience? Regardless, they were two weird characters that never had any other purpose. I really had been banking on spastic and eager-to-please Ed as the killer, but how would that help them at all? Property value would plummet if it is discovered that the last tenants were gruesomely hunted and murdered, and what real estate agent would want that? So they're off the table.the dad's death would have resulted in an insurance payout, so why doesn't she have $20 for lunch? Like.. come on.maybe the sister and her husband were the killers? She has the house on the market, and the killer poured what is assumably gasoline all over an unconscious Logan and the driveway, so it did occur to me that maybe the sister and her husband were planning to burn the house to the ground for the insurance claim, then decided the two casualties would potentially result in their life insurance policies being paid to them as well? Maybe the most likely answer, in my opinion.Lastly, and probably the point that has bothered me the most, are the freaking contact lenses. Early in the movie they make a very obvious point of showing us how he takes out his contacts and - woah - everything is blurry! As earth-shattering as this is, it's made so clear that this will be a recurring theme throughout that I wasn't surprised when the villain pins him down, and carefully, gently, without causing any other harm, removes his contacts for him and then barks, \"now run\". Our lil athlete runs until daylight, where he collapses by a stream, only to be found (and murdered) by the same psychopath who had taken out his contacts hours before. WHY. Why would he have Logan pinned down, where he easily could have strangled him then and there and been done with it, then just to let him go? Maybe he didn't want to kill him, he just wanted to preserve his identity? THEN WHY SPEND HOURS TRACKING HIM DOWN IN A FOREST JUST TO KILL HIM THERE? We later pan over the house and see that the crime scene is left, undisturbed and exactly as we had last seen it. No clean up, no gloves worn, nothing. His fingerprints are everywhere, and I guarantee a house that ritzy has some top-of-the-line security system.This guy is going to get caught, and doesn't seem bothered by that, so why not kill the kid there, too? My ONLY guess is maybe they wanted it put a \"The Most Dangerous Game\" spin on it, like the killer enjoyed tracking and hunting Logan, but even that doesn't make much sense.Overall, I wouldn't waste your time on this one. But please, feel free to tell me your theories or questions!",

            "content": "\"I just wasted 90 minutes\". That's all I could keep repeating to myself after finishing Netflix's new original, \"The Open House\". I'm going to just jump into the positives, which are very few so it won't take long. The acting of Dylan Minnette(Logan) and Piercey Dalton(Naomi) is decent, certainly the highlight of this terrible film, and I feel a sadness for both for being attached to this clunker. Also, the cinematography was very well done as well.Now that that's out of the way, I pose a question. Can an ending be SO bad that it can effectively ruin an entire movie's worth? That answer is a resounding YES. Not that this film was a masterpiece prior to the final 15 minutes, but I would say it was a decent 5-6/10 type of movie. The ending effectively dropped my personal score to a 1/10. Why you may ask? Well, because it decides to forgo the multitude of red herrings presented within the first 60 minutes(crazy Martha, weird Chris, the Dreams in the Rat House song, the dining table set-up during a \"break-in\") and instead goes with a nonsensical and boring ending of explaining that it turns out there just so happens to be a killer that makes his living by stalking the home-owners of open houses. I've never felt so insulted by a movie's ending like \"The Open House\"'s. Netflix should give anyone who watched this garbage 3 months free as compensation. If this is an indication of the direction of Netflix's original movies(Bright was also pretty bad), they should give up and just stick to their original shows.",

It leads you to believe that there is something going on with the neighbor and her dead husband, but she serves no purpose other than to create tension and make the movie creepier. I think the trailer and the way the movie was marketed were also very misleading. I don't know if it was just me, but I thought it was going to be a supernatural thriller, the tagline \"You can't lock out what's already inside\" suggests that there's an evil being in the home to start with. It is also very unrealistic to suggest that a single mother wouldn't bring any kind of weapons or protection to a new home in a secluded mountain area.

Why introduce Doris and the mystery of her dead husband, was he the killer? Why? What was his motive?They introduce the one african american in this film to only have him killed off without an evidence that he did anything to help or help the plot. Why did the killer go to all the trouble to freak them out for days and day, just kill them already and get the movie over with.I skipped through the last 25 minutes after Chris was killed because I saw it coming and was pissed that they did it. They introduce this band, and this recurring song that is supposed to have significance but it never really gets there. Was the director friends with the band and wanted to help promote them through this movie?Why did the rich sister just spring for a apartment or a room at her house in town and now to this isolated mansion-cabin.

A good horror consists in the good(victims) and the evil which I thought this film had at first before I realised with 16 minutes of the film left to watch all my questions had still not been answered, AT ALL!! \nWhile we thought we had the film figured out with the arrival of new characters , firstly the man that nearly got ran over, delusional Martha and her dead/ undead husband (who knows), the real estate agent, Chris the shopkeeper, and the plumber we had all come to a confused conclusion that all these people have nothing to do with slamming of doors and strange missing objects, but yet the film leads us to believe that these people are involved or know something of why the open house is so creepy but yet they know nothing. when we finally do know who the corporate is (kind of, because we still don't actually know who the man is as we don't see his face) we don't get a backstory or even a real reason as to why this psycho went through all the trouble to torture Naomi and Logan (the mom and son(main characters)) to then kill them afterwards.

So much stupid and so many red herrings that were just forced and obviously not red herrings no matter how hard they were trying to make them red herrings. They practically had neon signs flashing over them. \"Hey! Look at this red herring over here! Have we made you suspicious about this character yet? Look at how suspicious they are! Totally suspicious right over here!!!\" Like the neighbor. They clearly tried to make her all super creepy, but it was obvious she had Alzheimer's from her second appearance when she turned up wandering around and didn't know who the kid was. When she showed up with the banana bread and said her husband was alive they were trying to reinforce the creepy, and instead it was simply confirmation that she either had Alzheimer's or dementia before the plumber even showed up. They didn't even try to make it subtle enough for the viewer to question what was really going on. And Chris from the store. They were trying so very hard to make him seem creepy because he kept hitting on a widow and wow, look at Mister Inappropriate Advances over here, isn't he CREEPY? Except he didn't KNOW she was a widow because she never once said, \"I recently lost my husband,\" like a normal person would to discourage the mild flirting he was attempting. And then the stuff with the house! 1) If there's no light in a basement, I'm not going down there until a light is installed. 2) I sure as hell am not going down into a basement that doesn't have a light in nothing but a towel to relight a pilot light that keeps getting clearly turned to \"OFF.\" Maybe the first time (MAYBE, but I'm sorry, I don't know any woman, including myself, who would walk into a cobwebby, lightless basement in nothing but a towel), but after that - nope. 3) Why didn't the mother say to the plumber, \"You don't understand - the pilot light doesn't keep going out, it keeps switching to 'OFF.' That's not normal, is it?\" Because that just doesn't happen, and whatever coil he said he changed wouldn't have any impact on a faulty knob, and if the knob isn't faulty that means someone is turning it off. 4) WHY would you move to an isolated house in the woods that doesn't have a security system and where there are open houses being held and then once strange things start happening not go to the nearest animal shelter and get yourself a big ol' dog, at the VERY least, to protect you? 5) WHY wouldn't you tell your mother that someone clearly moved your cereal bowl right before the pilot light went out on the boiler? 6) WHY WOULD YOU GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTER FINDING SOMEONE HAD BEEN MESSING AROUND IN YOUR DINING ROOM??? I don't care HOW hard-up you are! I don't care if the police searched the place and didn't find anything! Someone has clearly been in this house you're staying in, weird freaking things have been happening to indicate you are not alone in the house for days, drive back to California and sleep in your flipping car if you have to!SUCH a stupid movie that should not have gone the way it did except that the two protagonists were too stupid to live. They practically deserve Darwin awards. Also, don't tell me that killer managed to silently track that kid all the way through the night in the dark without the kid hearing him. Just...SO. MUCH.
