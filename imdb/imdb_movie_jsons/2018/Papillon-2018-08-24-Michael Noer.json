            "content": "There is no question that the original Papillon movie released almost forty-five years ago and starring star actors Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman is an amazing historical period drama and survival adventure movie. Based upon true events, it tells the story of a wrongfully convincted prisoner who tries to escape a French penal colony in French Guiana on three occasions. One has to question why such a movie would be remade in the first place. Even by today's standard, the original film's acting performances are very skilled, the exotic locations are breathtaking and the story about freedom and friendship is profound and timeless. Even though the remake isn't a terrible film, it's completely unnecessary. If you're not familiar with the topic, I would suggest watching the original film. I would even suggest reading Henri Charri\u00e8re's Papillon and Banco novels which inspired both films. I would even recommend watching a documentary about French penal colonies before watching this remake. Watching this film should be your last option. However, it still remains an option, simply because the story is so good that it deserves to be watched or read or heard.A remake should have the ambition to offer a different take on the events of the original movie and to improve it. There are very few of these elements to be found in this film. If compared to the original film, this remake shows us roughly fifteen minutes of the lead character's life before his wrongful conviction. We can see him cracking a safe, attending a party with members of an organized crime gang and spending time with his girlfriend. This exposition also shows a reason why Papillon would be framed for a murder he didn't commit. He kept some of the diamonds he stole for the gang to offer them to his girlfriend and was seen in the process of doing just that.One element where the remake nearly matches the original film's quality is the acting. If compared to the unique Steve McQueen and the diversified Dustin Hoffman, Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek are obviously less experienced but they might deliver the best performances of their careers. Their friendship feels stronger and makes even more sense than in the original film. Charlie Hunnam convinces as resilient man who never gives up on his dream of freedom and comes surprisingly close to Steve McQueen's charismatic performance. Rami Malked does a solid job as scared intellectual and has great chemistry with Charlie Hunnam but can't match Dustin Hoffman's natural talent.On all other levels, the remake is quite a letdown. The new version is about twenty minutes shorter than the original film but ironically feels much longer than the film released forty-five years ago that already had a few lengths. The events leading to the first escape attempt are stretched and the scenes in solitary confinement are played brilliantly but end up being quite repetitive. On the other side, important scenes have been cut or excluded in the remake. The men's haunting passage at a leper colony was completely cut from the remake. Papillon's life with a native tribe lasts for about five minutes in the remake even though he lived there for a long period of time, got married to two sisters and even impregnated them. The ending is quite abrupt in the remake as the director shows a brief scene of Papillon's return to France decades after his final escape without telling what happened in nearly three decades between both events, making the remake feel less concise and focused than the original film that ended with Papillon's succesful escape.One element I would have liked to be mentioned is the fact that Henri Charri\u00e8re's story was at least partially made up. He clearly wasn't as innocent and sympathetic as portrayed in the movie. Making his character a little bit more sinister would have been an intriguing addition if compared to the rather neutral original film. However, Papillon instead seems to be an even friendlier lead character than in the original film which is somewhat misplaced but goes along with typical Hollywood productions that fabricate heroic protagonists the audience wants to cheer for. In this case, this approach is too simplistic.In the end, there are very few reasons to watch this remake. The exposition adds some depth to the lead character and the acting performances exceeded my expectations. However, the movie has more lengths than the original film, important scenes have been cut and the resolution feels misplaced. At the end of the day, this remake was quite unnecessary.",

Whilst it's a reasonable stand-alone film and not a bad movie, you just find yourself comparing it to the original at every turn. A classic film, is a classic film and should really be left alone. I'd prefer directors and producers to look at new projects and new ideas. Rehashing movies that have already been brilliantly done, are just a waste of resources. I would advise anyone wanting to watch this movie, just watch the original.",

The narrative jumps about and spends too long on lingering scenes and nowhere near enough time on characters and the linear story-line.The effects of years of brutality have almost no physical effect on the prisoners who look like they just hopped out of make-up after a good lunch!The 1973 version is timeless and a work of cinematic genius.

            "content": "There's no real reason for 1973's Papillon to have been remade, a sentiment that was seemingly found in most people considering how little fanfare this update got upon initial release, coming and going without so much of hint of notice but Michael Noer's re-imagining of the classic Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman prison break drama is a solid, if unremarkable attempt to breathe new life into the supposedly true life tale of 1930's convict and escape artist Henri \"Papillon\" Charri\u00e8re.Starring two of the most in-demand actors working today, in the form of Sons of Anarchy superstar Charlie Hunnam (who just can't catch a cinematic break) and Bohemian Rhapsody star, new Bond villain and Oscar winner Rami Malek, Papillon is a picturesque and solidly filmed epic that's lack of heart and energy often holds it back from achieving its goal of justifying its existence around its much beloved predecessor, that to this day holds up well as one of the quintessential incarceration/escape film's.There's a lot of commitment on show from its leads, with Hunnam and Malek diving headfirst into their roles, even if Hunnam is the films real MVP, stripping back (and off) for his role as con artist turned wrongly convicted murderer Charri\u00e8re.While Malek is fine as psychically weak forger Louis Dega, of whom Charri\u00e8re begins to protect in hopes he can finance an escape off the notorious French/Polynesian that the two criminals find themselves on in the harsh surrounds of the early 1930's, Hunnam's psychically and emotionally charged turn is deserving of a better film, a shame since his strong performance here will remain largely unnoticed, much like the similar low-key release of the very good Lost City of Z.Despite Hunnam's turn and some great production qualities on stunning surrounds filmed across Eurpope, Papillon's big missed opportunity is in its creation of a strong friendship between Charri\u00e8re and Dega. We never feel a strong connection between these two men, there's hints of a bond throughout but never a fully-fledged connection.Unlike say a classic such as The Shawshank Redemption or even the original 1973 film, of which featured a great double act of comradery between McQueen and Hoffman, Papillon never nails its central and important friendship down, meaning we're always kept at arm's length to the plight of these two very different men, unable to be more than curiously engaged rather than totally captured by their dangerous undertakings.Final Say -Unnecessary and not close to matching the original, this modern take on the Papillon story is still perfectly watchable and features a turn by Charlie Hunnam that showcases why he can hopefully have a break out feature but overall you do wonder what the point of this whole exercise was when what we've had before is still more than adequate.3 bundles of coconuts out of 5",

Far too much of the film focuses on the solitary confinement Papillon 'earns' from his escape attempts - a 2 year sentence then another five year sentence - and the dank and dark silent atmospheres results in audience participation: watching these passages is akin to actually being in solitary confinement!The previous 1973 version of the true story - with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman - moved more rapidly and was far better paced. Hunnam and Malek (and an assorted ensemble cast) definitely create the mood of the book, but the direction and editing are sluggish. The resulting concern for the audience is simply hoping that the next escape attempt works - to end the film.",

This is a fair redo and that's all this could be. The production is top level. The setting has the tropical desperation. It falls on the two leads to rise to the challenge.

            "review_title": "A Good Remake That Imitates the Original",
            "content": "Some movies shouldn't be remade. An example is director Michael Noer's \"Papillon,\" about the real-life experiences of a French safecracker named Henri Charri\u00e8re, who penned the eponymous autobiography of his nightmarish incarnation in French Guinea in the early 1930s. Noer's film benefits from a sturdy cast headed by \"Sins of Anarchy\" star Charlie Hunnam as the lead. He was framed for the murder of a pimp and shipped off to the penal colony on the other side of the world in South America. During the voyage, Charri\u00e8re befriends a wealthy forger, Louis Dega (Rami Malik of \"Need for Speed\"), who becomes fast friends with Charri\u00e8re. Charri\u00e8re needed somebody with money so he could launch escape attempts, while Dega needed the protection that the brawny Charri\u00e8re could provide. Inevitably, these two grew to be inseparable. The conditions of the prisons that they were confined at were abysmal. Few inmates escaped, much less survived, in a land filled with treacherous predators on land and sea. Nevertheless, these myriad dangers did not stop Charri\u00e8re from embarking on one escape attempt after another, until he got off Devil's Island and lived the live of a free man. Hunnam and Malik make a believable, often charismatic pair. \"Contraband\" scenarist Aaron Guzikowski drew from the original screenplay of the Steve McQueen & Dustin Hoffman film which was scripted by Dalton Trumbo of \"Spartacus\" and \"Three Days of the Condor\" scribe Lorenzo Semple Jr. Indeed, if you've seen the far superior original, you will know exactly what to expect from this movie. Although it draws heavily from its source, the remake qualifies as a good, often exciting thriller, with Hunnam's thoroughly convincing performance. Unfortunately, as admirable as it is as a remake, this \"Papillon\" doesn't have the raw power of director Franklin J. Schaffner's movie. This picturesque production, featuring scenic locations that replicate the subhuman conditions of the prison with its corrupt guards, heartless wardens, and bestial inmates comes in second best. If you enjoy the remake, the original will blow you away.",

Too much creative liberty (in both movies to be fair), horrible casting, bad scenography, some laughable flops like jumping into still Mediterranean ocean.2017 Papillon is a movie tailored to the general population starting with a love story and adding Louis Vega relationship as a main point of the movie, while in book Louis Vega is just of of many characters that come and go. Gruesome, brutal unnecessary murder in the middle of the ocean and just whole movie is one big lost opportunity if not anywhere else in selecting which scenes from the book to display.If you are unaware of the story, sure, watch it, otherwise very little substance to be found here.",

            "review_title": "a gentler remake",
            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. It seems like most every remake that comes around begs the question, \"Why?\" This is especially true when the film being remade is a favorite such as 1973's PAPILLON. The original was directed by Oscar winner Franklin J. Schaffner (PATTON, THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL), and starred two legendary actors, Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr, and was based on the Henri Carriere books \"Papillon\" and \"Banco\". Mr. Carriere was, of course, the titular Papillon himself, and though the specifics of his stories have been met with skepticism over the years, he nonetheless delivered some fascinating material.So why make the film again 45 years later? Well this is a kinder, gentler version and features two of today's most popular actors: Charlie Hunnam (\"Sons of Anarchy\") and Rami Malek (\"Mr. Robot\") as Papillon and Louis Dega, respectively. The screenplay from Aaron Guzikowski (PRISONERS) focuses more on the friendship and less on the brutal prison environment. Director Michael Noer (I'm admittedly unfamiliar with his previous work) delivers a movie that looks very good and works as an example of loyalty and bonding.The film opens in 1931 Paris and we witness Papillon (so known because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest) doing what he does ... safecracking for a powerful mobster. He seems to be living the good life with his girlfriend (played by Eve Hewson, Bono's daughter) and they have plans to escape this life of crime - always an ominous sign in movies. Sure enough, he is framed for murder and sent to the penal colony in French Guiana. It's there that he meets Louis Dega (Malek), a master counterfeiter. Dega is a soft and slight man, and the wad of cash hidden in his nether-regions puts a target squarely on his back. So Papillon's brawn and need for cash to grease the wheels of his escape, and Dega's need for protection, make this the match made in heaven (or in this case, hell). Being a man of eternal optimism, Papillon never loses faith that he will escape, even when the warden (a terrific Vorick van Wageningen from Fincher's THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) explains that hope is his enemy. The years spent in solitary confinement rob Papillon of years and weight, but never hope. A final stint on Devil's Island reunites the two men who share a bond that only such harsh circumstances could build. Since we know that Henri Carriere wrote the manuscripts for the books in 1969, the ending is known before we start; however it's the telling of the story that allows us to come to know both Papillon and Dega.This latest script does a better job of developing the friendship, as well as providing Papi's past and reason to live. The original nailed a man's commitment to surviving, while this one makes hope more of a philosophy. Lacking the magic of McQueen, Mr. Noer's version doesn't quite compare, but for those who have never seen the 1973 film, this one should prove quite engaging - even if we old-timers don't buy into the kinder/gentler approach.",

It is entering in the screenings so late, of course because so many factors, but we already knew the main story from the Internet. While it is coming to Indonesia, it is such a blessing. This movie is not a popular movie, not having typically Hollywood ending, but it brings the strong sense of humanism and how is the deep mind of prisoners, who had been captured unfairly. Papillon has simple main story about how prisoners had tried to escape, been captured, escaped again, and been captured again. The repetition plots in this movie is not boring, because we have Rami Malek's great acting, sad scenes of cinematography, and unbelievable shooting of dark side in Guyanna French prisoners' islands. Rami Malek is not the main actor, but he leads the whole action-reaction scenarios and I am pretty sure he will be great in his next moves in both Hollywood and European film industry. Papillon had big success in America, North America, and Europe and this year I am pretty sure it has more success in Asia, even though it is not popular movie, but is darker than Prison Break and harder than Gulag story. Much appreciation ahead for the Director, Producer, actors, cinematographer, and editor.",

According to his own account he was framed for murder of a pimp, convicted, and sent to prison for life in 1932. He had a butterfly tattoo on his chest and the French word for that is 'Papillon', thus his nickname and the title of this movie.He ends up with many other prisoners in French Gianna, on the NE coast of South America, then eventually on Devil's Island. The movie shows a number of escape attempts, some successful some not. Ultimately he was given his total liberty in 1945 and became a citizen of Venezuela. He died in 1973.So the movie is primarily about the incarceration and poor treatment of him and the other prisoners. Historians say that some of what is claimed was drawn from the experiences of other prisoners. Henri Charri\u00e8re himself claims his book is about 75 percent true.It is a well-made movie, some of it is entertaining but mostly it depicts the harsh prison environment in the 1930s.",

The film does get grim seeing these prisoners being starved, beaten, and put into a breaking point until they are insane. It does get a little graphic with prisoners harassing the weak. Guards and wardens trying to break the prisoners.The plot was decent feeling a little dull at times. Besides it is based on a true story of Henri Charriere actual memoir of the events he encountered with being beaten, trying to protect another prisoner, and escaping. And getting captured to be placed on devil's island. Henri is a skilled thief. A safecracker. Working for the criminal organization. When he is wanting out and gets framed for murder. He is sent to devils island for life. He meets a counterfeiter Louis (Rami Malek) who is rich. And has some money with him that can buy his protection. Henri and Louis try to plot their escape on a broken down boat. But gets captured again and placed in a confined room for years until they are back on the island. Which nearly looked every prisoner is broken down, feeling hopeless, and losing their minds from starvation, isolation, ect.Charlie Hunnam was decent with playing Henri. Rami Malek was good playing Louis. The emotions with these characters as Henri and Louis looking out towards the sea for freedom was sad and heartening.I did not like the beginning of the movie with Henri being that slick safecracker. And walking to a club in France. Every thing seemed a bit rushed with the first 15 minutes of the movie. He is working for some mobster in breaking through safes. He gets drunk and falls in love with one of the clubs dancers. And they walk around the city of France having a good time and messing around like teenagers. And Henri wakes up in a hotel room until they get interrupted with the police arresting him for murder. The beginning felt rushed and cheesy. It does get better from there.Overall, Papillon is a fair drama film. Plot was okay. Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek gave a good performance. The gritty tone was emotional and powerful. Even if the movie had a cheesy rushed beginning.",

But as of now he has not done anything remotely as succesful as SoA. Not trying to be mean or discredit him as an actor in any way shape or form. There are quite a few reasons I reckon why he wasn't able to. But he's working and he's doing a lot of big budget movies, so there's that.This is not a carbon copy of the original, which may satisfy or anger the fans of the original.

Except by cruel happenstance he is fingered as a murderer by a mobster gang lord and sentenced to life imprisonment at the most notorious facility they have to offer... Devil's Island. A compound prison camp nestled in thick green foliage with nothing but ocean as the moat for Papillon and his friend Dega who both vie to escape the hellish conditions of the sadistic guards as well as deviant prisoners from all walks of life. It is a told account of their trials and obstacles to overcome their mental and physical instabilities so that the opportunity will show itself in the form of a boat, or a clear running path to freedom. I found this to be an excellent portrayal where the director used exact dimensions to the prison itself. What you saw was how they lived day to day in constant fear of being both killed or raped or even executed. Charlie Hunham played Papillon brilliantly as did Rami Malek who acted as Dega, The cast was picked perfectly and the movie was directed like it should have been with all the trimmings included to show us just how bad the prison really was by testimony accounts and parolees. Birds or Butterflies are not meant for such brutal establishments such as Devil's Island. Although human mistakes can often be made Papillon allowed us to witness the darkness that law makers thought was normal for all criminals during the height of criminal activity. The music score was flawless as was the complex location backdrop of French Guiana to authenticate this film's most potent emotion... Hope.Being stuck within an apocalyptic prison for nearly twelve years mentally taxes a human to their bursting points and for Charriere it was his moment when he attained freedom. Great story and wonderful scenery along with a fantastic cast and director. Highly recommended to for those who like docudramas or prison tales.",

            "content": "Remakes are often hard to review for most people because they could not be objective without emotional bias. For example, the Total Recall remake received harsh review from audience who were accustomed to Arnold's original Mars adventure with all that 80s muscle man action star quirks and one liners. Because of that many were not able to judge the new version for its own style as a more futuristic action sci-fi.Other movie remakes such as Ben Hur also faced the same unfair harsh treatment. Papillon would not be an exception either, due to strong attachment by many of the critical audience to the original stars such as McQueen and Hoffman.In an unbaised review, this film was exceptionally made. There were subtle differences in this version compare to the original, most notable were the fight scenes which added a bit of action to rather a melodrama. However, even so, it was not without soul or heart and the friendship between Dega and Papillon was well choreographed to the very end.The updated crisp and HD view gave a more surreal feel to the movie background, that you feel both the beauty of the tropical setting as well as the claustrophobic intent of the solitude imprisonment scene.Overall it is a very well done film and being 30 minutes shorter than the original, a much smoother story telling that will keep you engaged to the very end.I'm giving it 8/10 simply because these kinds of stories don't really interest me in general. It is as high as I can give to these kinds of movie and I doubt I would give the original any higher.",

He is known as Papillon because of the Butterfly tattooed on his chest. Attempts at escaping always proved fruitless and landed him in Solitary for 2-year and then in solitary for 5-years and then it was on to Devil's Island.This is a remake of a 1973 movie starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Poppy as he is called by fellow inmates lines himself up with wealthy art forger Louis Dega (Rami Malek) and we see these two survive as best they could and still think about escaping. I am sure the prison life was more brutal than what we saw on screen.I took this out because I had seen the 1973 Papillon, but wanted to see if current technology updated the scenes and or action. No. No CGI. Nothing much changed - the story went on as in 1973. At times the cinematography was outstanding.I noticed that no one spoke French or even had a French accent There were many characters whose names I cannot recall mostly because many were not referred to by name. That was a huge disservice to those players because they were very good and should have been recognized at least by name in the movie.Notables: Yorick van Wageningen as Warden Barrot; Nikola Kent as Deputy Warden Briouelet; Michael Adams as Bartiloni, one of Warden Barrot's enforcers.Papillon in 1973 is a classic and I think this one in 2017 can be also considered such a classic also as it is very good. Not sure why it was remade, but those who didn't see the 1973 version have a great opportunity to see almost a carbon copy of that classic. Charlie Hyunnam and Rami Malek made this work.There are statements at the end to tell all what happened to Papillon and Dega.Violence: Yes.\nSex: No.\nNudity: No.\nHumor: Yes, at times.\nLanguage: Yes, mostly in the beginning\nRating: A",

So let me get this out of the way now: This review will NOT be a comparison to the 1973 original. This movie will be reviewed as its own work, and I will not compare it to the original unless its deviations raise a legitimate question.On its own, this is a perfectly watchable movie. Serviceable performances all around. Rami Malek in particular does a great job with what he's given, although that's to be expected from him. The issue here lies in the dialogue. The writing is okay at best, diving into outright cringe-worthy at the very worst. There were quite a few times where I found myself quietly snickering to myself because of just how forced and clich\u00e9d the dialogue felt.The action is decent. It never devolves into outright shaky cam, but most of the action is still shot from too close up and thus becomes hard to follow. It ends up looking like the studio was trying to hide the more grisly aspects of the action, which is never a good mentality to have while shooting an R-rated flick.On that note, the movie really cannot seem to make up its mind whether it wants to go all-in on the R-rating or scale things back, to the point where it seems like the movie's most explicit moments were added solely to avoid a lower rating. Prime example? Just three scenes in, we're treated to at least eight exposed breasts. Very next scene? PG-13 sex. A few scenes later, an extra gets disemboweled on camera in vivid detail. The movie never comes close to attempting this level of gore again until the final kills. The biggest issue with the movie, however, is the pacing. The movie is 133 minutes long, but it will quickly start to feel like a 3+ hour ride. Why is this? Well, because the second act is just too goddamn slow. The solitary confinement sequence is admittedly great... until you realize that it just keeps on going without any development being made.In contrast, other threads are resolved too fast, causing the runtime to feel rather unjustified. This is the one area where I feel the need to compare to the original, as there, the great deal of planning that went into Henri's escapes is shown in detail. Here, they just sort of... happen, and feel rather contrived. And in a film based on a true story, a lack of this type of detail is kind of the worst that can happen.Overall, it's a perfectly serviceable film, but with all of its issues with pacing, writing, and content, and the existence of the original which is miles better, I can't recommend it to anyone really looking for a good time.",

Charlie plays Papillon-which means butterfly, a nickname he had because of a tattoo he had-who was a well known safe cracker in 1930's Paris. Eve plays his girlfriend. Charlie is wrongly accused of murder and sent to prison in French Guiana. There, he meets and befriends Rami, a professional counterfeiter. The warden is very strict, saying any escape attempts will earn time in solitary confinement and when he says time, we are talking in years. If any guards are killed during an escape, you automatically earn a date with the guillotine. Of course, Charlie thinks about nothing but escaping and makes a deal with Rami to protect him in prison, in exchange for footing the bill on any escape plans-you know, bribing people or any materials needed. Roland plays a fellow prisoner that wants in on the escape. After several failed attempts at escaping, the warden starts to lose his patience and sends the boys to a different, more escape proof prison called Devil's Island Prison.

The earlier film was static and included mediocre production values. By contrast, the newer version included dynamic scenes and stunning cinematography.The date is 1931, and the place is Paris. Henri Charri\u00e8re, a skilled safe cracker and bon vivant, is having the time of his life in the dazzling mecca of Josephine Baker and the French nightclub scene in the interwar years. But his high-rolling bliss is interrupted when he is arrested and accused of murder, then falsely convicted and sent to the brutal French penal colony in French Guyana. The film focuses on the relationship Henri establishes with his alter ego, a mild-mannered, cerebral counterfeiter named Louis Dega, who has also been shipped to the penal colony.One of the strengths of the film was the improbable bonding of Charri\u00e8re and Dega. The relationship of McQueen and Hoffman never quite worked in the 1973 film; they were merely the odd couple. But in the updated version, there was the clear sense that these two characters needed each other. Their complementary survival skills were what enabled them to endure the gruesome circumstances of a living hell in captivity.Another striking feature of the film was the photography. The beautiful natural environment, especially the ocean scenes, helped to convey the yearning for freedom of the two prisoners. The filmmakers took great pains in drawing upon archival footage and photographs of the Camp de la Transportation to recreate the penal colony.Over 80,000 prisoners were condemned to the inhumane conditions of the French penal colony in South America. There is a poignant moment at the close of the film where we learn in the words of Charri\u00e8re that his memoir tells not merely his personal story, but that of thousands of other human souls.This was an engaging film experience in which the filmmakers went beyond merely remaking a film from one of the great decades of American cinema, but strove to place their own stamp on the project. The DVD version of the film includes a large set of deleted scenes, all of which could have been included in the final cut, based on the quality and integrity of the filmmaking.",

Directors who put the 'photography' above the content, when in reality 99 percent of viewers don't give a flying fox about lighting and grading, and Actors whose egos far outweigh their talent.\nPapillon, the book, is a true masterpiece for so many reasons and it's almost a natural screenplay - what the Producers, Writers and Director have done here is managed to sum up the book like a Twitter Post rather than a script, missing out on the absolutely wonderful, scary, heartfelt and funny scenarios that Charriere went through for real. The film was also shot in Malta, presumably for the South American scenes, and probably in Winter because there are many scenes where it's clearly cold enough to see the breath of the actors. I mean, if you are going to spend a lot of money on a film, at least go somewhere more authentic and save your money elsewhere.\nSo, forget about this attempt, it's insulting to the memory of Charriere.

The film is a brutal and tough watch, but it does give you an idea of the hellish conditions that the prisoners were subjected to.So clearly there is some good with this film, but at the same time I found that whilst it gave with one hand it also took away with the other. I found the set-up to the escape incredibly long-winded, some scenes went on for too long presumably merely for dramatic effect and I think that the director went overboard with some of the violence/torture - yes necessary to an extent, but at times it was a little over the top. Although the relationship between Dega and Charriere was fairly well-explored, the relationship was a fairly cold one and I struggled to buy into this deep friendship that they supposed had here (it came across much more believably in the original).In the lead role, Charlie Hunnam was brilliant and has proven himself to be a capable and reliable actor over the years. I was less impressed with Rami Malek and felt that Dustin Hoffman brought more to the role in the original film. Technically, the film is good with some beautiful photography and cinematography (moreso when they get to Devil's Island).I don't totally hate this film and did appreciate the different approach that was used. It was arguably deeper and a little more expansive than the original film, but if I just want to watch something deep and expansive I'd watch a documentary. It's purely a matter of taste, but to me this film felt a little cold, clinical and uncinematic. If you haven't seen the original film I would suggest you check it out as whilst it is different in some respects to this film I did it enjoy it slightly more than this one.",

It was a fantastic movie, from start to finish. I had seen the original maybe a year ago and was pretty bored by it, but this was incredible. I have no idea what the critics are thinking, but I don't trust them anymore. What a shame. The acting in the film is superb aside from the fact that everyone using British or American accents is a bit confusing considering it takes place in France and a French colony. The story is ultimately what matters and it's great stuff. Perhaps the snobbery came about because this was a remake, and that's a shame.",

It is a thrilling movie with good acting and very nice editing and directing. The scenes are well-built and the story is good. I did however feel that there were some plot holes in the movie though who knows maybe that was really how it happened in real life. So a little spoiler alert here, I didn't understand why Devil's Island was a bigger punishment than isolation. It actually seemed even better than the regular prisonment. You just live on an island and do what you want. Of course it's no Paradise but definitely better then rotting in isolation or being bullied or killed in prison.",

You don't remake The Sting, The Godfather, Cabaret,The Exorcist, Deliverance or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest so why remake Papillon? The new version is honest and worthy but it's flat and it's bland and if it wasn't for the efforts of Hunnam and Malek in the two principle roles then the film would be barely watchable. They don't have a lot to work with script wise and the direction is all over the place.What did director Michael Noer do previously to earn a stab at this ? I am not sure . Some scenes seem to copy faithfully scenes from the original so you know what's coming before it happens but when they do depart from the original it doesn't work either,for example compare the opening of the original against that of this remake where you see a little background of events leading up to Papillon's arrest and imprisonment. It wasn't necessary to show it. This film appears to be based on the original film lock stock and barrel instead of maybe venturing into the pages of the two enormous novels that Charriere wrote about his years in captivity. You feel the level of suffering much more in the original than this remake and I felt the black and white footage and photos that end the film conveyed the horrors of being in captivity much more than the preceding two hours.After the cruelly underrated Lost City of Z and this Hunnam will continue to see his stock rise and Malek already has his Oscar .I'd like to remember this film as being part of these two actors journey in cinema rather than it being a good remake of a seventies classic which it falls way short of.",

Even the imprisonment scenes got to the point across, about how Henri struggled to keep his sanity and motivation. \n(2) Escape scenes and prison brawls looked realistic, albeit hard to catch every movement due to dim lighting.\n(3) The plot and pace are easy to follow (no bizarre flashbacks / editing), making the 2hr 13 minute film not feeling long to sit through\n(4) The historical photos on the penal colony at the movie end credits were thoughtful tributes to the real prisoners. The tone of the film was also serious and created empathy for the inmates. Fights and deaths were portrayed with dread and sadness, not gratuitous violence.The Drag/Let Down:(1) The friendship/ chemistry between Henri and Louis didn't sink in until half way through the movie. The supporting actors also couldn't do much with a few scenes and lines given to them. So, the interactions didn't lead to a moving and inspirational story about the unwavering spirit of friendship, and fight for freedom.Recommend:For those looking for a prison drama-thriller, you'll enjoy the movie.

It wasn't hard to watch because of the content subject matter, it was difficult to watch because it was done so poorly. There were so many thing that it's hard to say them all. They did try and put some male and female gratuitous nudity in it from time to time, but they was a cheap ploy to salvage what they knew was going to be a slop. They even stole little bits from other movies, like \"Pretty Woman\". Did they think no one would notice? Another thing is that the prisoners are supposed to look malnourished, but the actors' had a good amounts of muscle tone and fat that it was hard to believe. The special effect/makeup were terrible. It looked like a bad TV movie. Not to mention that the casting director should have been fired. Overall, I couldn't care less what happened to any of these characters.

            "content": "First, there was a true story of hope, endurance and daring escape from a tough prison in French Guayana in 1941.Then came the controversial autobiography by the man who lived through it. Then we had a celebrated 1973's movie... and now there's a remake.The original movie's stars Steve McQueen (the epitome of cool in 1960-70's Hollywood) of and Dustin Hoffman have been replaced by Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek which is surely an interesting choice.Hunnam is in amazing physical shape but also a promising actor - a combo you don't see often -, while everybody likes Malek in \"Mr. Robot\" who's suitably nerdy counterpart for the other man's buffed-up torso.Turns out, the new \"Papillon\" is much more action- and looking-cool-centered than the brainy original, so the new duo works out just fine.To be precise, it's more of a Hunnam's one man show, giving him chances to both showcase the action man and the dramatic actor side of him, and he doesn't disappoint.He really grabs the role by the balls and runs with it - grit, pain, unflittering instinct for survival, he made me buy all that.He wouldn't look out of place among the next batch of male actor Oscar nominations, although \"Papillon's\" early showing in Toronto film festival in September 2017 may have ruined that (any wider release has followed only quite recently).Anyway, the new \"Papillon's\" production values are great, everything looks downright amazing. The movie looks deliciously authentic even in smallest of details, from sweat-drops on characters' bodies to withered prison walls - not to mention 1931's Paris - a true movie lovers' dream.Judging by IMDb, the Danish director Michael Noer seem has plenty of experience with screen stories about criminals, so the atmosphere is also appropriately macho and adrenaline-soaked.So far, so good. Too bad it all doesn't stay that way. The movie achieves its high point somewhere around the middle point, when Papi gets out of the solitary confinement.This section is pretty good in itself, making it psychologically hard to stomach both to hero and the viewer - no hope, no light, almost no words. But after that, one just can't ignore the fact that the story loses any real emotional punch it previously may have had.The problem is that storytelling is sorely lacking some depth, regarding both any characters and the situation they are in.Almost nothing they do is explained adequately, if at all. Why Papillon is so loyal to Louis Dega, for example? How does he survive the solitary so well, both physically and mentally? What keeps him going?And we don't even get to know the basic facts about the intriuing prison environnment: what is the local hierarchy among prisoners? How do prisoners earn the money? For a 133 minute movie, it can really be surprisingly shallow.In the end, we can only summarize that \"Papillon\" is a really cool-looking thriller about some cool-looking dudes. But it could have been something more.The ingredients for making it all work are there - but the bar has been set just all too low.My suggestion is to re-edit and expand the material to re-release it as a mini-series or something.Surely the creative forces behind the camera have plenty of unused scenes and footage which wasn't used due to time restraints?

Malik simply can't act, he belongs in a C4 soap not in high profile films.

Perhaps by making it easier in the eye, the more polished, cleaner and newer version takes away some of what made the original. That grit shows us the horrors he endured and the darkness takes us on the journey with him. I certainly prefer films that aren't so grimey or nasty that they upset my gut. You know the ones where you can smell what's in he bucket or the rancid food and feel the cold or the burning heat. I like films that I can access and understand without having to try too hard, which this take on it allows me to do.The story, before anything else is even considered, is pretty good to begin with. There will be die hard McQueen fans that will call this interpretation an abomination and refuse to watch it again and there will be other fans of the original that consider that as long as the tale is told, it doesn't matter who's telling it. I think it stands on its own either way as a great tale, but I was disappointed to read that a lot of it may have been a fabrication, or at the very least, a collection of stories rather than one specific autobiography, which the film alludes to at the very end.When I think about the leads, I have to say that Charlie Hunnam wins me over, but that's because I would love to get him hog tied on a table too. There are moments where it doesn't seem like he's been through the trauma his character is supposed to have endured, especially towards the end when he is more like the teenage Nathan from 'Queer As Folk' again and not a tired, beaten, middle aged man as he should be. That said, his acting abilities have come a long way and I think he does a great job here, if a bit more heroic than Steve's version and that isn't quite right.\nIf I'm honest with myself, Steve is the better Papillon, he just doesn't float my boat like Charlie.Rami in the role of Degas is probably very good, but there was something about him that put me off. I think I was so impressed with Dustin Hoffman when I saw his performance, that it would always be difficult to compete with that.The supporting cast do a fine job, there is no one else that specifically stands out, but that in itself shows a consistently produced film.I personally find this one to have a better pace and to be more bearable to watch.\nI do, however, have a grumble. I don't understand why, in this age of such superb acting abilities, versatility and international co-operation, the correct accents aren't used? They are French after all? It doesn't have to be spoken in the French language necessarily, but an accent at least would help to set the scene appropriately. For all I knew he could have been from America or England.It will go on my list of films at a higher rating than the original, but that is my personal taste. I don't deny that both are very good.",

I was particularly impressed with Mr. Hunnam's portrayal of Papi, his ability to show the character's human brutality and vulnerability as well as the friendship, loyalty and love that Papi develops for Dega is Oscar worthy. Mr. Malek's portrayal of the nervously optimistic Dega is outstanding.

I have never been a fan of the \"remake\". Rarely, if ever, do they meet my expectations so I generally just steer clear saving myself the anger and the money. That being said, why did I watch the remake of Papillon? Simply, I am a big fan of Rami Malek. Hearing he was going to play the part of Louis Dega I was hooked. So, I held my nose, closed my eyes, hoped for the best, and hit PLAY. Well, once again I should have followed my own instincts and saved myself the disappointment!!!! \"Papillon 2017\" sadly, is a mere shadow of the classic 1973 version at best. Gone is the character development between Papillon and Dega which is so beautifully portraited by McQueen and Hoffman in the 73 classic and so very crucial to the story. The 73 original, written by Dalton Trumbo (in my opinion, next to William Wilder, is one of the greatest screenwriters of all time) gives every character an identity.",

            "content": "I'm very old school, even though I'm only in my late thirties. I grew up in a poor family that only had a black and white TV until the early 90s, and never had cable. So mostly, I saw old movies on TV. In the last ten years or so, I have mostly given up on Hollywood, too many superhero films, prequels, sequels and what have you. Also, there's something missing with young actors, like they are light on life experience or real toughness that they try to portray. I think the golden age actors who mostly had to serve in the military or at least experienced the depression had a natural edge here. I probably never would have given this film a chance, but was stuck on a long flight and found it will browsing the films on offer.\nNaturally, I had seen the original many times, the first probably going back to childhood. I also revisited it after getting back home. The older film looks to be set on location, and that helps it, as the scenery is kind of a costar. The newer film looks to be set elsewhere. The acting of Steve McQueen was quite good in the original and I don't think is topped here. Hoffman's acting is too meek for my taste and I never quite got the friendship in the original, whereas the actor that plays Dega in the new version is somewhat nerdy, but has a lot more life in him and it is believable to me that with Papillon's protection, a little luck, and time to acclimate, he could eventually learn to survive. Hoffman's character does not seem like someone who could survive with rough prisoners and even tougher environment, I just don't buy it, particularly when his protector is often in solitary for years.\nThe problem with both films is it is unclear exactly what Papillon is surviving for, although this remake gives us a snapshot of the wealth and women Papillon had, and I imagine hopes to return to. It really needs to be an old fashioned epic type film, where the first half is an amazing safe cracking job along with a romance, and the second half is the prison scenes, something like that, probably making it a 3 hour film, like Lawrence of Arabia or something, Perhaps Papillon doesn't merit that treatment but I think it would be a stronger film for it.\nThis version has more action than the original which makes Papillon's success a bit more supernatural, but the original has a lot of unlikely events as well. I didn't like the warden being so stereotypical in the new version, although upon reseeing the original, he is somewhat similar, although less extreme. I can't imagine a warden being all that interested in how you got some coconuts. Sure he might put him on half rations with a good chance of death, but I would think he would leave it at that, and not bring in beef stew months later in an attempt to play good cop and get him to confess. Anything is possible I suppose, but this seems very unlikely.\nI read that in the original McQueen and Hoffman did not get along, and to me that shows in the performance. Only at the end do we sense a real friendship, while in the remake we sense it much earlier and so Papillon's loyalty makes a bit more sense (still unlikely unless the convict's code was what was keeping him from ratting). I would say technically speaking the acting is a wash, with the new Papillon's acting being somewhat worse and the new Dega's being somewhat better. But I think most viewers unless they are looking to learn about method acting will enjoy the acting in the newer version more.\nThere are some things left out in the new version, like a visit to a leper colony while on the run which was quite memorable. My advice would be to see them both, and if you have already seen the original, give this newer version a chance. For people who know nothing of McQueen's acting they will almost definitely enjoy this, for those who do, if you are willing to watch someone play the part differently, you can enjoy it as well.

Rami Malek is one of the 21st century's most well-rounded actors and he did a great job as Dega in both the fragile part and especially the smart parts. Is he close to Dustin Hoffman? Two different animals.I have to agree with all the other reviewers who have stated, some loudly, that this is a movie that did NOT need to be remade. I have to agree. The new version didn't bring anything new to the screen. In fact, it didn't live up to the original at all.And forget about matching the book!This seems to be a vanity version with some gratuitous nudity tossed in. And a nun. No. She wasn't nude.It it worth a watch. Sure! Why not!? Just realize it's last in line for entertainment value.",

Rami Malek and Charlie Hunnam put in excellent performances here and share a convincing and touching onscreen chemistry. If you enjoy either actor or perhaps 2015's \"Unbroken\", then you'll probably love this.It feels epic and incredibly cinematic in style. It's amazing to think this was based on a true story and in that sense, it's as inspiring as anything else you'll see this year. There is humour, hardship, difficult-to-watch sequences and edge-of-your-seat tension. It really is a film that has a bit of everything.\"Papillon\" is effective and strong enough to stand alone, separate from the classic McQueen original. If you like true stories, then check this out.

It's desperate. Dark. Ugly. Brutal. Disturbing. Sweaty.\nIt's not a movie you want to watch more than a few times, because it cuts.Comparitively, the remake is almost sexy (with Charlie Hunan's ripped physique), and has a \"day at the beach\" feel to it (despite taking place in one of the most brutal penal colonies in recorded history).\nLook no further than the solitary confinement sequences.\nBarring a few gray hairs, Hunan's \"Papillon\" emerges none the worse for wear. Mentally, not only does he emerge intact, but borderline witty.\nSteve McQueen's \"Papi\" is dragged out ashen, teeth rotting, voice shot, shaken to his core.\nBut don't blame Hunan. He's too pretty for the part. Did anyone buy his performance as \"Jacks\" in \"Sons of Anarchy\"? The tough biker?\nSteve McQueen can out-rugged anybody. By the end, you wonder how his character is still alive-- let alone escaping.The scenery and overall vibe is unconvincing. People who spent time in French New Guinea never looked as good as these fellas.\nIf they were to make a Disney attraction called \"Papillon\", this version of the movie would be the model. It's safe.\nThe original is far too disturbing, and probably a bit much for our \"Baby Boss\" society.\nI guess they will attempt an \"Exorcist\" remake next. Hollywood wouldn't... Would they?",

Moving far more swiftly than the original, the film remains constantly interesting, gripping at times, within an altogether incredible set of circumstances. Hunnan and Malik play their roles well, although accents can be a bit all over the place at times, and the right perceptions and connections can be made of the characters.

There was no sense of time or hardship or the contrast offered by papillon's time with the native Indians. I nearly pissed myself laughing seeing the two guys after a 5 year stretch in solitary confinement looking not a day older or thinner and just perhaps appearing to be having a bad hair day.

Papillion's biography is quite different then either movie, and while also considered largely padded and exaggerated and faked, though not like what Clifford Irving concocted about Howard Hughes, it is,\nparticularly the actual escape and how it was really achieved, grossly Hollywoodized.Midnight Express and the Revenant, especially the latter, are more accurate.

To achieve a shorter runtime, different escape stories were cropped and merged into newer ones. Makeup is also terrible. Papillon looks almost the same after all those years of imprisonment.

However, while this remake is a little flawed, I thought it was an awesome rendition for a modern audience.I haven't see the first one all the way through; I caught a few minutes of it here and there on TV. Either way, this new version is a very well-crafted film, with great visuals, decent performances, heart pounding drama, and a critique of the human condition, sacrifice, friendship, and criminal punishment. Hunnam is not the greatest actor of all time, but I've always enjoyed his performances and style. He is far from the worst of today's overly huge bin of \"stars\".I genuinely felt sadness and remorse during the film, and found myself on the edge of my seat in a few scenes.The only real bad things you could say about this version are: Too little explanation of his life in France, and what happened with his frame-up and trial, and why is the final punishment area of Devil's Island nicer than all the other hellholes he lived through? It is supposed to be the final boss of prisons, yet the guys wander around smoking cigs and gardening, and have access to ropes, cloth, art materials, etc. and never seem to be under guard, locked in cages, starving, or working hard. So, looks like you would rather be on that rock than the other crapfests he was in.Overall, it was exciting and interesting, with a nice epilogue about what happened after all the brutality and adventure. I feel the low ratings and hateful reviews stem from people who will NEVER give a remake a chance, because of their love for McQueen and Hoffman, and I am usually against remakes myself. This one is worth a watch.Also, I believe the \"Goofs\" section to be mistaken. If you listen to what the warden originally said, he tells them that the first escape attempt results in 2 yrs. solitary. The next time will be five. So, if you add that up, you get seven years, plus the rest of the time that can be assumed to have passed while they live in the main prison and work details.

Everything from transportation to ordinary routine gives a feeling of unhuman attitude. The rules of detention are also rough but have some sense.So, in the middle of the ocean in the south American rainforest Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek try to survive and even might think of the grand escape. The evolution of relations is predictable but charming, the ugly truth follows the footsteps of the characters. Remembering the aforementioned praise of prison depiction, I add the performance of Charlie Hunnam and the director's choice that brought us the genius moment of solitary detention that I have never seen before.The whole story keeps you on the edge of your emotions. Without any exaggeration, I can say that I felt imprisoned with the inmates and I was cheering for them to break free from this nightmare at any cost. The ending is amazing and it has blown me up with an incredible gratitude to the director and the cast.Still shaking off the unbelievable feeling that is multiplied by the fact that everything is based on the memoires of a real person I would say that the movie is a jewel that cannot be passed by.Bravo!

But this does not deter Papillon from trying to escape again from the prison Island.Charlie Hunnam and Remi Malek are good in their leading roles. The film is brutal, but also shows the strength of the human spirit.I saw the original Papillon (1973) many years ago. I don't remember the fine detail of the movie, but I remember it was really good. I feel Papillon (2017) does some justice to Papillon (1973). I was pleasantly surprised with Papillon (2017).Both movies were based on Henri \"Papillon\" Charri\u00e8re autobiographies Papillon and Banco.",

First, great acting by both McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The score in the first can stand on its own and it helped you feel the proportion of the epic book.This story is enjoyable, and while it is a good production, I didn't feel as though I was experiencing Papillon's entire journey, which was actually told in 2 books. Honestly, if you want to experience Papillon, you have to watch the first movie. You also need to read Henri Charri\u00e8re's two books. Both Papillon and Banco. They are page turners and you'll understand how difficult it is to portray Papillon's epic tale.This film however, is enjoyable and only people who've seen the earlier movie will understand elements that are referenced and slightly glanced over.Worth watching. Not worth buying. Saving this flick for a rainy day and hopefully it draws you into Papillon's story. Chris Hunnam is good, but homeboy can't carry the film on his own.",

            "content": "Currently this movie is featured on Amazon Prime as possibly an attempt by the filmmakers to get back some of the budget money. It was a limited theatrical release in 2018 possibly because of unfavorable comparisons to the original with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The original plays like a grand, sweeping adventure with a rousing musical score, some unforgettable scenes, and even some dark humor thrown in here and there.This remake? It just plays out as a competent historical action flick with some good acting. Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek portray the Papillon and Louis Dega characters, respectively and portray the right sense of appropriate desperation and dread at the right times. Yet fans of the original will be comparing every scene from this one to the original and wondering what happened to a slew of characters, situations, and scenes from the original.One hint about one of the major differences between this and the original is that the producers focused too much on the relationship between Papillon and Dega in this one, to the point where it almost becomes homoerotic. There certainly wasn't any sense of that between McQueen and Hoffman; in fact some dark humor moments happen when Papillon becomes annoyed at the fey Dega.The other major difference is that there are scenes showing Papillon cavorting about in Paris as a carefree playboy at the beginning, pre-arrest and then at the end after he has successfully made it to the mainland on his coconut bag raft. By the way, it would have been fun to see Papillon triumphantly arrive at freedom on such a flimsy raft.In all, this was a risky remake for this big reason: the long, drawn-out scope of the story taxes the attention span of the current movie-watching generation. Watch it on Prime and see if you agree with me.",

Plus, unlike other remakes that bring a less censored version, the 1974 version pulled no punches when it came to gore and suffering, so there was little to add in that respect.So where was it lacking? For starters, the original had a much more sweaty feel to it-the lighting and cinematography always imparted a sense of decay. Everything seemed to be rotting and falling apart, including the people. That whole feel carries over to the solitary confinement scene, and McQueen's fetid hellhole seems dry and sterile and even Hunnam's reputed weight loss just doesn't convey McQueen's abject suffering.This movie is worth watching, but if you have a choice, go with the original.",

Reluctantly, I decided to watch the beginning, knowing full well I would be offended by this remake and quickly turn it off. I was surprised. It was good and I watched the entire movie. What I loved about the movie, while at the same time could have criticized, is that it was a duplicate of the original. As if from the same movie script. There were moments I thought I was actually watching Steve McQueen as Papillon. As to Louis Dega, I did not see as much Dustin Hoffman. In my eyes Rami Malek brought a certain twist to that character, But both performances were excellent.My favorite scene from the original version was missing from the remake. Which surprised me.

I thought Rami Malek stood out in this film. Charlie Hunnam did a fine job also. The film is based on a true story. It is about friendship, loyalty and hope. Survival and freedom.

None can get close to the standard of McQueen and Hoffman acting in the original film Papillon that grossed over $50m in 1973, whereas this current crap got $10m. The locations was poor compare to the original. Jumping into the calm sea off Devils Island was laughable compare to the original. The beginning and the end scenes was pointless and the original didn't need it and yet was perfectly understood.Why pick Hunnan when he can't act? Seriously he was the same in Son Of Anarchy and his irritating facial impression that made his unwatchable. He has no other ways of acting and is very one-dimensional. Malek is an average actor but the wrong choice for Delga. His shape of face and eyes are irritating to watch.Why bother with remakes as every remakes are always worse than the original. The filming industry in the last 10ish years have run out of ideas and have been producing rubbish film. One or two per year gets my money, the rest gets zilch.",

I really don't like remakes but this was very well made. Charlie Hunhams best performance, really starting to establish himself now after the lost city of Z or whatever. I knew Remi Malek would be a Star the moment I saw him in the pacific (hbo) in 2010, and he somehow managed to recreate Hoffman's performance in his own way. I loved this film. I'm not just a movie buff either. I'm from the Kansas City Art Institute's film department and I know a good one when I see it lol. Just watch this. Trust me. If you like those shocking prison type movies then this is it. Starred Up is great, too. Check that out. Bronson's not as good as people say. But it's good. Starred Up though, check that out. That term is British and it's when a minor gets moved to the adult prison because they're too violent. It's Jack O'Connells best role, and his dad's in prison with him so it's pretty crazy.",

Where is the key fight from the Caen Central prison, where he became friends with Joulot-the hammer guy,where is Galgani asking Papillon's help before islands departure, etc, etc, etc. On the islands, Santini was a convict, not a prison guard and the scene with the prison officer it's totally out of the context, because it does not exist in the book.

They were both jailed and sent to the prison at the same time. These two personalities were nearly opposite and began their relationship with issues mostly of cultural differences. Over time a friendship began, and with that came trust and a bond of two men most do not see in today's world.Ultimately, though difficult mental and physical hardships, they discover who they are in the world. One stays behind and the other continues to seek freedom. This I feel is the message that people need to find themselves and the purpose of their lives to discover personal happiness.",

I wonder if the film makers even bothered to read the book.All in all, I was very disappointed with this offering. I wasn't entirely surprised (when I read that Charlie Hunnam was to play papillon, I knew it couldn't possibly be much good), but I was still disappointed. A small part of me hoped that a new working of a book I love would tick all the right boxes. Instead, I'm left wondering, what was the point?",

This remake has rewarding elements that will gratify the old movie goer. It is worthwhile to give it the time and open mind needed to separate the coarse edged original from this modern polished remake.My primary complaint is about the filming location. No matter how hard they tried, the Med does not in anyway give the sense of the hellish heat and humidity of the Guianas. This is especially true in the final scene where the desired relentless pounding of the Atlantic looked like a calm sunny day in the Mediterranean...which it was.Watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is...a modern remake of a classic.",

The ability to move between different personalities of both Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek was incredible.Henri started out as a character that looked above, without a care for anyone else except his goals. Louis Dega (Rami Malek) started out as a weasel, who needed protection and looked down, but spoke his mind regrettably. Halfway through the show, both character began to cross each other's personalities, but it was much deeper than that.They began to find out who they really are, deep down, and they needed each other to realize this. At the end of the show, Henri became more like Louis and vice versa.Regardless of whether there were flaws that didn't relate to the original book and story, this movie is underrated due to the performance of both leading actors.These are the types of movies i continue to search through, because even if it is not 100% accurate, it's the actors ability to make the movie better than what it was supposed to be. It's the actors ability to become more like the character.",

Watch him as if you did not have watch the first movie.If I did not watched at this movie I would not even know that there is one in 1973. I think the remakes are good for new generations.I do not like people who say that the classic must remain a classic. If this is not the new movie, many would not know about the old. Anyway, what would it be if those people watching the 1973 movie dies and later film dies with them because the new generations did not know about the classics?JUST WATCH IT! IT'S GREAT!",
