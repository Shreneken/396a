            "content": "While watching Badhaai Ho I was remembering a dialogue - \"Family is above everything\" from the film 'Coco'. Badhai Ho is definitely a film that makes you love of your family sometimes more.Nakul's (Ayushmaan Kuranna) family resembles a perfect happy Punjabi family until the tragedy happens when Nakul's mother (Neena Gupta) get pregnant on her late 50s. For sure Nakul, his brother and his his grandma everyone started blaming her and his husband (Gajraj Rao) for being careless. And this story spread like flame and they all started feeling exhausting on the society.Now It's reflect a story that's really unique and anyone will want to know what's gonna happen next. The next situations are quite realistic and perfectly organised. Every scene is so funny and hilarious that makes you sit through the film. And the film has a kind of humor that can makes anyone laugh.Amit Sharma comes with this amazing story and he is successful to reach India's heart, anyone can fall in love with his work. When talking about the acting Gajraj Rao did a great a job and everyone else in this film is amazing, Ayushman Khurrana getting to an unique place on Bollywood day by day. The screenplay written by Jyoti Kapoor and several others is great. The background score sometimes makes the film melodramatic but that's not a question at all because the drama never gets too much because of the beautiful cinematography(Best of 2018 after 'October) by Sanu Varghese.Overall it's a 2nd amusement in 1 month by one and only Ayushmaan Khurrana that is completely watchable and anyone can say \"Let's make this kind of films more\"",

            "content": "The movie is the proof of the current encouraging trend in Indian cinema which is coming up with lots of original concepts. Indian movies have started regaining their old charm by keeping the stories and characters real and relatable. This movie is one of them. Some of the points which makes the movie special are.....One - Conceiving a child in middle age, considered a taboo in indian middle class and the writer, director duo depicted this in a satirical way with lot of lmao moments. Two - Gajraj Rao and Surekha Sikri were exceptional and over shadowed Neena Gupta and Ayushman. I watched the movie yesterday and still laughing out loud by remembering the dialogues of Surekha Sikri. It's proven that Ayushman is best suited for boy next door characters and he has managed the emotions with humour so well. It's really nice to see Neena Gupta after long and she has a done remarkable job with controlled emotions. Gajraj Rao has always been a good actor but recent directors are getting best out of him by showing more faith and giving more screen space. Lastly Sanya Malhotra has justified her role and she looked stunning. Last but least, it's definitely a laugh riot.",

            "review_title": "Long Review: Badhaai Ho (7 Stars)",
            "content": "If I said that Bollywood has played it right for most of the part in 2018 then you wouldn't disagree with me. There are at least a dozen examples in recent times where Bollywood has shed its usual formula of masala and cheesy romance and turned to narrative storytelling about social issues. All of which has reignited my faith in Bollywood, and thanks to director Amit Sharma, Badhaai Ho can be added to that list of films which helped in that feat. It is a perfect example of an entertaining family drama with one major conflict that is as novel as the storytelling itself.The masterful Gajraj Rao and the queen of nuances Neena Gupta are the heads of a Delhiite family - the Kaushiks - who bear the embarrassment of being preggers at an the age when others prefer (or rather give in to the society-accepted job) to play with their grandchildren (which Surekha Sikri tries to do in the film as the paternal grandmother). How cultural stigmatization of being pregnant well over the age of fifty when you have two boys themselves active enough to bear child acts as a source of ridicule and contempt is shown in a visibly light but loud manner in Badhaai Ho. Gupta's character struggles from start to end, even receiving a \"do you really want to?\" from her own husband, which prepares you for the ulterior question of pro-choice that is in the mind of others who put tradition and cultural indifference on the top. Ayushmann Khurrana plays one of her sons - an adult working-class man - who finds himself in a situation that usually demands happiness but which instead has created some distance between him and her, especially from the eyes of his girlfriend (Sanya Malhotra) and her mother (Sheeba Chaddha). Badhaai Ho is not a celebration of a birth but instead a narration of how the world perceives a product of love when it shifts from the routine or expected.The almost pedantic attention to details in Badhaai Ho appeals to my OCD and it also tells me that director Sharma does not believe in cinematic liberty. The entire film has been carved with honesty and by giving due reverence to reality. Why else would a character make a silly act of pointing out the missing apostrophe in the word \"Kaushiks\" that has been inscribed on the backside of their red Wagon R with a typeface that will make a designer quit his field? It may not be a big deal for the casual cinema-goer but it does show where the makers are coming from. This type of attention to tiny details - whether it is in the selection of the soundtrack or the usage of the score as a cue to the audience to rejoice in laughter - is what makes Badhaai Ho an even better family entertainer. However, what sets the film apart from other recent family comedies is that every character is idiosyncratic - from their family doctor who reminds you of that overweight physician your family used to consult in the 1990s to the kin characters who also remind you of people you know in real life. They all have their own flavorful characteristics which not only makes the film a fun to watch but also makes you wanting more from director Sharma. Despite his last one being the noisy thriller, Tevar (2015), with Arjun Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha.As I have noted above, Badhaai Ho has an excellent suggestive score (Abhishek Arora and Tanishk Bagchi) that acts as a cue for you to take note of the particular scene. And such cues come and go every five minutes. The titular song is catchy and funny, which although is too loud for me, reminds me that I am watching a Bollywood movie. Special appreciation to editor Dev Rao Jadhav who concocts a complex carving so that the viewing becomes interesting. I am amazed at the sound mixing as well, which made me sit back and marvel at the amount of efforts put in the film in the editing room. The anti-climactic narrative may put some of you off, but it is what makes Badhaai Ho enjoyable and different.Sanya Malhotra is the only cast member who seemed out of place in the whole film. Others blend in like actual members of a Delhi housing colony, with a special visible connection between the actors who play the family. Malhotra is good-looking and adds brightness to the scene she is in, but her facial expressions make me want to direct her to a film school. Gupta and Rao are the highlight performances of the film, and maybe even the year. You cannot find anyone else to play the kind of a miser and innocent father that Rao plays in Badhaai Ho that you want to go and hug him if you ever meet him in person. Helping him put up a show is Gupta, who is phenomenal in her star character. (I even wonder what prevented casting directors from hiring her all these years when she was out looking for a job.) Together, their performances overshadow that of the rest of the cast, including Khurrana's, who I think has reached the typecast saturation. There is even this discussion that happens on Reddit where people claim that Khurrana plays the same character - ordinary young man from Delhi or UP - in all the films. I tend to agree, after watching Badhaai Ho and Andhadhun almost within two weeks.If you thought Sharat Katariya was the only master household storyteller (who directed Sui Dhaaga this year) then think again. In Badhaai Ho, director Sharma crafts comedy out of thin air; out of routine familial conversations, which is so sweet to watch that it melts in your mouth like the caramel popcorn you prefer while watching such comedy dramas. There is no shortage of such palpable moments in this honest drama that you will complete watching it with a big smile on your face. But, when you go in to watch Badhaai Ho this week, don't go in to be outsmarted by a relevant story, but instead go in to get your mind blown with a crispy drama that will make you laugh and cry - in a way that Bollywood hasn't been able to in a lot of years.

            "content": "What a year is 2018 for Bollywood! The content based films are recognized and appreciated by larger mumber of audience. This year is wonderful for Ayushmann Khurrana, as his two films (Both released in October itself) are getting great reviews and B.O. collection. Though, Andhadhun came on 5th October, it is unusual that these two Ayushamann starrer films are competing each other, as no other film is as good as these two.Badhaai Ho is the film whose trailer raised the bar and everyone was expecting it to be a Hit. Film shows exactly what its trailer offers. Though, audience is very happy with this comedy drama. Story is fantastic and very unique. Ayushmann (Nakul)'s mother got pregnant (played by Neena Gupta), and this is not the normal thing. Neither for Ayush and his brother, nor for his grandmother, nor for his girlfriend and her mother, & nor for the society! Film deals with this issue in an organic way possible, and gives out best example that whatever happens, you need your family and family needs your support.Sanya Malhotra looks so pretty! It's her 3rd film after Dangal and Patakha, and I love her in every film. Gajraj Rao plays the father of Nakul with such an ease. This film will get him the recognition he deserves. Neena Gupta plays her part brilliantly. The pair looks so perfect with each other. Best one is Daadi-Sa, Surekha Sikri. She is too good. Her dialogues in the second half will make you cry. I heard many saying they cried in the second half. And I guess it's because of her. Sheeba Chaddha is also good as Sanya's mother.Film delivers the perfect humour which this kind of film requires. Some scenes are beautifully taken without any dialogues, but just with expressions. There are many moments when you will laugh out loud. Although, the love-story portion in the second half could have been more filmy and entertaining. It is there as a simple and good-going story. Though, it definitely is not boring from any point of time. For this, writers deserve applause, which are Akshat Ghildial, Jyoti Kapoor and Shantanu Srivastava.Amit Sharma is the director of this film. It is his debut film. He looks promising. It will surely going to be a hit. And hence, hoping for more good work from him in his upcoming works.This film is having the best suitable background score which a comedy film is supposed to have. There are not much songs. The title track is funny. 'Maari thi Missed call, lekin ho gaya Answer hi!' There is one super romantic track as well. And how can I forget the lullaby in the climax, where the film ends with the sweetest way possible!Go and watch this film with your family. It is not a taboo topic which can't be seen with your parents. Try out and be modern like an educated man/woman should have to. And, oh, yes, I forget to mention about Ayushmann's performance... Well, I think since his first film he is doing his job great! So, Bollywood ko Ayushmann ki Badhaai Ho.",

            "content": "For every person, parents are like god to them. We idolize them, worship them and respect them. However, situation comes when you realize that they have committed something which brings embarrassment to the society, especially if you are surrounded by relatives and friends in the social circle. How will you deal with it ? Will you stand by them or just leave them ?Badhaai Ho talks about the situation when Nakul (Ayushmann Khurrana) suffers the calamity fallen upon him when he finds out that his mother (Neena Gupta) is pregnant.From the director of Tevar, Amit Ravindernath Sharma brings a bold subject to the Indian cinema for the first time. It is a very sensitive subject which if not treated well might fire back. Amit Ravindernath Sharma does well in handling the subject with maturity infusing the comedy scene in the first half which will make you laugh-aloud with emotions in the second half and comes out well as a winner. There is a scene when Surekha Sikri realizes about her daughter-in-law's pregnancy and the way she speaks and curses her will bring down the down the house. She is absolutely wonderful in her non-stop verbal spat that she keeps on talking to herself even after Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta leaves the house. There are so many instances like this that will make you feel good without creating boredom through out this 2 hours 4 minutes journey. Kudos to the Amit Ravindernath Sharma and the writers of Badhaai Ho for doing a fabulous job.On the flip side, Badhaai Ho do loses the focus slightly in the second half when it shifts the story to Nakul and Renee (Sanya Malhotra) but is too little to worry about. Music is just about okay. Cinematography and art direction is simple but the background is smooth. Dialogues are outstanding especially the ones spoken by Surekha Sikri. Performance wise, it is the senior actors who have stolen the thunder. Badhaai Ho belongs to the trio - Surekha Sikri, Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta. Even though, the film has Ayushmann Khurrana as the lead but the combination of these actors is a treat to watch. They get engrossed into their characters with so much ease that they will make you believe that they are actual characters in real life. Ayushmann Khurrana does well but will remind of same role played by him in Vicky Donor. Sanya Malhotra brings charm to her role as Renee.Overall, Badhaai Ho is a unqiue piece of art that should not be missed. Go for it 3.5 /5",

For those people who think the Khans are ones who can make movies hits, they should watch out for Ayushmann Khurrana. The guy is very natural in his performance. But despite him being the protagonist of this movie, I feel the story is mainly about Neena Gupta's character. It is her character that faces a tough situation in life and decides to go through it anyway. Ayushmann Khurrana and the other characters are people who react on that situation. Hence I feel they are more like supporting characters.The film shows how the society reacts to yet another taboo situation that is very unusual: parents having a baby again. The characters of Ayushmann Khurrana and Gajraj Rao are symbolic of the typical Middle Class people who are against it. The character of Sheeba Chadda (Renee's mother) is symbolic of the society itself that judges any person it wants to.On the Writing & Direction part, I can't believe these are the same people who made Tevar. Tevar was a movie copied from the South while this feels more like an Original Story. Guess they have realised that proper observation and imagination can give really good stories.On an ending note, I'm beginning to really like each and every movie that Ayushmann Khurrana is coming up with. All of his movies are getting a rating of more than 7 or 8 in this website and I hope this continues.",

            "content": "Badhaai Ho has sitcom recipe written all over it. It has some finely constructed humor, moments of emotional outburst, and not to forget, a 'happy' ending. The film is about a Delhi-based middle-class family with its set of isms. The concept that it tackles (of 'late pregnancy') is one that hasn't been explored in Indian cinema quite a lot. I really enjoyed the director's eye for the little details like the sticker (in an atrocious font) on the back of their car that says 'Kaushiks' (with an apostrophe missing), the house in which they stay (the grandmom's bed is bang opposite the television), and more along those lines.The humor is simple, situational, and mostly relatable in the first half. The mom of the house (who is nearing her 60s) is unexpectedly expecting and the whole family somehow has to accustom themselves to this fact. What makes this unusual scenario work on screen are the terrific performances of the older couple (played by Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao), the grandmother (Surekha Sikri), and to an extent the sons (Ayushman Khurrana and Shardul Rana).The warm, affectionate relationship shared between the dad and mom of the house is what makes the first half of Badhaai Ho an engaging affair. Khurrana's scenes are pretty fine too (the romance track between him and Sanya Malhotra thankfully isn't a cheesefest), but the comic timing of the seniors often outdo the rest. The dialogues have been written well and ensure sufficient laugh-out-loud moments.However, the second half isn't without its share of flaws. The film, all of a sudden, turns into a collection of moments: the sons choosing not to accompany their parents to a family wedding, the younger son getting into an altercation at school and the older one coming to his rescue, the ugly spat between boyfriend and girlfriend and the eventual reconciliation, and the grandmom coming to the aid of the pregnant daughter-in-law while she gets shamed, and plenty more. The film loses its focus a wee bit here and tries to rely too much on cinematics. The songs do not help in making the proceedings appear less dramatic either.'Badhaai Ho' needs to be applauded for placing a fair bit of emphasis on the characters of Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao (who can easily have a whole movie to themselves) in the initial half even though their issues sort of recede into the background in the latter half. The angle between Nakul (Khurrana) and Renee's mother also seemed rather pointless. Would I recommend the movie to a friend/peer? Yes, for the fantastic performances of the senior Kaushiks.",

            "content": "Films like Badhaai Ho make me lament that such films didn't come out before in India. The film is so culturally rich and enlightening it's just wonderful. Like with most films of its sort off late, the film is set in a most realistic backdrop of lower-middle-class families which show the beauty of today's India. The film's story is indeed a unique cultural insight into how late pregnancy is approached by this milieu. I was all set up for a highly humorous comedy and was a little concerned that it's turn into a comedy of errors or something of the sort. Thankfully, despite all the wonderful humour he infused it with, the director Amit Ravindrenath Sharma took the film and the subject seriously enough to deal with the social stigma attached to middle-aged pregnancy and turn this film into a moving, emotional drama, with a strong social message. While I thought the second half wouldn't be as good as the first, it exceeded all my expectations to go from strength to strength. I believe non-Indians, particularly people of western societies, would not so easily understand the social context of this film, and why such a big deal would be made about it. It takes great perspective to be able to grasp the sensibilities depicted in the film, but those willing to not get too judgmental will love it.And every viewer is likely to find it very easy to fall in love with this film. As said above, the cultural insight, the realistic setting, the positive and gracious tone of the proceedings, all make for cinematic treat. The casting is fantastic. Ayushmann Khurrana, doing his usual bit of positive social activism through cinema, is as reliable as ever, but the show belongs to the senior generations of players. Neena Gupta, a familiar character actress, gets a tremendous opportunity to lead a film with this wonderfully challenging role, and she is breathtaking in a beautifully understated performance. In the role of her husband, Gajraj Rao is excellent. Sanya Malhotra does exceedingly well. It almost goes without saying, however, that it is the legendary Surekha Sikri who gets the best lines and moments and, in turn, gives the film its winning combination of comedy and emotion. She is phenomenally real, and she is also responsible for the film's best scene, where she acknowledges her daughter-in-law's devotion in a way that is no less than stirring and emotionally overwhelming, encapsulating the core message of this story and reminding us all of the divine duty of honouring our parents and elders. Badhaai Ho has lesser moments too, but at its best, it's just brilliant entertainment.",

Music: Music is good. My favorite track is 'Badhaaiyan Tenu'. Acting: Acting stands justified as well.Final Verdict: It is worth your penny, do watch it on big screen, you will love it. It is an epic family entertainer that puts light on worth of a family.",

            "content": "Badhaai Ho', much like its subject, puts a fantastic new spin on the usual.\nThe comedy and icing of emotions engage you thoroughly.Story revolves around the life of a typical middle-class family in Delhi where an old grandmother lives with her obedient son Gajraj Rao, dutiful daughter-in-law Neena Gupta and two grandsons, Ayushmann being the elder one. Their lives turn topsy-turvy when Neena Gupta becomes pregnant at a relatively old age bringing embarrassment and uncomfortable moments for other family members.Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao and Surekha Sikri steal the show. No word is enough for their scintillating act.\nAyushman Khurana and Sanya Malhotra form a good pair.A Notable touching scene in movie is, how in the guise of geriatric behaviour, SurekhaSikri blurts out some home truths and defends her daughter-in-law, when in other circumstances she would be constantly bickering with her.Overall it's a simple story and at time simplicity works beautifully.",

            "content": "The day the trailer for this movie landed I was so eagerly waiting to watch this on the big screen as the premise seemed so hilarious and original. And I wasn't disappointed a bit.\nThe film has a very basic and simple plot. A couple in their 50's who have 2 children, get pregnant. The social stigma and embarrassment that comes from the society and their own family forms the crux of the story. The film is brutally honest and simple in it's approach and never goes overboard into preaching on what a society or family should be like. They don't lay down golden rules or have big speeches.\nThe hero of the film is it's brilliant script, hat's off to the writers (Shantanu, Akshat, Jyoti). Amit who directs the film treats the film and subject with a meticulous approach. The depiction of a typical middle class 'Delhi' vali family is so on point without going into stereotyping. Running into just a shade over 120 minutes, the movie never bores you because comic situations continue to arrive in every scene. The movie is a laughter riot and the emotional scenes gave me goosebumps and teared me up a bit.\nWhile the script is the hero of the film, the heroine of the film has to be the excellent bunch of actors. Meet the KAUSHIKS( You have to ask the little brother why it's KAUSHIKS and not KAUSHIK'S). Jeetu(Gajraj Rao), Priyamvada (Neena Gupta) play the pregnant couple. Dadi( Surekha Sikri) plays Jeetu's old mother. Nakul (Ayushmann) and Gullar (Shardul) play the sons. Everyone is mind blowing throughout, their expressions are so on point. Gajraj, Neena and Surekha jee steal the show with their brilliant portrayals. They seemed to be living the characters. Ayushmann is on a role, back to back brilliant movies and acting.Badhaai ho is a brilliant comic caper that just cannot be missed. It's heavily entertaining and you will fall down laughing. The delicate issue of pregnancy in the late 50's and societal stigma that comes with it has been brilliantly handled and portrayed.",

The older son works in the telecommunications industry and is romantically involved with a co-worker. The younger son is still in school. Grandma lives in the apartment and belittles the mother every chance she gets. And the mother is a housewife who is not feeling too well. She goes to the medical clinic and discovers she is expecting, at an age when they were looking forward to saving some money and retiring, they have to consider abortion.... and she's refusing.It's not a new theme. There's a good movie version of the Broadway show NEVER TOO LATE and, indeed, the two movies share a lot of the same concerns and even the same jokes. That's hardly surprising, given that some aspects of human life haven't changed much in ten thousand years. Yet every place and age differs, so we are left with the question of whether this movie deals with anything new or in a new manner. Given current Indian governmental pushing towards smaller families, as well as the concurrence of 'the best people' (whoever they may be), yes it does.",

            "content": "Badhaai Ho is a film directed by Amit Ravindernath Sharma. The trailers of the film had made me interested and I was looking forward for this venture. Finally, I can say the waiting of two weeks were successful.Plot: Nakul and his family receive the shock of their lives when they find out that Nakul's mother is pregnant.Story and direction: From the concept itself I was looking forward to this film as it sounded very interesting and unique. The makers of this film could have gone many ways of showing this film. But I can say from seeing this film that the way they went was absolutely correct. Amit Sharma (who also directed the not so famous 2015 film TEVAR) has shown the film in the most correct way. Even while watching the film I was thinking the very same things that these characters were. The mindset of people regarding an issue like this is very apt and shown with utmost sincerity. The comedy and the drama are so well balanced in this film. In addition to Amit, I would like to thank the writing team (Akshat Ghildial and Shantanu Srivastava) for bringing such a wonderful script. Each and every scene and dialogue were just wonderful. The transition of Nakul's character from rejecting his parents' behaviour to finally coming terms to it and supporting them to the fullest has been beautifully shown. Also, shown very nicely is that family is the most important thing in anybody's life. Also shown quite nicely is the family members standing against other people when taunts are being passed on their condition. Also, I quite loved the way the makers portrayed Delhi and Haryanvis. I really don't know how to fault this film since I felt that the film was perfect in every way.Performances: The film is filled with mind-blowing performances. Ayushmann Khurrana (fresh from his successful ANDHADHUN) once again delivers a great performance. He is seen in varying shades as an actor. Sanya Malhotra was also good considering what the writers had mapped her character as. Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta were the most adorable parents anyone can ever have. Surekha Sikri is the grandmother that any kind of household has. And finally, Sheeba Chadha was great as Renee's mother.Music: With a film like this the music has to be spot on as the music has to be in sync with what the scene is trying to convey. There are only four songs and all of them are good. They gel in with the situation shown in the film. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the Ayushmann Khurrana crooned 'Nain Na Jodeen'. The background music of the film is great and shows the director loves old music as we hear some old hits in the background.Favorite Scene: With a film this good, it is kind of difficult to pick the best one. But the one I would pick is where Nakul decides to confront the students who hit his brother Gullar. I liked the way Nakul motivates his brother to teach those people a lesson. I really could connect with the scene as I felt the need of someone like Nakul in my school life.Verdict: Packed with punchy dialogues, a great story, amazing performances and a beautiful message, Badhaai Ho is a complete entertainment package. Never for a moment I felt disinterested in a film. It is a film to watch with the entire family. I am sure you won't be disappointed.Going with a perfect 10.",

Her sons sulk till the specific moment they decide it's all okay and go rah-rah-maa with a \"baby shower\". The mother-in-law (Surekha Sikri) is such an archetype tyrant you know later they're going to give her a speech in which she defends the bahu against a sneering samaj (which makes you want to slap her for not covering the DIL's back earlier when her own grandsons turned theirs). Ayushmann Khurana plays one of the confused sons from his comfort zone, while Sanya Malhotra as his girlfriend is written as a walking cliche of contemporary liberal youth whose every glance and utterance is as meticulously designed as her couture and coiffure.But, and I won't blame you if you sniff at me and snatch away my cinephile card, I was hooked. It was mainly the performances that worked. Neena and Gajraj Singh look the part of a long-time middle-class couple and their interaction has a warmth that overcomes cliche (plus, she looks so lovely in those dilli-wale sweaters). And yes, I was blubbering into my hankie when cranky gran put down her khandaan for cocking their noses up at her sanskaari paanv-bhari bahu.",

Ayushmann Khurrana, Gajraj Rao and Late Sureka Sikri also deserves an applause for the perfect acting but for me it was Shardul Rana who deserves a special appreciation for making his presence felt in the middle of power houses of acting.Screenplay of the film was superb and will keep you engaged. The film looked very original an fresh and the dialect of western UP used in the film also looked very original and this originality is probably the strongest point of the film.

            "content": "'Badhaai Ho', much like its subject, puts a fantastic new spin on the usual. In a new-age rom-com, you'd expect Ayushmann and Sanya's love story to take centre stage, but when you see the middle-aged parents blush with romance, the entertainment really becomes novel.You don't expect actors playing 'Mom and Dad' to have as much screen space as the young leads of the film, but the director Amit Ravindernath Sharma actually puts the spotlight on senior actors Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta. Their romantic moments are the veritable highlight. Same goes for their performances, too. Neena Gupta is excellent in her portrayal of the unsettled mother. Gajraj Rao's performance is the best thing about 'Badhaai Ho'. In fact, he steals every scene that he's a part of. Just his body language, mannerisms and expressions are enough to make you laugh out loud. Not to be overshadowed, Ayushmann, too, is in top-form, playing the son who feels the brunt of the social pressure. So much so, that his relationship with his girlfriend, Reene (Sanya Malhotra) gets affected, too. Surekha Sikri, who plays the dadi, deserves a special mention. She's old-fashioned for various reasons, but when it comes to taking up for her bahu with a baby bump, she unabashedly tells the rest of the family that it's admirable for couples to be in love and have \"sexy\" (meaning sex) at this age. Sanya Malhotra, who plays the girl with modern outlook, breezes through her role.The screenplay by Akshat Ghildial (who is also the dialogue writer) is shorn of clich\u00e9s - an attribute that lends the film a veneer of freshness. It lasts all the way until the very end and helps it tide over the more difficult elements in the plot. With the actors on song, Badhaai Ho has a smooth, even feel that makes it an easy watch.This is a family drama with a difference whose appeal stems from the confident and steady manner in which it unfolds. Badhaai Ho is relatable despite the fact that it deals with a situation that isn't all that common, in real life or in cinema. Sharma knows his craft and demonstrates an acute sense of proportion, especially when he is dealing with the dramatic moments that spur the tale forward.The concept of 'Badhaai Ho', where a quintessential Delhi couple; parents to two adult boys (one of them is of marriageable age), get pregnant out of the blue, is just the sort of subject that can ruffle-up feathers within the middle-class family system. Yet, this dramedy, based on children feeling terribly embarrassed by the outcome of their parents' mid-age romance; with outsiders joining in the criticism, conveys some really progressive thoughts. The situational humour of 'Badhaai Ho' is complimented perfectly, by striking performances from Gajraj Rao, Neena Gupta and Ayushmann Khurrana. This film is as funny as it is liberal. The conversation around the fact that romance and passion have nothing to do with age, make this film a stand out for many reasons.The film engages thoroughly, while still making a social statement. Even though the story has a limited scope, the detailed writing, the finesse of Sharma's direction and some unforgettable performances, make this film an absolute winner.",

So refreshing to see movies are being made on subject we rarely talk in our society.This is Ayushman Khurana's fiilm but the strongest point of the film or you can call the pillar of the film are Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta. Both of them have excelled in the movie.Gajraj Rao as the head of a pure Delhi family is so relatable. His behaviour, accnet, everything is relatable. Infact in the movie every character is pure Delhiite. Whether it is Ayushman Khurana's character or Neena Gupta's character as a mother, ot Sanya Malhotra as a upscale modern girl. There is Delhi in every frame of the movie. If you are from the city, you will quite relate with the film.Such an impactful story and message have been delivered so subtly. Ayushman Khurana's mother Neena Gupta got pregnant and the whole family reacted very strongly with the news. The movie is all about how each one of them handles with the subject. With the message, the film also delivers a perfect humour and at no point the film seems vulgar. This is a perfect family entertainer.",

            "content": "What happens when a middle class boy of marriageable age finds that his parents are expecting a baby..? The movie chronicles the ordeals of Kaushiks - a twenty something Nakul (Ayshmann Khurrana) working in a private company, his school going brother Gullar who find it hard to face their friends, taking cheap pleasure at their discomfiture even as their parents - Jeetendra aka Jeetu (Gajraj Rao) and Priyamvada aka Babli (Neena Gupta) - at the centre of this pickle, brace to face their sons, and their dreaded dadi (Surekha Sikri) as well as the sundry near and dears who jump to judge them with righteous contempt.\nThe casting choices are apt to say the least. Neena Gupta is a picture of grace with her winning screen presence and is excellent as Priyamvada. She effortlessly wins our heart as a loving mother and wife, a caring daughter in law and shines through the gamut of emotions without breaking a sweat and is capable of conveying with just a silent gaze or glare. It is indeed a travesty of Bollywood that we do not see more of her in our movies. Gajraj Rao shares a natural chemistry with Neena Gupta and is in fine form as the romantic husband, closet poet and a father who is finding it hard to explain a sticky situation to his children and mom. Surekha Sikri is a hoot as the feisty grandma and cracks you up in several sequences. Ayushmann Khurrana brings out the multiple shades of his character Nakul - be it romance, anger, confusion, embarrassment, vulnerability - in a remarkable performance. Sanya Malhotra and Sheeba Chaddha try their best in parts that are comparatively underwritten and appear tacky in comparison to the main characters.This is a neat comedy drama that keeps a fine balance on a subject that could easily have slipped into a slippery mess of being too crass or a caricature or worse, a sappy melodrama. But, debutante director Amit Ravindernath Sharma and his team of writers steer this film skillfully - for the most part - with sprightly humour and some sentiments that tug at your heart. His fine sense of balance is also evident in the narrative which provides optimal scope of every member of the cast, (especially Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao who are the parents) - just as every member of a family come together to make it work.Overall, it is a quirky yet rooted comedy drama with a crisp runtime of little over two hours (could've been a tad shorter though) elevated by superlative performances by Neena Gupta, Gajraj Rao, Surekha Sikri and some fine writing.",

The director deals with the theme with finesse, putting in measured doses of comedy and drama to make it a truly mass entertainer for the Indian audience. Movies with such content depend highly on the acting and direction part to get them going, and this one just didn't pull through but brought the house down in laughter as well as gave lumpy throats in various scenes. It is hard to pinpoint any one performance at the cost of being unfair to others, but Gajraj Rao's (the father) mute expressions and initial unease while disclosing the news to his family and the discomfort while peers congratulating him, do show semblances with one Rowan Atkinson of Mr Bean fame; deliberate or not, it surely entertains.\nSurekha Sikri, whenever appears, the audience is already half smiling apprehending another good laugh, and Neena Gupta is as good as she has ever been acting-wise. Sheeba Chaddha as the girl's mother was perfectly cast and Sanya Malhotra, known as the Dangal younger sister, did well in whatever part she got and looked lovely with that hairstyle. Ayushmann's Delhi accent was too good for a Bong like me to pick, his back-to-back hits now following Andhadhun surely puts him at the top now. The director too smartly outwits the audience with the two sequences following the rehearsing scene in front of the mirror. The film also brings back memories of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee movies of late 70s and early 80s, which had a similar dramedy flavour to them. Overall, an assured good time watching it, with a positive social message too. Thumbs up to it, no hesitation in giving a 7/10...",

Middle class family(couple) with well grown son past teenage age having an unplanned pregnancy which leads to embarrassing situation something which is quite uncalled for. Film handles the plight of the family and how they tackles it ending with delightful climax. Film is very light hearted and it has some witty dialogues too although it can get vulgar sometimes. Direction was pretty good and pacing throughout was consistently good. All actors have done their job perfectly however there was one Naani, who was owning everyone whenever she opens her mouth. Even at this age her energy was on par with many others. Some songs were good and others average. Best thing about the film is that it never preaches you not even for once. This is one film that you find yourself watching it whenever it telecast on television. Watch it! I assure you won't hate or regret watching it.",

Badhaai Ho belonged to the middle class Delhi's Lodhi colony out and about! Various sections of our country are acclimatised to different tunes of orthodoxies and perplexities and the movie just fits the Delhi setting.A social message told in this dramedy with situational humor is where the story excels in. That and letting your character actors (instead of leading actors) take centerstage in a film adds to your entertainment value.A 50+ couple accidentally end up getting pregnant, much to the chagrin of their 2 sons and extended family, causing turbulence in the family and relationships. Middle Class in India welcome kin and babies with full gusto, however still shy away from discussing sex. This film is as funny as it is liberal. The conversation around the fact that romance and passion have nothing to do with age, make this film a stand out for many reasons.Gajrao Rao is the man you need to see in this movie. With his finely tuned performance, aced with funny mannerisms and slight shifts in expressions he robs everyone else of their equally erudite performances. Next in line is veteran actress Surekha Sikhri who eats into the role and delivers an organic performance of a unyielding but liberal grandmother. There couldn't have been a better role written for Neena Gupta and she gets it perfect. Ayushman Khurana is such a terrific actor today, he has attempted so many Delhi based roles yet he outshines in again as a Delhi boy with a Delhi accent that you haven't seen before. Sanya Malhotra looks dainty and breezes through her role.The writing takes the credit for the movie and so does the dialogues. Background music doesn't overdo itself and doesn't force you to laugh in the comic scenes. The songs, especially the climax one is the one to tap your legs on. Direction couldn't have gone wrong with such a virtuous package and Amit Sharma packed it neatly. You know how the film will progress much early in the film and hence there is hardly any story left to be told after the 1st 30 minutes.Middle-class families are often riddled with their own set of values and social systems and it was endearing to see us getting progressive day by day. A must watch for all families!",

Its such a weird feeling to do both laughing and crying and there are two scenes where I did that. Poker- faced grandma was involved both times. Her indian acerbic humour is familiar to everyone. The scripting for her was next level -such a sharp wit and looked remarkably like my own sharp witted grandma. I love that a character and like even she can have growth in this move.This is definitely modern bolly cinema tackling unusual topics as Padman and Hindi medium did. The catalyst for all the drama comes from mum who's maybe in her 50s deciding not to abort her baby in an unplanned pregnancy. And boy does she get a lot of stick for it. Everyones prejudices against having the baby is a good starting point for each and every character in the film to have some growth. And for relationships to improve in ways that everyone can learn lessons from ; mother daughter in law relations, Husband and wife trust, relationships between brothers. And generally how we should just be grateful when our parent show us that love and intimacy should still happen for our parents into their old age. we should be grateful if it does right?rather that than a lifetime of avoiding calling your spouse by their first name or looking him in the eye for shame. .Its a conservative family learning to surrender to their circumstances. The scene when the baby is born is just well paced choreographed and one of the most touching I have seen in years.Im going to show this to my dad and my 11yr old daughter for both of their cultural enrichment nights.",

I cannot emphasize enough on how well thought-out and well executed this movie is. Ideas are very important, but implementation is equally important, if not more. Every emotion, every thought, every idea has been depicted so beautifully in this movie, it is commendable. With simplicity and humor, they showed how the society can control your life as much as you let it. I feel like Ayushmann is slowly repositioning the image of a common man in our minds. This guy is something else! Kudos to the whole team, and especially to Ayushmann for always compelling us to believe how exceptional an ordinary man can be.",

            "content": "Badhaai ho falls right into Ayushman Khurana's favorite category - Slice of life films. As good as the trailer was, it actually subverts from what the movie actually is about. The trailer showed a very light hearted comedy, while the movie is a realistic take on how the fake standards of normalcy in society can bring undeserved shame and embarrassment which can threaten the sanctity of a family. And at the core of all this is very funny dialogue and set pieces which provide the comic relief. The movie takes itself very seriously and very lightly at times, and its the balance that it manages to strike which makes it highly enjoyable.\nThe perfomances are all top notch. Gajraj Rao outshines everyone with his portrayal of the 'convict' dad. The love that he shows for his wife seems genuine enough to the point that you feel bad for how they are treated by their children and by others. Neena gupta gives a stellar performance as the pregnant mom. Ayushman Khurana gives another effortlessly good performance as the coming of age son who gives in to society's notions and then realizes how bleak they are. Others put in good performances as well.\nOverall i would say that Ayushman is having a stellar year, and hindi cinema is finally churning out good movies on a regular basis. Badhaai ho is a gem and deserves all the accolades and money it is making.",

The scene she tells her daughters off bought a tear to my eye.\nI could very easily do a breakdown of all the characters because of how well they were portrayed. Although Ayushman tends to kind of play the same roles, you can't fault him because he does play is characters very well and special mention Sheeba Chadha - I am so over the wealthy middle class woman of the house being a complete heartless  for no reason. She however, played her character perfectly. The scene where her daughter tells her her potential mother-in-law is pregnant was just perfect - she was incredibly convincing as the wealthy middle class mother who just wants the best for her daughter.\nIt has been a long time since I watched a film and felt completely satisfied - the story line, script, dialogue and characters were all so solid.\nOverall, a fabulous and heart warming film and how could I forgot, how funny it was.

            "content": "Badhai Ho Badhai is a welcome change from formula films coming out from the Bollywood stable in the last few months. A simple script pictured in an endearing fashion, the movie manages to move you at times. Acting is avant garde. Neena Gupta and Surekha Sikri steal the show. Ayushman Khurana and Sanya Malhotra form a good pair. Khurana's acting is subdued and well nuanced. The only dampener is Khurana's heavily Punjabi accented Hindi. At times you wonder if you are watching a Hindi movie or a Punjabi movie. South Indians will find it difficult to understand Punjabi and Haryanvi dialects.\nAn unexpected pregnancy embarrasses a family and mercifully the mother decides to go ahead with the pregnancy instead of terminating it. The grown-up children find it difficult to accept that their parents have an active sex life but eventually they reconcile to the fact. Khurana's girl friend (Sanya) is pretty cool about it though her mother (Sheeba Chaddha) cautions her that the child will eventually become her responsibility.\nGajaraj Rao has great screen presence and manages the comedy sequences very well. The locales add immense value - be it Lodha Colony in Delhi, railway station, Meerut.\nOne feels so happy for Neena. She was always sidelined by mainstream Bollywood ; she was forced to do sidekick roles like the one in Feroze Khan's Yalghar or playing side kick to Madhuri Dixit in the dance \"Choli Ke Peechey\" in Subash Ghai's Khalnayak.\nThis role is a role in a lifetime for Gupta - she might win a couple of awards. You actually see an ageing middle class housewife Priyamvadha Kaushik and not Neena Gupta the actress. There lies in the success of the director in his efforts to extract best performances from all actors.\nEvery actor has got a meaty role and this is where the script appears to be balanced. Shardul Rana has delivered a good performance as Khurana's younger brother. One wishes that one had an elder brother like Khurana - protective, strict and affectionate.Definitely worth a watch.Do not miss it.",

She has brought her up to be an independent, confident and assertive woman. Like herself. Like Mother Like Daughter. A woman with an agency.\nThe daughter, young and exuberant. She is in love. She chooses the man to love. Chooses how to love and how much to love. They are equal partners in a relationship. Each has a voice. To agree or to disagree. She disagrees with the way he views the sexual relationship between his parents. She disagrees with the way he behaves with her mother. She voices her disagreement. Its all about about having the voice. A woman with an agency.\nA middle aged woman with two grown up sons, faced with an unplanned pregnancy. Makes the choice. Choice as to what to do with her body, her pregnancy, her foetus. Right or wrong. What is a right or wrong choice here anyway? But its all about being able to make the choice.\nThe husband is ambivalent. Mostly perturbed by what are the people going to say. And also concerned about the health of his wife.\nBut, she knows what she wants. She wants this child. Irrespective of what people would say. A woman with an agency.\nDecision taken. Only to be followed by anger of dear ones, ridicule, mockery, sly looks and taunts. \"You wear red lipstick even in this age\", says the mother in law. \"In the entire marriage ceremony, you were the topic of conversation. Do you have no shame?\", says the sister in law. \" My head hung down in shame, how do I go to office?\", says the son.\" She remains calm, yet resolute, though hurt.\nThe equal partner in the crime, her husband, on the other hand, gets compliments for his machismo, in this age!\nIsn't it about the unequal distribution of power in a patriarchy. A daughter-in-law vis-a-vis the mother-in-law and the sister-in-law. Anticlimax. The mother-in-law finally stands by the daughter-in-law. Reminds her daughters that they weren't there for their mother. When she was sick. It was the daughter-in-law. Who washed her clothes and linen, provided for food and medicines and most importantly, love and care. The unpaid care work acknowledged and respected. The mother-in-law using the power granted to her by patriarchy, to stand up for her daughter-in-law. A woman with an agency.\nThere is a hero, yet every character is a hero.\nThen is born a little girl. Welcomed by every one with open arms. The cooing of the baby. The tears of joy. The hugs and the prayers. A happy ending. The viewers leave with hope. That this little girl would have equal opportunities in life. To study, to play, to eat, to be happy, to be what she would like to be. That she would have a voice. And choice. That she would be a woman with an agency.",

Unfortunately this cannot be said for about 50% of new actors that get launched due to being affiliated to someone in the industry. Movie approached multiple taboo topic and did a amazing job delivering. Movie is for open-minded individual or family. Although, close-minded people may appreciate watching as well, as they probably been through such events in life or knew people that have been. It's not for extreme close-minded people who hide behind that's our culture bs. Fyi India didn't reach 1 plus billion by not doing it all night long.",

Also one way to differentiate good movies is that you will clearly remember the scenes and the entire story even after a long time....and this movie is one of them.\nGo out there on a weekend and watch the movie...else enjoy it on tv or lappy.
