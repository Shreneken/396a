            "content": "The great Japanese director Hiorkazu Koreeda (\"The Third Murderer\") continues his exploration of the true meaning of family In Shoplifters (Manbiki kazoku), a quest he began in his award-winning 2013 film, \"Like Father, Like Son.\" Winner of the Palme d'Or award at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival and the first Japanese film to win the award since Shohei Imamura's \"The Eel\" in 1997, the film is focused on marginalized people existing on the fringes of Japanese society who barely eke out a living by engaging in activities that skirt the letter of the law. It is the story of flawed people who have patched together a working \"family\" of outcasts who believe that the impulse to survive and create a nurturing environment is more important than strict adherence to society's norms.The film opens in a supermarket where Osamu Shibata (Lily Franky, \"After the Storm\"), a middle-aged, part-time construction worker, is seen exchanging strange hand signals with a pre-teenage boy, Shota (Jyo Kairi), who seems to regard what is going on as a family outing. It quickly becomes apparent that this is no ordinary family shopping spree but an exercise in shoplifting, as we watch Shota casually throw items from the shelves into his shopping bag when no one is looking. Justifying their flouting of the law, Osamu says that if the goods are in the store, it means that they do not belong to anyone, and tells Shota that they are stealing the items only as a means of helping the family.Much later when questioned about stealing by the authorities, sadly he says that shoplifting was the only skill he had to teach the boy. Osamu, as it is gradually revealed, is the head of a household consisting of husband (Franky) and wife Noboyu (Sakura And\u00f4, \"Destiny: The Tale of Kamakura\"), teenage daughter Aki (Mayu Matsuoka, \"Tremble All You Want\"), her younger brother Shota (Kairi), and grandma Hatsue (the late Kirin Kiki, \"I Wish\"), all living in a small, cluttered apartment outside of Tokyo, scattered toys and knick-knacks everywhere, barely providing the family with enough room to eat and sleep.The family, as it turns out, is one in name only, consisting of those who have been \"picked up along the way,\" and brought together as a means of mutual support. We discover that it is not only Osamu and Shota that are engaged in dubious activity but the others as well. Noboyu works as an attendant in a laundry and pockets things people leave in their pockets. Aki contributes by working in a porn shop, performing sex acts for men who are hidden from her view, while grandma is a conniver who plays the pachinko slot machines, claims her deceased husband's pension, and collects money from his son from another marriage.The family's lives change drastically when Osamu and Shota find Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a shivering little girl of four or five alone in the streets, seemingly abandoned. With her protection in mind, Osamu, who renames her Rin, brings the little girl home and discovers bruises on her arms that indicate she has been physically abused. Later, they see a news story on television about a child who is missing and how authorities are conducting an extensive search for her. Justifying their decision to hide the girl from the authorities, Osamu tells the others that it is not kidnapping unless you ask for ransom.Osamu claims that they fear for her safety if she is returned to an abusive situation, yet he is not above using her as a decoy in markets as he and Shota engage in shoplifting. Through it all, Koreeda does not stand in judgment of his characters but simply observes the trajectory of their life in the tradition of Ozu and Naruse. When he moves into darker territory in the film's last section, its main focus remains on the humanity of the characters. When Nobuyo disposes of an item that is a painful reminder for Yuri about the family that abused her, she gives her a big hug, explaining that when people love each other, they give them hugs and do not hit them. In an exquisite moment, Yuri places her hand on Nobuyo's face who lets it remain there for a few minutes.While Shoplifters contains elements that are painful to watch, what we take with us is Koreeda's empathy displayed in the beauty of small moments: The joy of trips to the beach, the sexual intimacy between partners that has been long repressed, and the expression on the faces of young children aware, perhaps for the first time, that they are loved.",

            "review_title": "Koreeda at the top of his game",
            "content": "On the day I watched Shoplifters, the news in Japan was dominated by the story of a 5-year-old girl, beaten and starved by her parents, writing messages in her notebook begging for love. An eerily similar storyline is threaded through Shoplifters, but Koreeda's prescience is no accident - he engaged with similar stories in his 2004 film Nobody Knows. Family, in various degrees of warping, is the focus of Koreeda's opus.Shoplifters concerns a three-generation family living on the fringes of society. Dad apprentices his son in the art of shoplifting, telling him things on a store shelf do not actually belong to anyone. He also tells the boy that only stupid kids have to go to school, which is why he doesn't. The older daughter performs in a seedy red-light peep show, and Mum works in a low-paid laundry job, searching pockets for any stuff she can pilfer. They live with granny, though any time a visitor comes they all have to hide themselves.This warm but abnormal family is slowly revealed to be conjoined in ways we did not expect. The catalyst for this is Dad and son bringing home a neglected 5-year-old girl they come across abandoned on an apartment balcony on a freezing winter night. The girl comes home with them, and slots into the family, a pattern, we slowly realise, that has been repeated in the past. Granny was 'picked up,' and the son seems to have arrived by similar means. Their warmth and humanity is at odds with the illegality and disregard for social mores. Society judges such people, but by allowing us intimacy with them, Koreeda shows how society is also judged by them - and found wanting.The slow revelation of the family's background, the naturalistic interactions, the judicious spacing of shocks and surprises, are all evidence of a master filmmaker in perfect sync with his material. The performances are sublime. Franky Lily and Kirin Kiki are Koreeda regulars and both are tonally perfect here. Koreeda shows that he still has a deft touch with child actors, first seen in Nobody Knows, a film that garnered a Cannes acting award for 12-year-old Yuya Yagira. Jyo Kairi has resonances of Yagira, both in his physical characteristics and his mannerisms. The maturity of his performance is stunning. Sakura Ando is outstanding as the mother-figure, made wise by bitter experience but also upbeat in her approach to life. Her threat to kill a minor character is chilling. One scene, where she performs straight to camera, answering a question on what her 'children' called her, rips your heart out.There are many set pieces to enjoy here. A sharing of noodles on a humid summer day was one favourite; listening to, but not seeing, a firework display was another (what a metaphor for this family's peripheral status!). But the joy comes from the way the whole thing gels and shimmers, and provides steely insight on contemporary Japanese society, and the human condition. These are flawed individuals and Koreeda does not avert a critical gaze from their individual responsibility. The film explores big questions on living a good life and taking responsibility in an uncaring society. A simply stunning film.",

            "review_title": "multi-generational poverty",
            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. We typically think of family as blood relatives, those affiliated by marriage or adoption, and those funky cousins (sometimes 'removed') that, according to the family tree, are supposedly related to us. Expert Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda (LIKE FATHER LIKE SON, 2013) presents a story that will have you questioning whether the strongest connection is blood, heart, or money.We first witness 'father' Osamu Shibata (played by Lily Franky) and adolescent 'son' Shota (Jyo Kairi) in a well-coordinated shoplifting maneuver at the local grocery store. On the way home they stumble across a shivering child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, who has been seemingly abandoned by her parents. They take her home to warm her up and feed her, and it's here we discover the multi-generational family living in a tiny apartment. This family also consists of 'grandmother' Hatsue (an excellent Kirin Kiki), 'mother/wife' Nobuyo (Sakura Ando), and teenage daughter Aki (rising star Mayu Matsuoka).When the family discovers signs of abuse on the little girl Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), they decide to keep her - less an informal adoption than an admission to the club. See, this family lives in poverty, and finds comfort in working odd jobs and shoplifting. They do bad things out of necessity, in a kind of twisted 'honor among thieves'. Each person, regardless of age is expected to contribute to the team. The eldest provides a steady income through her deceased ex-husband's pension, and by scamming mercy money from his second family. Osamu and Nobuyo have regular part time jobs, while Aki works in a sexy chat room. Shota polishes his shoplifting skills and even tiny Yuri begins to learn by watching him. Everyone contributes in what can be described as a pyramid scheme of petty cons.As the film progresses, we get to know each of the characters and begin to care about them ... rooting for them to find success. Writer-Director Kore-eda draws us in with subtle scenes of interaction between the characters, each willing to sacrifice for the other. He raises the question on whether choosing one's family might create a stronger bond than those blood ties. What really seems to matter is where we feel we belong, and where are accepted.The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, and it's likely due to the devastating and expert final act. In a dramatic shift in tone, true character is revealed - it's a shocking revelation on some fronts, and fully expected on others. Each family member has a backstory that slowly unfolds through the first two acts, and then abruptly slaps us upside the head as the film nears conclusion. There are many social aspects to be discussed after this one, including how the child welfare system (seemingly regardless of country) sometimes works against a child's best interest, even with the best intentions. This is one that will grab your heart and then stick with you for a while.",

It is unbelievable that the rather complicated characters and their relationships are depicted in just two hours. The approach is mild, understated, low-profile, subtle and nuanced. Much room, space and thought are left to the viewers. The direction is simply super smart. The cinematography is extraordinary, with some surprising long shots, close-ups and beautiful shots from tight angles. The editing is speechless, connecting numerous scenes just seamlessly. Not a single minute is wasted, and the film is largely intense and arresting. Together with the brilliant performances from the ensemble cast, the result is a satisfying and deeply affecting drama on lower class in Japan.",

            "review_title": "Koreeda's latest is a fine family drama with a quietly devasting finale",
            "content": "Hirokazu Koreeda is one of the finest filmmakers working today. He specializes in relationships within a family, including those of an nontraditional kind. A trait which is never more evident in his work than in SHOPLIFTERS.The movie begins with a Father Osamu (Koreeda vet Lily Franky) and Son Shota (Jyo Kiari) involved in the title activity at a small store. Silently, and with rhythmic precision they pull off their tiny heist. When they return home - more a dilapidated, cluttered shanty - we meet the rest of the unorthodox family - Grandmother Hatsue (another Koreeda regular, Kirin Kiki), and two grown daughters Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) and Aki (Mayu Matsuoka). Noboyo is Osamu's mate. Introduced into the clan is a very young girl Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) who they find on the streets crying out for help. They take her under their wings even if they know it's a form of kidnapping - good motives and all.Once introduced, Koreeda (who also wrote the screenplay) takes his time revealing the lives of the individual characters as well as unpeeling the various threads which connect the group. Each character gets their due as we come to understand their methods and motivations. Koreeda's method can come off as sprawling and even a bit obtuse at times, but he has never been known for tight rigid storytelling. They unfold before us, and it is on the viewer to suss out the shadings. A scene can begin with one level of meaning and end with a wholly different appreciation of deeper shadings, none more so than one where Aki plies trade as a softcore peepshow performer. Only a Director of Koreeda's skill could turn a tawdry act like Aki's into one of such tenderness. The cast is uniformly fine from the youngest to the eldest, but Sakura Ando is particularly superb, never more so than in the quietly devasting climax.The last act of SHOPLIFTERS is where the seemingly random plotting comes together. Everything is laid bare, along with new insights and revelations. It's also one of the most heartbreaking turn of events in a movie this year. Koreeda, as is his approach, doesn't give easy or definitive answers. The fact that we still care to ponder the fates of those characters after the end credits roll, is a testament of how effective Koreeda's movie is.",

            "content": "I'm putting down 8/10 for a \"rating\", but basically I have no idea how to put a movie like this numerically in comparison with just about any Hollywood effort. It really belongs on a different scale entirely. My wife and I are just back from seeing it at our local art-cinema theater and we liked it very much. Stylistically, for other recent movies it's close to \"Roma\" and also the American indie film \"Leave No Trace\" as bittersweet, unhurried explorations of quite real human beings working hard to survive.\"Shoplifters\" follows the lives of a makeshift \"family\" living in the underside of an unnamed Japanese city (the particular place isn't important). The adults scrape by with low-security, low-paid jobs, the grandma has a small pension income, and the kids are vagabonds. They get by in a crowded, ramshackle tenement and the two kids are busy picking up the techniques of petty shoplifting from the adults. We slowly learn that almost none of them are actually related; they've haphazardly chosen each other to live with in a framework a little outside the margins of normal society. All of them, in some way, have left or been taken out of abusive or dangerous previous relationships. Throughout their exploits, told by a long series of short vignette scenes, is that they indeed feel close bonds but that their \"family\" is built, not by blood, but by the constant kindness they show towards each other. They survive on the margins, but they love and are loved.The second and much more subliminal big message I took away from this film was its ambience: it's quiet. Scenes that would -- in a Hollywood film -- predictably lead to shouting matches or displays of anger or confrontations with authority, *never* take that cheap overdramatized route here. When confronted with tough questions, the main characters answer reflectively and with spare honesty. Even out on the streets with traffic and lots of people around, it's quiet. What a change.Toward the end of the film, the main characters are being patiently interviewed by social services staff in a series of magnetically powerful scenes. The \"family\" members' answers are often startling: \"Why were you teaching your son to shoplift?\" \"I ... didn't know anything else to teach him.\" or: \"Didn't you take your grandma and threw her away?\" \"No. Someone else threw her away; we took her in.\" or: \"The child belongs with her mother.\" \"No. Giving birth doesn't make her a mother.\" From small glimpses like this, a window opens into an entire world of human nature.",

With a sad and melancholic narrative that makes us feel small moments of beauty and union, but little by little begins to reveal layer by layer on a more bittersweet and human truth.Filmed in an excellent way with a cinematography designed to stay around the eyes of youngsters, with a soft and melancholic soundtrack that perfectly complements the scenes. The performances are fantastic from the entire cast, especially the children, who give a realistic and humane representation when it comes to their performances. The script is fantastic and human, teaching them a hard reality and difficult to grasp many times by our intangible minds, people who try to survive day by day through bad actions, but still try to keep their intentions pure and good.A film quite unique, original and emotional, full of hard and sad moments that move us completely but eventually end up revealing a new truth different from what we believed, highly recommended without a doubt.",

            "review_title": "Great performance from Kirin Kiki in her final role",
            "content": "Shoplifters: A non-nuclear family drama infused with humour set in Tokyo. We have Grandma Hatsue (Kirin Kiki)who subsidies the rest of the clan with her pension, the father Osamu (Lily Franky) is a casual labourer, he teaches son Shota (Kairi J\u00f3) to shoplift while he causes distractions, mother Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) works in a laundry and steals valuables left in pockets, her sister Aki (Mau Matsuko) serves as a hostess in a bar. Their relationships is left open to question but they function as a family.Coming home from a shoplifting expedition, Osamu and Shota find a cold and hungry young girl, Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), they bring her home and feed her. They try to return her home but Nobuyo hers Yuri's parents quarrelling and violence occurring. They decide to keep Yuri after discovering bruises on her arms. Life continues, Yuri becomes part of the family, Shota uses her as distraction during pilfering escapades. Then Yuri appears on TV, social services have discovered that she has been missing for two months without her parents reporting it.A tale of family life in Japan, how family isn't always those who are related to you, rather they are the ones who care for you. Even when Osamu is injured at work and Nobuyo loses her job they don't abandon Yuri. There is an interdependence going on here, Grandma doesn't want to die alone so she allows this ersatz family to live with her. But even she has her own secrets. At different levels the houses adult inhabitants are exploiting as well as caring for eachother. This is at times a satire about Japanese family life and the dichotomies between supposed familial responsibilities in theory and in actuality.A great performance from Kirin Kiki in her final role before she died earlier this year. Kairi and Miyu are covoncing as children who have had a hard life but are moving beyond it. Mostly cramped shots in the small house or dark shops contrasted with wider, brighter, pans along the banks of the River. Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, Shoplifters deservedly won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2018. 9/10.",

            "review_title": "What if you can choose your parents and kids in a new family?",
            "content": "In a portrayal of a lower class Japanese family, director Hirokazu Koreeda explores again the theme of family and the driving force of children. Yet to him, a family may not be blood related. Only care and respect defines a family - except here the parents teach the kids to shoplift. The film opens with a father (Lily Franky) and son (Jyo Kairi) picking up a girl (Miyu Sasaki) shivering in her cold balcony and brought her to their warm home with hot meals. The audience then slowly see other members of the family - mother (Sakura Ando), grandma (Kirin Kiki) and granddaughter (Mayu Matsuoka). But as the story unfolds, we would discover more how they are related. Although it is not blood that links them together, the family is close with an interdependent relationship or team work that also involves love and care. Grandma has her retirement fund but she does not want to die alone, and she cares for others with very sharp perception and emotions. Would this be a better alternative than putting the lonely elderlies into a nursing home? The characters do not ask the government to change policy. Instead, they take the matter in their own hands and form their own way of existence. Mom and Pa probably have fertility issues but they care for each other and bring in more children in their own ways. Here it echoed the director's theme in \"Like father, like son\" - it does not matter if it is blood related as long as there is love, also in \"Nobody knows\" - many family secrets and the community is kind to kids. \nIt was not clear how Akiko, the grandma's hubby's mistress' granddaughter got into the family. But she is a lonely soul and seeks comfort from another lonely patron (Sosuke Ikematsu) who is also a marginal character in society. In fact, all the family members are marginal members in society, living in the crack of the city center and can only \"listen\" to the fireworks. Echoing the importance of quality time as shown in \"Like father, like son\", here all the meal times are bonding time. A trip to the beach naturally slide in sex education. All these require sensitive and perceptive adults even though they do not have kids/grandkids of their own. This can be a wake-up call for the aging Japanese society with decreasing birthrates and growing trend of singleton. Would this pluralistic family be an alternative for the basic human need of affection? Of course the controversial part is the family's profession - shoplifting. But in their perception, they just reuse and recycle what other people abandon. They do not snatch. They just pick up people/things that others do not want - wife, son, daughter, grandma, clothes and household items (if they are in the store they do not belong to anyone). Then they treasure whatever they have or whoever they are.Very smooth and delicately written script. Excellent acting: low key and natural and yet so believable. But it was the kids that steal the show. Their innocence yet determination makes you feel both sad and happy. In this extended but close-knit family where all members were picked up by chance, there is lot of love. The family decides to stick together and stay on. Even the picture book Shota the son reads is a story of uniting to fight a bigger enemy - swimmy fish against the big tuna. Really subtle script writing. Sad but also heartwarming. All the adults are very sensitive and caring, perhaps a projection of the director. They are also very reserved and do not say \"thank you\" or \"dad\" out aloud. We see lots of recurring themes here. It seems that \"Shoplifters\" can be an extension of \"Nobody knows\" where we see how kids are abandoned in their own home. \"Shoplifters\" give them a new home. Unfortunately it is a solution not approved by the system. Yet the same issues exist all along: kids are left in the car in \"Nobody knows\" - who become the picked up Shota in \"Shoplifters\". Dead bodies have to be buried. Mealtime is a bonding time: from curry to instant ramen to paper. Parent's haircut shows their care etc ... Overall, it shows lots of issues in modern Japanese society and offered some light for the future, one that might deviate from the establishment/tradition or morality but built with lots of passion, hope and care. The director really cares for the society and is exploring whether a self-pick family would work. In his world it does but the system does not seem to allow it. Unlike \"Nobody knows\" which has bright sunshine in the end signaling hope, \"Shoplifters\" has a more pessimistic outlook, as if announcing the impracticality of the director's exploration of this new family formation.Great movie. Highly recommended.",

They have jobs, but they supplement their livelihood by stealing and scrounging. They seem to live by their own moral code. They're not bad people -- in fact, in some ways they're quite good people -- but they do things others would consider to be bad, and they're not overly concerned about hurting others along the way, albeit usually not in major ways. What we learn about them in regular and subtle reveals over the course of the film is that none of them are actually related by blood, yet they've cobbled together a family full of more closeness, happiness, and solidarity than any of them has with those they're related to in the traditional sense.\"Shoplifters\" is my favorite kind of movie because it suggests that people can be many things at once and defy categorization. We learn to know these folks, warts and all, and it's up to us how to feel about them. The movie doesn't make decisions for us. I sort of fell in love with them, and while I didn't necessarily condone all of the things they did, I felt terrible at the end that the life they managed to build together out of unlikely circumstances couldn't continue.In a movie full of excellent performances, the one I can't get out of my head is that of Sakura Ando as the \"mother.\" When we first meet her, it seems like she might be the coldest and most detached of the group, but by the movie's end we realize how responsible she is for holding everything together. It's a shame a performance like hers is too off the beaten path to ever be considered for Oscar attention, because she deserves it. The film itself is up for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2018 Oscars. It won't win, but it doesn't need an award to validate its greatness.Grade: A+",

            "content": "So, after years of films put forward, Kore-eda Hirozaku finally scooped the big prize at this year's Cannes festival, claiming the Palme d'Or for his latest \"Shoplifters\". Coming a matter of months after the multiple successes of \"The Third Murder\" at the domestic Academy awards in Japan, he is adding medals to years of critical acclaim. But how does his most prized film sit among the rest of an oeuvre in which a bad film has yet to materialise?Well, as if a \"Nobody Knows\" of adults, \"Shoplifters\" shows a \"family\" of acquaintances, brought together by a similar social status and treatment by their more traditional families. \"Grandmother\" Hatsue (the late Kirin Kiki), oversees her \"son\" Osamu (Lily Franky), his younger \"wife\" Nobuyo (Sakura Ando), her \"sister\" Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) and the couple's \"son\" Shota (Jyo Kairi).After a session of successful five-finger discount, Osamu and Shota walk home passed the again-left-out-in-the-cold Yuri (Miyu Sasaki). Offering her food and warmth, they soon realise they will need to return her to her rightful home. But as they are about to do so, her parents' arguing can be heard, and Nobuyo can't bring herself to leave her in an unloving household. The couple, therefore, have just given birth to their second child and latest family member.But what they can offer in a loving home cannot be matched financially. They all live in a one room shack, sleeping on top of each other. Osamu has a low-paying job in construction, but soon finds himself injured and out of work. Nobuyo works in a laundry service, but finds herself in the same scenario. Aki is the only real earner, but working in a peep show flaunting her bits, and as such does not share her keep with the others. The family's main livelihood, therefore, comes from Hatsue's pension and low-level thievery. Osamu and Shota are the main protagonists in this line of work, and Yuri is brought in on their game.But a financial and family structure such as this can only stay stable for so long. Caught in the act, an accident during escape sees a hospitalisation, leading to arrests, prompting confessions, resulting in the end.Kore-eda always poses a question in his films, to which there is no immediate answer. Here it is as to the bind that keeps families together. While they have no blood ties, in \"taking in\" Yuri, they treat her better than her parents ever will, with more love and dedication. They have little to offer any new family members, but all seem happy with the situation, despite all having lives that one would seek to avoid. This is closer than the relations the depicted blood relatives offer each other.The \"Shibatas\" are together by choice rather than forcibly by blood, with their post-modern solution a seemingly better option against tradition. But blood ties will always be there, and the choice to walk away from the Shibatas is also true. On arriving, Yuri is given the option to stay or return to her family; and once the authorities become involved, there are perhaps deceptions in all of them.Shota gets caught on purpose, knowing it could result in their demise; Osamu and Nobuyo's killing in self-defence of her ex-husband is revealed; Hatsue and Aki have former family connections, Hatsue claiming money off Aki's parents on the sly; and with Shota lying in hospital ready for questioning, the others plot their escape, leaving him alone. The \"family\" is perhaps no more than a convenience for the criminal, low paid and deceiving, with little actually known as to those they share a floor with. But once legally put to rights, all show that the artificial family they'd created was perhaps preferable to the alternative. With no blood ties, they had to be more careful and considered in their behaviour to each other and what is said and revealed, leaving a happier compromise.As ever, Kore-eda's slow pacing allows for a succession of detailed and delicate shots to build the story, as well as your knowledge of Lily Franky's buttocks. The end, however, is a confessional, each revealing their story to the police in individual interviews (partly conducted by Kengo \"...Yonosuke\" Kora). Though these are not designed to pull too tightly on the heart strings. As with \"Nobody Knows\", the everyday nature of the reactions, again perhaps a nod to the reaction and treatment of the lower classes and underclass in modern society: unseen and treated with indifference.Their family unit is not allowed to survive in the legal system; the poor and destitute barely able to survive under it also. And following on from \"The Third Murder\", Kore-eda again questions the nature of justice: The Shibata's \"kidnap\" Yuri, but treat her better than her parents ever would, though they are the convenient scapegoat.Featuring good performances throughout from some old reliables as well as some new names, there is undoubtedly a lot of expectation sat on \"Shoplifters\". The truth is that it is not his best film, but is definitely up there in a career of high standards, though perhaps doesn't leave as much of an impression as some that have come before it. But in an era of dropping standards, this is certainly the best new film I have seen this year, cementing that his is one of the best talents in contemporary cinema and justifying those awards.politic1983.blogspot.co.uk",

            "content": "Hirokazu Kore-eda's The Third Murder (2017) left me cold and entertaining the notion that Kore-eda has lost his mojo. O ye of little faith, please forgive me... Shoplifters, fresh from being minted with the highest honour, the Palme d'Or, at this year's Cannes Film Festival, is Kore-eda back to being his emotionally devastating best. This ranks in the top tier of his outstanding output. If ever there is a film that can declare that sometimes, just sometimes, water can be thicker than blood, this is it.Somewhere in Tokyo, Osamu Shibata (Lily Franky), his 'wife' Nobuyo (Sakura Ando) and 'daughter' Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) live in poverty. While Osamu receives occasional employment and Nobuyo has a low-paying job, the family relies in large part on 'grandmother' Hatsue's pension. As he is shoplifting for groceries with his 'son', Shota (Kairi Jo), they discover Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a neglected girl. Osamu takes her home, where the family observes evidence of abuse. Despite their strained finances, they informally adopt her.Once in a long while, a film can come along, sneaks up on you and sends your heart into a flutter of tiny explosions. Coming out of the screening with six other friends, we had to dissect what we had just experienced. As it turned out, it wasn't much of a deconstruction, but more of a discussion of the ideas of the family unit that Kore-eda paints with such delicate and painterly brushstrokes. That's when you realise the immense power of cinema and what it can do. This is a gem.Kore-eda dives into his favourite theme of the family unit and observes what will happen to the bedrock of familial relationships if it goes through a seismic shift. It is a theme he has dealt with in outstanding films like Nobody Knows (2004), Still Walking (2008), I Wish (2011), Like Father, Like Son (2013), Our Little Sister (2015) and After the Storm (2016). After so many excellent films on the same theme, you would think what else can he still distill. Shoplifters may be Kore-eda most complex, but yet his most accessible film to date.The ideas explored in Shoplifters are multi-faceted and piercingly intelligent, intermeshed into a tapestry that will fall apart if even one scene is taken out. The script is subtle and draws empathy readily. So many times the dialogue feels innocuous, only for the poignancy to hit you in the gut some time later. It doesn't judge, never points a finger at any party, nothing here errs on the side of twee. The tone is deftly maintained from the first frame to the devastating last.As usual, the heavy-lifting is done by the youngest actors, performances so naturalistic that they feel authentic. The ensemble is superbly cast and each of them shines in their own memorable way. They may be thieves, but there is honour and righteousness in them. They do not represent the lowest strata of the Japanese society and don't believe in handouts. With a warped sense of justice, they are willing to break the rules to survive. Above all else, their love and trust for each other is the glue that binds them.Kore-eda never cheapens the emotional ride and doles out expositions like sermons. Details of characters are gradually accumulated in a Zen manner till it hits a gut-wrenching last act.Like a lot of his heart-wrenching films, Shoplifters feels like a 3-hour magnum opus and I was again surprised it is only a 2-hour film because Kore-eda packs so much in the story. You will no doubt feel like you had lived a lifetime with the characters. Shoplifters is essential viewing and provides many involving examinations of what constitutes a true family. I love what the matriarch of the family said in a contemplative scene at the beach and I will paraphrase - \"Sometimes it is better to be with the family you choose rather than the family you are born in\". Some food for thought there.",

            "content": "A beautiful, warm, and touching look at humanity through the lens of a group of people at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. It's not immediately apparent, but it's a small group of strangers who have formed this family unit which includes those of all ages, from a grandma down to a couple of children, one of whom has been rescued/kidnapped from abusive parents. A couple of them make money at menial jobs, one is a worker in a sad little sex club, another collects her dead husband's pension, and most of them supplement their income by stealing things. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda gives us a deeply humanistic film with these characters, but he doesn't idealize them. He shows us selfish, greedy, and manipulative behavior to go along with sacrifice and genuine love. There are so many threads beyond family and parenting, including hardships of abuse, alienation, and being a low-paid worker in a capitalistic society. For a film with such dark elements, there is a calm, benevolent acceptance of it all though, as if Kore-eda was looking down on humanity from up high.Sakura Ando is absolutely gorgeous in this film, turns in a brilliant performance, and has some very sweet lines too. I almost melted when she hugged the abused little girl and said: \"The reason they hit you isn't because you are bad. If they say they hit you because they love you, that is a lie. If they love you, if they really love you, this is what you do...\" When you think of how such a group might be conceived of or portrayed, there is a sense of inversion when they act in these sublime, empathetic ways. We also see this in little moments like the sex worker hugging a clearly scarred regular patron, and when the shopkeeper who notices the kids stealing lets them go, simply warning the boy not to let his sister do that.The angle the film takes relative to family is an interesting one. To choose your own family may be better and more meaningful than the 'real thing', but on the other hand, given the circumstances and how the group lives outside the law, there is a tenuous fragility about it. The film also explores simply surviving as an individual in a tough world, but in surviving, needing to cling to others, to do what's right for them as much as oneself, and to love them. These things reflect the human condition so perfectly that the film has a powerful aura about it. Highly recommended.",

Even though the reconciliation between the individual and the world is no longer given hope, Hirokazu Koreeda's past unsolved thoughts resonate in a virtual space..\nTherefore, it is not a bragging to call this film his masterpiece.",

This movie really touches you and shows you just how important human connection is to us, and not in a smarmy way, but rather in a way that highlights how that need for connection can be so easily assuaged and turn into genuine familial love.",

            "content": "Academy Award's official entry from Japan Shoplifters already earned so many awards and could even got every awards if there was no 'Roma'. Shoplifters questions us and left us to find the answer. The question could be seen in the trailer too. It was \"Does giving birth automatically makes you a mother?\" Though shoplifters is not made on this very topic. It's more than this.They are family with husband, wife, and grandma and with two kids. They are poor. The man named Osamu (Lily Franky) shoplift everyday with his kid named Shota (Jyo Kairi). They return home and feel their stomach with the foods along with the other members of the family. One day returning home Osamu and Shota found a little girl (Miyu Sasaki) was outside of his home who had no one in their family then. They took her into their little house full with humanity and everybody welcome her. On the next day they went to return her but ended up hearing their parents were fighting over her existence and that's why they decided to took her into their house.All of them in this family earn legally or illegally. They are not all innocent but they do have innocence. This film is adorable with it's realistic family goals. No matter what this family is actually happy over anything they has. But will not they try to do something which is acceptable? They are helpless too. They are free, they enjoy their time. The little girl who used to get beaten by her parents made a great relationship with this family too.First of all there is nothing to spoil this film. The trailer showed almost all of this movie. This film is made on the views over a poor japaneese family. Hirokazu wanted us to feel for them. And it worked amazingly by his artistically work. Shoplifters never gives you any hard moments and this film has no center conflict. It's like a flowing river that has some stones in the middle. Shoplifters is an adorable journey throughout an road of humanity.Amazing screenplay form Hirokazu and masterclass acting from all the cast gave me goosebumps in moments. There are moments that can make you cry and laugh at the same time. Shoplifters will be always live with my heart. And I liked it by watching 8.1 on imdb over 17k votes. It is really good to see normal people started liking this kind of arts too.",

            "content": "Maybe because I work in a retail store, I perhaps have a bit of a one sided, or jaded approach to theft, or shoplifting seeing as the store where I work deals with it on an almost every day basis. This ranges from people peeling off stickers on items and replacing them with lower ones to get away with paying less, or sometimes it's just a simple matter of people stuffing items into their purse, backpack, or pockets to get certain items. I tend to be a bit more lenient when it concerns this as opposed to some of my coworkers and superiors who would probably prefer me to be as tough as nails on the issue. While I am totally and completely against all forms of theft and robbery, I still can't help, but think that maybe there are some underlying issues here that should be paid attention to. Are these people doing it because they are kleptomaniacs and get a thrill from each item they steal, or is it more than that such as people who are hurting financially and could really use a break? The store where I work is a charitable organization, so we do have programs and services set up to help the less fortunate and if one of them came to us with a letter, or voucher from a shelter, or government sponsor, we would certainly and have given out free clothing and supplies. Is it really necessary for people to steal, or are some doing out of absolute desperate means? This new film, Shoplifters asks a very important question with this as we see this group of people who engage in stealing and otherwise dishonest means in order to support themselves. We see the kind of place where they live and how rundown it is and how most things people here in America consider everyday life these people would consider an absolute luxury. Is it necessary for them to carry on this lifestyle and what example is it setting for the children and could it possibly later corrupt them? The film places no judgments upon them by either saying they are good, or bad people, but instead shows us a different kind of lifestyle and one that is perhaps unknown to most of us, but probably should be known. We worry about the influence of these people and how long they can get away with what they are doing as well as when trouble does finally come, what will be the outcome? We see that this group of people do generally have the best interests of one another and they seem to have a bond that even when it is tested seems to be something that can't be separated. The film presents an interesting topic and suggests that maybe there is more services and programs necessary for people like this and as viewers we are not to turn a blind eye against the poor and needy, but to help out in whatever capacity available. The performances are all very natural and genuine and henceforth more believable and emits more empathy from the viewers. This is a film with something important to say and yet it doesn't judge, or condemn, but instead leaves us with a lingering problem that suggest that as a people and society we have a lot of work to do. A moving film that is a masterpiece in and of itself and one of 2018's finest achievements.",

            "content": "I'll mark spoilers just in case, but I don't really reveal plot points, just the themes that the film presents in the end.You can think of Shoplifters as a twist on the classic crime family formula such as Goodfellas and The Godfather; Koreeda's twist is that he just focuses on the drama about building a relationship on morally-questionable intent. The first half of this film plays out like a typical movie about a family of misfits and outcasts. The thieves/hosts play parents and grandma to a handful of children that come from either abusive, neglectful, or pressuring parents. Here the children are their happiest and they build very sincere relationships with each other. Yet there are sprinkled hints of bad intent; our adult protagonists are framed like Robinhood characters, but as we continue the viewers logic and society in the film reveals them to be more closely related to the typical scum criminals can be. Maybe the hosts weren't trying to be helpful, but rather fulfill their own personal wants while putting others in danger?Koreeda doesn't answer these questions of the character's intent, because he doesn't want us to know. Koreeda wants us to ask what is parenthood and family. If it's a safe space, the thieving hosts very well provided that as opposed to the other families. The kids were arguably the most free to be kids when with them. However if family should provide a moral backbone, felons are not your number one pick. And there is much more moral inquisition but these were the ones that stuck out to me.In terms of the technical aspects, despite the cold blue coloring this was a very cozy and warm film. All the actors performed really well and seemed genuine, the main house set is very small but not cramped in the way it was shot, and sound was typically diegetic making the film world seem alive. There was one shot-reverse-shot where the characters were framed in the direct center, facing the camera (similar to a tatami shot), and while cool, it was never repeated again, making it a little inconsistent with the rest of the film. Otherwise, not really much to criticize on the technical front.On a personal note, this film came to me at a time while I'm reconsidering what my friendship is like with others, so the themes of the story really resonated with me. Did I just spend years building a relationship on a fake persona of myself? Are they friends with me or are they friends with my actions and speech rather than my intent? Should I be picky or should I cut my losses? \"No one wants to die alone\" like the film says, and it's not like I'll care about what they say at my funeral. I don't know if this film is helping me cope or if it's just adding variables to my turmoiled mind, but it felt like it was talking about me at some points, and maybe if it was like that for me, maybe it will be for you too.",

This cross between \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Shoeshine\" but filmed in the style of Ozu's \"Ohayo\" is about a family of thieves in contemporary Tokyo who find a little, five-year-old girl abandoned by her abusive parents, take her in, shower her with affection and teach her to steal. They may be amoral and they may be lawbreakers but sometimes we find goodness in the strangest of places and in the least likely of people. What's worse, the film asks; stealing food and clothes or 'rescuing' a child, a crime society and the world at large views as the greater theft.If the style of the film is neo-realist, the concept is purely humanist and, for once, Koreeda comes across as a Japanese Ken Loach and, like Loach, he draws extraordinarily naturalistic performances from his entire cast, (Miyu Sasuki, the little girl playing Yuri, is absolutely perfect), and there are great moments here, as good as any in recent cinema. Life, you see, is not black and white but full of all the colours of the rainbow if you just know where to look.

            "content": "Excellently scripted and full of impressive subtleties, Shoplifters is a harrowing look at a working-class family in Tokyo, in the business of trying to simply make ends meet day by day. At first glance this may seem like just a story of this family resorting to petty crime, but as the plot gradually unfolds the reasons for the behaviour and decisions of each character is revealed, and al the dots begin to connect amidst this struggle.Certainly seeing some of the characters getting involved in decidedly immoral behaviour- for example, the shoplifting carried out by the young boy and his father (as the title indications) and one young lady making a living off involvement in the porn industry, can be uncomfortable to see and it does present the characters in this film as morally dubious. But the whole situation that these people are in, and partially choose to create themselves, is eventually presented to the audience with unassuming subtlety, which is beautiful to watch. The overall tone of this film is fairly grim, and there is definitely raw emotional power to many scenes, but the acting and the script never at any point becomes overly sentimental or tragic. The scenarios and emotions that each character faces is really presented as it is, but of course with much delicacy.This film may be relatively slow-paced and not visually stunning, but is breathtaking nonetheless. It's no wonder why it managed to win the Palme D'or! It's definitely going to end up as one of the best films of the year and will probably be recognised as a classic long in the future. Regardless of which culture you're from, I highly recommend checking this film out. It should deeply resonate with and impress any film lover.",

The family has strong ties except those of blood, for it is the shortage that makes this cluster of people stand and act like an actual family.The matriarch Hatsue, the Grandma, lives on a small alimony received from her ex-husband since the divorce. Today dead, her husband continues to receive posthumous honors. In the house, tiny, still live the Daddy and the Mother, Osamu and Nobuyo, that we will discover later to have united in a striking and traumatic episode. He is a hod carrier and she works in a laundry room, picking up, here and there, little forgotten trinkets in the pockets of the clothes. There are two more inhabitants in the house: a 10-year-old boy (who sleeps in a closet) and a young Aki, the granddaughter of Hatsue's ex-husband, who works as hostess in a club, where she shows off for costumers.In the opening scene, Osamu and the boy Shota return home after a choreographed swipe at a market (though they have forgotten the shampoo), when they encounter a 5-year-old girl left on the balcony of her house, probably by her violent and negligentparents. Fearing that the little girl Yuri dies of cold, they take her with them to their home, where she is at first rejected, and later \"adopted\" by the family.Although the girl later becomes wanted by the police, the Shibatas do not worry because, in their particular code of ethics, they understand that there is only kidnapping if there is a request for ransom. Likewise, they believe there is no theft if the goods have not yet been sold to clients unless the store that sells them is going bankrupt.Hirokazu Kore-eda builds a minimalist and beautiful movie as if it were a large onion that we were gradually stripping until we discovered, among acid layers, a core that brings tears to our eyes.",

Only four months after the premier at Cannes, Kiki died, at the age of 75.

The focus on the film was what actually constitutes a family....and like this film, \"Shoplifters\" challenges the traditional Japanese notion of what makes a family and the importance of genetics.This movie is NOT pleasant...and has many harsh moments. So, please consider this when you decide whether or not to see the movie. It's NOT an easy film to watch and if you are depressed already consider seeing a comedy instead.The story is about a group of people who are a pseudo-family. They are not related but live as a family...with a grandmother, parents, sister and children...or at least folks who act like these roles. Why are they living as a family? Well, for mutual profit...and the children help pay the bills by spending their days stealing...much like the children who worked for Fagan in \"Oliver Twist\". Where does all this and the unpleasantness go? See the film.\nThe message of this film is unusual...that criminals like you see in the story MIGHT be better at parenting than the biological parents. It also exposes a truth you don't easily see when you are in Japan...that there ARE folks who fall through the cracks, so to speak, and are not productive citizens. I just returned from three weeks in Japan and evidence of the homeless and criminality of any kind is something you will have to struggle to find. It creates a portrait that challenges the cultural norms...something which some folks might not appreciate. Overall, a well made but very unpleasant film that deals with topics such as child abuse and neglect...not exactly fun subjects but ones which should not be ignored.",

It convinces with strong actresses and actors and especially child actors Sasaki Miyu and Kairi Jyo are absolutely incredible and should have a great career in the future. The film is directed calmly, intimately and precisely and shows us how a group of societal outcasts stick together to find a common purpose in life. The movie criticizes the perception of homeless, lonely and poor people and makes you wonder whether the actual kidnappers and thieves are to blame or whether those who ignored and mistreated them have a big part in their development.The film tells the story of a group of poor people who live in a small house in a depressing neighbourhood of Tokyo that is owned by a lonely elderly woman who supports the group with her deceased husband's pension. One day, the adult labourer who has assumed the role of the family father and the young boy that has been living with the family for several years witness a sad girl on a balcony on a cold night while her mother is getting into a physical and verbal fight with a man. The laborer and the boy pity the girl and decide to take her with them. They initially plan to bring her back the next day but the girl doesn't want to go back and prefers staying with the family. She bonds with the unique group of people and especially looks up to the boy whom she perceives like an older brother she can trust. They spend much time together and learn positive and negative things from each other. When the brother however observes how his sister starts stealing in local shops like he has been doing for a long period of time, he decides to take the blame to make her stop. His selfless sacrifice has unexpected consequences on the entire group that considers itself a genuine family.Shoplifters is a movie that will touch your heart but also involve your brain and make you think. Despite a slow pace, the movie is never dull and each character is developed carefully. The viewer ends up empathizing with the different characters despite their flaws because they are gentle at heart. The movie's ending will make you reconsider the values of family and friendship as the lines between good and evil are constantly blurred throughout the film. Shoplifter finds the perfect balance between emotionalism and intellectualism. It would certainly deserve most to win this year's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.",

The simple justification for this immoral behavior is that the shop items do not yet belong to anybody. Next to this little weakness, the family ties seem to be in good shape as family members do listen to each other.The trick of the movie is that it is constantly laying trails of doubt whether these people living together in the small dingy house surrounded by big apartment blocks are in fact a real family. Why is it so easy for most of them to accept little Yuri as a new family member? Why does Shota refuse to call Osamu his Dad? How can Hatsue tell Nobuyo that she has chosen her as her daughter?Trains of thought start what else they may be if not a family and what brought and keeps them together. According to a statement in the movie, it is actually money, which makes the bonds. This in the end turns out to be (the unpleasant) part of the truth but no more than that.Then, around the next corner, the movie makes you think why not to call these people a family as they apparently care for each other. Why should not they share a common shelter if it keeps them off loneliness? Has not 5-year-old Yuri chosen to stay with these people rather than with her real family where nobody seems to like her? In this way, the movie suggests that there are various concepts to a family and that the one based on common blood is not necessarily the best.Next to this central issue, I also liked the movie because of its Japanese peculiarities. For example, all the eating is done while sitting on the floor and the noodles are sucked into the mouth in a loud and for European ears rather disgusting way. On the other hand, it is surprising to see Japanese characters that are both highly human and imperfect at the same time.",

In a time when the divide between haves and have-nots grows more stark, the lives of a family on the edge draw our sympathy. We first meet the father and ten-year-old son as they steal dinner from a grocery store. On their way home, they pass a balcony where a small girl, maybe 4 or 5, huddles shivering. She won't speak, but worried that she'll freeze, they bring her home where Grandma, her granddaughter, and the father's wife are ready for dinner.The little girl has a burn mark on her arm and bruises, but gradually their kindness coaxes smiles. Months pass; by the time someone reports her missing, they've grown attached to her, and vice versa, so they cut her hair and burn her old dress - she's one of them now.But as calamities befall them, gradually we understand more about this group, and why they're together.

            "content": "This movie tells the story of a group of japanese people who represent a \"family\" despite having no relationship to each other. We think it's a good movie, although it can get pretty confusing, very quickly. This is because of the amount of people that don't go by their real names and the fact that some characters use other character's names. (NO SPOILER) The children in the family have been taken by the father , and are used to shoplift from stores due to the family living in poverty. They find a little girl outside of her house, and take her in to save her from her own family's abuse. The film aims to define family- not by blood but by soul- and their eventual downfall. The five most important characters in this movie are Yuri, Shota, Grandma, Osamu, Kie Miyabe, and Aki Shibata. Along with the intricate familial connections that are referenced in the movie multiple times, this makes the movie a good movie with some disconcerting aspects. Ultimately, we think this movie's lesson is about seeing past prejudice. The movie introduces the characters in this film as a \"family\", you come to learn throughout the movie that this isn't exactly a traditional family, and that what bonds them all together initially is having committed something which society considers \"wrong\" (murder, thieving, kidnapping, benefits fraud, etc). But as a viewer, you have been made to care for each of these characters, despite what brought them all together. It's a movie about things not always being as they seem, and what that ultimately doesn't matter. The people at their chore, care for each other, in their own strange way. We don't think this movie is necessarily accessible to young people, but more people in their 20s or 30s.",

One of the themes of the movie that comes across quite clearly is that blood is not necessarily thicker than water. The audience starts with assuming that the various protagonists are members of a family by blood. As the narration progresses, it is gradually revealed that none of them are. And yet, their affection and devotion are something that you may not even see in a real, blood-related family.Director Hirokaze Koreeda's work shares certain fundamental qualities with the work of his world-famous countryman Akira Kurosawa: brilliant depiction of the \"little people\", with an endearing warmth. While their styles are totally different, the emotions they channel are equally genuine. Kurosawa has a mischievous sense of humour that will have you laughing and crying all at once. Koreeda approaches his characters with a low-key tenderness that often moves you to silently weeping. After distinguished works like \"Nobody knows\", \"Air doll\" and \"Like father, like son\", it's \"Shoplifters\" that won for him Best Director in Cannes.\"Shoplifters\" does have a simple plot that runs through the entire movie. To the \"family\" of four - father, mother, grandma and preteen son - is added a girl of 5 that the father finds shivering at a dark street corner. Unwilling to return her to abusive parents, the family keeps her, running the risk of felony of child-kidnaping. This background is all but forgotten as we see the little girl quickly mergers into the family, to the extent of even receiving lessons on shoplifting from her loving \"older brother\". A subplot involves the mother's young sister who is in the sex service profession in a cheerful matter-of-course way.While the parents have menial job and the grandma has a modest pension, the family is continuously struggle below the poverty line. The mother tries to nonchalantly explain away their slightly shady moral compass by saying that shoplifting does not really hurt anybody so long as the shops can afford it. As we share the family's daily life in a most intimate way we have, towards the end, come to entirely rooting for them as the \"kidnap\" is finally exposed, with dire consequences.While the acting of entire cast is absolutely mop-notch, it is the mother (Sasuda Ando) who will win your heart, with her deep compassion, with her cheerful disposition, and with her undaunted spirit towards life even when facing adversity.",

Gradually, as the movie unfolds, we realize how great the father-son relation is, and also realize (spolier alert!) that Shota is not Osamu's son. All the ladies of the house are so cool; and grandma is the coolest. They are all doing odd illegal stuff to get by, but it doesn't bother them. Even with their meager means, Osamu and Shota rescue a girl who was abandoned by her parents. Everyone else binds her in their family in a heart-warming way. It is just amazing how rich the family is in terms of love and relations.\nThey were living dangerously, and Shota being a young teenager was starting to question things. Soon, things fell apart, and everyone got arrested and the family was seen by the civilized society as a bunch of crooks who kidnapped kids and made them steal.",

            "content": "Shoplifters by Hirokazu Koreeda is one of the most beautiful portraits of the family household and its elements ever graced on-screen, and yes, that is how I am starting this review. While the last little while has been an array of firsts, experiencing a Koreeda film, I found myself recalling immortal auteurs like Yasujiro Ozu with his \"seasons\" series of melodramas, chiefly revolving around domestic trials and tribulations of man and humanity itself. At times I found it played like a Vittorio De Sica film, sprawling with driven poverty and poetic synthesis, proving on being a companion piece to his infamous Bicycle Thieves. While this film is already in the company of great films, winning the Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters is absolutely spellbinding! It's a film that is reviving the idea that modern cinema can move and transcend audiences in the most simplistic and organic of settings and motions.In my humblest and sincerest personal opinion, classic French, Italian and Japanese cinema produces truly spiritual, dreamlike cinematic material. Works from these countries articulate family, love, and spirituality through a lens that is equally transformative yet daringly raw and different from Western cinema. Ringing true to the genuine human condition than anything I have seen from Hollywood, Shoplifters is a film that has shifted my opinion on modern directors and modern cinema as a whole. With Shoplifter's we are truly drawn to a familiar world where the lens provides a gaze though the eyes of a real auteur. While I always disregarded the notion that anything shot with a modern camera in modern settings could materialize into the type of work that Kurosawa or Ozu have created, I have always believed filmmakers like these have unmatched qualities, until now. Koreeda's extreme sense of self-awareness and implementing a strong social dynamic, the characters and narrative of Shoplifters blossoms into a truly hearty cinematic experience.Although the story and narrative of Shoplifters really has no real importance, this is a film that truly draws from its actors and their interactions, to create a family that really delves into the depths of complex moral issues, bonds of love and the ideas of nature versus nurture, that hasn't been seen in film for many years. Yet, the casting in the film is perhaps, and although this may be a wholly bold statement, the best casting I have seen in at least a decade. Ranging from young child actors to older and respected Japanese acting icons, each familial role is worked and managed into broken down fibres of relatable family members we have in our own lives.The film tells the story of the Shibata's. Osamu Shibata, played by Lily Franky, the real patriarch of the family, provides the film with the majority of its humour, especially when he is teaching his 'children' the fine 'art' of theft. Early on, we see that he passes on his skills to his 'son' Shota played exceptionally well by Jyo Kairi. Relentless and effortless, the two are shown to be very close and possessing so many of the dynamics seen between a father and son relationship we have come to expect in film. Shota's mother, Nobuyo (Sakura Hando) works at a dry cleaners providing her share for the family, also engaging in forms of theft. Nobuyo's sister Aki (May Matsuoka) works at a soft-core gentlemen's cyber club performing for her dividend. All of the finances rendezvous at the flat the family stays in tucked away in an extremely quiet neighborhood. A large chunk of the rent that comes along with space is paid for by the true matriarch of the household, Grandmother Hatsue, played tirelessly by Kirin Kiki, who recently passed at the tender age of seventy-five.While each character's role is paramount in expressing the moral teachings in Koreeda's perfectly woven story, there is a firm affinity for Koreeda's sense of family and togetherness that does not go unnoticed. Each family member play each of their respectable roles honestly, spreading words and dialogue that ceases to shy from the harsh realities of such a lifestyle, yet brilliantly completely shatter society's belittling and scoffing nature towards them by being individual embodiments of humanity at all stages and ages of life.The family begins to change its dynamic when Osamu and Shota walk home one evening from a routine shoplift, and find Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a small child left in the barren waste of her broken family's home. Together, the two males bring Yuri back home, and the family agrees to keep her safe and make her one of them, a Shibata, due to their parents physical, emotional and mental abuse that can be heard from the open windows of their home. Once Yuri becomes a Shibata, the unravelling of a strong family unit begins, and in the most beautiful and gut-wrenching of fashion, even if what we are experiencing on-screen can easily be argued as kidnapping. Yet, one of the strongest questions in the film remains, is love experienced by strangers better than no love at all experienced by the people you call family?To call Shoplifters unequivocally beautiful is an understatement. Shot by Kondo Ryuto with a diamond touch in 35mm, an utilizing a medium shot style of filming, which gives great emphasis to the family's dialogue, action/reaction shots and allows for actors to truly embody their characters, with each one of their quips to be internalized. With amazing attention to detail, Akiko Matsuba, set designer to the film, allows his vision combined with Koreeda's small yet meaningful narrative acts, magnify the characters powerful revelations onto the screen.Although the main use of 3D in film, back when the medium was in its infancy, was implicated for the further immersion of audiences into the films they are watching, with films like Shoplifters, the true immersion audiences experience are into feelings of true warmth, a sensation that radiates from every scene and frame of Koreeda's Shoplifters. Shoplifters is a film that immerses the immersion of the soul. Focusing less on the actions happening around them and more of the facial, boldly and emotional reactions of his actors, the film is a true testament to the beauty of simplicity and minimalist cinema. One of the film's most powerful scenes, and easily my personal favourite, was a scene where we see the Shibata family collectively hang out of an open panned window, looking into the sky and stars, listening to the sounds and explosions of nearby fireworks. Hovering over the family like a precarious object, the camera captures the colours of its characters wonderment and marvel, as opposed to the fascinating and beautiful array of flames and fire in the sky. This shot alone showcases the very real and adorning obsession with Koreeda's skill and his fascination with human beings. Shoplifter's becomes a film who's universal look and bodily acting skills transcends language, countries, sects, cultures and religious beliefs. This scene alone had my heart fluttering with pure joy and happiness; a feeling that has been voided for me since seeing Akira Kurosawa's High and Low.To describe how simply sensational and dynamic Shoplifters is as a film is similar to trying to describe color to a blind person; it isn't a simple task and perhaps, in the end, no words or description may do a colour justice. Shoplifters is similar to this feeling and sensation; no matter how much I try to articulate my feelings towards it, nothing can prepare you for the level of hypnosis and the mesmerizing nature of a film that really only features people and the truly genuine emotions they express. Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters is easily the best film I have seen in 2018 and it is my highest recommendation to all lovers of cinema and lovers of people; It is a film that should be seen and embraced because, simply put, the film will steal elements of your heart...forever!",

            "content": "The dreaded word, 'heartwarming' is the most likely to be dragged out to summarise this but it would be unfair. Director Hirokazu Koreeda is much more interested in dissecting the true meaning of 'family' than pulling at the heart strings and producing sentimental tosh. Clearly a labour of love (and concern) he produces amazingly naturalistic performances out of a varied group of actors. It is also clear that Lily Franky has become a Japanese favourite despite the only other film I have seen of his, which was his first, the 2001 low budget semi-disgrace that was Blind Beast vs Dwarf! Mind you he was probably the only good actor in that and he is perfect here as the father (figure). Those brackets are important and even more so in relation to the 'mother' and 'grandmother' seen here as some sort of modern day saviours (or villains according to the police and accepted standards of morality). Mention must be made of the incredible performance of Miyu Sasaki who looks no more than four or five. Again, I assume we must look to the director as to just how such a remarkable performance was achieved. Apart from the serious question of 'real' mothers and what is best for children this film will be an eye-opener for those who know little of Japan or have just visited on a controlled tour. Here is the gritty underbelly, sex workers, day workers, pachinko parlours and seven elevens in all their tawdry glory. Plus a sample of the delightful weather, thunderstorms, snow storms and insufferable heat. But it is not all bad and without resorting to using the 'h' word I would say that this does paint a picture of a people dedicated to helping each other where possible and contriving to live under the most crowded of conditions. Gosh, I almost got through without mentioning the many scenes of slurping noodles - hot and cold! Minimal story but masterful direction of this (very) close knit family is bound to hold your attention.",

Might this family be a better environment for the girl than was her \"real\" family?There's nothing glossy here, just the straight, gritty stuff. It's a different image of Japan than we're used to seeing. We're used to seeing sensory overload, but here we see a brood on the margins. Every society is bound to have a homeless family or two: someone to do the work that no one else will do.Anyway, it's an outstanding movie. I look forward to seeing Kore-eda's next movie.",

            "content": "'Shoplifters (2018)' is a slice-of-life drama focusing around an unconventional family and their unconventional methods of adoption - which the government technically define as kidnapping. The piece posits that you can actually choose your family, and that the bond between these chosen family members may be even stronger than between biological ones. It explores how victims of abuse can band together to make sure the same thing never happens to someone else, how giving birth doesn't automatically make you a mother and how being forced into conventional dynamics can actually be more harmful than helpful. The majority of the run-time is dedicated to the everyday lives of the focal characters. It's not particularly remarkable but it's always oddly engaging. This is primarily because the piece does a tremendous job in dealing out its exposition, slowly but satisfyingly unveiling the true nature of each individual, their group dynamic and the events that lead to the overall current state of affairs. Indeed, every core player seems markedly 'real', which is probably how you're able to empathise with them so easily. This is the case even when they make questionable decisions, for you always understand their situation and - if you pay attention - actually have a rather keen insight into their motivations, too. It's remarkably nuanced right up until its gut-punching finale, which realistically unravels the idealistic status-quo to bittersweet effect. In some ways, this final act feels like the real 'story' of the feature - if this is the case, things don't really get moving until over ninety-minutes in. However, the movie operates as a kind of ensemble-based character-study. The large amount of screen-time dedicated to each character, and to the overall group, never feels wasted. In fact, this meandering development actually is the narrative. It's unconventional, sure, but it works. Of course, the thing isn't the most exciting, gripping or, even, emotional affair to be released. It isn't really trying to be, though. Its focus is on realism and an, essentially, unbiased portrayal of a family operating on the fringes of society. It's often funny, usually charming and always enjoyable. Plus, it's easy to get invested in its disparate set of castaways. 7/10.",

            "content": "\"Shoplifters\" (2018 release from Japan; 121 min.) brings the story of a family on the edge of society. As the movie opens, we see a man (Osamu) and his son (maybe 11-12 yrs. old) in a busy grocery store, and they are working with each other to steal various groceries. On the way home, they find a 5 yr. old girl who seems to be locked out or abandoned. Osamu decides to take the little girl with them. When they arrive home, it is an incredibly small place (2 small rooms) that houses 5 people altogether (not counting the little girl). Upon closer examination of the young girl's arms, it is clear that she has been beaten, mistreated, and/or worse. Still Osamu and his wife decide to return the girl, but when they hear the girl's parents in an all-out domestic dispute, they decide to keep the little girl a while longer... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Japanese writer-director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who previously brought us such great films as 2013's \"Like Father, Like Son\". Here he examines one particular family that is struggling mightily to keep things together financially, and hence resorts to shoplifting groceries and other necessities of life. The arrival of the little girl causes even more adjusting and yes, also tension, but it brings us to the heart of the matter in this film: what makes a family? and what makes a mother? The director, bless his heart, makes frequent use of long takes, where he simply lets the scene develop and it's almost like he is (and by extension, we are) simply observing and taking it in. Furthermore, the movie teaches us to not just assume things, and instead to gather all the facts before we come to any (nuanced) conclusions. The acting performances are top-notch. I picked up only one geographical reference in the entire movie (somebody mentions the Sumida river) that confirms the movie in fact does take place in Tokyo.The movie premiered at the 2018 Cannes film festival, and promptly won the festival's top honors (Palme d'Or). Then last week it picked up a well-deserved nomination for the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar. Alas, it is up against \"Roma\" in that category, which for me was the best movie of 2018, period (it got 10 Oscar nominations in total), so I can't see \"Shoplifters\" win that Oscar. But don't let that deter you for one minute not to see this. I saw it this past weekend at the theater, and the Saturday early evening screening was PACKED, I am happy to report (I'm guessing the miserable weather may have helped in that regard). If you like a top-notch foreign movie that brings a nuanced character study of a struggling family, I'd readily suggest you seek this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion",

This is the kind of movie about poor desperate souls living on the outskirts of society and still being human. It's something that I am accustomed to, as it seems the entire Romanian cinematography can only be about that. It was a bit unexpected for a Japanese film, though, to see an exploration of small time crooks, living outside society, almost a taboo in the little I know about that culture, and them being presented as very human and having beautiful souls.The plot is really unimportant, as the quality of the film is all about the details: great acting, attention to the little gestures, the subtle emotions and so on. It's an exploration of culture as a whole, not just the Japanese one, so in a way this is a very international film. Yet prepare yourselves for two hours of slow exposition of normal life. The movie is at the same time boring and wonderful and probably it takes one to be in a certain mood to fully appreciate it.Bottom line: Good acting, even from the very young, and a slow exploration of people's souls while they are living their miserable lives.",

Additionally, since domestic audiences aren't familiar with the actors, it lends an incredible amount of authenticity to their roles, further amplified by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda's impeccable camera placement.In the end, this isn't a film that leaves you either exhilarated or exhausted when exiting the theater.

            "content": "This was the first movie by the Japanese director Hiorkazu Koreeda that I've seen, and I was blown away. Koreeda, like his earlier works, continues his exploration of the true meaning of family in Shoplifters. This is breathtaking movie evokes so many emotions in the audiences and it does it so well, that its very hard not to connect to the Shibata Family. This is the second international movie this year I have seen about the repressed and the poor trying to live their lives, the first being Parasite. And it goes without saying, if you loved that one, then you'll love this one even more as Shoplifters is definitely more realistic and more powerful as a story.Shoplifters focusses on marginalized people existing on the fringes of Japanese society who barely eke out a living by engaging in activities that skirt the letter of the law. It is the story of flawed people who have patched together a working \"family\" of outcasts who believe that the impulse to survive and create a nurturing environment is more important than strict adherence to society's norms and blood relations.The film opens in a supermarket where Osamu Shibata (Lily Franky), a middle-aged, part-time construction worker, is seen exchanging strange hand signals with a pre-teenage boy, Shota (Jyo Kairi), who seems to regard what is going on as a family outing. It quickly becomes apparent that this is no ordinary family shopping spree but an exercise in shoplifting, as we watch Shota casually throw items from the shelves into his shopping bag when no one is looking. Justifying their flouting of the law, Osamu says that if the goods are in the store, it means that they do not belong to anyone, and tells Shota that they are stealing the items only as a means of helping the family. Much later when questioned about stealing by the authorities, sadly he says that shoplifting was the only skill he had to teach the boy.Osamu, as it is gradually revealed, is the part of a household consisting of himself and wife Noboyu Shibata (Sakura Ando), wife's teenaged sister (but from a different mother) Aki Shibata (Mayu Matsuoka), Osamu and Noboyu's young son Shota, and grandma Hatsue Shibata (the late Kirin Kiki), all living in a small, cluttered apartment outside of Tokyo, scattered with toys and knick-knacks everywhere, barely providing the family with enough room to eat and sleep.This warm but abnormal family is slowly revealed to be conjoined in ways we did not expect. The catalyst for this is dad and son bringing home a neglected 5-year-old girl, by the name of Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), they come across abandoned on an apartment balcony on a freezing winter night. The girl comes home with them, and slots into the family, a pattern, we slowly realize, that has been repeated in the past. Granny was 'picked up,' and the son seems to have arrived by similar means. Their warmth and humanity is at odds with the illegality and disregard for social mores. Society judges such people, but by allowing us intimacy with them, Koreeda shows how society is also judged by them - and found wanting.Shoplifters for its most part is focused on this families daily life and the problems they face emphasizing on their bonds, their empathy and their poverty. The slow revelation of the family's background, the naturalistic interactions, the judicious spacing of shocks and surprises, are all evidence of a master filmmaker in perfect sync with his material. Throughout the entire film, Koreeda does not stand in judgement of his characters but simple observes the trajectory of their life. Even when he moves into darker territory in the film's last section, its main focus remains on the humanity of the characters. When Noboyu disposes of an item that is a painful reminder for Yuri about the family that abused her, she gives her a big hug, explaining that when people love each other, they give them hugs and do not hit them. In an exquisite moment, Yuri places her hand on Noboyu's face who lets it remain there for a few minutes. These are flawed individuals and Koreeda does not avert a critical gaze from their individual responsibility.While Shoplifters contains elements that are painful to watch, what we take with us is Koreeda's empathy displayed in the beauty of small moments: The joy of trips to the beach and coming of age for Shota and Osamu handling it so humorously, the sharing of cold noodles on a humid summer day and the long repressed sexual intimacy that follows between partners, the expression on the faces of young children aware, perhaps for the first time, that they are loved; and the entire family listening to, but not seeing, a firework display (what a metaphor for this family's peripheral status!).The real joy comes from the way the whole thing gels and shimmers, and provides steely insight on contemporary Japanese society, and the human condition. This sense of realism and joy in small moments of life of its characters is communicated with simple gestures like the slurping sounds of noodles as the family eats dinner together, the way they follow small cultural beliefs and give the young girl Yuri salt to lick before bed so she doesn't wet the bed in the night, or the way Grandma hits a small metallic cup in honor of her dead husband every morning and Aki introduces Yuri to her new hair and name sitting in front of the mirror. It is through such small scenes that we can see clearly, that poverty is everywhere, but you don't need money or be related by blood to be a family.The cinematography is extraordinary, with some surprising long shots, close-ups and beautiful shots from tight angles. The editing is speechless, connecting numerous scenes just seamlessly. Not a single minute is wasted, and the film is largely intense and arresting. Together with the brilliant performances from the ensemble cast, the result is a satisfying and deeply affecting drama on lower class in Japan.The performances are sublime and it's more of a team effort as every character completes another and ultimately form an arc that tells the story in a brilliant way. Franky Lily and Kirin Kiki both are tonally perfect here. Koreeda shows that he has a deft touch with child actors. The maturity in the performance of both the child actors, Jyo Kairi and Miyu Sasaki is stunning. Sakura Ando is outstanding as the mother-figure, made wise by her bitter experiences but also upbeat in her approach to life. Her threat to kill a minor character is chilling. One scene, where she performs straight to camera, answering a question on what her 'children' called her, rips your heart out.Overall in a breath taking display of realism, Shoplifters tells a touching story that's seemingly simple at first sight but gets nuances to a point but the film sticks to its realism and dismantles the social norms with such grace, offering a new insight to a world unknown to most, where people long for family love and they're desperate to have someone to call family, on account of the raw emotions it conveys. The film explores big questions on living a good life and taking responsibility in an uncaring society. Shoplifters is a rare exercise of social realism and it gets its message across so elegantly making it filmmaking at its finest.Shoplifters is a simply stunning film and must watch for all.",

The movie casts a neutral light on this group without judgment or service to a predictable narrative arc. Still, it holds your interest, goes by quickly, and has a surprising finish that is both honest and shocking.The directing, cinematography, and score are all first-rate.

I wasn't impressed by the picture's meandering story line with it's series of abruptly ending, often disjointed scenes. I have an idea what director Hirokazu Koreeda was getting at with his central characters, but it doesn't help that most of them were unlikable, except for the very youngest girl Yuri (Miyu Sasaki). She had a waif-like quality that demonstrated her vulnerability, and I felt bad that she was being introduced to the sordid world of shoplifting to fit in with her street family after being abandoned. Actually, the theme of shoplifting doesn't even seem to be the main focal point of the story. Like the 'real' family in \"Parasite\", the characters here were getting by on their street smarts instead of applying their skills to acquire a better station in life. And then the deal with the old grandma Hatsue (Kirin Kiki); one day she's fine and the next day she's dead - what's up with that? I couldn't figure that one out, even if it was to highlight the break with her son's family and a source of income. Certainly the ending won't leave anyone feeling good about the outcome, with both of the young 'adoptees' facing an uncertain future with their real families. Even though I didn't care for the picture much, I'll be thinking about that ending for a while, perhaps even returning to the film at some point to take another stab at it.",

This Japanese foreign film tells the story of a family living in poverty and using any means possible to survive, including theft, sexual prostitution, and kidnapping.Osamu (Lily Franky) is essentially an updated version of Fagin with a heart. He works in a low-paying job as a laborer and teaches his adopted son, Shoto (Kairi Jo), to shoplift with pride just to make ends meet. However, Shoto has a moral conscience and begins to doubt this behavior as the norm. Also in this family unit are Osamu's wife, Nobuyo (Sakura Ando), a factory worker who is the family overseer, Aki (Mayu Matsuoka), who works at a sex hostess club, and Hatsue (Kirin Kiki), the elderly grandmother and widow who owns the house where everyone lives. One night, Osamu and Nobuyo discover a little abandoned girl named Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) who they discover is being abused by her natural parents and decide to save her. What was once a family of five becomes six.No, this is not your typical modern family and the narrative, while always compelling, needs more definition in its multiple characters, their actions, and their relationships within the family dynamics. A few rewrites could have clarified situations. Add to that, the film has major pacing issues, becoming far too slow-moving. Some scenes just do nothing to advance the plot, having quite the opposite effect.But there are many powerful moments that honestly deal directly with the socio-economic issues and our evolving idea of the nuclear family. Mr. Kore-eda examines this notion of family and our expected roles which intrinsically cause repercussions on each individual member. The director creates vivid images throughout the film. Its quieter sequences establish a sudden poignancy and pathos that allows his story to resonate (a melting snowman that was symbolic of a father-son bonding, a mother saying a final good-bye to her child, a old woman evaluating her long life, etc.). He also does not shy away from the harsh effects caused by poverty which continually traps and gnaws at its victims.The acting is uniformly strong. Especially memorable are Ms. Ando who brings such beautiful nuances to her strong maternal character and Ms. Kiki, in her last film performance, adding a special charm to her role as the cunning patriarch. Both of their final scenes are quite moving. The child actors give believable and natural performances that truly enhance the drama.Shoplifters has its flaws, but its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. Steal some time to see this worthwhile film.",

            "content": "In Tokyo, a makeshift, impoverished family lives together in the home of one of its members, a pensioner. Three of the adults have low-paying jobs; one of them plus a boy of about ten partake in shoplifting to help meet family expenses. One night, the family takes in a homeless girl of about six, not yet knowing that she is from an abusive home.Director/writer Hirokazu Kore-eda made a similar film in 2004: \"Nobody Knows\". Like \"Shoplifters\", \"Nobody Knows\" also delved courageously into the subject of children living poverty. While \"Shoplifters\" is one of 2018's most acclaimed films, I'm sadly an outlier on this one as I had mixed feelings about it though I did have a high opinion of \"Nobody Knows\".There are many curiosities regarding the characters in their difficult circumstances: while the adults are good for taking in children from difficult homes, there is a strong question of morality in teaching them to steal. In normal economic circumstances, this is clearly wrong but is this still the case where economic survival is concerned? Even some shopkeepers seem to accept shoplifting as a way of life for some. More could have been explored here but this area, like others, seems to be at loose ends by the film's conclusion.Kore-eda's directing style itself is ordinary even though the subject matter is not. The directing style could have been more impactful, perhaps like in the recent \"Roma\" where the ordinary was made fascinating. While the story and its characters are interesting enough, more is needed to justify the film's two-hour length - perhaps more characterization. \"Shoplifters\" also lacks a moral centre which is needed in a story that has so much moral ambiguity. Possibly, the moral centre is the young girl Yuri (a very affecting Yasu Hojo) if only for her total innocence in a very harsh world. - dbamateurcritic",

What follows is almost a utopic vision of family life, especially perhaps the idyllic outing to the seaside.Director Hirokazu Koreeda uses lots of close-ups where the profound humanity and truth of the characters rises to the surface of their faces. The effect overall is that of a stage play; there is a wonderful closeness or intimacy about this film on every level, physical and emotional. But there is much more to these marginalised characters and their relationships than is readily apparent. After the boy, Shota, is caught shoplifting their lives and stories begin to unravel in a surprising way altogether.Cinematography is pristinely good, especially the lowly placed shots. Screenplay is slow, but has a soul on its and the story blooms through its characters. Though a little bit on the lengthy side, editing is wonderfully crafted. Production design, costumes and makeup are brilliant. Music is subtle and used sparingly. All the actors played their parts quite convincingly, none of them trying to out perform each other. In short, together they looked like a family.Overall, Shoplifters is a clever and subversive film which asks profound questions about what makes a family, and what are the bonds that join us, while casting a wry eye on Japanese society. It is a film of immense tenderness compassion humanity and wisdom, which will not fail to move you. The film feels simultaneously hopeful and uplifting as well as harsh and depressing. The working class poor he depicts aren't cliched and downtrodden, They are bright and playful, canny and insightful, thoughtful and even philosophical. The movie will not be suitable to everyone, but for those who don't mind a slow burn, it is definitely worth a try. 7.3 stars out of 10 for bringing out several hidden themes & layers within.",

            "content": "\"Manbiki kazoku\" or \"Shoplifters\" is a new Japanese movie from 2018 and the most recent effort by writer and director Hirokazu Koreeda. He has always had an impressive record at the Palme d'Or Cannes Film Festival, but never managed to win the big prize. Well, with this movie he did and also garnered a huge deal of awards recognition all over the planet leading to the movie's Oscar nomination where it probably has no chance though going up against Cuar\u00f3n's most recent work. Anyway, back to this one here. It runs for two hours pretty much exactly and takes us into the world of a Japanese \"family\" living a very simple life with jobs that don't pay much and, as the title already gives away, sometimes they commit crimes to secure their existence. Even if the first scene is already an example of that and there is another involving fishing rods and another that results in a crucial plot twist, it never feels too much about shoplifting as I thought it could have been, so the German title is one that fits better perhaps. I think this film offered a lot of interesting moments. Koreeda is really a master of depicting the normal standard life of characters like you and me and still the interactions and relationships between these characters never become boring and you wonder what happens next. He has basically one crucial event most of the time, in the past a half-sister getting in touch with the other daughters of his father, and here a very young girl joining a group of people who have lived together for a long time already. I am struggling with the word \"family\" because there are no blood relationships between any of them. But they know and they don't care. And maybe what they have is the best they can get. Like the old lady enjoys living like a grandmother to everybody. And she really likes the young girl. So does Matsuoka's character. By the way, she is drop-dead gorgeous and anybody who isn't much into Asian women may change his mind after seeing her. Well, everybody kinda loves the little girl their very own way. There is one really cute scene involving Sakura And\u00f4, who is younger than I thought, and we see her hug the girl to show her what a loving mother acts like towards her child as a crass contradiction to the clothes shopping references that result in violence on several occasions, sadly also at the end.Yeah, the end and pretty much everything that follows the revelation and arrest add a really new note to the film and takes it into a completely different direction. This is not necessarily a good thing, it felt more exciting to watch before that and maybe that is also the reason why I am giving it \"only\" 3 stars out of 5. I mean it is not bad or anything, but to me it felt like a decline in quality, even if those moments of the boy saying \"Papa\" in the bus when he runs after him and the girl singing the song were very nice and show us the family feeling is buried deep in the kids' heads, even after everything fell apart. The grandma is dead, the mother is in prison and she accepted it because she enjoyed the last years, not because she wants the man to wait for her or anything. Back to the boy: His comment that he got caught intentionally was a bit strange and maybe there the movie wanted to be too much. Of course he didn't, but he said it perhaps because they wanted to leave him in the hospital. He was hurt. He was worried he was not good enough. That would be my explanation. As for the grandmother, I mentioned her on several occasions already and here's a few more words on her: I think if you look closely there will be many references visible about how she will die at some point. Her talk about the insurance, her talk about another grandmother dying and these are just the two I'm remembering right now. Her final words at the beach were of course telling too. She enjoyed seeing her \"family\" together enjoying the sweet life and each other's company jumping together in the sand and water and maybe it is good she did not experience how it all went wrong at some point afterward. There is no denying all the actors played their parts so well and it is virtually impossible to say who was best. Koreeda's writing (most of the time) and direction were also top-notch. And the little girl was just too sweet to be true honestly. I can see why everybody fell in love with her immediately and accepted her into their established circle really quickly. Asian film buffs will recognize many familiar faces here, not just Lily Franky, sure an unusual name for a Japanese male actor. Makes me a bit sad to see Kirin Kiki died in autumn last year like her character, but oh well what can you do. Like they say after her character's death, at some point it is time to go for everybody and that is certainly true. Overall, this was a pretty good movie and watch and I recommend checking it out, even if I think that the story arcs and narrative will not appear pleasing and pleasant to many audience members. But if you manage to open yourself to it, then it is a really rewarding watch. I just wish they could have kept the really high level right until the very end. The revelations about the duo killing somebody else in self defense, him wanting to leave the boy behind, the young stripper woman's destroyed hopes about being really loved by the old woman (as she clearly loved her) were really sobering and there is a lot more that fits the description. This is all about realism, about belonging somewhere, but also about how reality bites eventually and certainly not about highly unrealistic feel-good happy endings. Like real life you could say. Go see this film. I am already curious about Koreeda's next and I am happy that for this one here he finally received recognition from the Academy Awards and Cannes Film Festival. A definite contender for top10 best non-American movies of 2018.",

In both it is given that below the shallow beauty, calmness and sophistication of their respective societies lays canker, dissolution and dysfunction.We are presented with and it is later revealed an entirely mock family, we have the apparent hierarchy of grandma, mummy, daddy and children.Through various twists and turns the movie attempts to make a comment on the human condition, namely that blood may not be thicker than water and that pseudo family bonds can be forged in the face of avarice.This movie fails to engage the viewer on many levels, their is little character definition or development and as such we feel little sympathy for any of them. The constant repetition of \"its cold, it's cold\" irritates and the focus of nearly every scene are close-ups of quite disgusting table manners, quite a preoccupation with this director. Believe me acting props like this do not garner Oscars it is a cheap trick at realism.Over-all this was a dreary overlong kitchen-sink drama focusing on the ugly lives of ugly people. If revealed very little of the human condition and had the tendency to normalise the viewer to theft, vice, fraud, child exploitation, blackmail and kidnap without moral condemnation. I also sensed no redemptive qualities in its conclusions and this left a nasty taste in the viewers mouth.This was arthouse drivel that presented a mish-mash of vestigial thoughts, what was good, the cinamatography, apart from that why was this movie made and why did I sit through it, who knows!",

There was zero to nothing explored in this movie that I hadn't already witnessed from previous filmic dramas. I may have been emotionally affixed to the characters, but there still wasn't enough idiosyncrasy or even enough engrossment in the events/segments for me to appreciate its sum.

I wanted to like 'Shoplifters' but it just didn't work for me. Firstly, it's an extremely slow film. Now I have no problem with slow films simply for being the reason that they're slow ('Amour' is one of my favourite films of all time) but to be slow you have to have a couple of things. You have to have power and you have to have purpose. You need scenes that tell the audience a lot more is going on than meets the eye and you have to be subliminally telling the audience that their patience will be worth the wait. 'Shoplifters' had neither of those.Only the film industry could ask you to side with a family of shoplifters. It actually comes up in the film later on in terms of right and wrong with quotes such as \"Whatever's in a store doesn't belong to anybody yet\" and \"As long as the store doesn't go bankrupt it's okay\". Obviously films have the right to have their characters do anything, but in this case I felt like I was being asked to side with them.By the time the film started to develop a little and reveal itself I simply no longer cared. A lot of films set out to win awards, but some are better at hiding that fact than others. 'Shoplifters' felt to me like a film trying very hard to check all the boxes in order to win awards. There are some tremendous foreign language films out there. 'Shoplifters' isn't one of them.",

Regardless of your definition, Hirokazu Kore-eda' s Shoplifters will help define at least \"extended family.\" This Japanese dramedy defines love as a central ingredient of family, despite the fragmented, sometimes tumultuous, little world of adults and kids occupying a small Japanese-style hoe, where most of what you see strewn around has been stolen from unsuspecting merchants and naifs prone to believing grifters.Despite the formal nature of the film, romance is tucked away in heretofore unsuspecting corners such as everyone's love for and dependence on a 'Grandma\" (Kirin Kiki), like others in this family not blood related but bound by affection and needs to be fulfilled through the small community. After Grandma's support, the other major source of funds appears to be outright shoplifting, facility by children savvy and innocent enough to win our hearts and never lose them.Is this story funny?

            "content": "I must have heard about this Japanese film during Awards Season, it is certainly a title that is easy to remember, I knew it was well rated by critics and I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically, in Tokyo, Japan, the Shibata family live together in poverty. The elderly Hatsue (Kirin Kiki) owns the house and supports them with her deceased husband's pension, her daughter Nobuyo (Sakura And\u00f4) works for an industrial laundry service, Nobuyo's husband Osamu (Lily Franky) is a day labourer forced to leave his job after twisting his ankle, Nobuyo's sister Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) works at a fetish club (a peep show), and a young boy named Shota (Jyo Kairi) also lives with them. Osamu and Shota regularly shoplift from stores, using a system of hand signals to communicate. Osamu tells Shota it is fine to steal things that have not been sold, as they do not belong to anyone. The family often see a neighbourhood girl named Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) locked out on an apartment balcony, and one cold night they bring her home with them. They only intend to have her stay for dinner, but after finding evidence of abuse, they choose not to return her. Yuri bonds with her new family and with Osamu and Shota learns how to shoplift. Shota is reluctant when Osamu urges him to see Yuri as his sister. Two months pass, and the family learns on television that Yuri has been reported as missing, it was not her parents who reported her disappearance, but police are investigating. The family cuts her hair, burns her old clothes, and renames her Lin. Hatsue had an affair years ago and receives money from the son she had, the son and his wife are Aki's parents. The family spend a day at the beach, where Hatsue is content that she will not die a lonely death. Later that night, Hatsue dies in her sleep. Osamu and Nobuyo bury her under the house to avoid reporting her death to continue collecting her pension. Osamu steals a purse from a car, making Shota feel uneasy as he feels it is theft and goes against their moral code. Shota recalls joining the family after Nobuyo and Osamu found him in a locked car. Shota feels great guilt for teaching Yuri to steal and interrupts a theft attempt by stealing fruit from a grocery store in view of the staff. He is cornered and decides to jump from a bridge, breaking his leg. Shota is hospitalised and arrested by police. Nobuyo and Osamu are caught after attempting to flee with Yuri and Aki. The authorities discover Yuri and the death of Hatsue and tell Shota that the family was going to abandon him. They tell Aki that Nobuyo and Osamu killed Nobuyo's abusive husband in a crime of passion, and that Hatsue was receiving money from Aki's parents. Nobuyo takes the blame for the crimes to protect Osamu, who has a previous criminal record, and is sentenced to prison. Shota is placed in an orphanage. Osamu and Shota visit Nobuyo in prison, and she gives Shota details of the car they found him in so he can search for his parents. Shota stays the night with Osamu, going against the rules of the orphanage. When Shota asks, Osamu tells him the truth and confirms that they were going to abandon him, and he says he can no longer be his father. The next morning, as he prepares to leave, Shota says that he allowed himself to be caught. Shota boards a bus with Osamu running after it. Shota looks back and finally acknowledges Osamu as his father. Yuri returns home to her neglectful parents, and she looks back wistfully at the Shibata house where she felt she had a real family. It is interesting story of an unconventional family who resort to shoplifting to feed themselves, and their situation is made more difficult taking in an abused little girl, the performances of the cast are natural, the pacing and emotional tone are pretty good, and there is some good camerawork and cinematography, it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. Good!",

            "content": "I'm not sure I got all the implications of that big reveal at the end of \"Shoplifters\" and I'm not sure it did matter for writer and director Kore-eda to have us 'get' everything (if I dare make a bold assumption). Or let me explain this, what struck me in that film is that no matter how morally corrupt Osamu (Lily Franky) and Nobuyo Shibata (Sakura Ando) have been in this shady past of theirs, they did love and care for the children they had, and I use 'have' for the plot convenience of that word.Kore-eda made a personal hymn to Family that comes after a streak of movies I haven't seen and so I can only base my appreciation on what he said in a behind-the-scenes interview: \"Shoplifters\" was made after the loss of his mother, an event that entirely reshaped his perception of family and prompted him to make a family story where it's not about blood ties but something that goes beyond and runs just as deep. You can't really intellectualize that and cinema is a visual medium so let's just illustrate it through one of the film's most memorable and certainly the most poignant and moving moment.Some context is necessary. In the beginning, Osamu and his boy Shota (Jyo Kairi) finds Yuri (Jyo Kairi) a tiny little girl lost in the neighborhood, she's got a family but she's visibly distraught. Her parents aren't exactly looking for her and it's cold outside. What the Shibatas do is what any natural family would do. Take her to their home. Or maybe they would take them to the police, wouldn't they? Hence the necessity to introduce the father and the son as a shoplifting duo in the opening. Maybe. I don't know what I'd do instead, but I'm sure there's a limit to emergency and I wouldn't have kept the girl more than a night and the day after, she would have been given to local authorities.But the Shibatas choose to keep the girl, she's skinny, doesn't take much space and she's a cute little thing who brings her own innocent presence in a family of street-smart and cynical outcasts. Eventually, they adopt her and there's that beautiful moment where Nobuyo and Juro are warming up by a fire and Nobuyo is holding Yuri tight in her arms, wishing she could call her \"mom\". But gestures speak louder and more tenderly than words and as the hugging resumes and obviously Yuri wants also to display some tenderness, I was moved by the tears of Nabuyo who was tasting that moment like a candy from heaven. This is a mother in the sense that she's capable to give that love, but she's not in the sense that she hasn't children of her own. Or she couldn't have any.\"Shoplfiters\" is like that, about people who take what they can't get, and there's a sordid parallel between the fact that they shoplift grocery products and that the whole family structure is built on the same serve-yourself pattern. Nabuyo doesn't have a daughter but she took Yuri and since the love is mutual, that's it. There's an interesting moment where she says to the grandmother \"the family you chose is more important than the one you have\", while there's a bit of hypocrisy behind that statement (does the child have a choice?) the film somehow works as a hymn for adoption. But Kore-eda doesn't sugarcoat the material and never misses an opportunity to remind us that they're still criminals, petty ones but still.I don't know exactly what the deal was with the granny (Kirin Kiki) and her relationship with Aki (Matsu Mayuoaka) the young woman whom I couldn't identify as Shota's or Nabuya's sister but I have a feeling that the more I process it, the more likely I'm going to spoil that pretty little family portrait, whose momentum is reached by the sight of the five members on the beach playing with the waves, the movie poster. Not only is this image beautiful but it's the smile that it elicits on the granny's face that sells it, one of these faces that say \"I can die now\". Well she doesn't die right away after that.Through\" Shoplifters\", Kore-eda paints a delicate picture where the beautiful and the sordid meet, we see a family crowded in a shady place, the boy sleeps in a cupboard, and we see him and Yuri running together under the rain. The Dad is teaching fishing or magic tricks and the young girl is working in some weird peep shows to make ends meet and the couple are having sex and an aftermath many adults would relate to. Kore-eda leaves us with mixed feelings, we're not totally inclined to condemn the parents but we know they're guilty of the lives they led, their actions and the carelessness with which they handled their family life. It's not a moral film, but a commentary on the need for a family and some bonds that start as artificial, even illegal, but that grow and blossom into true love with the passing of time.There's a moment at the end when we get the feeling one of the victims is determined to leave that part and move forward but then, something happens that shows that you can totally ignore the good, even in bad people. For what's it's noble intentions, \"Shoplifters\" tend to drag on at times and I'm not sure I loved the way poor little Yuri ended but I guess closure can't be satisfying for everyone, or it would be a fairy tale. There's also some confusion on the way the father got away from the police but as I said, it doesn't really matter.The film touched me, deeply at times, there was a fine balance of amusement and shock that Kore-eda didn't overplay, it's a fitting Golden Palm winner and a smooth appetizer before the more shocking \"Parasite\".",

            "content": "'Shoplifters' by Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda confuses its audiences for much of the length of the film. For about three quarters of the duration of the screening, it looks like we are dealing with a family drama that takes place in medium of the poor classes of a contemporary Japanese metropolis. We see a needy family living in a kind of barrack, with the father and mother of the family performing poorly paid manual labor, which they actually lose one after the other, while serenely complementing the income with shoplifting in stores. They live together with a mother (or maybe grandmother) in her elderly age, and the woman's sister who works in a striptease parlor. Their boy does not go to school and is told that 'only those who can not learn at home go to school.' His 'education' includes dexterity in shoplifting. When a girl subjected violence in her family is adopted we seem to enter the realm of social melodrama. Something happens late in the story, I will not reveal what, and everything changes - the style of the film, and the image we acquired about this family that is far away from the image of a 'traditional family'.Leo Tolstoy warned is that happy families all look alike. The truth is, however, that the family in 'Shoplifters' seems to be too happy despite what they have to go through in order to survive. The details of the lives of those on the outskirts of society are rendered carefully and accurately. Social conventions that play such an important role in Japanese life and in Japanese films do not seem to work here. Although there are some premonitory signs here and there, the change in perspective comes as a surprise to us, spectators. The story is written and told in such a way that questions all the stereotypes that we may have about good and evil, about morality and legality, about death, but especially about family and children education.The tone of the film is generous and optimistic, and this is a sublimation of a message that we may find shocking after watching it all. I liked the cinematography, the actors' performances, the vision of a Japan different than the one we know as tourists or by watching the majority of the Japanese films. The risk, however, that director Hirokazu Koreeda has assumed is that the \"conventional\" part of the film takes too long. I confess that at some point I lost interest. The shock of the revelations in the last part of 'Shoplifters' woke me up, but the thread was already broken and it was not easy to find it again. However, the effort was rewarded. It's a movie that I recommend, a non- conventional Japanese film.",

            "review_title": "Actually quite enjoyable",
            "content": "This film is a minimalist and intimate puzzle about the nature of family. The story revolves around a stripped down cast of characters with meager posessions. This serves a stylistic purpose, but it also removes distractions from a plot that chooses its words carefully and thus ensures that the story does not get lost in a web of \"stuff\".While some reviews characterize the film, or just its ending, as sad, I did not find that to be the case. The ending is meditative, and ultimately leaves the viewer to consider a poignant but muted exchange between the Grandma and Nobuyo Shibata (played by Sakura Ando, who in my mind could have warranted an oscar nomination for this incredible performance). During a walk, Nobuyo muses that maybe the bond is more powerful if a former stranger chooses to be a member of a family. Hatsue (aka Grandma) responds that it \"will not last.\"I found myself reflecting on this conversation throughout the film and especially at the end. You can understand much of the two characters' behaviors through the lens with which they viewed family. In fact, much of the relationships in the film exist in pairings which to me pose this question over and over again and dissect the question from different but related angles: What is the meaning of family? Is it worth anything? Is it stronger if chosen? What is parenting? What do \"father\" and \"mother\" represent? How does one show love and intimacy?These are powerful questions delicately posed and thoughtfully rendered. If the director felt there was a clear answer, he was not heavy handed in his execution. I think the ending is actually quite hopeful on this wider question, even if some of the individual characters' fortunes may seem a bit melancholy. These material setbacks, to me, seem less consequential, and one can savor the greater war that was won in demonstrating humanity's capacity to construct a deeply fulfilling bond by choice, even amidst scarcity and depravation. I found this quiet battle of flawed, unlikely soldiers quite inspiring indeed.",

            "content": "Winner of Palme d'Or at 2018 Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters is a rich, delicate & bittersweet drama that's crafted with genuine care, told with heartfelt tenderness and ruminates on what constitutes a family through a humanistic eye that doesn't judge any of its characters & their deeds.Shoplifters concerns a group of people living together who rely on shoplifting to cope with their life of poverty. Despite barely making enough to survive, they live a seemingly happy lives but the bonds that unite them is put to the test when an unforeseen incident occurs and unearths hidden secrets.Written & directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, Shoplifters features a fascinating set of characters - each interesting in their own individual ways and exhibiting sufficient depth in their respective arcs - and through the little threads that unite them, he creates this semblance of a family living together under one roof.Kore-eda's direction is calm & composed, for he allows the plot to unravel at an unhurried pace, plus the silent camerawork doesn't get in the way of the drama unfolding on screen. The first half takes us through their daily life & shoplifting sessions in a heartwarming fashion, only for the director to uproot it all later to examine what makes a family family.While the deftly scripted characters & their dynamic with one another manage to retain a sense of intrigue throughout, there are also few stretches of slow patches that bog down the narrative, for there are moments that end up overstaying their welcome. Performances are top-notch from the entire cast, including the children who are outstanding in their given roles.On an overall scale, Shoplifters is a touching, affecting & emotionally captivating observation of family love that chooses to focus on the brighter side rather than dwelling on its characters' hardships. Powered by poignant performances elicited under Kore-eda's controlled direction, the film may seem aimless to some but its endearing portrait of ties that can grow between unrelated people resonates for far longer than its 2 hours runtime.",

            "content": "Director Kore-eda has done it again. Another searing family interconnected through intricate life experiences that shape their very own characteristics. To put it simply, this is a stunning piece of cinema. Heartwarming as it is thought-provoking. Social commentary as it is dramatic. Entrancing as it is contemplating. It acts as another pillar of excellence within Asian cinema, cementing the industry as one of the best. A poverty-stricken family regularly steal products from shops through an ornate method of hand gestures. One night they encounter a young girl locked outside of her house, to which they decide to bring her back for the night so she doesn't freeze, ultimately realising that she succumbs to abuse. They decide to keep her.Kore-eda offers an honest portrayal of low-class civilians within urban Japan, having to make ends meet in order to survive. A humanistic juxtaposition of the cold neglect from socially accepted behaviour with the warm contentment from dishonesty. It raises several commentaries on poverty, morals and Japan's increasing levels in crime (particularly shoplifting).But the most provocative message, which only comes into fruition within the third act, is the concept of motherhood. There's a poignant line that Kore-eda inserts that resonated with me almost instantly. \"It is assumed that you become a mother automatically after giving birth.\" That, right there, is a summary of Shoplifters. A brutal realisation of maternal qualities that vigilantly keep families under control. Individuals can misuse power and avoid responsibilities by abusing their children, but that doesn't make them a mother. Motherhood is warmth, heart and soul. Despite Nabuyo's unfortunate situation, she and the remaining family members have their hearts in the right place. The lack of funds only acts as a diminishing plot device that crafts the claustrophobic environment they reside in.In the end, Kore-eda's screenplay questions the idea of what makes a family, and he explores various answers through honest emotion. The clarity in characters, domestic drama and the environment, felt that it formed directly from Kore-eda's heart. Again, much like 'After The Storm', it's personal and personable. Needless to say I could go on endlessly dissecting various lines of dialogue. \"Don't make your sister do it\", \"Sometimes it's better to choose your own family\" and \"If someone hits you and tells you they are doing it because they love you, they are a liar\". This underlying sense of ownership for both material possessions and individuals, it just bursts through the screen instantaneously. Passion. That's what Kore-eda excels at. Showing passion.The cast give outstanding performances and allow the narrative's themes to come to life. Franky and Ando were mesmerising as the adult figures within the family, guiding their children with a dishonest yet harmless approach. Ando in particular gives massive complexion to her character that really shines during the third act. Kiki, in what was her final performance, was beautiful as the matriarchal representation of grief. The children, especially Shota and \"Lin\", gave convincing performances and equalled their adult counterparts eloquently.My only criticism would be that the character of Aki was underdeveloped and did not have enough screen time in comparison to the other family members. Scenes involving her provocative work lacked the finesse and power that the rest of the film prevailed in.Fortunately Kore-eda's precise directing style meant that the overall tone and message never diminished. Wonderfully clean long takes that enable the characters to naturally converse with each other unedited. Ryuto's cinematography was gorgeous as well, capitalising on the flourishing urban environment. On a technical level, this film is perfect. And, the more I reflect upon its entirety, the more I want to give it the perfect rating. However, due to Aki being a forgettable character, I just can't. That does not take away from the resonating experience that Kore-eda has lovingly produced. Heartwarming, endearing and emotionally involving. Shoplifters is a work of thematic art.",

The tale here confronts the very foundation of parenthood; the story dares to question the mundane definitions of lineage and family, as well as what it actually takes to be a parent for a child.What exactly do you mean by \"father\"? Who could be called a \"mother\"? Does giving birth automatically confers someone the right to be a guardian? Is it true that blood and ancestry come before all other forms of relation and rapport in this world? Is it truly necessary for a group of people to share the same blood to be considered a family?

As I watched this with fellow TMM reviewer Karl, he and I both made comments that this movie reminded us of the films of Edward Yang (\"Yi Yi\", \"A Brighter Summer Day\"), and any movie that draws comparison to Yang is one that deserves attention. This film is simple in its premise; really, it's all about getting to know these characters and watching their way of life. The brilliance of this film comes from Koreeda's writing, which slowly peels back layers of each character, revealing more and more through every scene. Every tiny revelation seemed to draw me in further to these people: they're some of the most well developed characters I've seen on screen in some time. Each character has their own flaws; deep and meaningful back story, and a lesson that they learn through their time in this story. Not one scene is wasted.I think really what drew me into this story the most was the compassion with which all of the characters treat each other. Every decision characters make is driven by a want to make someone else's life better; even the decisions that might seem wrong or at times disturbing, when viewed through the eyes of our family, makes sense when you think about how they're used to trying to survive. These people are fighting to be together because they truly believe that they're each other's best hope. While this film isn't exactly about happy things, the way that it is approached is so unbelievably optimistic; even in all these hardships there can be joy and hope. I feel like that message alone makes this movie worth watching.\nFor our full review of Shoplifters and for hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media!",

            "content": "The age old question \"What does it mean to be family?\" is answered in possibly the most heartfelt, beautiful way by the director Hirokazu Kore-eda. This question in itself is almost clich\u00e9 as even movies like \"Fast & Furious\" answers it superficially. The idea that the family that you choose is better than the one you were born into has also been explored to the death in many movies. But what makes this movie so special?The movie shows that love is transcendent. It doesn't care about its origin or even morals. It does not immediately reveal how the family came together and makes the audience believe that they are blood-related family. Even when the truth is revealed slowly, it's does not bring shock as it is told in a, subtle poignant and remorseful manner. It does not spell out everything for the audience on purpose. Though the family lives in poverty, it's clear that there is a strong bond between its broken members, which was only made possible by the stellar performances of all the cast. The mundane daily lives of this family are portrayed that reminds the audience of their own. It shows how dysfunction come together to function; how pieces come together to form wholeness. These seemingly normal days have the capacity to transform a person, as shown with Yuri. She starts as a young girl who is shy and clearly traumatized to fully expressive and loving. Through love, the cycle of abuse and generational trauma ceases to exist.Sense of moral is often not present for this heartfelt family at all. They've committed many petty crimes, largely shoplifting, but kidnapping and final disposition. Their crimes are horrendous from the outsider's one-dimensional perspective but the family justifies their actions based on the results. Osamu(Lily Franky) and Nobuyo's (Sakura Ando) crime of passion and consequent living together with Hatsue (Kirin Kiki) became the origin of the entire family. Shota (Kairi Jo) and Yuri (Miyu Sasaki) are both products of \"shoplifting\" them out of their abusive and/or negligent household. Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) works at a barely legal fetish club despite having a stable family. Burying Hatsue's body after her passing allowed the family to continue on as usual with extra financial security, albeit short-lived. Through all these actions that have permeated lives, the audience is compelled to empathize with their rationale and situation, rather than persecute and judge them.In the end, Shota's love for Yuri and his fragile moral code caused a cascade of events that disbanded the Shibata family. While Osamu acknowledges that though he's always wanted Shota to call him dad, he is not his father and is inadequate for Shota. Shota seems to agree at first but in the final scene, he silently says \"Dad\" as he gazes outside the window and sees Osamu trying to run with the departing bus. This was after Shota has lived in a community of kids, perhaps like a family, so we know that his acknowledgement is genuine. Whatever happened, the familial bond created by choice persists for Shota, through eternity.\"Shoplifters\" makes a powerful statement of the healing power of the transcendental familial love. Whatever your relationship with your family (or your chosen family) is, I humbly suggest that you give them a call.",

The emotional stress stays the same all along, aside from the little girl's situation (which stays pretty generic) there is no one you can really empathize with. Basically, gentle characters are well directed within an empty shell.In a nushell I enjoyed the craft but kept waiting for another dimension to materialize, and in the end this movie stands light years behind references like de Sica's Bicycle Thief or Kurosawa's Donzoko.",

It just felt really out of place and kind of random. It takes up about five minutes of the film, and it really kind of makes the feel out of focus. If that part was removed, the film would easily be a 4.5/5 (9/10).With a wonderful score, detailed set designs, amazing acting from all of the cast, and a beautiful story about the true meaning of family, Shoplifters is a great film, even if I disagree with it winning the Palm d'Or!",

            "content": "\"Shoplifters\" portrays a dysfunctional family that tries to survive, despite their difficult financial situation. The adults are teaching the kids how to shoplift, in order to get food. It is very obvious that the parents do not really want to improve their living conditions in any way. We discover later on that they committed some heinous crimes and their behavior is despicable. However, the director was able to show that these people also have a good side and they love every single member of this unconventional family in the same way. This is one of those movies that made me think a lot and it put me in front of many ethical dilemmas. I love when filmmakers portray real issues in front of a camera and make the audience waver. The general mood tends to be light-hearted, but the movie exposes several important and complex topics related to Japanese society.The cast was good, I have to praise the job done by Sakura And\u00f4, Lily Frank and Kirin Kiki, who were able to express in a convincing way many different emotions. Overall the acting is very natural, and this is what made this film great: it felt very close to reality. I enjoyed the photography, which is simple and yet interesting. The plot is amazing and there is a very dark and unexpected twist. Some elements of the plot tend to be a bit dragged: at times I wondered if the film would finally move on. Cutting down a few scenes would make it a bit more digestible.

It's a slow burn that seems to just be a simple portrait of a family, but then really opens your eyes in the last half hour and forces you to reexamine your beliefs about the characters. Some scenes seem isolated or not adding anything to the overall plot, but the more I mull the film over, the more I see small connections between scenes and the need to develop the characters as Kore-eda did. The last half hour of the film is shocking and exciting, and at the heart of it all is the question: what makes a family? Kore-eda doesn't give us a single simple, one-dimensional character - each is fascinating and flawed in realistic ways. I am still wrestling with the morality of the \"family\"'s actions. They were caring to the kids and perhaps did their best living on the fringes of society, and it's very hard to not sympathize with them. On the other hand, you do see the manipulative side of them come out on numerous occasions. Shota is a fascinating character as someone who clearly cares deeply for the family but also becomes uneasy with the morality of their stealing, and eventually it's too much for him. The themes and ideas will stay with me for a while, and I only wish more people would watch this movie and engage with it, because it does not disappoint.",

            "content": "SHOPLIFTERS / SHOPLIFTING FAMILY (Lit) (MANBIKI KAZOKU). Viewed on DVD. Director Hirokazu Koreeda (who is also credited as writer, co-producer, and editor) once again demonstrates his movie making skills in a tale about a family commune of mostly strangers founded and financially supported by a crafty senior citizen (played by the late actress Kirin Kiki) as \"insurance against dying alone.\" This engaging bohemian home drama (or Shomin-Geki film genre) features strong under-played performances by all lead actresses and actors (actress Sakura And\u00f4's quirky deliveries especially stand out) with Koreeda's ability to direct child actors providing one (but not the only) reasons to watch this movie. The film consists of a series of slice-of-life vignettes showing group and subgroup cohesion and interactions designed to build and convey (successfully!) warm fuzzies in the mind of the viewer. The vast majority of scenes involve eating (characters never seem to put on weight!) with this formula starting to become a bit of a self parity until the abrupt closing scenes involving police interrogations where revelations and resolutions (sort of) occur (perhaps too neatly?). Cinematography (many tracking shots), lighting, editing, and music (mostly keyboard, bass, and guitar) are fine. Subtitles are occasionally too busy, and not all text/signs and off-screen dialog are translated. Closing credits are translated, a welcomed rarely for a Japanese film! You will likely want to watch this more than once. Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.

            "content": "Shoplifters is the next film from Hirokazu Koreeda, who directed of one of my favorite foreign films After the Storm. Despite the acclaim that this director has under his built, I definitely struggled with this film. Although I was never really bored, I was certainly confused. Whether it was the family dynamics that kind of boggled my mind to the random vignettes of characters that were never brought up again or the lack of focus in the narrative, I was confused what I was supposed to feel. I am serious when I same the family dynamics really made no sense at first. By the end of it, I finally understood it, but I was just really wondering who was related to each other throughout the whole film.Many describe the film as a family drama showcasing a low-income family who lives crowded in a home together, but everything changes when they rescue an abandoned girl. It sounds emotional, beautiful, and heart-wrenching, but I got none of that. When I wanted to feel for the little girl who was abandoned and abused, to when I wanted to feel for the little boy, to when I wanted to see the fleshed our story of the stripper girl, to me even wanting to see the husband and wife rekindle their relationship, I got none of it.All I got was a series of sneak peaks to these stories, and it was irritating because the stories were never fleshed out for any of these characters. The director just went from person to person, and it never really flowed coherently for me. It annoyed me because the filmmaker had the characters and he had my investment, but he never took the time to flesh them out. Ugh it was annoying.Lastly, Japanese food is excellent I'm sure. But do we need to hear every character slurp when they eat? I wanted to slap some of these characters haha. But that is just my own issue with people who chew loudly.I will be sure to rewatch this film next week with, Burning but even if I like it more the next time, this definitely did not deserve the Palm D'Ore.Finally, this film is by no means bad, but I wish I cared more for what was going on throughout the film and actually have an emotional experience like most people are having.",

Shoplifters gave me an amazing new perspective of family because it told me that friendship can be stronger than family, because a true friend would never hurt you or put you down. A true friend would never want to hurt you because of something you did wrong. The thing that broke my heart about Shoplifters was that this \"family\" couldn't live together because it was technically illegal. It goes to show that even when someone tries to do what they think is the right and lawful thing, that doesn't mean it's going to do any good (in this case, the cops forcing the family apart, taking the little girl back to her abusive family, sending the boy away to a correctional school, arresting the women).Shoplifters is a very good, yet slow moving film.

Like Yasujiro Ozu, one of the greatest Japanese filmmakers to have lived, Hirokazu Kore-eda has an uncanny ability to create family-centric films both small in focus and broad in scope. This is an incredibly intimate film absorbed in the minutia of human behavior that simultaneously manages to ponder the very fabric of our relationships and societal norms.Also like the work of Ozu, Shoplifters demands patience. Kore-eda disorients the audience by dropping us into the world of these characters without expositional priming. He then slowly, expertly offers morsels of information that accumulate to reveal the true nature of this \"family\" and the morally ambiguous ways it came into being.The questionable actions of these flawed characters loom heavy over the film, to be sure, but Kore-eda's approach is one of curiosity rather than judgment. He observes them with great empathy, injects them with humanity, and endears us to them in a beautifully naturalistic way. In the face of the troubling revelations at the film's conclusion, we feel as conflicted as Shota in trying to merge our memories of these characters we've come to care for with the cold hard facts of what they've done.And perhaps that's the point here. Life, family, and human relationships extend so much further than those facts, or circumstance, or DNA. Kore-eda offers no easy answers to the questions he poses, but certainly gives a beautifully poignant film through which to consider them.Weak 4.5/5",

In many ways this is familiar territory for him - a closely observed story of an unlikely family on the fringe of society - a poor working class family who supplement their meagre wages through regular shoplifting. The father justifies it as the goods in the shop 'don't belong to anyone yet, so nobody is hurt'. This rough around the edges but open hearted family expands when they by accident end up taking in an abused little girl.What starts out as a slice of life film gets more profound as we realised not all is as it seems - and we start to question what it even means to be 'family'. Koreeda never force-feeds his audience with what he thinks, he lets us observe and come to our own conclusions.This really is one of his best - the only negative in the film is that the plot becomes a little contrived and didactic towards the end, and it requires a little suspension of belief. But its all carried off very well by a uniformly outstanding cast, with the usual Kore-eda mix of experience actors and newcomers.",

The whole concept of being so active and close to a child, is what the current Asian cultures have lost because of culture changes. I feel the demographic that the world is revolved around, the internet, has caused a great social disruption on the health of family cultures and values in Asia.\nAsian families are being more distant and rebellious against their family, which causes a great strain on the culture, and the government as a whole. The people fo the Asian countries are still being put out there as a conformed cultured people, but the people are more disruptive than they have ever been in history.\nWhat is also so real about this movie is the experience that the movie allows you to have. The movie does a very good job at showing the struggles of the vast majority of the people in the Asian countries, but the movie does hide the reality of the more traumatic and the slum image of the people of the community that this movie is alluding too. It's understandable why they do this, and if you don't know, it's because it allows the government to have better control of these people, because then it allows the government to have a standard where this specific community can strive to accomplish.\nThis community that these people are living I this movie, are more reputable than most people are in the country. These are more so around the lower middle class people in the Asian countries. Nonetheless the movie was great.",

They also take under their wings a young girl who is treated in a mean way by her parents.\nThe reason why this film works so much , is because it avoids the cliches and never feels too much and cheesy. Under the sweetness, lies a true sense of consequence and that's why it feels so realistic and powerful. The society will never understand true love and what's best for everyone. They will always jujde someone by looking at his/hers past and never appreciate those people who care and fight with love for the best. Truly profound.\nIts beauty lie in its small moments. The conversation between father and son about the son's sexuality and human desire, the diner scenes, a girl hugging one of her customers and feeling his pain and his want to be loved.\nWe all crave for love and when we find people who can provide it to us, we feel blessed. But even if they leave from our lives for a while. they still love us and we still love them.\nFriends and family are like stars. We might not see them, but we know that they are there.\nBeautiful film with a heart\n8/10",

From what I've seen of Japanese movies the lower class is usually not represented correctly, or not at all unless they're the \"endearingly bad\" supporting characters or secondary antagonists.This movie was tender and truthful, though at some times ugly. The criminal couple getting by playing house with kids they've taken in and living partially off a grandmother's earnings is not very flattering, but it creates conflict and a chance to switch the lens to \"odd\" families. It doesn't make the characters perfect but it makes them a little less than realistically flawed. Many familial issues are addressed and themes along the lines explored in a way that is approachable, making these characters have their own deepness and personality.It wasn't an average feel good film, I'll admit that. But it doesn't dismiss the utterly terrible ending. The ending feels like...some forced happening just to end the movie. Lin returning to her abusive parents irks me, and the sudden abandonment of Shota is unpleasantly curious. I understand; things can't always end well, but then again was this sort of ending necessary? Such a slow \"resolution\" and the prevail of abusive parents?Overall...I think it's not exactly a \"bad\" movie. But I wouldn't re-watch this, ever. Bitter endings can be done right and can be thought provoking when done right - and this certainly wasn't done right. I just wish didn't end on such a cheap note; I really liked the small-time crime family exploring the themes of toxic families and abuse, or what family really means. \"Found family\" is a timelessly gorgeous trope which can be done by almost any dolt - but this was a missed opportunity turned sour.

(I.e. in the first hour, you're guessing what is the situation with these people and their relationship.)Two things could have made it better:\nIf it was a true story (then I could accept that nothing really thought-provoking happens, but then it would desperately need to stick with one of the characters and see the \"story\" from their point of view.Cutting it to less than 70 minutes.If you don't watch it, you won't miss anything.

That of poverty and petty crime in Japan- but it really could have been anywhere in the world. At least that is what I thought. In truth, the poverty and the petty crime are just the setting, in order for the main underlying message to come to the surface.This is a touching movie about human relations, about a dysfunctional group of mainly non related people, who, by chance and/or choice come together at a certain point in life and try to make ends meet, while bonding as a real family would. The bottom line? Sometimes, the family you choose is better than your biological family, even if you do shady things collectively in order to survive. Perhaps, because you do shady things, the bonds strengthen.All the characters, while on a first glance dubious and opportunistic, quickly became very sympathetic and I could honestly feel the connection they cultivated, the love that they had for each other, even if they didn't admit it openly. The cast shone in their respective roles- especially the Mother, Father and the Boy. There are some extremely poignant scenes- the one with the fireworks comes to mind immediately- scenes that blatantly show that even if they are situated at the very bottom of society, they can still be happy and optimistic.It is a very realistic movie, very well directed and acted and it gave me a different perspective of things I take for granted in life.

            "content": "I believe that good or bad acting, writing and directing can cross and language barrier.\nAnd this movie is a a great example how it leads us into the complex relationships inside this family almost without falling into any clich\u00e9.\nIt works so well, that we fully understand the logic behind the illegal adoption of Lin/Yuri.\nA lot of story emotions are being delivered without the directors push them into our faces and that's what I really like likes about the movie.\nThe question what makes a family or parents what they are is being demonstrated over the film, rather that been asked over and over again.Everything works well until the moments that social services are getting into the picture.\nThis is where the acting, writing and logic failed in each and every scene until the last one.\nI believed the story as long as it was hidden from the real world. But once questions are being asked and they are finally being answered in such a clumsy way, without giving us a proper closure to most of the characters that it is unsetting.\nIt is has the heart of the movie died with the grandmother.\nI didn't expected to a Hollywood styles ending but, I'd expect something deeper that a long shot of Mayu Matsuka character's pooping her head into a the empty apartment.\nIs she clean if any charge? Is she still working as a sex-chat preformer? Does she try to seek for better life or she just look at the hollowness of her former fake life?\nThe social workers actors were too young, the rest was too unbelievable and it disturbed me so much that the last scene didn't work for me because I was so unconvinced that Osamu can just walk free out of this situation and meet Shota just like that.I wanted it to end in a high note that will crash my heart with the emptiness and sadness of the cruel reality but sadly it didn't happen.",

            "content": "In Shoplifters, we follow the daily struggles of the poor and unconventional Shibata family, who live in a cramped and rundown apartment in Tokyo. The family makes ends meet by engaging in petty crimes and scams, and they rely on each other for support and love.One day, they come across a young girl who has been abandoned by her parents and is living on the streets. Despite their limited resources, the Shibatas decide to take her in and care for her, and they begin to form a close bond with her.As the film progresses, we see the Shibatas struggle with their own personal issues and challenges, and we also see them come together as a family to support and protect each other. The film explores themes of family, love, and belonging in a way that is both heartwarming and heartwrenching, and it is a powerful exploration of the human condition.The acting in Shoplifters is superb, with standout performances from the entire cast. The young girl, played by actress Sakura Ando, is particularly impressive, and the chemistry between the actors feels authentic and genuine. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film.Overall, Shoplifters is a poignant and thought-provoking film that is not to be missed. It is a powerful exploration of family and the human condition, and it is also a moving and emotional story that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Highly recommended.",

Subtle, deeply intimal and raw, \"Shoplifters\" managed to stole my heart and resonate with me in the most inner parts of my soul.Beautiful colors and cinematography; fitting, non-intrusive music and a superb plot and performances by all actors, this film feels like a classical piece by a genius composer. An ode to art and cinema, \"Shoplifters\" nods to the all-time greats japanese films.I only gave it a 9 because of the anger and sadness that the second-act made me feel, because it does turns the atmosphere of the film upside down.Nevertheless, a masterful work by Japan's greatest working director (Alongside Miyazaki, who's on a break). I can't recommend it enough.",

Thus do we cherish or hate the change.\nWe get to see a family who appear to have little in means yet give, of the little they have.They help a seemingly abused small girl and this girls big change begins here. However, they all have a new additional member to get used to. This is the first phase the accustomization phase the change or changes that will effect them all. The second one is the cherish,joy and happy phase. The third phase i will not spoil.Within a little time we somewhat understand the storyline but it is the small intricacies that intrigues and when all the small pieces come together one realises the depth of the storyline that becomes more than initially anticipated. A renewed sympathy and respect to the characters unfold within oneself. Yet with some doubt as to their prior intention, but clearly understanding their intention at this point in time.\nA nice mellow movie that shows how people can be a positive or negative influence and focusing on the good even when dealt a bad hand. How being good to others makes you good and not being a force of evil is the best way to act.",
