            "content": "On the day of his wedding with Amy (Grace Kelly) and simultaneous retirement of the position of Marshal, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) receives a telegram advising that the criminal Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) had been released from the prison. Now he is coming to the town in the noon train to kill Kane, as he promised in the judgment. Kane arrested Frank five years ago and he was sent to North to be hanged. However he was sentenced to life and for some unexplained reason, Frank was pardoned and released. Three other gunmen are in the station waiting for Frank. Having less one hour and half to organize his defense, Kane tries to organize a posse but sees every citizen turns back to him, in a cowardly way and he stands alone against the killers.\"High Noon\" is a low-budget western with a tense and suspenseful storyline. The tension is built in real time and Gary Cooper has an outstanding performance in the role of a Marshal moved by his duty to protect the town that does not deserve him. It is sad to see his former friends finding excuses to turn down his request for helping. The performances are top notch and the viewer gets tense while the clocks show the fatidic noon coming. Grace Kelly is astonishing beautiful and finds redemption in the conclusion when she saves Kane. The final scene when Kane drops his badge on the dirty floor is memorable. \"High Noon\" is certainly one of the most credible westerns of the cinema history and might be one of the best. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Matar ou Morrer' ('To Kill or To Die')",

            "content": "John Wayne was totally wrong to call this movie un-American. Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back. With the new sheriff not due for a day, he just can't let go of the extraordinary sense of duty and responsibility he feels towards his town. However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose \"history\" with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad \"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\" by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces. There's nothing else to say - if you haven't already, go out and see this film NOW!",

The theme tune by Tex Ritter is also worthy of note.\u0091High Noon' works because of its tightly written script, its cracking pace and crackling tension.  I've seen the film many times and always see something different to notice and admire; still, I'd love to see it again for the first time and not know the twists and turns, not know how it ends.

            "content": "On Marshal Gary Cooper's wedding day to Grace Kelly, Lee Van Cleef, Sheb Woolley, and Robert J. Wilkie wait at the train station for the noon arriving train. It will be carrying their former gang leader, Ian McDonald who Cooper sent to prison and who's vowing vengeance. From the gitgo it's made abundantly clear that these are four nasty dudes who the town ought to deal with expeditiously. But the good elements of the town have grown fat and lazy and content to throw the responsibility of law and order on Cooper's shoulders. And he's quitting anyway, going on his honeymoon with his Quaker bride. A new marshal is going to arrive the next day. Why get involved. They want Cooper to just take his problem elsewhere. That view is probably best expressed by Thomas Mitchell in the scene at the church.Speaking of the scene in the church my favorite business in High Noon is when preacher Morgan Farley tells Cooper how dare he come into the church because a few hours earlier he didn't see fit to get married in that church. What a set of priorities.Grace Kelly had her breakthrough role in High Noon. She's a Quaker with deeply held pacifist principles. She's marrying a lawman, but one who's quitting that life. Her best scene in the film is with Katy Jurado who is Cooper's former gal pal. Katy explains the facts of life to Grace about marriage and the duty of standing by your man, long before Tammy Wynette ever sung about it. When the time comes, Grace does the right thing.Like his rival in western films, John Wayne, Gary Cooper had one of the great faces for movie closeups. Back in the day it used to be a running joke about how Cooper's dialog used to be just \"yep\" and \"nope.\" It was a good deal more than that. But High Noon's plot is carried quite a bit by the many closeup shots of Cooper. His face tells more than ten pages of speech and it keeps the tension of the film going. Man did not win two Academy Awards for nothing. Of course the theme of High Noon is also expressed in Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington's Academy Award winning song, sung at times during the film by Tex Ritter. However the big hit record of the film was from Frankie Laine. I doubt there has ever been a movie theme song that expressed everything you needed to know about the motivation of the central character in the film. I don't think High Noon would have attained the classic status it has without that song.Another great performance in the film is Lon Chaney, Jr. as the former town marshal, old and cynical, who'd like to help Cooper out, but at his age and health realizes he'd be more of a hindrance. He's the only one that Cooper understands and forgives.The final gun battle is choreographed like a ballet, it's that good. Maybe the best ever filmed. Can't describe it, you got to see it.The interaction of the town's responsibilities for maintaining law and order and Cooper's personal pride and integrity have been dealt with in various ways in other films. I'd check out Rio Bravo, Warlock, Death of a Gunfighter, Welcome to Hard Times, all of these take a different slant on the same themes.But personally I've always liked what the townspeople did in a Frank Sinatra film, Johnny Concho. That's what the people of Hadleyville should have done right at the start.",

            "review_title": "Citizen Kane",
            "content": "High Noon is one of the most loved films of all times thanks to the elements that came together to make it the classic that it is. The movie owes a lot to Fred Zinnemann for his tight account of this story by Carl Foreman. The film benefits from Dimitri Tiomkin's great score and the great cinematography by Floyd Crosby.This is a film that packs a lot of symbolism because of the times when it was done. Those were the days of the communist hysteria where many people in the industry were accused, tried and lost jobs because when they faced the HUAC and Senator Joseph McCarthy. Gary Cooper plays a man who is decent enough to return to the town where he just has gotten married and has finished his tour of duty. His conscience doesn't let him leave his post as he delays his  plans and goes back to defend the town from the bandit who's been freed by Northern judges, and is coming back to seek revenge from Marshal Kane and the town.\nGary Cooper embodied the all Amercian hero. He was an actor who could do no wrong, as he proves in his take of Marshal Kane. We see him as the clock is ticking away toward noon time when the train will arrive in Hadleyville. We see him perspire as he goes around trying to get people help him deal with the problem, to no avail; he will have to do it himself. In the process, he clearly disappoints his new bride, who is horrified at the prospect of losing the man she clearly loves.Grace Kelly was such an elegant figure that it's hard to imagine she would be in Hadleyville at all! Katy Jurado was also excellent as the jaded Helen Ramirez, the woman who owned a lot of businesses in town. Also effective, Thomas Mitchell, as the mayor of the town and Lloyd Bridges, as Harvey.This is a film to treasure.",

            "content": "...a quote from Men in Black that applies here if it ever applied anywhere.Gary Cooper plays marshal Will Kaine, who turns in his star immediately after he marries Amy, a Quaker girl (Grace Kelly). Upsetting the celebration is the news that killer Frank Miller is due on the noon train and his first order of business is to kill Kaine, a man who Kaine helped send to prison five years ago and swore blood vengeance at the time. The three members of his gang are waiting at the depot. Miller escaped hanging, got a long sentence, and some knuckleheads on the parole board have turned him loose. At first Kaine is with the popular sentiment - Run!. But then he realizes that Miller will lay waste to the town if he isn't there - the new marshal isn't due in until the next day - plus Miller will hunt him down wherever he is - Kaine will always be looking over his shoulder.He goes around looking for deputies to help him make his stand. Oh, everybody talks about what a good job Kaine did, but nobody stands up for him. They have all kinds of excuses. That a shootout will cause investors from the east and north to think their town is just another shoot em up town, that if Will isn't there Miller will just leave etc. In the end the result is NOBODY stood by him in his hour of need, in spite of the fact that many in the town owed their lives and fortunes to Kaine cleaning up the town.The best device in this movie - added after a preview called the film dull - is the constant showing of the clock, ticking away the precious minutes Kaine has. And he is a human hero - because you can tell dying is on his mind, running is on his mind, but in the end he stays to face his enemies. The scene towards the end, with him standing in the middle of a dusty abandoned main street as the camera pulls back just to show how alone Kaine is in this battle is iconic.Where is his wife you might ask? With a ticket in hand to get on the next train out. At least Grace Kelly's character has a reason for her pacifism - her newly found Quaker faith. What she fails to realize is that unless you are willing to be a slave you have to be strong enough that you can afford pacifism.There are some great performances here. There is Lon Chaney as the old sheriff who Will goes to for help. The old sheriff has the best excuse of all - he is just too old for this. Will would be looking after him instead of himself. Then there is Lloyd Bridges as one of the most unlikeable characters in film history. He's Kane's ex-deputy Harvey Pell and he is a weasel without the cuteness factor. He is tired of living in Kaine's shadow, just a little jealous that Kaine had Harvey's girl before he had her, very resentful that Kaine would not recommend him to be the new marshal. But here is his chance - if Kaine runs, Kaine is no better than he is. That is why he beats Will up trying to put him on a horse towards the end of the film. He doesn't want Will to live, he wants him to run, to somehow prove he is a coward.And you have to love the townspeople thinking that this will just \"all go away\" if everybody hides. The first act of the foursome of gunslingers when they hit town is not to kill Kaine, but to smash a store window and take a woman's bonnet that one of the killers fancies - an act of theft. They'll be stealing more than stuff by nightfall if nobody stops them.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The sombre ballad, the beleaguered marshall, the cold wife who deserts her man within an hour of marrying him ... \"High Noon\" is part of everyone's consciousness.       Will Kane is the veteran lawman of Hadleyville, a small Kansas town that used to be the playground of bad men, notorious among them one Frank Miller.  \"This is just a dirty little village in the middle of nowhere,\" but Kane cleaned it up.  Five years ago he had Frank Miller committed to a distant federal court on a murder charge.  Today, as Kane weds his quaker bride, news arrives that Miller is free and heading for Hadleyville.  His henchmen gather at the depot, and it becomes clear that Frank will arrive on the midday train, looking to settle scores with the marshall who arrested him.  Should Kane leave town with his bride, thus avoiding trouble for himself and for Hadleyville?  Or should he stay and face the Miller gang? Will the citizens rally round their marshall?     John Wayne famously criticised the film for being 'unAmerican', in that (in his view) a frontier community would not desert its lawman so abjectly. Implicit in Wayne's malediction is the notion that mainstream movies should promote wholesome patriotic values - a notion that led in Wayne's case to the debacle of \"The Green Berets\".  Zinneman's acclaimed film probes the ugly side of human nature, \"sifting out the hearts of men\".     Zinneman and Director of Photography Floyd Crosby devoted a lot of care to the look of the film, effort that paid off handsomely.  From our first view of Lee Van Cleef as an ominous shadow on the horizon to the climactic cuts which seem to accelerate the arrival of the fateful train, this is a movie which speaks through images.  The arid, flat expanses of Kansas mirror the impassive sky, and the town's rickety structures seem puny against the bleak magnificence of nature.  Human wishes are vain in the face of Fate. Rail tracks extend with cruel exactitude into the distance, converging in perspective upon the vanishing point, the symbolic spot whence Frank Miller will materialise.  Lurking in the depot's shade, the dark presence which is the Miller Gang bristles with malice.     Zinneman is not afraid of extreme close-ups, which he uses to reinforce moments of emotional power (Kane realising that he has no support, Helen refusing to beg).  He shoots Kane predominantly from below waist height, stressing his tall, erect stance as a symbol of moral authority. Compositions are tight and attractive throughout.     Gary Cooper was fifty-one years old and quite ill when \"High Noon\" was shot.  He is, in truth, too old for the part.  Gregory Peck had turned it down, and it is fascinating to imagine Peck as Kane.  There is no rapport whatsoever between Cooper and Grace Kelly, and they make unconvincing newly-weds.  \"I won't be there when it's over,\" says the blushing bride, and though the script tries valiantly to give Amy a motivation (she became a quaker after seeing her menfolk gunned down), the abiding impression is of Kelly's prissy coldness.     \"High Noon\" is, for an action western, surprisingly strong on character.  The judge (Otto Kruger) is clear-headed about running away from the Millers, and argues his position powerfully, yet his authority is punctured by his actions as he speaks - lowering the Old Glory, and concealing the scales of justice.  Lloyd Bridges is excellent as Harvey, the deputy whose moral vision is clouded by lust for Helen and immature resentment of Kane.  Katy Jurado never looked lovelier than here, playing the fallen woman Helen Ramirez who loved and lost Kane - and loves him still.  A young Harry Morgan is Sam Fuller, the self-important coward who cannot face Kane.  Marshall Howe (Lon Chaney Jr.) is the retired lawman who is now embittered and counsels Kane against throwing his life away for the sake of these undeserving citizens - \"They just don't care!\"  In a cameo of pivotal importance that must have been great fun to play, Howland Chamberlain is the bitchy hotel desk clerk who hits Amy with a few home truths.  James Millican is Herb, the dependable deputy who vacillates when the chips are down, and Jack Elam makes a fleeting appearance as the town drunk who sleeps through the entire drama.     One interesting plot development is the strange alliance which forms between Kane's two women.  They meet in Helen's hotel room and decide to leave town together.  Significantly, as they ride past Kane in the buggy, it is Helen who looks back, not Amy.     It has been suggested that \"High Noon\" obeys Aristotle's three unities, especially that of time, the depicted events being capable of fitting into the film's ninety-minute span.  Clocks are everywhere in Hadleyville, and the passing of the minutes is constantly emphasised.  My only observation is, it remains ten minutes to twelve for an unconscionably long time.     \"The day cometh that shall burn like an oven,\" we are informed, and I for one found the film's climax rather disappointing after the intense build-up.  \"It's our problem because this is our town,\" declares a local worthy, but neither he nor anyone does anything about it.  Zinneman's great crane shot, about halfway through the film, speaks more eloquently than the hollow words, zooming back to show a silent, friendless street, and one upright man, utterly alone.",

            "content": "For me, Will Kane embodies the American ideal of a hero: a man who stands up for what is right, even when nobody else does, even when the temptation is strong to stick the head in the sand.Will Kane explains his outlook at the outset: there is no point in running away if that means spending the rest of your life watching your back. His best chance is to face his enemies on his home ground. At this point, he still thinks that honest folk will stand by him. The rest of the movie is a study in character: will he stand his ground when his entire world crumbles around him?It is puzzling that Howard Hawks, John Wayne, and others thought of High Noon as un-American. I am not sure if this is because of the allegory of the McCarthy era; or the people of an American town collectively sticking their heads in the sand; or the Marshal throwing his badge to the ground in the last scene.Clearly, the movie does not criticize McCarthyism itself. (It has nothing to say about communism, either.) It appears to criticize the people who did not stand up to McCarthy and the HUAAC, but it can equally well be seen as a comment on the appeasers who did not stand up to fascism or communism.In any case, not too much must be made of the anti-appeasement angle, because the townsfolk is not the primary focus of the movie: the focus is on Will Kane. When the townsfolk behave like cowards, that gives Will Kane a chance to prove that he is a hero. If the town had stood by the Marshal, we would have seen, at best, an excellent Western like Rio Bravo, but not a masterpiece like High Noon. For Will Kane to be a hero, it is necessary that he stands alone.No statement can convey the dramatic impact of Will Kane throwing his badge away, but it is worth discussing what this gesture means. For me, it means that the town and the badge were not worth fighting for. Will Kane fought for principle: he fought because he does not run away.",

            "content": "\"High Noon\" is a text book on how to edit a film brilliantly, but it's awfully cold and impersonal as a movie. It creates a tremendous amount of suspense, but the whole movie is gimmick, and the suspense is empty. As most people know, it takes place in \"real time,\" so there are lots of cut aways to clocks underscored with thumping music, and montages of reaction shots of all the principal characters looking pensive. But stripped of its novelty after a first viewing and the fact that its gimmicks have been ransacked countless times by other movies over the years, there isn't much to revisit.I suspect Gary Cooper's acclaim in this role came from people who were tickled to see an iconic movie actor playing an iconic movie type, rather than because he created a flesh-and-blood human being that anybody really cared about. He's not required to do much but look resigned and stoic, which to his credit he does well. But I don't know how much of a PERFORMANCE it is.It's cool to like \"High Noon\" because it's been interpreted as an attack on McCarthyism, but that's not enough to make the film relevant today. It's certainly not a bad movie, and I get why it's viewed as an important one. Movies like \"High Noon\" are necessary, because they introduce new ways of doing things and add new phrases to film language. It's just that, with some historical perspective, it's obvious that it wears its schematics on its sleeve.Grade: B",

Of course the movie is not a blueprint of how Westerns worked back then and does have some social criticism. But it's also something that makes it almost timeless. Because what it does point out (put yourself into the main characters shoes), is relevant today and I'm sure will be relevant in a couple of years too. It's about human nature and about society.

Now I am not saying this is the best Western ever made--I can think of a select few that I actually think are a tiny bit better--but only by a hair's breadth. I do prefer my favorite short Western still is THE OX-BOW INCIDENT and the long but very satisfying BIG COUNTRY is an amazing and under-appreciated film that might also be better. However, what makes all three films so great is that they provide wonderful sociological lessons that are timeless and transcend the genre. The OX-BOW INCIDENT confronts mob mentality, THE BIG COUNTRY addresses what it's like to be a REAL man (not a cartoon cowboy) and HIGH NOON combines BOTH plots from these other two films. An exceptionally well-written film with great, great acting and insight into human frailty. About the only negative for me was the ever-present theme sung by Tex Ritter.

Most people first remember the Dimitri Tiomkin theme tune, then Gary Cooper stalking down the lonely street\u0085 The bits and pieces gather from there\u0085 The film also ties a small town of do-nothings showing their cowardice by turning their backs on trouble, integrity, and an elected representative...\"High Noon\" is also distinguished by many fine images from the incidental (the brief close-up of the wagon wheel revolving against the town's facades as Cooper and Kelly leave the community); to the poignant ( Zinneman's camera drawing back from Cooper's face to show him standing vulnerable and alone in the dust of a deserted main street); to the deliberately melodramatic (Cooper bitterly grinding his marshal's badge in the dirt before riding away for good ).By means of rapid cross-cutting, Fred Zinnemann gives shots\u0097repeatedly\u0097of the pendulum of the clock, of the empty railroad tracks, and in rapid succession, shots of tense faces\u0097taken at close range\u0097of the townsfolk in the church, in the local saloon, then of the worried face of the marshal, his wife, and of the three criminals ready for the approaching train...\"High Noon\" is the simple and forceful tale of an aging lawman on his day of retirement and also on his wedding day...Will Kane, on a blazing June morning in 1875, has just married a pretty young Quaker girl... The bride feels doubly blessed... She's got her man, and this is the day he will hang his guns... She has firm Quaker convictions and never did imagine herself as a lawman's wife...But, while it's all being celebrated a badly shaken stationmaster (Ted Stanhope) bursts in with quite the wrong kind of wedding telegram... It states that an outlaw Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) whom Kane had put behind bars six years ago for terrorizing the town has been released... The stationmaster adds that three members of his old gang are already awaiting his arrival at the depot\u0097their object a reunion with the pardoned man who will get off the train at noon, and presumably settle the score with Kane...The marshal, like a sensible man, does, in fact, put his wife in the buggy, but then like a man of honor but also a sensible man (for the gang will surely hunt them down wherever they go) changes his mind and heads the horses back to town\u0085A bride, especially a Quaker bride, can't quite see it this way on her wedding day so she hands him her own ultimatum\u0097if he won't go away with her she'll go alone by train\u0097the one that leaves at twelve...Everything on this torrid, dusty morning therefore hinges on midday\u0097therefore Kramer's insistence on his clocks. From this point onwards High Noon, although it remains completely classic in Western terms, faithful to period and concerned with an indicative historical situation, takes on wide and profound implications\u0085 It's about group cowardice and short-term interest\u0097particularly the treachery of so-called 'good' people\u0085 'Law abiding,' you feel, doesn't mean what it should mean\u0085 When a group of people decide that they must passively refuse to support the law for reasons of personal preservation, who, in fact, are the outlaws?Thus the marshal's predicament\u0085 He is an embarrassment to everyone, from Judge (Otto Kruger)\u0097he's leaving town\u0097to the humblest citizen of Hadleyville\u0085 Only one is ready to give assistance and he melts away when he finds there'll be no other volunteers\u0085 The marshal's immature deputy (Lloyd Bridges) is willing to take over his job\u0097again, provided Cooper leaves town\u0085 But this is absolute ambition at work\u0085The build-up of tension as the lawman prepares to meet the four thugs and makes fruitless attempts to recruit help from the cowardly citizens has never been handled better, and it is sustained right up to and through the climactic gunfight as the lawman's bride finds herself trapped in the crossfire...Filmed in Black and White, \"High Noon\" is among the ten Best Westerns ever made... The film achieved the shape of a democratic allegory which reached people in much the same way and for the same reasons that \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" had done... Its cutting suspense was the hallmark of Zinneman's mastery of the movie medium... Gary Cooper's performance, as the very vulnerable, worried man, won him the year's Oscar...",

Even though the difference in age between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelley makes the thought of their marriage seem a little kinky, it's easy to buy into the story. Katy Jurado is sexy, Lloyd Bridges is callow, and the townspeople mean well, but when push comes to shove, they reveal their cowardice. (If you remember the scene in \"Blazing Saddles\" in which Van Johnson says, \"Howard Johnson is right,\" you'll almost certainly laugh at an inappropriate moment in \"High Noon.\" ) \"High Noon\" is a textbook example of the storyteller's art. The drama begins with the opening credits and doesn't let up until everyone's true character has been laid bare. This one is suspenseful and thrilling, and I find more to admire with every viewing.",

            "content": "Three criminals wander into a Western town to wait for the 12:00 noon train to arrive. Their leader, Frank Miller, will arrive on it and together they will get revenge for Miller's jail time (he was supposed to be hanged). The man who put him in jail is Will Kane (Gary Cooper). He has just been married (to Grace Kelly) and is about to leave town, but he figures he can't while those criminals are there to start trouble. He goes back to raise a posse to take the outlaws before they can do anything. No can do, though. Everyone else is out for him/herself, and they all either refuse or ignore Kane when he asks them to be deputees.High Noon telegraphs its every move ten minutes in advance. There's nothing special about it, and its themes are rather trite. It would be passable if any of the performers were good. It's actually kind of depressing, considering how good some of them are elsewhere. I loved Gary Cooper in Meet John Doe, but he seems really uncomfortable in High Noon. We never really learn anything much about Kane, and Cooper only helps us know less. Grace Kelly is particularly bad. To tell the truth, she was never a great actress. One year later, in John Ford's Mogambo, she gave an equally neurotic and unbelievable performance. Only in Hitchcock's films, in particular Rear Window, did she shed that nervous quality. Lloyd Bridges - well, maybe it's just me, but I can never find him effective in a drama. He was so much better when he got older and started to do comedy like Airplane. Perhaps the only one on par with the rest of his career is Thomas \"Doc Washburn\" Mitchell.The villains are particularly pathetic in High Noon. I know, the \"real villains\" are those who refuse to fight, but the film would have been infinitely stronger if Frank Miller and the other three thugs had some personality. When a movie talks about a villain for 3/4 of its run, and then he appears without any bells or whistles, it's sure to disappoint. When the obligatory gunfight arrives, it's nothing if not boring. I longed for the dramatic effectiveness of the shootout in My Darling Clementine.\nHigh Noon is a film made with some skill. The cinematography is good. For some reason, it always got really good when they would cut over to the three outlaws waiting for Frank Miller. Those three actors always seemed to be standing in some clever composition. The only thing about High Noon that I would rate as exceptional would be the music. It's quite good, if a bit overused (especially during the gunfight sequence; again, I think back to the beautiful and harrowing silence of My Darling Clementine). Overall, I don't hate High Noon, but just feel it is weak and definitely overrated. 6/10.",

            "content": "To celebrate my 1700th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. Will Kane is the Marshal of the small Western town of Hadleyville. The action takes place on what should have been the happiest day of his life. He is newly married to Amy, a beautiful, much younger woman, and is preparing to retire when he receives two pieces of news. Firstly, his successor as Marshal has been delayed on his way to the town, meaning that Kane will have to remain in office for a day longer. Secondly, Frank Miller, a dangerous outlaw whom Kane once arrested, has been released from jail and is on his way back to Hadleyville, swearing revenge. He is due to arrive at the station, where the rest of his gang are already waiting for him, on the noon train- hence the title.Amy, who is a Quaker and a pacifist, begs Kane to flee before Miller arrives, but he refuses; he has never run away from his duty and does not intend to start now. In any case, if he flees the gang will only come after him. He attempts to recruit a posse, only to find that the townspeople are unwilling to help him. Most are too afraid; others worry that a gunfight might harm the town's reputation or its commerce. Kane's deputy Harvey, resentful that Kane will not support him for promotion, resigns his office. Kane only receives two offers of help, both of which he declines, one from a one-eyed old man, the other from a teenage boy.Upon its release in 1952 the film was highly controversial. Given that it came out when the Korean War was being fought, its political meaning seems clear. Kane represents America as the \"world's policeman\". Miller represents Stalin, and the rest of his gang are Mao, Kim Il-sung and other Communist leaders. The townspeople represent peaceniks and others in the West who are too cowardly to stand up for democracy. The film is therefore an allegory of the need for a strong stand against international Communism.Well, actually, I don't suppose that screenwriter Carl Foreman, a well-known Hollywood Marxist, had that particular interpretation in mind, but it seems to me to fit rather better than the one many people, both on the Left and on the Right, have tried to give it, both at the time and later, namely that it is an allegory of McCarthyism. (There is a certain breed of film historian for whom every film from the fifties was secretly about McCarthyism, every film from the sixties and seventies about Vietnam and every film from the eighties and nineties about AIDS).The McCarthy allegory never works for me because the situation in the film is the precise opposite of the one which confronted America in the fifties. McCarthyism was all about an abuse of state power; the film is all about an unlawful challenge to legitimate state authority, and it is Kane, the upholder of that authority, who is its hero. If Foreman really did intend an anti-McCarthyite message, it seems to have been well hidden- so well hidden, in fact, that it even eluded the film's politically conservative star, Gary Cooper, who always denied it was a propaganda piece.The real reason for this film's greatness lies not in its supposed political message but in the power of Cooper's acting and Fred Zinnemann's direction, with special mention going to Dimitri Tiomkin's musical score, based around his song \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling\". Cooper is now so firmly identified with this film that it is strange to think that he was not the first choice for Kane- that was John Wayne, who indignantly refused because he despised Foreman's politics. Nor was he second choice- that was Gregory Peck, who declined (something he later regretted) because he did not want to get typecast after playing a similar role in \"The Gunfighter\" the previous year. Nor was Cooper even third choice- Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and Charlton Heston also turned it down. We cannot, of course, know how any of those actors might have played the role, but Cooper makes it his own, playing Kane as the embodiment of courage and integrity.It has been said that Beethoven's Fifth Symphony does not contain a single wasted note, and I have similar views about Foreman's script and Zinnemann's direction. There is not a single wasted line of dialogue, not a single wasted shot. Everything seems to contribute to a perfect whole and to a sense of unbearable tension as time inexorably ticks away, leading to the inevitable shoot-out between Kane and the outlaws. The tension is increased by depicting events in real time, with frequent shots of clock faces emphasising the passing of time between 10.40 am, when Kane first learns of Miller's impending return, and noon.\"High Noon\" was nominated for seven Oscars and won four, including \"Best Actor\" for Cooper and two (\"Best Score\" and \"Best Song\") for Tiomkin, but lost out on \"Best Director\", \"Best Screenplay\" and \"Best Picture\", something which has been blamed on the political controversy surrounding it, although it may also have had something to do with the Academy's traditional snobbery about Westerns. (DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", which did win \"Best Picture\", is a decent enough movie but not in the class of \"High Noon\"). Although the likes of Wayne and Howard Hawks (who were later to make \"Rio Bravo\" as their reply to it) attacked the film, not all political conservatives disliked it- President Eisenhower showed it at the White House and Ronald Reagan ranked it among his favourites. Sixty-five years on we can see just how right Ike and Ronnie were and that Wayne and Hawks, for all their talents, on this occasion made themselves look foolish. 10/10",

            "content": "This is one of the best films ever made-both formally and because of how the text intersects with reality. The movie at its core is a slow build-up of a marshal asking for help against a gang only to be hung out to dry by his community. The film proceeds in near real time. The entire story is about 105 minutes-10:30 am until 12:15- while the film is 85 minutes. Like a Chinese puzzle box the film fits together such that each minute of screen time is just over a minute of story time. The editing-as well as the direction-is so tightly constructed most people think the story is in real time. And it is not just showing off. The build-up and pacing are big reason why the film is so intense no matter how many times you have seen it. Cooper's raw and pained performance of a man approaching his doom is the other reason why the film is so intense no matter how many times you see it. Add in the script packs so much history, implication and theme in 85 minutes and you get why this is considered a classic.The film is often read as an allegory or parable about Hollywood cowardice during the Red scare of the 50's-this is one of the reasons why Hawks and Wayne loathed the film. I am sure that was an influence but I think the film is open ended in its symbolic meaning. It is really easy to read any principled person taking a stand against evil while being abandoned by their alleged friends. For example, I am writing this on 5/12/2021 and the GOP House Caucus is about to vote to remove Liz Cheney from leadership because she refuses to lie for Trump; the election was not stolen. That is a High Noon moment and despite being 70 years ago the film resonates with it. The film is political because it is about living your principles-and because of the wife character how hard that can be-even if you lose friends. But that political situation comes up a lot. This is a great film-it is little wonder that politicos are so drawn to it.",

Gary Cooper is superb and the supporting cast is outstanding as well (although I wish Grace Kelley would have spoken without the artificial sounding school-girl accent, something which marred so many of her otherwise fine performances). I do not read into the film a commentary on events of the 1950s, specifically the ongoing investigations by Congress of left-wing activities. High Noon transcends such specifics as this. I know John Wayne called the film un-American but I must disagree. I have great respect for the Duke but think he got this one wrong. Weak, timid people are everywhere and the strong are often few and far between. Goodness and right often prevail because a small minority insure that they do. All benefit from the courage of the lonely hero whether they realize it or not. Hign Noon is a testimony to this truth.",

            "content": "High Noon (1952)People study \"Stagecoach\" to see what John Ford did to make a modern Western tick, and they study \"High Noon\" to see how Zinnemann did. And both films, besides being iconic Westerns at each end of the classic Western period, are independently produced films (this one by Stanley Kramer). \"High Noon\" is a masterpiece of construction, of mythic West storytelling, and of allegory. Even in the first ten minutes the plot takes on several directions. There are old icons of Hollywood in new and old roles (including good old Thomas Mitchell, who was in both films, and Lon Chaney Jr.), and the photography and music are interwoven and masterful even as they are in service to the director's high goals.Watch, even, as the stagecoach is racing out of town with our two romantic leads, played by Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly (an unlikely but well cast pair). The first hints of something not quite right occur with a glance down by Cooper, as if checking the reins but you know it's more than that, confirmed by a flatted note in the music, down a step instead of up. It's subtle, but that's what masterpieces are about, every small thing fitting into the larger one. It's crisp, fast, forceful, and yet also remarkably subtle all through, with consistent lighting from close up to far shots (this is outside, with fill light), and with a whole vast crew of bit actors giving nods or glances or worried looks in succession.Floyd Crosby as cinematographer is the one surprise in the crew, relatively inexperienced, but he pulls off a sharp, dramatic job, never distracting, always emphasizing the action perfectly. Some of this credit goes to Zinnemann, of course, who is an old hand by this point. The music is very strong (a critical dramatic component) and Dimitri Tiompkin is maybe the best along with Bernard Hermann of the purist originals of this period (I put it that way to leave out the obvious master, Max Steiner, who was an appropriator and adapter as well as original composer). And of course it's the repeating, almost droning rhythm of the theme song, sung and played by legend Tex Ritter, that defines the movie in our memories.Clocks are a major character of sorts, because the movie is shot essentially real time, and as the first clock shows about quarter to eleven, we know there is just over an hour until, yes, high noon. A key moment, as tension builds, is when the unsavory hotel clerk is seen adjusting the clock--ahead, by five minutes. The train arrives at noon with a dangerous killer recently released from jail. Trouble is inevitable. How to deal with the trouble is what the movie is about.Gary Cooper is the paradigm of solitary justice. He has every right to be bitter and angry, and yet he is going to do his job. If a gunfight seems inevitable (just as it did in \"Stagecoach\"), it's the leading up to it that is what matters. It's amazing to read (in all kinds of articles) about the reactions to the film, and to varying interpretations of the character and the events. On the surface, it's plain to see that this is about good over evil, but some people (like the Soviets and the conservative Republicans of the 1950s like John Wayne, believe it or not) found it unsavory that the sheriff would be so humbled in this situation. Yet Eisenhower showed the film countless times at the White House. And so did Bill Clinton, who said it was his favorite film (not \"Deep Throat,\" mind you).Director Kramer was mostly puzzled and hurt by all this. In all, it's just a good movie about some ordinary folk trying to get things right, with their flaws on view. And it really is about the strength of the individual against the mob, even if the public, the community, doesn't come to help. Whatever your politics, you'll have to like the movie on some level. Even if you don't like Westerns, the filmmaking is so good it all rises above.",

John Wayne actually called the film \"un-American\", and was still trashing it twenty years later, which is pretty much the highest honor you can receive.It must have also bothered Howard Hawks, because the \"chicken\" sheriff led Hawks to make \"Rio Bravo\", which, surprise, had John Wayne. As an interesting side note, Cooper was conservative, too, but I guess not as much as Wayne or at least not as emotional about it.The film is called \"a western for people who don't like westerns\". I can see the point on that, but I do not know how accurate it is. I liked it, and I do not normally like westerns, so I probably should not argue.

            "content": "High Noon is the movie that John Wayne didn't like. 'This is the most Un-American movie ever made!' He quoted about the film. He later teamed up with director Howard Hawks to make the great Rio Bravo (1959) as a counter-response. Neither Hawks nor John Wayne liked that Western, which was embraced by film critics. Both director and star felt that the film's defeatist spirit severely deviated from their idea of what the Real West was all about. The biggest complains that Wayne had, was the Marshall putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it. Walking away from his job, as the Marshall did, was inconceivable to Wayne's commitment to responsibility and public office. In my opinion, it's a great western direct by Fred Zinnemann, starring Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Cane. John Wayne was a fool. I never liked his over-acting, and he played up the big \"military man\" persona even though he dodged the draft. Props to him for popularizing the Western genre, but he was wrong with this. Still, I agree with some things he says about the film. I believe that the good, honest American people should had stand by and shouldn't left Will Cane go out alone to face the gunmen that were not only threatening him but the peacefulness of the town itself. Wayne thought an American town would stand up with Cooper against the bad guys. I agree. The pacifism that the film was mistaken as Communists message as the communist were promoting pacifism in the U.S at the time. I really doubt that. The movie contains highest praise of free society, free speech, hence of all iron and noble American values in the first place! It's a story of heroism. Released at an unfortunate time, got falsely misinterpreted as anti-McCarthy propaganda, which it never was meant to. Honestly, I don't see how the movie is anti-blacklisting and communist baiting. The movie has nothing to do with it, or anything similar to those courts. While I hate McCarthy trials, I just can't see this movie being an allegory for the McCarthy hearings. John Wayne, on the other hand, was a supporter of the Hollywood blacklisting and the hunt for communists. There's nothing left-wing or anti-American about it. The film is in nearly real time, the film tells the story of a town marshal forced to face a gang of killers by himself based on John W. Cunningham's pulp short story, \"The Tin Star\". This movie was cool because it was an hour and a half long movie and the time in the movie was also about an hour and a half. Movie starts when it's a little before 11am and ends a little after noon. The background tempo and the music beat takes the place of the clock ticking with each 4 counts of the beat, sounds like a countdown was amazing. Will has just married pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and turned in his badge. He intends to become a storekeeper elsewhere. Suddenly, the town learns that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a criminal Kane brought to justice is due to arrive on the noon train and leaves Marshall to deal with him. The acting in the film is great. It's hard to think that Gary Cooper had a bleeding ulcer at the time of filming because you can't tell. Very powerful. Each character even the baddies are given their moment. The Lon Cheney JR character seems the most tragic. Also this marks the debut of Lee Van Cleef in film and in Western. Lee Van Cleef's face looks so tough he could dull a Gillette razor just by staring at it. Grace Kelly also gives the film, her own spin. The age different between Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly was alarming and bit disturbing if you think about it. It's still a love story as well. What Amy Fowler does in the end moved me more deeply than any other moment in film. She had to go against her beliefs. She stands by him because he is her husband, and she is his wife. The movie in a way, is a celebration of the institution of marriage. The theme song of High Noon, 'Do not forsake me, My Darling\" written by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter, is awesome. This movie is how I first became aware of Tex Ritter. It's an unforgettable song. I seem to hear an honesty in Tex Ritter's voice that is unequaled. The movie also has an excellent and highly suggestive play with imagery. In one scene, the camera focus on a certain chair. It's the chair in which the villain Frank Miller sat in when he was sentenced to jail and now he's coming back. The movie center theme has endured for years because its essential truth endures: we can never really know for sure who's got our back. Sooner or later most of us find ourselves in a position, to one degree or another, where we realize that everybody else has troubles too, and we're just going to have to figure things out for ourselves alone.",

Gary Cooper fans will find this to be one of the best, if not THE best, Cooper performance. The plot, the performances, the brutal series of events leading up to the final show down gun fights all contribute to a feeling one has that it truly is noon day with a relentless sun beating down. This is a Western which almost makes one smell the dust of the town streets. The sheer masculinity of Marshall Kane is beautifully balanced with superb feminine grace and strength found in Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado. Ian MacDonald's Frank Miller comes across as a villain par excellence. This is a perfect presentation for black and white. Color would have diminished the sense of impending death that builds relentlessly with each coward's refusal to help Marshal Kane. The film emphasizes that triumph often comes with a price. In the end, Kane removes his lawman's badge and throws it down into the dust, and he rides off with his Quaker bride who must forever live with the fact that she took a human life in violation of her religious convictions. Courage and valor do not come easily.",

This is the gold standard by which Westerns should be measured, not to mention any drama.

Katy Jurado' role is one of the exceptions, where there is more talking, but we see unfold an exceptionally interesting person. How many movies can you watch repeatedly over the years as you grow up and grow old that continue to move you and continue to reveal new depth and meaning? That is the measure of art.This movie is timeless, and has a lesson for humanity of all eras and all nationalities. It will be watched a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, if civilization survives that long. The message of this film is that this is not at all certain. It is up to us.I suspect the reason some people down-rate High Noon is not for the quality of the film, but the message. Like John Wayne, they just don't like what it says about America. Well I've got bad news for you, John, the Frank Millers have killed the sheriff and now run this country. The gang has gotten elected president and vice president. And the townspeople and ministers acquiesced like sheep or even actively supported it as \"good for business.\"",

The film is about a small town sheriff who must basically stand alone to defend the people from a wild gang of outlaws who have just been let out of jail. Although he does not have to and the town really does not deserve saving, Cooper stays and decides that he will do the job that he was hired to do. \"High Noon\" is not only a western, it is a mirror to our society.  It is very accurate in the fact that in the darkest of hours, usually you have to stand alone.  In short this movie proves that you have friends when you do not need them, but when you need them, they turn their backs on you.  An outstanding western and an outstanding film.  5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "\"High Noon\" has always been one of my favorite Westerns, heck, it's one of my favorite films altogether. The theme music stays with me for days after each viewing, not such a bad thing, though my humming does grate on the rest of the family. My unofficial count after today's viewing caught eight instances of the theme interspersed with scenes from the movie, not counting the complete rendition offered at the opening.Director Fred Zinneman broke ranks with many Western film traditions in his approach to this classic, and concentrated on three main ingredients to build suspense in the story. The threat imposed by the returning Frank Miller was continually reinforced by the still shot of the looming railroad tracks on which the villain would arrive. Marshall Kane's (Gary Cooper) repeated requests for help would be summarily turned down by virtually everyone in a town that feared for each individual's personal safety. Thirdly, the repeated use of the clock image, beginning at 10:40 A.M., is used as the countdown mechanism to herald an impending confrontation; it's use helps build suspense right up until the fateful steam whistle sounds at high noon.The reason fans can relate to Gary Cooper's take on Marshal Kane is a movingly human one - he can admit that he's scared. Yet there's that gnawing sense of duty to service and facing one's challenges that surfaces and takes over to drive Kane toward his destiny. That doesn't mean that Kane can't despair when his only ally deputy Herb (James Millican) backs out. Sure, John Wayne might have handled it differently, but that character would have been a caricature. Kane was about to face his mortality, and it wasn't a rosy picture.One thing did puzzle me though. Once the showdown began, the first time Kane is fired upon by an off screen gunman, the bullet strikes the side of a barn about a foot over his left shoulder. At the same time Kane grabs his upper left arm as if he was wounded. His shirt from that point on is torn as if damaged by a bullet. The ballistics involved for that scenario just doesn't work, the bullet would have had to bounce off Kane's arm in an impossible trajectory.I got a kick out of Lloyd Bridges' recollection of the fight scene in the stable between his character Harvey Pell and Kane. Lloyd's son Beau was six years old at the time and he wanted to witness the filming of the scene, so dad hid him in the hayloft above the stable. When Cooper doused Bridges with a pail of water at the close of the scene, Beau burst out laughing, and they had to shoot it all over again!Upon repeat viewings, you might pay attention to some of the nuances that give the film even more subtlety and substance, like the look Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado) gives Harvey when the Kane's ride back into town, or the barber regarding the number of coffins the town has on hand. I got a kick out of that actually, note the sign in the barber shop offering 'Complete Funeral Service and Undertaking'. Nice touch.For it's effort, \"High Noon\" took home four Academy Awards, led by Gary Cooper's Best Actor. It's theme music was rewarded with a Best Original Song along with a Best Scoring Oscar. Not too shabby for a genre traditionally overlooked by the Academy.For me, \"High Noon\" is one of those pictures that I like to bring out about once every year or so just to keep me focused on what good, tight story telling is all about. It's a classic underdog tale that ranks right up there with films like \"On The Waterfront\", and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", as the lone protagonist finds the will to rise to the occasion and stand up for what's right. For Western fans, it stands alongside \"Shane\" as one of the best of the genre, without using a lot of complex techniques to explain itself.",

            "content": "Like \"Shane\", \"High Noon\" is another Western that has ridden to film critic heaven on the back of Oscar victories. It's up to me to point out that the emperor has no clothes. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, just that it is overrated.Let me start with the positives:The movie is well paced. There is good tension. Most characters are well developed. It is well acted. Katy Kurtado, who has the only quality supporting role as a Mexican store owner/slut, has a great line where she tells Lloyd Bridges that Gary Cooper is better than him because \"Hees a mehn!\" Loved that.OK, I'm done with positives now.Here are the negatives:The basic plot doesn't make sense. This movie is often referred to as an example of an individual's steely resolve to stand up against wrong, even though abandoned by friends and society. But Kane runs like a rabbit as soon as he finds out the Millers are coming. It's only when he gets a couple of miles out of town that he realizes that he only has an hour head start on them. He tells his wife that they have no choice but to go back to town. \"They'll just catch us alone out in the open prairie,\" he says to Grace Kelly. \"My only chance is to stay in town and get help\".So, Kane did not stay out of principle. He stayed only because he had no other choice. Yet for the rest of the movie, Kane doesn't make that argument to the townspeople. In the final church scene, there are seven or eight men who are strongly inclined to support Kane. However, town elder Thomas Mitchell wants to avoid bad publicity and tells Kane the solution is for him to run.. Why doesn't he reply to Mitchell, \"You're telling me to commit suicide, it's too late to run. I need help now and you guys owe it to me\". Surely if he made that simple, compelling argument, his supporters would have come to his aid. Instead, he just glares at everyone and storms out.The Grace Kelly character makes absolutely no sense. How can she abandon her husband five minutes after she marries him because four guys want to kill him? He already told her that to leave town was virtual suicide. The age difference between Grace Kelly and Gary Cooper is disturbing and distracting. She looks like she's fifteen, he looks like her grandfather. Cooper was only 50 when they made this, but sadly, he was not a well man at this stage of this life. He looks closer to 60 in this movie.Kane's the hero of the story, but he's hard to admire. He seems too afraid of the bad guys. Also, he only prevails after his Quaker wife dry gulches Ben Miller. Critics wax poetic about this aspect of the movie, telling us that \"High Noon\" was the first \"anti-Western\", where the hero isn't brave. Fair enough, but I don't like anti-Westerns. I'm a Western fan. If I was anti-Western, I would watch musicals or romantic comedies, not \"High Noon\".The principal heavy is almost completely uncharacterized and is off screen for most of the movie. When he finally shows up, he looks like an accountant on vacation at a five star dude ranch. Only \"Butch Cassidy\" has a more poorly developed bad guy.What's so interesting about this movie being a metaphor for the HUAC investigation of communists in Hollywood? Who cares?And while we are on that subject, if this is movie such a liberal metaphor, what's with the tirades against weak courts releasing murderers? Isn't that a right wing rant? My head was spinning through this whole movie. \"Hounding Communists is bad and so is trial by jury.\"This is a strictly back lot \"town\" Western. While movies with similar story lines obviously have few opportunities to film scenic backdrops, may directors find ways around this (George Stevens in \"Shane\", for example). This movie feels less like a real Western and more like a intellectual Broadway stage play with cowboy hats and spurs for props.There is not an iota of comic relief. I mean nada, niente, nothing. I read that Jack Elam's drunk had a comic scene deleted. Was this to keep the movie to its gimmicky \"real time\" length? If so, it wasn't worth it.Another plot hole. Mrs. Ramirez is so afraid of Frank Miller's vengeance upon her that she fire sales her business and skips town. She then proceeds to deliberately catch Miller's eye at the train station. He hardly seems to recognize her, much less attempt to punish her for her sins against him. Maybe Kane should have bought a train ticket too. It seems to provide full protection against ex-con gunslingers bent on revenge.And while we're on that subject, why would the Miller gang let Kane's wife waltz out of town on the train? Their many friends in town would surely point her out to them. Another reason Kane can't run. He has to stay to protect her, even though she's abandoned him for.....well, for staying to protect her? Like I said, the plot is irrational.The ending was much too abrupt. Another time saving measure?Finally, I'd like to know how the burning barn mysteriously extinguished itself. At the end all the townsfolk are crowding around the dead bodies, when they should have been scrambling to keep their homes from burning down.",

That grim-faced determination suggests that he doesn't think about moral matters and the right thing to do. Instead, he feels the right thing in his gut, and it's a lot harder to ignore your feeling than it is your head. So there he goes, down the street, because his gut won't let him do otherwise, the town and even Grace Kelly be darned.This has got to be the least scenic of any western on record. But who cares since the story is a compelling one. The narrative may not vary from a simple plot line, but it's a pregnant one for judging people. Then too, looks like the production must have cost about 50 bucks since the action takes place on a western set in the middle of LA. But again, who cares since the tension mounts like a first day at school. Cheap or not, my only complaint is a pale, almost washed-out b&w photography. But then that works in favor of the story too. There are no visual distractions. After sixty-years and a thousand westerns, the movie remains a stripped-down western classic, political allegory or no.",

            "review_title": "A 'Western' psychological masterpiece ... transcended by an unforgettable music ...",
            "content": "Some remarks tell a lot about their authors' artistic conceptions. Howard Hawks said that \"High Noon\" wasn't his idea \"of a good Western\". John Wayne went even further, saying it was the most \"un-American thing\" he ever saw. Even Roger Ebert disliked the film and so did many viewers who -I guess- expected fights, chases, vast landscapes and other Western archetypes.I find these views artistically oppressive. Fred Zinnerman's masterpiece \"High Noon\" is a pure and authentic western with an innovative psychological dimension, incarnated by Will Kane, Gary Cooper in a career-defining role, and more than in any film, sublimated by a beautifully haunting song.'Do not forsake me oh my darling' \u0085 The first notes with their catchy poetry and lyric purity, plunged me into the heart of the film, penetrating mine. The genius of Dimitri Tiomkin's song is its total embodiment of the film's inspirational message of moral duty and obligation, about a man who must face the killer whose rhyming name is Frank Miller, and ask his woman to stick with him. And as the song is like hummed throughout the score, I couldn't help but feel a total empathy to Will Kane, Hadleyville's Marshall, and ask myself, what would have I done if I was Kane? Or a more disturbing question: if I was a member of the town? These interrogations takes a darker significance when put in the context of the film's release : the McCarthyism. The story has valid reasons to have been called \"un-American\", as this absurd word totally fits this infamous period. It's about a man, in danger of death, finding out that none of his friends, of the citizens he protected, volunteers to help him, standing for him against a deadly enemy, but all push him to leave Hadleyville, in a town's self-preservation impulse. The McCarthyism allegory of the blacklisted Carl Foreman's script couldn't have been more explicit. The most iconic shot of the film, is Gary Cooper standing alone, while a slow zoom out reveals a deserted street while you can see the frustration of a man, abandoned to his fate.It's a pessimistic view intelligently tackled by Foreman's script. All these people have 'reasons', starting by Amy, Kane's Quaker wife, Grace Kelly as the fair-haired beauty who rejects violence, and doesn't want to trade her new white dress for a black one. Some friends refuse to help Kane out of obvious cowardice, or admittance of physical or outnumbered weakness. \"Thou Shall Not Kill\" says the reverend and the people in church start a whole argument until the Mayor makes a long speech concluding that Hadleyville's prosperity asks for Kane to leave the town \u2013and transfer the shootout out of it. Harvey, the immature deputy, played by a young Lloyd Bridges, wants to take the credit alone but conveniently drops his tin star when Kane refuses to name him Marshall. And finally, as stated by the cynical judge, sometimes, returning tyrants can be acclaimed as heroes by the very city that banished them, an irony demonstrated by the cheerful reception of Ben Miller in the saloon.Frank Miller's arrival ultimately highlighted Hadleyville's hypocrisy and meaninglessness of Kane's tin star. And from the announcement, we follow in real time, Kane's vain attempts to recruit a posse. The doors constantly slammed in his face make him more endearingly heroic as a man who faces an unfair adversity. Asked to leave the town, he obstinately stays and stands alone. Kane can't leave the town without a Marshall although he knows Miller comes for him. But he knows he couldn't escape forever, he must face him. Cooper hardly smiles during the film, his face almost agonizing with an increasing pain devouring his heart as he's realizing some disturbing truths. He embodies the tragedy of a man, left alone to vultures. He deserved the Oscar in this performance that exuded the bravery of a man who sticks to his moral duty despite fear, doubts, hesitations, even weaknesses. Will Kane is one of the most fascinatingly inspiring cinematic characters, rightfully named #5 hero in AFI's Top 50 list.And the one who understands Kane, as we do, is Helen Ramirez, the beautiful Katy Jurado who should have won an Oscar for her performance. Obviously shocked, she tells Amy that if she can't understand Kane, it's useless. Katy loved Kane after being Miller's girlfriend. She enriches Kane and Miller's antagonism, by making it more personal, deadlier. Helen Ramirez mirrors the viewer's fascination toward Kane and a true contempt for the townspeople.The story of \"High Noon\" is classic, but its handling by Zinnerman is fundamental. The film is shot in real time punctuated with many clock shots indicating the time left before noon. The plot is a long build-up, carried by the score resonating with a growing solemnity, as the editing's pacing accelerates. The suspense culminates at noon, where we get to see all the protagonists in close up, contrasting with the deserted sight of the town, and time going faster and faster, until the train whistles.If some elements of the climactic shootout objectively dated, it didn't affect the film's greatness. When the first gunshot is heard, Helen's dark and sincere eyes proved to have affected Amy who gets off the train, joins her husband and uses violence despite her reluctance. The last gunshot concludes one hour and half of a psychological torture with the mark of hypocrisy, when the town is instantly submerged by the people 'coming to see'.And the ending couldn't have been more satisfying, before getting into the buckboard, a relieved Kane condescendingly looks at the townspeople, removes the tin star and drops it into the dusty ground, an iconic ending celebrating bravery and morality, and an eternal response to all the cowardice, the hypocrisy and the blacklisting in the world.With all due respect, Mr. Hawks, Wayne and Ebert, \"High Noon\" is simply perfect the way it is",

Hoping to convince townsfolk to join his cause to \"persuade\" Miller to avoid a mistaken gunfight, Kane tries and fails. So as the clock ticks to noon, Kane comes to a realization that the odds are not in his favor. With a Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) he had just married attempting to motivate him to leave town with life intact, Kane's integrity and pride won't allow him to. Kane's hotshot young deputy, Harv (Lloyd Bridges) wants Kane to leave so he can be given the spot as top dawg, but Will thinks he's too immature and not ready. After boozing up in the saloon, losing his \"claim\" to Will's former girl, Helen (Katy Jurado) who is planning to leave on the train, and hearing about Kane's courage even as no one seems willing to help him, Harv is set to do whatever he can to get the marshal to head out of Hadleyville\u0085he's so insistent that Will leaves on a horse Harv would even saddle, a fight ensues! Guess who comes out the victor of those fisticuffs? Marshal Kane goes to the saloon and soon to church, looking around for anyone who will become \"special deputies\", but the town debates and questions his facing Miller and the obvious results of violence that will occur, defaming and ruining a well-built positive reputation. Miller's men wait at the depot for their leader to step off that noon train, and Kane's time (as the pendulum of the clock continues to rock back and forth) draws shorter and shorter. The film has that fantastic \"the seconds tick and the faces of the town are shown in deep concern\" with that train's whistle sounding off like a death siren. The streets are empty, the anticipation is on the faces of Miller's men's faces (including a young Lee Van Cleef!), and the agonizing look of concern on Kane's face tells the whole story\u0085he plans to die in Hadleyville, with no support by the very ones he was sworn to protect by the tin star pinned to his vest. There's an aching moment where Will watches as his wife and former flame ride to the train, and that feeling of abandonment rests on his face quite vividly. Kane does his duty, upholding it by using his intellect and the town's many hiding places (the stables, back yards, fences, etc.) to get some sort of advantage despite being outnumbered.There have been certain criticisms towards it that interested me. Kane's throwing the tin star to the ground after the men have been taken care of with all the townspeople flooding the street (Where were they when he needed them? Can you really blame him for feeling so betrayed?). Kelly's Amy coming to her husband's aid by shooting one of the gunfighters (He had no one else! And they had multiple guns firing at him.) And the emphasis on finding help and seeking support from a town he was a great deal responsible in civilizing and making healthy enough for families and progress instead of action and gunplay (The killer wasn't in town yet, and his boys were waiting for him to arrive before confronting Kane; and it's reasonable that Kane would try to find able-bodied men to back him up. Also, this is a town full of men; the sheer number should be enough to spook Miller a little bit.). So while there's this idea that subliminal messages on the Communist witchhunt was included within the context of Kane's struggle, I looked at the film as one man's mission to do the right thing and face what comes with that decision because he feels morally obligated to take this stand even if the town wishes he'd just leave. A woman's forgoing her religious belief of not killing (because her father and brother both died thanks to the gun) in order to save her man and it really stems from his no-win situation\u0085if she doesn't help him then he'll surely perish. Kane dumping the tin star makes sense to me because he received nothing from those he protected, and their cowardice despite all he had accomplished for them (he arrested Miller and allowed the justice system to run its course; it's not his fault the man was freed) left him obviously wounded. No gunfight except that final ten minutes added to the build up to it\u0085the wait until noon developed the dread of it, with the town caught up in the fear of Will asking them to back him up. So it's a classic worthy of its status as far as this western fan is concerned. The judge (Otto Krueger) leaving town (packing up all his law items and heading out), the old mentor (played by Lon Chaney, Jr. revealing a tired, weary old man no longer able to stand and fight as he once did) unable for health reasons to give assistance, and a colleague secretly hiding (Harry Morgan of M*A*S*H & Dragnet) and forcing his wife to lie on his whereabouts; these individual scenes infuse that Kane keeps looking (even a volunteer soon backs out when he learns that Will has no other backup) and failing in his task because of numerous excuses. That's the point: Will tries hard, leaving no stone unturned, and is left to fend for himself.",

The opening song by Tex Ritter may contain the odd clanger (\"made a vow while in state prison, swore it'd be my life or his'n\" is something of a stretch) but it works well in context.I could talk forever about the black and white cinematography, which doesn't quite have the innovation to approach noir, but is superbly shot nevertheless or the film being set in real-time. But what really grabs is the way the movie discards all western traditions. The lead hero gets to admit he's scared, gets to cry, considers running, and the final scene is played out without dialogue. A lesser film would have required Cooper to explain exactly why he throws away his badge. Here the audience is regarded with the intelligence to work it out for themselves as he takes his new wife and rides away. This scene was singled out by boorish plank actor John Wayne, star of many a bog-standard peer, for being \"un-American\". Wayne gave Cooper his Oscar, and expressed approval of Carl Foreman's script, yet was later responsible for getting the writer blacklisted. So not only was he a militant, he was two-faced about it to boot. Maybe Wayne was wary of the competition, as Cooper gives more emotion in this single film than Wayne would do in his entire career. Another footnote to this development is Howard Hawks writing Rio Bravo for Wayne as a response to this movie. There John would turn down all offers of help and not complain about the job, just like a real, pig-headed macho bore would do.While the clock ticks away waiting for Frank Miller to arrive and exact his revenge, we are treated to the incidental characters, all of which have a point of view. Around the halfway point we get another clever blurring of the lines, where it's revealed not everyone thinks that Will Kane (Cooper) is in the right. It's this grey area of suspicion which gives the film an added dimension. The villain is not bad to some, the hero not a saint to many. There are some thoughtful lines, too, like the judge explaining what happened in a similar situation in Athens, 5th Century BC. You wouldn't get that in The Magnificent Seven.All the actors can't claim to be first rate \u0096 the two female leads are quite poor, fluctuating from wooden to melodramatic and back again. But the males making up the majority of the cast \u0096 Cooper especially \u0096 are perfect. And when you learn that the film was an allegory of the McCarthy Witch Trials it's the icing on the cake. 8/10.",

It works well both as a suspenseful adventure film and as a piece of social commentary in which the subtext explores the tendency of the general population not to get involved in dangerous matters. The film's positing as an allegory of the Communist witch hunts only makes it more interesting.In any case, this is a slim, minimalist piece of film-making which feels clean, fresh, and unmuddled. Gary Cooper is the retiring marshall of a small town which is about to be visited by a murderous outlaw who Cooper previously sent to prison. He's coming in on the twelve noon train, swearing vengeance. Thus the film plays out almost in real time, with that great ticking clock plot device that other films like 3:10 TO YUMA would also utilise to ratchet up the suspense.The cast has some interesting supporting players in the forms of a youthful Grace Kelly, a cameoing Lon Chaney Jr., and Lee Van Cleef, who makes for a more imposing villain than the main bad guy. The whole film is about the build up to a rattling climax which is one of the best western showdowns I've seen. HIGH NOON is a film that doesn't disappoint and I wish I hadn't waited so long before watching it.",

            "content": "High Noon (1952) :\nShort Review -A Western Classic that Salutes Real Brave Man and Slaps cowards. Undoubtedly, the most powerful Marshal film ever. High Noon appears as fast tracked and real time thrilling experience that will certainly win you heart. You would want to salute the real brave man in the film and clap for him. A honest and brave marshal finds himself in trouble when none of the citizens come out to help him against 4 criminals, not even his own bride. But he ain't spineless, he stands tall against all odds while rest of the spineless creature run back. While watching the film i literally had tears in my eyes when i saw a man who gave his entire life to help people and to service the law gets no help at all. This is the Time when you realise who's the Real Man and who are just useless living coward creatures. There're couple of scenes in the film which hit my heart, when Ramirez talks about Kane being a Real Man, that church scene when a woman yells that how Kane has changed our lives from a Dirt to clean town. High Noon doesn't waste a single moment to build up the story and there's not a single boring moment when you can take off your eyes in 85 minutes runtime. Gary Cooper shows a real courageous man and you just can't hate him. Deserving Oscars i say. Gorgeous looking Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado have small roles but important ones. Director Fred Zimmerman pulls the trigger on right time as he seamlessly buils up tension, suspense and ends it with proper action. High Noon also has several iconic scenes and dialogues which have influenced many Cop films over the years. In short, High Noon is Remarkable achievement and inspirational showcase among Brave-hearted films. The only minor complaint i have is, High Noon could have became a People's Film if the Climax had been little different. It Focuses on One Man's courage when it could have became an inspiration for the unity and Society. This is just so freaking awesome for the time it released. A Must See is the least and worst i can say.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

In trying to set up a posse, the townspeople are resistant when asked for help.This film is highly praiseworthy for many reasons. The brilliant screenplay shows different reasons for the people to support and not support the marshal. Though the spirit of the story takes one of those sides by the end, it doesn't moralize by being one-sided as all characters express their reasons for their choices very well.The directing by Fred Zinnemann is also top-notch. This film is unique in that it is done in real time. The tension is obvious using techniques such as camera angles (showing clocks in the background reminding us of the upcoming noon train arrival) and brooding music. This works beautifully during the climax and the buildup toward it. The ending and its preceding buildup are among the best in any film.Zinnemann's touch shows in his work with the actors all of whom show emotion in their faces. Cooper is especially effective. He clearly shows the look of someone forging ahead but also visibly upset from the betrayal that he faces. There is also fine work from Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Juarez.A genuine classic worth repeated viewings. - dbamateurcriticRating: 10 out of 10Award-worthy Achievements:1) directing by Fred Zinnemann2) screenplay by Carl Foreman (based on \"The Tin Star\" by John Cunningham)3) acting by Gary Cooper.",

            "content": "A production of the Stanley Kramer Company. Copyright 30 August 1952 by Stanley Kramer Productions, Inc. Released through United Artists. New York opening at the Mayfair: 24 July 1952. U.S. release: 30 July 1952. U.K. release: 9 June 1952 (sic). Australian release: 3 October 1952. Sydney opening at the Plaza. 84 minutes. SYNOPSIS: Four gunslingers travel by the noon train to a small western town where they plan to shoot down the sheriff who sent their leader to prison.NOTES: High Noon won four Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Gary Cooper), Best Film Editing, Best Music Scoring of a Drama or Comedy, and Best Song. The film was also nominated for Best Picture (won by The Greatest Show On Earth), Best Directing (won by John Ford for The Quiet Man), and Best Screenplay (won by Charles Schnee for The Bad and the Beautiful). Other awards include two from The New York Film Critics (Best Motion Picture of 1952 and Best Direction for 1952) and the number one spot (Best Film of 1952) in The Film Daily's annual poll of around six hundred film critics in the USA and Canada. The National Board of Review rated High Noon second to The Quiet Man as Best American Film of 1952. Gary Cooper came in second to Martin and Lewis as America's top money-making star of 1952. High Noon became United Artists' top boxoffice attraction for 1952 in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia. Indeed in Australa, the picture was the second highest coin-spinner of the year. Only MGM's road-shown (at advanced prices) Quo Vadis took more money. Locations in Sonora and at the Columbia Studio ranch. Interiors filmed at the Motion Picture Centre.COMMENT: Definitely one of the greatest movies of all time, High Noon is surely the ultimate in cinema suspense. Foreman's taut script is dramatically reinforced by a number of key technicians, including director Zinnemann, cinematographer Crosby, and film editor Williams. If ever an actor deserved his Award, Gary Cooper comes through with full honors for his brilliant study of the loner-worn out, weary, deserted, let down-who is forced to put his own life and everything he holds dear on the line. Coop gets great support from the entire cast, particularly Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, Katy Jurado and Lon Chaney in principal roles, whilst small-part players contribute many memorable cameos (for example, Howland Chamberlin as the sneering hotel clerk). The four gunmen are menacingly yet individualistically portayed by Ian MacDonald, Lee Van Cleef, Robert J. Wilke and Sheb Wooley.",

It's always hard to pick the \"best\" film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.",

            "content": "Life was going well for Will Kane, Hadleyville's town marshal.  He'd cleaned up the city and made it safe.  He'd sent the badmen packing or to prison. He'd just hung up his star and married beautiful young Amy Fowler, surrounded by his loving and loyal friends, and he looked forward to a peaceful life with her as a storekeeper.  And Then It Happened.A telegram reaches him to let him know that Frank Miller, an outlaw killer whom Kane thought was to be hanged, has been pardoned and will arrive at the Hadleyville train station at high noon.  Three of his old time bandit companions are waiting for Miller there, and they will surely come to kill Kane when Miller arrives.At first, Kane prepares to run.  But he realizes that the killers will come after him and Amy; they have to be faced, and it might as well be here and now with a posse at his back.  So Kane pins his badge back on and goes to his friends and neighbors for help in facing the badmen, but most of them turn their backs on Kane.This movie gives a brilliant examination of the cowardice of Kane's fellow townspeople.  The person who remains most mysterious is Kane himself. Courage, as I understand it, is the ability to ignore one's fear in order to do what must be done.  Kane is afraid, and he is able to ignore his fear, but why does he think that he must fight?  Does he feel a duty to protect Hadleyville, even though it has spurned him?  Is he convinced that, no matter where he runs, he will still have to fight the four killers alone? Does he believe that running from any situation, no matter how impossible, is unmanly and dishonorable?  Would he have fought ten men?  A hundred?  A million?  Kane himself doesn't seem to be entirely sure.  He clearly has very strong morals, but lacks the ability to explain them.  Even when a man asks him to cheat the new sheriff out of a job, Kane refuses, but can't explain why, merely saying, \"If you don't know, there's no use in me telling you.\"  When someone asks him why he says \"I've got to\" fight the killers now, he frankly admits that he doesn't know.Lloyd Bridges is excellent as Harvey Pell, Kane's former deputy and the first man Kane approaches for help.  When Pell cravenly abandons Kane to his fate, Bridges is wonderful at showing his guilt.  One of the best parts of the movie is where Pell tries to allay his guilt by trying to get Kane to run away; if Kane won't fight, Pell thinks his own cowardice will feel more excusable.Grace Kelly, in her first major role, is quite good as a woman whose Quaker religion compels her to pacifism, and cannot understand her husband's need to meet violence with violence.  Even better is Katy Jurado as the beautiful, tempestuous Helen Ramirez, who understands Kane far better than Amy does.  Harry Morgan portrays Sam Fuller, a deputy so gutless that he not only won't face Frank Miller, but won't even face Kane to tell him so.  And Thomas Mitchell is great as the town leader who subordinates Kane's life to the economic future of the town.As an allegory for the Hollywood blacklist, HIGH NOON is pretty weak.  Kane is not falsely accused of subverting the town's welfare; the whole emotional power of the plot is based on the fact that the townsmen refuse to help him even though everybody recognizes that he has done nothing but good for Hadleyville.  The killers, on the other hand, are openly lawless and evil, not poseurs pretending to protect the townsmen by their persecution of others.  Still, whatever its flaws as an allegory, HIGH NOON is one heck of a great western and a great story.Fred Zinneman did a very good job on directing the movie, with one exception.  Throwing out the usual Western orchestra for Dimitri Tiomkin's lonely guitar music was a good idea, but it is used far too much.  It doesn't take long to get tired of Tex Ritter's sing-song drawl.  But the use of clocks for suspense, particularly in the climactic montage, is a masterstroke.HIGH NOON ranks as one of the top ten westerns I have ever seen.  It is worthwhile renting for just about anyone, regardless of whether they are fans of the genre.Rating: *** out of ****",

Gary Cooper was well-deserving of Best Actor and I can see why Tony Soprano loved the strong and stoic Will Kane character so much. I can also see why Gregory Peck regarded turning down the lead in High Noon as the biggest mistake of his career.Katy Jurado and Grace Kelly deliver incredible performances too - playing some of the strongest women depicted in film (refreshing for a film of this type). Besides the gripping final showdown, the film is really just a drama that happens to have the setting of a western. It is beautifully shot. The High Noon song by Dimitri Tiomkin will be stuck in my head for days. It really helped make the movie the classic it is.The fact it takes place in real-time gives events a real sense of urgency.

But word comes that a notorious gunslinger he put in prison has been released and is heading to town with his gang intent on bloody revenge. With a sense of fearless duty Kane decides to stay and sets about enlisting a posse, however, he finds that nobody in the town that he made safe for everyone will aid him in his mission.The 1950s saw a big shift in styles for the American Western. After the yee-haw Cowboy Vs Indians excess of the 40s, the decade was ushered in by such films as Broken Arrow. Showing the Native Americans in a sympathetic light, Broken Arrow also showed that clearly Westerns had much more to offer than frothy shoot them up entertainment. Which brings us to High Noon, a black and white Oater that landed in 1952 and is still today revered as a quintessential classic Western. Which is not bad considering there's no gun-play here until the last five minutes of the 85 minute running time.What makes High Noon so significant is that it's not a big movie in terms of production. There's no reams of extras dashing around in glorious Technicolor, no sprawling vistas inhabited by colourful characters, this is pretty understated stuff. Yet thematically it's as big as it gets, a lesson in character drama where not a frame is wasted. From the unforgettable opening of three bad men (Lee Van Cleef, Robert Wilkie, Sheb Wooley) waiting at the station while Tex Ritter's ballad explains the plot, to the now legendary and iconic ending, High Noon simmers with suspense and intensity as the story unravels - all told in real time too.Based on a short story called The Tin Star written by John W. Cunningham, High Noon is directed metronomically by Fred Zinnermann and is shot in high contrast by cinematographer Floyd Crosby. Thus the film has a documentary feel to it, giving it an authentic edge so rarely seen in the Western genre. The piece is further boosted by the performance of Cooper. Winning the Oscar for best male performance, Cooper was 50 years old and into his third decade as a movie star. His prancing around in Western days were reducing by the month, yet High Noon shows it to be one of the finest casting decisions made in the 50s. In agony from a back injury and other ailments during the shoot, Cooper carries the movie with brilliant sincerity, conveying the pain of a man now alone as he trundles towards doom. The realisation is that all his heroism and graft that made Hadleyville a safe place for women and children to live, now counts for nothing, it's a heavy weight on Kane's shoulders. It's here where Cooper excels, there's no histrionics or drawn out speeches, it's through expressions and body movements that the story gains its emotional momentum. A remarkable turn from a remarkable actor, proof positive that you didn't need a dashing leading man to propel your movie.The film notoriously angered Howard Hawks & John Wayne, the themes and the perceived allegory for blacklisting a bone of contention that led to them making Rio Bravo as a riposte in 1959. There's many an essay on High Noon and the links to Senator Joe McCarthy, HUAC etc etc, so really I have no interest in going there. Instead I think it's just fitting to say that Zinnermann himself always resisted talking in terms of allegorical interpretations for his film. He, rightly so, felt to do that would be unfair and dampen the huge significance of his wonderful movie.Amen to that. 10/10",

            "content": "John Wayne was totally wrong to call this movie un-American. Courage and cowardice are universal emotions, and the attitudes of the characters in High Noon are, I think, incredibly truthful and telling. I know that if I lived in the Wild West, had a job and family, and was asked to stand up and fight against a gang of gun-toting psychos I would probably not be able to do it. That's why Gary Cooper's Will Kane is such a remarkable character in terms of self-respect, morality and inner strength. It's the way he MUST uphold the law even though it will perhaps cost him his wife and his life. It is the various townfolk with whom most of us will identify, even if it makes us feel shame or unworthiness to admit it. No matter how bravely we act, nor how much we want to think heroically of ourselves, 90% of us would cower in the shadows when the time came to do what Will Kane does in this movie.On his wedding day, dependable lawman Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just handed in his badge and is preparing to leave town with his bride Amy (Grace Kelly) when he receives devastating news. An old adversary, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), has been pardoned for crimes that he should have hanged for and is on his way to Kane's town of Hadleyville to get revenge. He is due on the noon train, leaving Kane one hour to either run for his life or make preparations to fight. Kane and Amy set off at full gallop, hoping to put some miles between themselves and danger, but Kane doesn't get far before he feels compelled to turn back. With the new sheriff not due for a day, he just can't let go of the extraordinary sense of duty and responsibility he feels towards his town. However when he gets back to town he gets quite a shock - for no-one has the guts (nor, in some instances, the inclination) to fight alongside him against the Miller gang. As time ticks unstoppably towards noon, Kane gradually realises that if he's going to stop Miller and his boys, he's going to have to do it alone!Cooper's performance is extremely powerful and he received a thoroughly deserved Oscar for it. Kelly is good as his bride, although many viewers will find her character hard to like. Lloyd Bridges has a brilliant early role as Kane's deputy, while the very best of the supporting pack is Katy Jurado as a Latino woman whose \"history\" with most of the men in town puts her in an unenviable position when the shooting starts. Fred Zinnemann directs the film outstandingly, making each scene fit into the grander scheme of things with literate precision. Any aspiring young film-maker wanting to learn how to pace a film correctly should watch High Noon with a close eye, for it is unparallelled as the most perfectly paced film of all-time. The music by Dmitri Tomkin - plus that incredible ballad \"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\" by Tex Ritter - is just one more element that makes High Noon one of the great masterpieces. There's nothing else to say - if you haven't already, go out and see this film NOW!",

But it is on my list of most important films, and I believe it should be experienced by anyone serious about learning how to watch films.The film is abstract, adopting a German stance which in turn had Russian (Eisensteinian) origins. (This deliberate abstraction as an enhancing strategy was later revived by Malick and reborn as inherently American. He even recruited Robert Wilke.). Here, the camera is German, but the story is more deeply American than merely stepping into the western genre. The post WWII American notion of personal sacrifice for Liberty is what is woven here, a responsibility to press against evil, to benefit even people who won't help themselves. Only this time, instead of saving Jews and Frenchmen (and Brits and Aussies and Russians), the government turned against its own patriots and almost imprisoned many involved in this project.Hard to believe today, folks. But the nobility of the story was criticized by John Wayne as `plain unAmerican.' Many people in power thought so too for decades. It is my belief that this film, right here, had a subtle but measureable influence in saving America from its own witchunts -- it is no accident that Welles' character's name `Kane' was chosen.

And it never fails to set up the tension and I connect with the characters each and every time.It is Gary Cooper's greatest performance though he was in his fifties at the time and thirty years older than his leading lady, Grace Kelly, in her first starring role. He plays Will, newly married that day, who has to wear his marshall's badge for the last time and defend the town he has cleaned up. His new bride does not agree with his action and prepares to leave him.Remarkable for its era (1952) the film plays in real time over its length of 90 minutes.Katy Jurado plays Kane's former mistress, a standard fiery Mexican but with a twist - she is also an independent business woman. A youthful Lloyd Bridges plays a deputy. There are many great bit players in minor roles. Watch for Harry Morgan as a coward. And the theme song is a character all by itself, haunting and mournful, threaded throughout the movie and sung by Tex Ritter.The movie was made in the height of the reign of McCarthyism in the states where communists were perceived to be hiding behind every tree and with Hollywood deemed to have more than their fair share. An allegory can be drawn between the action of one brave man in a town of disconnected citizenry, and the high jinks that were happening in the sessions of the House of Unamerican Activities where there were far too few heroes and many craven cowards.An amazing film ahead of its time and right up there in my fifty best of all time.10 out of 10.",

I'm rooting for Coop, of course, but the bad guys either had terrible aim or terrible judgment. Instead of showing just how justified the fear was for 75 minutes in the final ten, these so-called dangerous men strolled in without any caution, missed shots from 10-20 feet away, and let Will Kane draw and shoot first every time. On top of that, Coop took 'em down easy for the most part. I understand that it was more about the first 75 mins and less about the last 10, but the last 10 has to support the previous 75.

            "content": "Despite the fact that \"High Noon\" is highly regarded as one of the greatest western films of all- time, it took me a long time to actually spin it up in the DVD player. Probably because, to be honest, I was afraid it would be little more than a \"stock western\". When I did \"give in\", however, I now completely understand the praise.For a basic plot summary, \"High Noon\" is a story about an Old West town that is about to see the return of Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a convicted gunslinger freshly released and ready to wreak havoc on the town that sent him \"up the river\". Waiting for him is a posse led by fellow no- gooder Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef). In the town itself, Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just been wed to his beloved Amy (Grace Kelly) and about to begin the honeymoon when he gets news of Frank Miller's return. Kane's high moral standards compel him to stick around for the confrontation, but will he be able to rally the town around him to clean up the streets once again?There are two reasons why I consider this movie to be a cinematic classic:First, it is actually a very complex film in terms of thematic material. It is most definitely NOT the traditional 1950s western flick. The movie really delves into themes of humanity and how people react in times of great stress. Seemingly every single person or group of people in the film have their own set of values, and at some point they are all called into question as the intensity ratchets up.Secondly, the tension just continues to pick up as \"high noon\" (the train's destination time) approaches. With every passing moment, the weight of the day pushes down harder on Marshal Kane.The acting in this movie is also top-notch. Besides those already mentioned above, Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado play great auxiliary roles, adding their own little niches to the overall tapestry.Overall, I really had no expectations going into this movie and by the time the credits rolled I was thoroughly impressed by the human drama. This is one of the most entertaining westerns ever made, provided you enjoy movies with great character interactions. Yes, you do get the gunfights and the typical western iconic landmarks, but you also get top-notch drama to boot.",

It has a great, simple story, great characters and actors portraying them, a great build up and some fine directing. I just can't see how anyone could ever not like this movie.The movie has a real simple main premise, of a former lawman, who shortly after his marriage hears that he man he once put behind bars is out again and on his way to get his revenge. Instead of deciding to run with his newly wed wife he decides to stay and stand his ground and confront his enemies. He then learns who truly his friends were during the time that he lived in town and was the Marshall. It's a story about courage, friendship and loyalty. It above all things is also being a very realistic western with its story and characters. It's not being an heroic movie and it shows humans how the truly are and respond to certain threatening situations.The movie gets beautiful constructed and build up. Director Fred Zinnemann did a great job with this movie. It's simplistic but all so incredibly effective. It makes the movie an absolutely compelling one to watch, even if you aren't really being into the western genre.The cast is at first sight a rather unlikely one. I mean, an aging Gary Cooper as the main character. Lloyd Bridges, Grace Kelly and Lon Chaney Jr. in western roles. It all don't seem like the most likely casting picks. But truth it that every actor does a great job and let their characters work out. Also real great to see Lee Van Cleef making his movie debut in this one. It's also a real great looking movie in terms of its style. I can definitely see how some of the camera-work and editing influenced later westerns, such as the Sergio Leone ones. I was amazed at how great the movie was looking at times. I also really liked the musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin.Not just one of the best westerns but also really one of the best movies I have ever seen.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman pose a fairly simple question: when times are desperate, who's willing to stand up? As we find out, not too many. A real reflection of a turbulent time in US constitutional history, with the McCarthy witch-hunts in high gear & HUAC calling suspected leftists to the carpet for the political views, with those being blacklisted for refusing to \"cooperate.\" Cooper is perfect as the only righteous citizen, not even able to articulate why he has to stay & defend the town. Lloyd Bridges is his angry deputy & Grace Kelly is excellent in her first substantive film role (as Cooper's Quaker wife). Harry Morgan, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Jurado (handling a very difficult role with a lot of poise) and Lon Chaney Jr. are in it too.

They both rise to the top of their professions, are headstrong and unyielding, and find themselves alone and alienated from their friends, but that's about where the similarity ends.\"Citizen Kane\" has a complex narrative structure, is filled with ambiguity, and is embellished with artistic and technical flourishes, whereas \"High Noon,\" the story of Marshall Will Kane who must face his nemeses without help, is about as complicated as a child's toy. We pretty much know what's going to happen from the beginning.In case you don't know the story, four of Kane's (Gary Cooper's) old enemies, led by Frank Miller, seek him out in a small Western town where he serves as Marshall. They're going to come for him at high noon. He's got about an hour and a half to organize special deputies. His wife Amy (Grace Kelly) leaves him when he refuses to run from the coming conflict. And for one or another reason all of his old friends, even those who helped him clean up the town some years ago and put the chief heavy, Frank Miller, behind bars, refuse to help him. Some of the townspeople are sympathetic and some hate him. Kane has to spurn offers of help from a pathetic duo -- an abject drunk and a fourteen-year-old kid. There is a gun fight at the end. Guess who wins. Kane takes off his star and drops it into the dirt and he and Amy ride off into the sunset to open a store somewhere.It's a tightly written story, even in all its predictability, and the constant references to the clocks ticking down the minutes, plus the omnipresent dramatic chords of Dmitri Tiompkin's score, generate a good deal of tension.There are only two real scenes of action. One is the shoot out that's well staged but otherwise unmemorable. The other is a fist fight between Kane and his jealous subordinate, the Deputy Marshall Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges). It isn't a long scene but it's a bruising fight with both men being slugged repeatedly in the face. Cooper is so tall that when he falls backward to the stable floor it seems to take forever, as if in slow motion, his arms flailing. I felt his pain more acutely than I felt his fear for his life. When it's over, and Harvey lies unconscious, Kane is unable to walk away and must slump against a wall, holding his beaten face in his hands, gasping for breath. He seems completely exhausted.The story about the movie is almost as interesting as the film itself. Is it about blacklisting? (Kids: You'll have to look that up.) A lot of people thought so, including Howard Hawks who was disgusted by the movie. No true Marshall would act like that, going around begging for help. So Hawks made \"Rio Bravo\" to tell his version of how it really works. The sheriff, John Wayne, turns away every offer of help but people show up when they're needed anyway.I don't actually believe it's a movie that's that pregnant with social comment. I think it's a movie about a Marshall who is deserted by all of his friends except his wife, who intrudes at the last minute, and it's commercially designed in every way, following as it does a classic narrative structure in which there are a series of increasingly serious minor climaxes, then the climax, then the denouement. The overarching plan could have been provided by a computer if they'd had computers. This isn't necessarily a weakness. \"Stagecoach\" had a similar structure, and the platform itself has been around for a long time. Sophocles used it, didn't he?",

            "content": "'High Noon' has always been a personal favorite of mine because it so multi-layered and brilliant. I first saw the film as a child and was surprisingly immediately taken in by the brilliant performances. Gary Cooper is absolutely magnetic as Will Kane. It is a truly amazing performance as it is tremendously restrained and often sluggish and yet Cooper is electric as he is so in tune with his character and the impending doom upon him. Even as a child I recognized something special here. Of course now I look at the film for what it truly set out to do, create an allegory for the criminal HUAC committees and blacklisting. 'High Noon' works brilliantly as a western and I would dare go as far as say it is the definitive masterpiece of the genre and yet the film is really a piece of political commentary that unfortunately is needed as much today as when it was made...Will Kane is the anti-John Wayne in every respect of the word.The fact that 'High Noon' is designed as a western angers it's detractors. The western genre has more or less delivered us cartoon after cartoon with Wayne or some figure in his mold presenting a violent form of propaganda in creating the archetype of this law man hero. Kane's only crime is being imperfect. He has the perfectly human fear of going to a gunfight and knowing that he may very well die. 'High Noon' is such an effective film because Kane has that fear and realizes that he must overcome it in order to save his community. This is the strongest motivation and character arch you can give a character because essentially Kane has the potential to become a Christ figure. I will be honest I am not a huge fan of the Western because so much of it is about paraphernalia and cheap emotional triggers. By having Kane have to overcome his personal demons and this very real foe it shows how really powerless the paraphernalia is. One of my personal favorites Lon Chaney Jr, has a brilliant bit part which sums up this film and why it transcends it's genre. A debate is had about 'what weighs more a man or a tin star? ' Wayne and so many others would answer the tin star and 'High Noon' has the gusto to say that the tin star is nothing but what people make of it. 'High Noon' presents a town in crisis. Throughout the course of the film the values behind that tin star are questioned and brought down to the fundamental questions of right and wrong. This is where 'High Noon' becomes a brilliant political allegory.Violence and repression distort the concept of the rule of law. HUAC represented a perversion of what America stood for. In Will Kane we have a moral compass who thinks only in rights and wrongs. The town seeing the opportunity for bloodshed becomes afraid and deserts him by distorting the nature of the conflict to fit a warped self serving view of their codes. Fear is the essence of 'High Noon' and it's strong political allegory. Kane is not a coward for seeking aid because he is asking people to do the right thing. If Wayne and the right wing ilk are upset at 'High Noon' because of this then they are very naive about human nature. Fear can drive people no matter what values they have to be complacent and accept a wrong as a right. Will Kane becomes a great hero because like great heroes before him he doesn't accept this. This is a quintessential American picture because of this theme.",

            "content": "Gary Cooper's Marshall Kane could have left town. He is already on the horse and carriage with his new wife (Grace Kelly, perhaps out of his league in age but whatever, I'm sure they have their reasons). He knows that the dastardly villain Frank Miller, who was put in jail for good reason by Kane for a crime that should've had him hanged, is out on pardon and on his way back to the town to get his revenge. He knows the town would be in danger from him and his posse (including the likes of Lee van Cleef!) But... something's not right about running away. He could, but where would it get anyone? Miller would still continue to terrorize the people, and would likely come after him someway or somehow. No, this won't do - so he returns, and tries to gather up some deputies. Not only can he find practically no one to be at his side, people actively tell him he's wrong for a number or reasons. High Noon was made without ambiguity as an allegory for the period, namely for Hollywood writers and creators and actors who has to be put up against the BS HUAC and without many to help them in the Communist inquests. Who can you seek help with when fear comes up around everyone? What makes High Noon last though, why it's been homaged and parodied and remake over the years, is because, like with another 1950's parable genre film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it could apply to a lot of things in this world. Teamwork, adversity, ignorance, cowardice, themes and dramatic conflicts presented in High Noon don't just have the time and place of the Communist paranoia, otherwise, frankly, the film would be dated. This is what John Wayne couldn't get through his thick skull when he went on to attack the film (the one good thing to come out was his \"response\" with Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo). Or, as it was speculated according to IMDb trivia, he secretly wanted the role of Kane for himself - and might've made it, also frankly, more unrealistic.Cooper is world-weary but keeps pressing on, loaded with sweat, the Tomkin sung song traveling with him like he's Radio Raheem with 'Fight the Power' in Do the Right Thing. He just needs a few good deputies, and yet everyone tells him he's wrong, nuts, foolish, or maybe just the situation itself is just too much - a little more time, not just the hour and change as the minutes keep ticking till the noon train arrives, things could be different - and this conflict of getting people and others telling Kane to just stop and run away, this makes for wonderful tension. There's probably a reason this is called the \"western for people who don't like Westerns', because it could be about any time: replace the Miller- led gunslingers with gangsters and it could be set in the 1930's; change it to ronin and you get... Seven Samurai, to a degree, if they couldn't get the 'Seven' that is. There are a couple of things for me that keep it from being really a full-blown 'classic', at least on first viewing. I didn't fully buy the performance from the Mexican woman and character, Katy Jurado. She's not bad, but something about her is kind of stiff and one- note. Grace Kelly, at first, seemed that way too, but the more I understood her character as the loving Quaker wife with good intentions but a sharp mind and instincts, I liked her a lot more. One or two minor supporting turns from the cast also stick out, but perhaps they'll grow on me over time when I return to the film. Certainly Lloyd Bridges is excellent, giving his scenes an intensity as he is burning with conflict - the deputy who has been in town for so long and is finally giving up, but should he? And should he get into a fight with the momentarily- doubtful Kane as he's in the horse stable? That fight alone is worth the 'price of admission' as they say.Zinneman may be using symbols, via Kramer's production ethos, but they didn't come off as heavy-handed for me. What is so striking is just how compacted everything is, and how Cooper makes this a performance about stress and being a hero who may very well be reluctant and tired and 'what the hell am I DOING doing this?' But he internalizes it, rarely has to vocalize it, and when he does (like when he has a conversation with his mentor, an older Marshall I think), it counts. Seeing him move through his town, that face matched with all the others, it's a performance for the ages even if you're not crazy about Cooper's other pictures in general. And by the time noon comes and s*** gets real, the actors and filmmaker are so totally in sync that it's hard not to be caught up in the sensation that anything can happen. We have a thought it will turn out OK - it's the 1950's code-era Hollywood after all - but the dread is certainly there and maintained well. And that song...",

Here, Tiomkin's music combined with lyrics by Ned Washington and vocals by Tex Ritter act like a minstrel accompanying Kane, celebrating him in song as he confronts his enemies and his demons.Frankel's book presented surprising layers of information. His research and insights into the pressure the HUAC investigations applied to Carl Foreman and Stanley Kramer put everything into context. However, for me, the most interesting aspect was the creative process behind the making of the film. \"High Noon\" had a tight budget, but you wouldn't know it, it's a class act all the way. Its quality shines through seven decades after it was made.",

Unfortunately for the film, quite simply, everything that occurs is predictable. Therefore the tension which is supposed to build up is inexistent. And the 'real-time shooting' supposed to lend pace and suspense ends up dragging on an on as Cooper performs one weak speech after the other. Not surprisingly, considering how inefficient this structure has been, the climax/showdown is flat and uninteresting.I will admit the photography is quite beautiful, but to consider this film a classic, let alone one of the greatest movies of all time, on the grounds of its alleged political relevance (by the way much as I loathe Mccarthyism, I find this 'metaphor' much too formal and tedious) is preposterous.

But upon his return, he finds a gang of the criminals' cronies waiting for their old boss to arrive and all the townspeople completely unwilling to help him; some out of preference for the days when the criminal ran the town, but most out of sheer cowardice, and even the sheriff's pleading with all the townspeople to help him deal with the criminal fails to move them. But in the end the sheriff decides he will face them even if it means his death. Even his wife, who had become a Quaker in reaction to several violent deaths of her family members, is ready to desert him. (Uh, she just married an ex-sheriff, whose job included carrying a gun and using it on occasion?)The movie is said to be a thinly-disguised attack on the House Unamerican Activities Committee, which was then investigating Communist influence on the Hollywood movie industry. The analogy is simple: the criminal gang represents the HUAC, the townspeople represent people in Hollywood who are too afraid of the HUAC to stand up to them, and the ex-sheriff is the hero who will face the HUAC himself, with or without help. The cowardice of the townspeople is all too contrived; the gang the ex-sheriff faces is small, unimpressive, and easily defeated. The comparison of the HUAC to criminal thugs also falls apart; the HUAC had genuine popular support and had noble intentions, whether wrongheaded or not. Communist infiltration into the Hollywood movie industry really existed; the extent may have been overestimated but it was genuine.",

However, when Kane hears that dangerous criminal Ben Miller (Sheb Wooley)is on a train which is due to arrive in his town at 12 noon and is looking to seek revenge against Kane with the help of his gang - they want revenge because Kane was the one that sent him to prison. Kane considers leaving with his wife Amy Fowler Kane (Grace Kelly), but his conscience doesn't allow him to do this. He decides to return to the town and face Kane and his gang. This however, proves more difficult than he anticipated when he finds that people aren't prepared to help him (for varying reasons).I think what sets this apart from other westerns that I've seen is that there seems to be more focus on story as opposed to action. Most westerns seem to have lots of fights and lot shootings and gun battles. High Noon is different in the sense that the primary focus is on Kane and his struggle to gain assistance. The lack of battles and shootings wasn't a problem for me as I liked the story driven approach in this film - there is a great deal of time spent on developing characters and we also learn a lot about the characters in this town (there are those that seem to side with Miller and those that side with Kane but these people have their own reasons for not wanting to help him). I liked this approach as it gave the film a very balanced feel - it didn't feel quite so black and white and means that most viewers will probably be able to gain an understanding of both sides of the argument. The church scene is probably the most effective scene in the whole film and demonstrates this point perfectly.I think a major strength in this film is that Kane is such a likable character - the fact that he came back and stood his ground was both brave and admirable. How can you not root for a character and how can you not fail to get involved in a story when your lead character shows such great 'character'. The make or break aspect for viewers of this film is whether you enjoy the story or not as apart from the last 10-15 minutes the whole film is one long build up to the inevitable shoot out. As mentioned, this wasn't a problem for me as I enjoyed the story and found that I cared for Kane and his cause - the very fact that he was prepared to take on Miller and his gang with or without anyone's help made it all the better as far as I was concerned.High Noon is a solid western which may disappoint some people as it isn't as action packed or humorous as some of the westerns that have followed it. However, it does have a strong and involving story which was good enough for me.",

Gary Cooper fits the role of Marshal Will Kane well. He's a reserved man with a strong physical presence. When he hears that Frank Miller is coming on the noon train, he knows why the man is coming and he knows what to do about it, despite the fact the marshal was married that morning. His bride, however, is a Quaker and only wants her new husband to be safe. Grace Kelly fits that role well, with her prim and proper bearing, and a visual purity that makes her seem above the issues of the grimy little town of Hadleysville.As the clocks (which seem to be everywhere) count down the minutes until noon, the Marshal looks for allies---a difficult task, considering his history with certain parties and the fact that the townspeople have divided loyalties.The suspense of the countdown is what drives the film. Kane is not some superhuman, untouchable gunslinger. He knows what his chances are and he feels the pressure. Dmitri Tiomkin's music does a good job of reinforcing the mounting stress.The ending is somewhat anticlimactic for me. Other westerns that lead up to a final confrontation have done it better.Watch for strong performances by Lloyd Bridges as Deputy Marshal Pell and Katy Jurado as Helen Ramirez, a savvy businesswoman whose past relationships complicate matters.",

Faced with a choice of confronting a dangerous enemy or leaving town, Kane chooses to stay and fight, even if he must do so alone.The plot triangulates three elements: Kane as hero, a cowardly group of citizens, and a threat to both, in the form of four outlaws, headed by killer Frank Miller, returning to the town now, to revenge Kane's actions against him years ago.Clocks promote tension as they tick down the minutes to Miller's arrival by train, to rendezvous with his three partners in crime. Meanwhile, as Kane tries to organize a courageous response, the church-going townsfolk react with a mix of ambivalence, fear, hypocrisy, cowardice, and a general lack of nobility.One of the best elements is the B&W cinematography, especially in outdoor scenes. Black hats and human silhouettes amplify the oppression of a washed-out sky, stark, and arid. Interesting frame compositions add to the visual appeal. And static camera shots looking down a railroad track build tension as a symbol of looming threat.Great film editing and a fine performance by Gary Cooper also confer credibility, as does the thematically relevant and wonderfully melodious Western ballad, sung by Tex Ritter.But the film is not perfect. The plot is a bit too melodramatic and talky. Fewer speaking parts and a smaller cast would have helped. Also, I question the dubious casting of Grace Kelly; she's a tad too Victorian to be in a Western. And her character, Amy, is annoying.This is a film I had doubted I would like.

            "content": "Genres are powerful things. Much more than just a setting and type of action, they are a bundle of conventions, moods and character types. If you're going to mess with a genre, you need to get it dead right or you'll be making a flop. In 1952 the Western was at the height of its popularity, but nothing survives without adapting, and Westerns were either becoming bigger and bolder, or like High Noon they were overturning those rules.To understand why High Noon is what it is, you have to bear in mind that writer Carl Foreman, producer Stanley Kramer and director Fred Zinnemann were quite innocently approaching the genre not because they thought it would be fun to make a Western, but because it was an ideal setting for the kind of story they wanted to tell. These three had collaborated before on The Men, an extremely earnest yet rather flawed picture. High Noon is like their graduation piece.From the very first scenes you can tell this is going to be somewhat different from your average horse opera. Zinnemann, as always, shoots the outdoors with an emphasis on beauty and simplicity. This contrasts with the extremely dark and cramped looking interiors. Funnily enough (or perhaps not), Western director supreme John Ford also used a firm contrast between indoors and outdoors, but it was done in a different way and for different reasons. In Ford's west, the interiors were cosy homesteads, whereas the open plain was romantic, exciting and slightly dangerous. In High Noon however the point seems be to show the townspeople shuttered up in their homes, peering out onto the action. The reason for using light, airy exteriors is less obvious, and at first glance it even seems contradictory to have the villains delicately framed amid the trees. It does however give us as audience members a sense of injustice that these thugs should be roaming free amongst all this beauty.Those iconic opening shots also establish right away the sense of dynamic rhythm, and this is integral to making High Noon enjoyable. The picture is shot and edited in a way that is fairly commonplace now (thanks to a generation of filmmakers who grew up hero-worshipping Orson Welles) but was pretty cutting edge for the time. Little bursts of action begin and end almost every scene, so that the pace is continuous, and we feel that the picture is constantly moving forward. All this leads to a finale of a good old-fashioned tension-building montage, one which is particularly effective thanks to its motifs of the clock, railroad track and empty chair having been prominently established throughout the picture.The rhythm and tone of High Noon is enhanced by what is one of the best examples of motion picture scoring of the era. One of the biggest problems with many films of the 40s and 50s is overblown, overly melodramatic \"background\" music, which often detracts from the power of the performances and overshadows the action. All Dimitri Tiomkin's score for High Noon does is establish a mood for each scene, adding atmosphere to the action. It also happens to be incredibly melodic and listenable, and I for one disagree with the notion that a great backing score is one you don't notice.Last but not least, High Noon happens to be superbly acted on all parts. Gary Cooper was not the deepest or most flexible actor ever, but once in a while a part came along that fit his style like a glove, and this is probably his best. Like Cooper, all of the supporting cast underplay it, moving little but conveying emotional depths with subtle gestures and expressions. This understated tone is ideal for the overall feel and pace, and there is no weak link in it, ranging as it does from the suppressed temper of Katy Jurado to the mute moodiness of Lee van Cleef.Ultimately though the only real problem with High Noon is that its creators did not have any real reverence or understanding for the Western genre. They saw it merely as a setting for a story. Compare this to Shane, which is in a way more of an anti-Western because it sets out to debunk the myths of the genre, but it also tips its hat to the conventions of the Westerns, and has respect for its character types. This is why people like Howard Hawks and John Wayne were so appalled by High Noon. Nevertheless it is a resonant and tightly constructed thriller, and this is what has earned it admiration over the years.",

Surprisingly, considering the film could be taken as a rebuke of Hollywood for not standing up against the House Un-American Activities Committee when it began to target the entertainment industry, 'High Noon' won four Oscars (of seven nominations including Foreman). Gary Cooper is excellent as the desperate marshal who watches his support evaporate as the clock ticks towards noon. The supporting cast is a great collection of character actors, with the first person on camera being Lee Van Cleef, making his debut as an especially laconic 'heavy' (his character never speaks). The climatic gunfight is outstanding: tense and 'realistic' (by Hollywood Western standards anyway), as is the famous, Oscar-winning theme music.

            "content": "I have seen this film a couple of times before, in my youth. Both times I didn't rate it much, if I was going to watch a Western, I wanted lots of gunfights and in this film there's only one. Having matured slightly\u0085 (Ok, a lot), and on several recommendations, I decided to give it another go. In the intervening time I did see, and like, a remake of this called Outland (1981) starring Sean Connery. But back to the original, I must admit I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Yes, it is dated, but it's still a great piece of storytelling; it's about a man prepared to do the right thing despite the odds stacked against him. I will give my thoughts after this brief summary.Marshal Will Kane is getting married to his new bride, Amy, but even as the ceremony is taking place three men ride into town. These are bad men, men who ran with Frank Miller, a psychopath who Kane had put away several years earlier. For some reason, he has been pardoned and is due to arrive on the noon train. It's obvious to Kane that he has come for his revenge. He cannot arrest the men who have come to meet Miller, who include; Jack Colby and Frank's brother, Ben, as they have not committed any crime. In trying to raise a posse, Kane, surprisingly, meets a lot of resistance, even his deputy, Harvey Pell, is unwilling to face Miller. And even Kane's wife, a Quaker, is against him facing Miller but Kane is determined to see it through. As the clock ticks down to noon will he find an ally in a town that seems to have forgotten who cleaned up the streets and made it a fit place to live? Well it would be a major spoiler if I told you here and them Spoiler Police would throw me in Jail for 30 days.Even though it's in black and white, and in a 4:3 ratio, I still found this film very watchable. It's quite a compelling story and you really feel for the character of Will Kane. This is partly down to a great script and a really good performance from Gary Cooper as Kane. Also worthy of note were; Lloyd Bridges as the ambitious Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell, Katy Jurado as Helen Ram\u00edrez, Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane, Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin Howe, Harry Morgan as Sam Fuller, Ian MacDonald as Frank Miller and not forgetting, in his first ever big screen role, Lee Van Cleef as Jack Colby.Told in real time, it's quite an interesting and enthralling film. I found the excuses people came up with were beginning to wear a bit thin by the time Kane got to the church though. The constant refrain of the song by Dimitri Tiomkin I found an interesting hook and now I'll always associate the refrain \"Do not forsake me oh my darling\" with this film. Also the device of the clock, in almost every scene before the train arrives, there's a clock, reminding the audience that time is getting short. Over all, it's a really well made drama with some really good performances. I certainly enjoyed it a lot more than I expected\u0085 Recommended.My Score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (39,425 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (46 reviews counted when this review was written).",

            "content": "Right off the top I have to concede that I've never been a particular fan of westerns. Most I find to be basically the same story with a little different packaging. Having said that, I'd certainly rate \"High Noon\" as one of the best (probably THE best) western I've ever seen. More than that, I'd say it was one of the better movies I've ever seen in general, head and shoulders above most of the stuff being put out by Hollywood today. There's a real story here; a real moral dilemma; a real consideration of how people respond to challenging circumstances. And there's Gary Cooper - who offered a truly brilliant performance. At its most basic level, the story is simple. Cooper is Marshall Kane. It's his retirement day and his wedding day, all in one. He's marrying a pacifist Quaker (played by Grace Kelly) and he's handing in his badge as they prepare to head off into a new life. Unfortunately, just as they marry news arrives that a vicious killer named Miller whom Kane put in prison years before has been released and is on his way to town on the 12 noon train to take his revenge. Kane is faced with a dilemma - stay and face Miller and his gang, or ride off into the sunset with his beautiful young wife. Needless to say, Kane stays.But the movie isn't about a gunfight - although the gunfight that eventually comes (and which takes up only the last few minutes of the film) is a pretty good one. It's really a deeply reflective movie that addresses a lot of issues and questions. Why is Kane doing this? Why does he feel the need? Will the citizenry support him? Why or why not?To be blunt, I wasn't entirely convinced of Kane's nobility. I was actually somewhat nodding in agreement when one man in town made the point that if Kane would just leave there would probably be no trouble when Miller showed up, since Miller was coming to take revenge on Kane. In one sense, that's true. On the other hand, the point was made that under Kane the town had become safe for women and children, suggesting that perhaps with Miller back and Kane gone, the town would go back to what it was. So, although Kane is clearly the heroic and noble figure in this, I appreciated the willingness to at least raise those questions about why he felt the need to stay. Was he willing to sacrifice the lives of the townspeople for some personal cause that they had little if any involvement in? But the bulk of the ethical storyline was the response of the townsfolk. Would they fight with Kane or not? The answer was a resounding no. Only one man in town lined up with Kane (even his deputy quit on him) and that one man backed down when he discovered that no one else would stand with Kane. Was this cowardice or was it common sense? Certainly, the men of the town were afraid - who wouldn't be in the circumstances - but fear isn't necessarily cowardice. Sometimes fear is logical. This certainly looked like a suicide mission Kane was going to lead. How many of us would really sacrifice ourselves for a lost cause and leave behind our wives and children in the service of a cause that may not even have been necessary? This seemed to be a personal dispute between Kane and Miller. I found it easy to put myself in the place of the townsmen and, frankly, I don't think I would have been any more anxious to stand with Kane as any of them were. I think the movie provided an honest portrayal of human nature, and a serious consideration of when it might or might not be appropriate to make a sacrifice.This is a simple movie; a short movie. It's a little less than an hour and a half (filmed basically in real time) - but it packs a real punch. It's thought provoking, as opposed to your standard, formulaic western of the time. I loved the moral dilemma it portrayed and what I thought were the realistic reactions of the townspeople to the situation. I loved the theme. \"Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darlin,\" sung by Tex Ritter. It was so perfect and its application gradually shifted. As the movie opened, it was as if the words were a reflection on Kelly's Amy wanting Kane to simply leave town with her rather than facing and being a part of the violence that she abhorred, and possibly leaving her as a widow. Gradually, though (as the words of the song kept coming up hauntingly throughout) it obviously became a reflection of Kane's thoughts about the townspeople who were forsaking the marshal who had cared for them and kept them safe for so many years.John Wayne apparently didn't care for the film. He called it \"un- American\" (I assume because it portrayed most of the townsfolk as unwilling to fight) and in later years said that he wished he had been given the part of Kane so that he could have made it like one of his own westerns. I'm glad he didn't get the part. \"High Noon\" worked brilliantly as it was. The only thing that really threw me off was the age difference between Cooper and Kelly - and, yes, I know that Cooper and Kelly had a real-life affair while this was being filmed, and that Kelly often partnered (in movies and in life) with older men. Still, for whatever reason it bothered me. There was a certain \"creepiness\" factor watching Cooper kiss her. That's just me. Overall - the movie was brilliant. (9/10)",

            "content": "'High Noon' is one of the most acclaimed, respected and influential films not just within the Western genre, but in all of American cinema history. Along with a handful of other films, 'High Noon' paved the way for a new wave of films called 'Revisionist Westerns' which subverted the conventional clich\u00e9s of past Westerns along with blurring the distinctions between good and evil.The screenwriter Carl Foreman wanted his screenplay to reflect the demons of McCarthyism which was prevalent in Hollywood at the time. On watching the film with this prior knowledge, one can easily see that it has those allegorical subtext in it due to the extensive presence of betrayal and isolation. But the film can easily resonate with anyone even if the viewer doesn't see any connection with McCarthyism, this is because at the heart of it, 'High Noon' is a tale of moral dilemma.The director Fred Zinnemann and screenwriter Carl Foreman have actually kept the door open for multiple interpretations. Yes from an idealistic viewpoint, the viewer will certainly put himself/herself in Marshal William Kane's shoes and sympathise with him. From that perspective the town folks who backed out on him and refused to support him will look ever so cowardly. However, this film can be easily watched from the perspective of the town's folks. From this perspective, one can easily see why they wanted Kane to leave as soon as possible so that the blood loss could be avoided. Kane could have escaped with his wife and allowed his succeeding Marshal to deal with Frank Miller and his gang. Even though Kane was a great Marshal, but even then Kane's zeal to stick to his 'code' can be easily seen as a machismo fueled act of foolishness to retain his own ideas of masculinity and heroism in his own eyes. The excuses given by the people who refuse to side with Kane in this encounter for the most part actually seem plausible and understandable. I also understand the Mayor when he asks the people to veer off from any potential violence as he thought this would steer away all the investors up North who might be viewing this town as potentially investment worthy. So this is morally ambiguous and the viewer can view the themes in any way he/she feels. It is a heavily cynical film about the human spirit and our inherent selfishness. This is why I think this film will work as a great companion piece with either Billy Wilder's 'Ace in the Hole' if you want similar cynicism or Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' if you want to undercut 'High Noon's cynicism with a touch of unity.'High Noon' is majestically directed. The intro to the film with the three horse-riders riding into the small town and the onlookers reacting to them was breathtaking and utterly evocative. This intro heavily reminded me of 'Yojimbo'. Zinnemann is masterful at composing frames be it POV shots, unbroken shots, still shots,etc. The film takes place in real time and it moves along with great pace. Zinnemann brilliantly uses the 'High Noon Ballad' to raise tension, but he also knows exactly when to remove background music and let the visuals and real sounds take over to accentuate the emotional effect. The director brilliantly handles the mythic aspect of the character of Frank Miller. The concept of the unseen and invisible but ominous evil is beautifully done through the use of clocks, momentary shots of the railway, tracks, etc. with the music adding to it.Gary Cooper is a bit like Jeff Goldblum in my eyes, his acting style can be a bit jarring, but the tentativeness and vulnerability that is a fixture in his gestures and mannerisms is perfect for the role William Kane as the character himself feels extremely vulnerable under pressure of the adverse circumstances that he finds himself in. Kane's character itself subverted the concept of having the all powerful, idealistic, stoic hero, instead we get a human being who although being idealistic is prone to feelings and emotional vulnerability. We even see him break down at one point in the film after being overwhelmed by the fear of ominous adversity. Everyone else like Lloyd Bridges, Katy Jurado, Grace Kelly, Thomas Mitchell,etc. are great too. 'High Noon' in my opinion thoroughly deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. It is multi-layered, its cynicism has depth, and it dared to do something different in terms of character representation within the Western genre at a time when it was almost unheard of. Well written, brilliantly directed and well acted, this is an essential watch.",

            "content": "Although westerns are not usually my favorite, I confess to enjoying an occasional old John Wayne movie. While the Duke is master of the genre overall, High Noon is my absolute favorite western and, in my humble opinion, the best ever. Frankly, I cannot believe that John Wayne condemned it as un-American.This classic tells the wedding morning tale of Will Kane, who has just married a Quaker girl, Amy, and plans to retire as marshal of a small frontier town. However, he is warned via telegram that a man he once arrested, Frank Miller, will arrive on the noon train and is \"coming to get him\". Miller has just been released from prison and is bringing his buddies with him to enact revenge. Kane is torn \"betwixt love and duty\" as his pacifist Quaker bride threatens to leave him if he stays and fights Miller. In the scant time available, he tries to elicit help from the worthy but useless townsfolk, who are afraid of the Miller gang and want no part of any conflict. Meanwhile, that \"big hand is movin' along, nearin' high noon\"...The time element is critical to the film, as the movie plot (where Kane has from 10:45 to 11:45 AM available to him) coincides exactly with an hour of real time. Clocks are everywhere in the town and frequently show the minutes ticking away, as the tension dramatically builds to the arrival of the four Miller hoodlums on that noon train.Grace Kelly, the late lovely lady and princess of Monaco, plays Amy, his blonde bride and \"fair haired beauty\". She has a moral dilemma of her own, trying to reconcile loyalty to her husband with her nonviolent Quaker ideals. The movie's song \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling\" is cleverly catchy. I always feel like saddling up a horse and trotting nonchalantly along while singing it.However, apart from the dramatically done time element, this movie is made by Gary Cooper conveying masterfully the dilemma, conflict, and especially the personal integrity of the marshal, Will Kane, who is forced to stand alone against danger and evil, deserted by everyone including his new bride. A major theme of the movie is the cowardliness of the townspeople, whom Kane has counted on for support and who instead abandon him to fend off the bad guys on his own.It's a masterpiece of anticipation, suspense and, above all, character. Shining, heroic marshal (the very essence of integrity), lovely young bride, four bad and nasty villains. Don't miss this definitive western and brilliant classic.",

But first, I want to respond to one of the recent posts that faulted this film for being unrealistic, in her words, and \"on the cheap.\" She misses the point - and knows nothing of human nature. I was in a very similar position once, in danger in a small town. And this is exactly how people react - most people are cowards and will never support you when you need their help. This movie is brilliant, in its depiction of human nature. It's a rare person who stands up for what's right and that person will be very lonely indeed. As the judge puts it in the film, \"I have no time to give you a civics lesson\" - or something to that effect. In other words, heroes are few and far between. That's what makes this movie so great - the depiction of heroism in the face of impossible odds. These kinds of men existed in the West. Wyatt Earp was one such man. So was Billy the Kid. In addition - with regard the negative reviewer's comment that this movie was made \"on the cheap\"...what did she expect? Towns in the 1800s were simple and small, just as shown here. There were no car chases, crashes, explosions or loud noises or music. I think that reviewer's naivet\u00e9 about what to expect in a great film is all too telling about the lack of sophistication of today's movie goers. All they want is special effects - that, to them, makes for a great film. Shame - because she cannot appreciate true greatness, as in the acting in this film, and the subtleties it represents, in human emotions and motivations. Not to mention the commentary it makes about love - as in the taut scene between Cooper's former lover (played by Katy Jurado) and Grace Kelly (whose depth of love is tested by Cooper's decision to fight it out). In spite of the narrow range of experience expressed by the negative reviewer I referred to above, yes, there were men who stayed behind to fight it out, in truth, in our American West of 1800s, and this movie is a fine representation of them. (The Battle at the OK Corral, in fact, was the result of several brave men deciding to stick it out, in Tombstone, in the face of impossible odds - choosing to battle it out with the Cowboys (a band of real bad guys) rather than high-tailing it out of town. And they, too, had those who told them to leave - just as Cooper had happen to him in High Noon.) And Gary Cooper puts in the performance of his life here. What a brilliant film - and so unique. The tension just grows as we watch the clock tick off the hours before Frank Miller is due back in town. What a great dramatic device in one of the best films ever - with a cast of many many fine actors.",

            "content": "It's only very recently that I've taken an interest in the American Western genre, and, as far as I've been able to tell, each film falls loosely into two categories. The first group is comprised of the sort of films for which John Ford is renowned \u0096 Technicolor epics which involve the American frontier, magnificent countryside and tenacious tribes of Native Americans. The second group I have delicately termed \"small Westerns,\" usually low-budget, black-and-white stories \u0096 typically occurring over a small period of time \u0096 in which an ordinary man must summon all his courage to confront a gang of crazy and unpredictable cowboys. 'High Noon (1952),' directed by Hollywood stalwart Fred Zinnemann, falls snugly into the latter category, and succeeds relatively well in being a tense and atmospheric suspense Western. An aging Gary Cooper stars as Will Kane, the retiring Marshal of a small American town, who is forced to single-handedly confront an old enemy, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), who is set to arrive on the noon train. As Will scrambles frantically about town to secure assistance, his pleads are rebuffed at every turn, by friends and enemies alike.Cooper, aged 51 at the time of the film's release, won his second Oscar for his portrayal of Kane, an aging hero who finds that he simply can't run away from a confrontation, not so much because he wants to be heroic, but because he knows that he'll never be able to live with himself. As he marches across the dry, dusty roads of the small town \u0096 abandoned by those he considered his friends \u0096 Kane's ravaged features exhibit a sad loneliness, the pain of rejection and betrayal all too tragically evident on his face {Cooper was suffering from stomach ulcers and back pain at the time of filming, which presumably assisted the actor in demonstrating such pained emotions}. Also starring is the lovely Grace Kelly in only her second film role, and, though she isn't really given much to do, her mere presence is enough to add some warmth to the picture. The story itself unfolds almost in real-time {105 story minutes compared to 85 minutes of running time}, and Zinnemann exploits this to heighten the tension. The camera frequently cuts to a shot of the nearest clock, which steadily and inevitably ticks away towards noon, every second bringing Kane ever-so-closer to his moment of judgement.'High Noon' proved one of the most influential Westerns of its time, and films such as Delmer Dave's '3:10 to Yuma (1957)' surely could not have existed if not for its inspiration. However, and I suspect I'll be alone in this assessment, I consider the latter to be the superior picture, not because its better acted or directed, but simply because I felt that Dave did a finer job of drawing the odds against the film's hero. Both pictures achieve excellent suspense by continually keeping one eye fixated on the nearest time-piece, but 'High Noon' lacks an intimidating villain for the audience to fear. Indeed, most of the running-time builds up towards Frank Miller's arrival, but MacDonald unfortunately fails to live up to our worst expectations. 'High Noon' was Carl Foreman's final film before he was affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and many critics view the story as an allegory for the McCarthy era witch-hunts: Kane obviously represents the solitary, stoic American citizen who is unfairly abandoned by his friends and colleagues, and leaves the town as a lonely, embittered soul, disillusioned by the cold, dishonourable community that he had once called home.",

Simultaneously three outlaws ride into town and head to the station to meet Frank Miller, the leader of their gang who is due to arrive on the noon train.Miller is seeking revenge on those who had him convicted previously, some like the judge decide to leave town before Miller arrives, that is the Marshal's first instinct too but he turns round and returns face his enemy. Once back he goes about assembling deputies to help him but for one reason or another nobody wants to help. His deputy resigns as he is upset that the marshal didn't recommend him for promotion when he resigned, others are afraid and some even see Miller's return as a way to make money. To make matters worse his wife has decided she will be leaving on the train.Most of the film is taken up with the marshal's attempt to get help and as more and more people say no and the time nears noon the tension escalates. This film shows that it is possible to have a very exciting film without any swearing or constant bloodshed.Gary Cooper rightly won the best actor Oscar for this film but he isn't the only good actor in this, Grace Kelly is good as his restrained Quaker wife, a young Lloyd Bridges is excellent as the hotheaded deputy and Katy Jurado is great as the Mexican woman who has a past with Kain, Miller and the deputy.",

            "review_title": "Unromantic Western Tale is Probably the Best Prior to the Eastwood Era",
            "content": "During the 1940's and early 1950's, the typical film Western was a cookie-cutter escapist story, usually involving a bad guy in a black hat, and a heroic good guy in a white hat. The innocent townspeople suffered at the hands and gun of the outlaw until the heroic lawman confiscated his gun, cuffed his hands, or in some cases shot him dead, not unlike the young knight saving the Princess from the villain in a Chivalric Romance. Instead of swords the characters wield 6-shooters. But High Noon is different. Here good and evil are more blurred, and the issue of indifference in the face of danger becomes the all-encompassing theme. Instead of a chivalric heroism, High Noon is a morality tale which has more in common with Shakespeare and even Greek tragedy than with knighthood romance. The script also served as a metaphor for the Hollywood Red Scare/Blacklisting which was a result of McCarthyism during that time. \"High Noon\", one of the few films regarded as both a classic and a masterpiece, inspired many later films and television, such as the morally ambiguous Sergio Leone Westerns of the 1960's, which would also star Lee van Cleef, who finally gets to talk! It would also inspire the television series \"24\" which is also based on the idea of \"real time\".Despite popular misconception, the term \"High Noon\" meaning either the pinnacle/peak or the climax of a confrontation existed long before this film. The term itself dates from the late Middle Ages, and quotes from American Civil War primary sources (circa 1860's) use the phrase in the same way that it is treated in this film. The first audiences would have understood what the term meant in this context. The innovative concept which permeates the cinematic experience is having the events unfold in \"real time\" up until Noon. The first 90 minutes, from 10:30am to 12:00pm, are more or less 90 minutes of activity, and the audience is continually aware of the time with shots of different clocks and timepieces through this period which takes up about 75% of the movie.The plot is deceptively simple which paves the way for much more complex thematic and even psychological underpinnings. Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper in an Oscar-winning tour-de-force performance, learns on his wedding day about the return of a bona fide killer, Frank Miller, recently released from prison. Kane had apparently incarcerated him, and Frank Miller is now on a train scheduled to arrive in town where his three associates are waiting for him at the depot. (One of his associates, who remains silent the entire time except for a harmonica, is played by a very young Lee van Cleef!) Kane had been the town Marshall but upon his wedding decided to voluntarily retire. However, the new Marshall was not scheduled to arrive until the next day. Kane resolves he must stay in the town and confront Miller, despite the protests of the townspeople. He solicits volunteer deputies for the task but the townspeople appear indifferent to the plight.One of the most intriguing aspects of this film is the ambiguity. Although most of the town agrees that Frank Miller is a killer and outlaw, a few thrived under the anarchy of Miller, such as the owner of the local hotel who complains his business suffered when Kane moved in and stopped Miller. Which points to another interesting innovation: the film gradually reveals back-story but only as much as the characters decide to disclose. Only by the time Noon arrives has the audience put together the pieces of the larger puzzle. Even when we the audience first learn of the coming confrontation, there is much which remains concealed.The main reasons the film works as well it does is because of the outstanding script, the believability of all the actors, and the compelling camera work which paints a very different image on its cinematic canvas. The scenes are shot rather starkly in front of a seeming cloudless sky. Periodically, we see the railroad tracks going off into the distance, knowing only that it is from these tracks something menacing will arrive. Cooper is absolutely outstanding, his performance so subtle and underplayed it appears effortless but simultaneously absolutely believable. The dialog is for the most part right on the money, never lapsing into clich\u00e9. Characters talk very little about the dilemma and are often reluctant to tell what they know. The Mexican woman who had been involved with both Miller and later Kane as part of the back-story is asked about what she knows from Kane's bride but refuses. High Noon is a suspense film rather than a straightforward Western, which was one of its criticism early on but has over time become its strength. The subject could have been easily a film noir set in the 1940's with a killer arriving on a train into a city. But I think the starkness of a Midwestern American town circa 1870 gives the whole story a feeling of unease. Because the story relies more on drama and anticipation than pure action, High Noon rises above the fray and into the realm of drama which explores the tragic human condition. In this case, the tragedy is not one of unjustified death but the inability of humans to act courageously in the face of evil.",

            "content": "HIGH NOON is one of the most overrated movies of all time. It is an anti-western for anti-moviegoers, to paraphrase Andrew Sarris. It is the kind of western people who don't see westerns tend to like. Aesthetically, it is slow and talky and for the most part without tension. Narratively, it is frustrating and laughable to see a western \"hero\" act so spineless. (Howard Hawks made RIO BRAVO as a direct response to this picture, telling the same story but in reverse: everyone wants to help John Wayne but he won't let them!)The \"real-time\" gimmick is just that -- a gimmick.  And it results in showing many scenes which in and of themselves are dull and talky -- not what you want in a western.  Furthermore, if you watch the film carefully, you will see that it \"cheats\" -- it in fact is not told 100% in real time. But that really doesn't matter, as it's a totally arbitrary device anyway. Ironically, the one scene in the picture that really does work is the \"clock montage\" towards the end, which builds tension through cutting.  The rest of the time, Zinneman follows around Cooper listlessly.  And Cooper gives another wooden performance.  He was a movie star but never a great actor.It's easy to spend time watching this movie thinking, \"Why doesn't Cooper just get ON with it?  Why run around crying for help? Why doesn't the movie itself get on with it?\"There are dozens of better westerns. Here are a few. I defy anyone to see these movies and think HIGH NOON is more enjoyable, exciting, or involving: WINCHESTER '73, THE NAKED SPUR, BEND OF THE RIVER, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, THE TALL T, RIDE LONESOME, SEVEN MEN FROM NOW, COMANCHE STATION, THE SEARCHERS, THE WILD BUNCH, MAN OF THE WEST (and this one stars Cooper!), RUN OF THE ARROW, SHANE, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON..... etc etc.",

            "review_title": "A significant milestone in the Western genre",
            "content": "The American film genre par excellence, the Western film genre has been suffered many changes and explorations since its humble beginnings as a literary genre. In film, the genre has gone from being the epitome of the All-American hero's adventure to conquest a brave new world, to the basis of personal meditations about the nature of violence, honor and loyalty, and even the futility of the previously praised conquest of nature. Among the many films that helped to shape the genre through history, Fred Zinnemann's \"High Noon\" is one of the most important, as in it's realistic and suspense filled plot, we discover that we are not perfect, that we can be selfish and therefore evil, but most importantly, that a hero can be afraid.Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has a lot of reasons to be happy, he is finally getting married to his beloved Amy (Grace Kelly) and he finally is able to quit his job as Marshall of Hadleyville; but as soon as they get officially married, Kane receives the news of the return of Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a notorious outlaw who was sent to jail by Kane. Knowing that Frank will want to take revenge, the townspeople urges Kane to leave the town, but as the new Marshall will arrive until the next day, Kane decides to remain in town against his wife's desires. However, soon Kane will discover that the people he so strongly wants to defend are not willing to offer any help to their loyal Marshall.Loosely based on John W. Cunningham's story \"The Tin Star\", \"High Noon\" was written by Carl Foreman in an attempt to criticize Hollywood's (and other artists and intellectuals) silent and cowardly reaction to the policies of McCarthysm (Foreman was effectively blacklisted). While the political background of the movie was certainly important for its conception, the film transcended its time as it presented a way different reinterpretation of the Western genre, a portrait of a hero with the untraditional yet very human emotion of fear. The fear of facing death alone and the disappointment of watching the people he considered his friends turning their backs on him and denying him help. Certainly not a good portrait of the classic Western archetypes, but one that echoed in the genre and began the rejuvenation that would result in the complete revisionism of the genre.Experienced director Fred Zinnemann borough a lot of realism to a worn out genre and gave life to this story of courage with his efficient and overtly professional style. Taking the realism of the story to the max, Zinnemann conceived his film as an almost real time experience, making every minute of the film to represent a real life minute, and used this device to enhance the suspense and tension as the hour of the duel approaches. Against the classic conventions of the genre, Zinnemann placed more emphasis on this suspense instead of the action and the romance; a controversial decision indeed, but one that only helped to improve this masterpiece, as the film would not have had the same impact if it were done in a different way.Gary Cooper is simply excellent in what is probably the best role in his career. Suffering a bleeding ulcer at the time, Cooper took advantage of his physical pain to be able of transmit Kane's emotions in an overtly realistic way. While this is certainly Cooper's film, many of the actors in supporting roles deliver an outstanding performance as well, specially Katy Jurado, who literally steals every scene she is in as Kane's former lover and the only want who understands him (a groundbreaking role for a Mexican in a Western). Grace Kelly is effective, and while not exactly impressive, her career was just beginning and she shows the talent that would take her to the top in the following years. Finally, there are excellent performances by Otto Kruger and Lon Chaney Jr. in their minor supporting roles.Heavily criticized on it's release due to the many classic conventions the film broke (as well as for its supposed \"anti-Americanism\"), \"High Noon\" is simply one of the most important Westerns ever made. While it's true that it doesn't follow the constrains of Western to the letter, the way it uses the genre to deliver its message opened the doors to new interpretations and explorations of the Western. It caused strong reactions (Howard Hawks' excellent \"Rio Bravo\" was a direct answer that followed the classic Western pattern in opposition to \"High Noon\"), but it also echoed in future westerns that presented ambiguous and flawed heroes (\"Shane\", \"Vera Cruz\", or the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s) in \"anti-Western\" situations.One of the most praised Western films in history, \"High Noon\" truly deserves its status as one of the best films ever made. This multi-layered story of conflict and complex morals is a must-see not only for Western fans, but for every movie lover, as the themes dealt in the film could be placed in any setting. This revolutionary Western is an example that film is about stories, no matter what genre is used. 10/10. Masterpiece",

His primary drive is not courage but sense of duty. He is all but the iconic lonesome cowboy.\nJust as in most Westerns there is a shootout nearly at the end. The pivotal scene is however the scene after the shootout. Its a real ode to cowardice.Just as in the television series \"24\" the film is nearly in real time (running time = 85 min, story time = 100 min). The frequent scenes with clocks reminds us of this fact and builds up the tension.",

Cooper's decency and sense of moral righteousness is constantly commended by Zinneman and writer Carl V.

But really average for me was the shoot-out : 1 against 4, the rogues just being dumb and shot down with reasonable ease. This could have been arranged easier. And if the Marshal checks his Winchester rifles in the office, why doesn't he pick one, offering him range and extra firepower ?

            "content": "This is the first movie I have seen with Gary Cooper. Saying that may make me sound that I am not from this planet, but to be honest, trying to find a good old 1950s western is rather hard these days. After saying that, I am glad that I got to see a movie starring Gary Cooper. \"High Noon\" is a great old western. Cooper gave a great performance as the marshal of a small, apathetic town William Kane. He doesn't deliver one-liners or clich\u00e9s that John Wayne often did in his movies, rather he immersed himself as a character who stands his ground against four men who are sent to kill him over his past.I found that director Fred Zinneman was able to capture such a tense movie wonderfully, using a variety of camera angles and shots such as pans and crane shots. I will note though that I found it funny in one crane shot, when the camera pulls out from the town before the big finale. It pulls out too far, revealing parts of Los Angeles in the right hand corner of the screen. Anyway, the editor also did a decent job in building tension as well.The first half hour is dry with many long shots, but as Kane is forced to look for deputies to assist him, the editor uses multiple shots that are probably no longer than five seconds in each scene. This technique keeps it interesting and making the film feel all the more suspenseful. A well-deserved Oscar there of '52. But the one let down in this movie is the music. The score wasn't bad, but I couldn't stand the theme song that is used throughout the movie. Flat out saying it, it was annoying. Other than that, \"High Noon\" is a great old western that lovers of the genre would get a treat out of. 9/10 I will note though that this is not an action-oriented western. There is only one big shoot-out at the end. The film is based on character versus action.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Thanks to the Cinemark Classic Series, seeing this one on the big screen became a summer highlight. Often rated as one of the all-time best, and easily one of the best from the western genre, the film was written (by Carl Foreman) as an allegory to Hollywood blacklisting brought on by Sen. McCarthy's red-baiting crusade. The cowardly townspeople represent those who wouldn't stand up against the wild and often false accusations.The film won four Oscars, including Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane. The character is often compared to Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird. Both are shining examples of men doing the right thing in very difficult circumstances. It's been noted that Gary Cooper's constant look of pain during the film might not have been excellent acting after all. He reportedly was suffering from a bleeding ulcer and a bad back during filming.Originally filmed in \"real\" time with the numerous clock shots to prove it, the film was re-edited prior to release, nullifying the effect. Tex Ritter (John's father) version of \"High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me)\" is heard throughout, and will stick in your head for some time after viewing. This was the first major motion picture for both Grace Kelly and Lee Van Cleef. Ms. Kelly plays Kane's new bride, who doesn't understand his need to stay and face Frank Miller. Mr. Van Cleef flashed his beady eyes here and went on to have a long career as a top notch villain.The film is directed by Fred Zinnemann who also directed From Here to Eternity, Oklahoma!, and A Man for All Seasons. Zinnemann lost the Oscar to John Ford, and film lost to The Greatest Story Ever Told. It's considered one of the greatest Oscar upsets in history. Floyd Crosby was the cinematographer ... he is the father of singer David Crosby (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young).Other supporting work is courtesy of Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy from It's a Wonderful Life), Katy Jurado (excellent as Helen Ramirez), Lon Chaney, Jr, Harry Morgan (later Col Potter in MASH), and Sheb Wooley (later known for singing \"The Purple People Eater\"), and of course, Lloyd Bridges as Harvey, Kane's ambitious deputy (and father to Beau and Jeff).Cooper is at his most dominant in this role and it's difficult to believe that just about every other Hollywood leading man of the time was offered the role prior to him. Cooper's Will Kane is the epitome of the strong, silent type ... and a real stand-up guy.",

            "content": "Before Fred Zinnemann made classics like From Here to Eternity and A Man for All Seasons, he made one of the most recognized Westerns in history, High Noon. Gary Cooper's career has been in decline for years, so this film helped him put his career in turnaround. He actually won an Academy Award for his performance, and I can say he delivers a powerful performance. The movie also receives credit for being an early \"revisionist\" Western. In other words, this movie does not play out like traditional Westerns which surprised many people. The build-up towards the explosive ending works very well, and I also liked how feminist the film is when compared to other Westerns. The women (including the great Grace Kelly) are given juicy but significant roles.The making of film features some exciting drama. The production was beginning in the midst of another Red Scare, so communism was on the minds of many Americans. The screenplay was written by Carl Foreman, who apparently may have had ties to communists. He was brought before HUAC where he was deemed an \"uncooperative witness.\" His production partner was Stanley Kramer whom believed Foreman was going to accuse him. It was a mess, but Foreman remained with the project although Kramer was given more reign. Before Gary Cooper signed on, John Wayne was the initial choice. Wayne despised the project because he felt like blacklisting was a central theme for the movie and he supported the idea of blacklisting people when Foreman didn't. The movie did not live up to Wayne's ideals. Interestingly enough, Cooper shared similar views of Wayne's, but he still accepted the role and committed to it. But any awards chatter was hearsay for him which is a shame because this is Cooper's movie. But it goes to show the drama behind the scenes of any film can be very exciting.Fred Zinnemann changed the course of Westerns with this classic. People were expecting beautiful scenery, explosive action sequences/gunfights, and the traditional male lead saving a civilization from bad guys. Yes, that is the definition of an old-fashioned Western. So, imagine the surprise when people got moralistic and pensive dialogue for most of the running time...until the final showdown. Imagine how people felt when Cooper's character fights the baddies all alone because the townspeople bailed on him for lame excuses (complete opposite of a traditional Western). And also imagine the surprise when women (Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado) were given strong, beneficial roles. In fact, Kelly's character had a major role in the film's ending. Contemporaries of the day, such as Alfred Hitchcock, did not agree with Kelly's performance. I just suppose they were not ready for changing times.Played out in real time (really enjoyed this gimmick, but had to get used to it), Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is set to be married to the love of his life, Amy Fowler Kane (Grace Kelly) and to retire from his post. He is, however, told that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a man he sent to be hung, is returning on the noon train to exact his revenge on Kane. He seeks the help of the townsfolk whom he protected for so long. In heartbreaking fashion, they all turn their back on him. In the end, it looks like Marshal Kane will be facing off against Miller and his posse...alone.Gary Cooper shines in what is one of his best performances. His character is different than what he is accustomed to, but he made it work. Definitely gave his character more sadness as a result. Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado are fantastic in their respective roles. Each woman plays a major part in making sure Cooper is alive by the film's end. Also, Lloyd Bridges as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell and Thomas Mitchell as Mayor Jonas Henderson likewise deliver strong supporting performances.Overall, High Noon is worth a watch. If you like Westerns from the 1960's and later, you owe this film some respect as it changed how Westerns were produced. I find it hilarious how much Wayne hated the movie. Funnily enough, his film Rio Bravo was made in response to High Noon's success. Also memorable is the film's theme song, known as \"High Noon,\" also known as \"Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darling.\" The song does seem to be beaten across the head as composer Dmitri Tiomkin incorporated it often in his score. The film's ending remains one of the best endings you will see! I was satisfied. If you think the film runs slow at first, just wait until the end.My Grade: A-",

But when the news breaks out that a notorious killer whom the marshal sent to prison years ago is returning on the noon train to exact revenge, the sheriff returns to face him but finds himself completely alone as the people he has protected for so long coldly turn their backs on him.Excellently directed by Fred Zinnemann & deftly written by Carl Foreman, the entire story is narrated in real time & gets better as the film progresses. It's much different to a typical western as the characters & their inner conflicts with themselves is the element that's given more priority. Cinematography is finely carried out while editing cleverly paces the film's story so that it runs parallel to real time. Music is structured around a single song, which wasn't bad, that keeps resonating throughout the film but is at its best with a new track during its third act.As far as acting goes, Gary Cooper delivers the standout performance amongst the cast as Marshal Kane & completely owned his character. However, my favourite moment in the film is the little montage that shows the various happenings in town when the clock is about to hit 12 o'clock, indicating the arrival of the train. That scene is tense, expertly shot & vehemently supported by a brilliant score and I liked it even more than what happens in the subsequent climactic showdown.On an overall scale, completely taking me off by surprise & scoring much better against my initial expectations, High Noon is a wonderful example of quality cinema that tries to approach its genre in a rather unconventional manner & is a must for fans of western cinema.",

Also, there are just too many cowards in this film, I was really hoping that at least a couple men would come around and help the marshall. I was disappointed when his deputy fought with him. It also seemed silly for Gary Cooper's character to even stay and fight if no one else wanted to since he had already resigned; I get that the point is to stand up to bullies but I don't know. So, a fine film, 6/10, but perhaps overrated. P. S. The Mexican actress Katy Jurado is the best part of this film.",

            "content": "Perhaps the most politicized of westerns, hailed as a masterpiece when it first came out, then fashionably derided as the reputation of its director dipped, it now seems so familiar as to veer on the edge of parody. But seeing it now and putting it in its historical context it feels like one of the most important and finest of all American movies. For a start, it was the first truly 'grown-up' western, aimed at an intelligent, adult audience and it changed the form the western was to take afterwards. After \"High Noon\" the western was able to deal, not just in the mythic, but in the here and now while structurally elements of the film can be found in the work of directors as far removed from Zinneman as Peckinpah and Leone.Of course, the film was born out of a liberal disgust at the route America was taking at the time; (it was scripted, superbly, by the black-listed Carl Foreman and it's producer, Stanley Kramer, was to become famous for his grand-standing social conscience movies). Indeed, as an allegory people were comparing it to Greek tragedy which may be over-egging the pudding a bit, but on its own generic terms it works magnificently.Cooper's Will Kane was the quintessential quiet American hero who not only stood for right but for a universal sense of justice and he was justly awarded the Oscar. In a superb supporting cast, Katy Jurado, Lloyd Bridges, Thomas Mitchell and Lon Chaney Jr are at their best. while Grace Kelly's luminous performance hints at what was to come. Much has been made of the film's running time mirroring the actual time of the events portrayed, (and Elmo Williams' and Harry Gerstad's Oscar-winning editing captures this brilliantly), yet on hindsight this is the least of the film's virtues. It should be included on any list of the ten best westerns ever made.",

            "review_title": "Bill Clinton sure has good taste in Westerns, seeing as how he picked this remarkable film as his all-time favorite",
            "content": "One this is for certain about former president Bill Clinton: he has great taste in movies, particularly Westerns. In 1993, he helped the overlooked masterpiece \"Tombstone\" gain recognition by applauding it and Val Kilmer's performance, and during his eight years in the presidency, he watched Fred Zinnemann's classic \"Nigh Noon\" seventeen times. It is his favorite movie and a favorite of many, including myself. \"High Noon\" has oftentimes been called a Western for people who don't like Westerns and it very much is, because it has so much depth in its otherwise conversant premise.The setup is familiar. An outlaw has been paroled early from prison and is returning to town to gun down the marshal to sent him there in the first place. The marshal (Gary Cooper) ties the knot with his Quaker fianc\u00e9e (Grace Kelly) on the day that he learns the outlaw is meeting up with his old gang after he arrives on the noon train. Cooper, feeling a responsibility to protect his town, starts preparing to face down the enemy. That daunts him, but what complicates the scenario is that nobody, not his fianc\u00e9e, not his deputy, nor anybody else in town will lend a finger to help him.This is not exactly an original plot premise for a Western. In fact, it's been used many times. Now the denouement and the payoff of the movie is vastly alien from the way this type of movie usually ends, but there is so much more to it than that. Right away after the opening, which gives you the impression that the story will be familiar, screenwriter Carl Foreman and director Frank Zinnemann construct a very deep, very complex, and compelling story that oddly enough parallels the political divides (maybe that's why it has such appeal for Mr. Clinton?).\"High Noon\" may be a Western but it almost seems like the type of Western that Alfred Hitchcock would have directed. Like that wonderful movie of his' \"Rear Window\" (1954), \"High Noon\" spends most of its time setting up the scenario and then the final act is sheer suspense. Suspense of waiting for the noon train to arrive, waiting for the hour hand to strike twelve, waiting for the outlaws to come and kill Cooper, who can't even find old friends willing to help him. I don't wish to give too much away, but there is a spectacular moment that really shows how alone the marshal really is. After the train has arrived, he stands in the middle of the town. The shot begins with an eye level close-up of him and then pans back, high into the air (a crane shot) and we see Cooper standing alone in the middle of a deserted town and with nothing on the soundtrack, we sense his dread and feel his isolation.Another very interesting scene is a moment in the town church, which seems to a representation of political arguments. The movie has also been noted as an allegory for blacklisting, which is why John Wayne had a particular dislike for the film, even though he was courteous enough to accept Cooper's Oscar for him the following year when he did not attend the ceremony. There are also great subplots with additional characters and a lot of depth is explored in these scenarios. This feels not like a staged story. It feels like a real event.Gary Cooper won his second Academy Award for \"High Noon\" and he was more than deserving of such a prestigious honor. His performance as the isolated marshal is absolutely superb, zeroing in on his lines with precision and an atmosphere of panic, yet optimism that somebody somewhere might help him. Grace Kelly as his wife is terrific, as she always was and it's movies like \"High Noon\" that make me wish she had done more pictures. Lloyd Bridges is effective and buttoned-up in his performance as Cooper's cowardly, conflicted deputy and Katy Jurado, a marvelous Hispanic actress, is superb as the businesswoman who seems to have connections to most everybody in town in one way or another. There are other great performances by names such as Thomas Mitchell, who brings a lot of flamboyant charisma to his role as he always did, and keep an eye out for Lee Van Cleef in his dialogue-free feature film debut. It's fun to think that he stared here playing a bit part, then went on to slay Ray Harryhausen's rhedosaurus in \"The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms\" and ultimately facing down Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach in one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history at the conclusion of Sergio Leone's \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" Another great performance is, oddly enough, by the clock, which is apparent enough to almost be a supporting role. The clock generates almost as much fear as the outlaws do.This is one extraordinary Western that I agree will have appeal for all sorts of people. It really got me involved. Heck, you know, Bill Clinton may just make a movie critic yet....",

Although the final face-off still packs a wallop, I'd long since stopped believing in or caring about these stock characters.\"Stagecoach\" -- with half the budget and twice the cinematic imagination -- is a much better bet as the top Western.",

            "content": "That's a simple western film, just before the renaissance of the genre with Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone and a few others. It is a classic of that period (1952) and in a way a turning point. A criminal was caught and sent to prison because one marshal and the population of a township did what they had to do. The criminal should have hanged but some law from Washington changed the game and he only got five years of prison. Five years later he comes back to kill those who had tried to have him hanged. The town learns about it when they see three of his associates come for the noon train, and it is confirmed by telegraph that the criminal, a certain Miller, is on the train. The city has a little more than one hour to do what they can to solve the problem. The marshal had just gotten married thirteen minutes earlier and he was to leave on his honeymoon and he was no longer the marshal and a new marshal was arriving on the following day only, slightly too late. The marshal comes back to assume the situation. He tries to get six deputies and the only he gets are a family man with two kids (he volunteers because he is convinced many more are going to come and he will step back when he finds out no one else has volunteered), then a one-eyed saloon customer who does not realize he is not fit for it, and a fourteen year old boy who is definitely too young and untrained. All the others refuse and even ask him to leave for Miller to do nothing. His newly-wed wife leaves on the noon train, or at least gets on it, though she will get off at the last minute. The judge leaves as soon as he can. The mayor asks in church the marshal to leave, while the parson refuses to commit himself (thou shalt not kill). All his friends avoid him or just plain say no. Alone he is and alone he will have to deal with the four outlaws who are trying to kill him. He will of course succeed. the details of his simple strategy and opportunistic tactics are in the film and you will have to go check them. And the film reveals how cowardly people can be and how they consider law and order is not their problem but that of the professional they pay to take care of it. That's the only really positive point that is different from the standard vision of traditional older western films. It is not blind gunfights and it is not everyone against the criminal. It shows the psychology of people in a crisis situation is very often divided and their reflex is often to hide their heads in the sand or run to cover behind the first bush they can find, senior or junior, who cares, provided it is not a burning bush.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

He said the acting was weak and the plot was clich\u00e9d. I was patient because I felt this person had totally missed the boat. This is a very bleak, very simple film. Will Kane's charge is to see that there is safety for his town and to \"face the man who hates' him. What's disturbing about the movie is that the silent hero who is as much Gary Cooper as Will Kane need not do what he does. It's the code of the West and the consequences are death. He has this young bride, Grace Kelly, and a future, and yet he's going to sacrifice it for what is right. This is about mythology. This is about Troy and the gods. He has no choice. He would not be a man. He can't resort to being like the townspeople who, for the most part, refuse to even help. Of course, this is true because people don't want to die. They pay a man a few bucks and give him a badge and they cast off all their responsibilities, even if he has to cut through a herd of bad guys. The desolation and bleakness of this town stands in contrast to the heroism. If this man dies, life will go on and no one will really remember.",

It is also an allegory to the McCarthy witch hunts that were taking place in the USA at the time.Gary Cooper plays the ageing Marshall Will Kane, who marries the young, beautiful Quaker girl Amy (Grace Kelly.) He is due to retire and and is preparing to leave town a day before his replacement is scheduled to arrive.Unfortunately, villain Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is arriving on the noon train and he is looking for revenge against Kane for sending him to jail some years earlier. He was not hanged and now he has been released early. His gang members that includes a younger Lee Van Cleef are waiting at the train station for him to arrive and then go after Kane.The townspeople implore Kane to leave with his bride but he decides that he must stay and fight. Kane believes that running away will not mean he will be safe and he will always have to look behind his shoulders.Kane spends a lot of the time trying to round up the townspeople to take on the gang. No one wants to be deputised because they are afraid or believes that Miller will be good for business.Even his deputy Marshall (Lloyd Bridges) refuses to help because he is upset at being passed over for promotion and is also dating Kane's ex flame, a Mexican hotel owner Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado) and believes that they still have feeling for each other.The town is expanding, it is going places. The Marshall and others cleaned up the town several years earlier by sending Miller down but now he finds himself alone. His best friends who were with him at his wedding a few hours earlier now want to avoid him. They want him to leave, probably knowing that he and his wife will be killed somewhere in the prairies, out of sight and out of mind.It is interesting to note that the town's judge finding out that Miller is returning quickly packs his bags and leaves. He knows that the townsfolk will not lift a finger to help. He tells Kane of an ancient Greek story before he scrams. Even Ramirez believes the same thing. She quickly sells up and is scheduled to go on the next train out, ironically with Amy, who does not want Kane to fight because of her pacifist believes.As the clock ticks down, Kane gets ready for a shootout.The film's political sentiments might be overstated as screenwriter Carl Foreman was blacklisted. It is a story of a man standing alone for a principle discarded by friends, family and people he helped. The final scene where the Marshall's badge is thrown away might had been deemed to be controversial at the time but twenty years later, Clint Eastwood did the same thing in Dirty Harry. In that movie maybe Harry thought he was no better than the criminals than finding that the people he was saving were cowardly scumbags themselves.",

            "content": "Not the conventional John Wayne good guy proving to be higher than all, but a movie that portrays what life really is; you can't do everything by yourself you need the help of others.High Noon stars Gary Cooper and it was a subject of controversy at its time of release, with people deeming the protagonist behavior as un-American. But no matter what they all say High Noon has been a White House favorite, Bill Clinton cited High Noon as his favourite film ever and during his tenor he screened it 17 times at the White House.This 1952 American Western movie is ranked 27th on the American Film Institute's 100 movies.... 100 Years, Gary Cooper the lead, was actually like 30 years older than Grace Kelly who played his wife in the movie. High Noon is not filled with the regular violence, shooting, riding and chase that most western films are known for except for the ending that is where the shooting finally took place.The movie plot is about the battle of a man, who had to carry the load of a town alone. Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is the marshal of Hadleyville and he just got married to a pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and he planned to turn in his badge and go on a honey moon with his wife and start life elsewhere.But things changed when he learnt that the train that is coming to take him out of Hadleyville at 12pm is bring along with it Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), who has been a form of a terrorist to the towns folks and a criminal which Kane took down a while back.Frank Miller had been sentenced to death by hanging but was pardoned, so he was riding back to the town where he got convicted to strike the cord of revenge on Kane.Kane now picks up the badge and decides to stay till Miller comes around so as to see what his plans are, because waiting for Miller's arrival is 3 of his gang men which Kane saw as a sign of upcoming trouble.The movie is about the difficulty Kane faced trying to raise a team of deputies to help face Miller and his boys should in case trouble arises.High Noon won 4 Academy Awards which included Best Actor in a Leading Role for Gary Cooper which was received for him by John Wayne who disliked the film, and has been noted to have said that his movie Rio Bravo was done as a response to High Noon.The movie director Fred Zinnermann who is known for his attention details, has won two Academy Awards for directing for the movies From Here to Eternity and A Man for All Seasons.High Noon is not your conventional westerns but it is a classic all the way, so there is no reason to see what AFI calls the 2nd best western movie.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "review_title": "Finding Harmony in Moral Ambition and Inherent Good",
            "content": "It fits like a glove that High Noon is one of the earliest uses of popular song being integrated as film score, because High Noon is a lyrical film. Its use of time gives it a cadence, with ellipses and verses, with a rhythm kept by certain elements of repetition in its details, the use of which is rhythmically increased as we reach the all-important climax, and in its bridge- and chorus-like set pieces. And the famous Oscar-winning Ballad mirrors it, lyrically annotating the premise of nobility and responsibility which identify the picture. We postmodern youngsters can laugh all we want at the melodramatic moralizing, but an aspiring director could learn virtually all they need to know about precise visual storytelling from High Noon.It's also idiosyncratic in the American canon of Westerns, in that Carl Foreman's script creates a dialogue between the idea of good vs. evil and the passivity of understanding how inconsequential that idea is when facing a loaded gun. What separates a good man, or woman as things develop, from a bad one after a good one has used whatever means necessary to stop evil? The actions are the same. Kane's new wife Amy understands that, even though at first she seems to be yet another token Worried Wife whose emotions always dominate her common sense. Not so, as Foreman is very clever in squeezing all the thematic benefit he can from Amy, whose role in the ultimate turn of events heralds a whole character arc of her own. Not only is she a Quaker, probably a bold stroke for its time, but Zinnemann pits her in contrast with Helen Ramirez, a frankly mercenary soul who bows to no conventions or pigeonholes except those of needing and wanting to both survive and be free as a Mexican woman in the American West. That she was once Kane's lover even reflects the gray area in him as well.Kane nevertheless becomes increasingly simple as a Christ-like figure standing alone in raising the standards of society's moral ambitions. Anticipating the villain Frank Miller's advent on the noon train, he endures a lingering, solitary night of the soul as the temperature swelters, his fellow townspeople disperse, and it becomes pitch-dark amidst the glare of noon. It's never conclusive whether the marshal is carrying out a deed of inspirational, bigheaded pointlessness, as his new wife thinks, or just doing what he feels is necessary. After on-going stretches of cardboard manly hardihood in movies, High Noon is ever more valuable if only as the framework of how to define the heroically righteous man before the illusion capsized.This uncommonly well-handled Stanley Kramer production paints a poignant portrait of a small western town as it folk anticipate a duel between the marshal and a vindictive outlaw, planned for noon. The temperament of the people is carefully encapsulated by Fred Zinnemann's direction and Floyd Crosby's illustrative shooting. Avoiding sweeping Western scenery and lively action sequences, Zinnemann creates claustrophobic tension by boiling down to three images: Kane's increasing anxiety; mercilessly ticking clocks counting down the minutes toward noon; and the ill-omened, bare train tracks that will ultimately bring Kane's nemesis into town. Zinnemann meticulously and ponderously maximizes the atmosphere radiated by the looming bloodshed, keeping the tautness persistently escalating until it's decided in the liberating culmination. Carl Foreman's script is pretty scathing in what it has to say about a public prepared to agree to peace and discipline only if they don't have to put individual effort into upholding it.Cooper is uncommonly adept playing the marshal. He's rebuffed wherever he goes, compelled to defy the urging of his bride and, ultimately, confronting the dooming menace of the returning killer alone. Like Zinnemann's later outstanding A Man for All Seasons, High Noon is a portrayal of unwavering moral nerve in a man who is resisted by his society, his peers, even his wife, and is prepared to sacrifice himself for his ethics. What those ethics are, however, is not as lucid in Will Kane's case as in that of Thomas More. Kane implies more than one basis for his obstinate resolve in facing Miller, some realistic, but others just egotistical. Prowling somewhere underneath Kane's inflexible willpower is another issue of morality: The movie was made during the McCarthy era, when Hollywood filmmakers who declined to oblige HUAC were blacklisted or betrayed by contemporaries more concerned with self-protection than in defending their equals or confronting the Hollywood blacklist.",

            "content": "High Noon blew me away: it's a very short film but very dense; the concept is very simple but intriguing. And it all rolls out in near- real time. If you see Lee Van Cleef at the beginning and suspect a final duel for a showdown you're in the wrong place: this is a very American film, in both plot and theme.Marshall Will Kane (Gary Cooper)has been married for less than 10 minutes when he receives news that a killer he sent to jail is coming back for his revenge, his posse already waiting for his train. Despite his reputation, the townsfolk insist \"things are different\" and are hesitant to help. This is mixed with constant looks at clocks, showing that time is short: there's literally 90 minutes between the news and Miller arriving. Action is second to dialogue and crowd dynamic. In this regard, the film is a drama dressed up like a Western.Have you ever tried to get a group to do something, but everyone is hesitant to help because everyone else is hesitant to help? That is what I found to a major theme in the film- the lack of mob confidence and therefore strength of the individual. High Noon serves also as an allegory to the Communist hunts in Hollywood, siding with the accused unlike the later 'On The Waterfront', which sides with the accuser but parallels this film in many ways. Kane's final expression perfectly expresses the stance on this topic, and is a very memorable image.I feel like High Noon is one of those films that should be written out and taught in high school like a Shakespeare play. The many supporting characters are interesting, symbolizing and crafting reflections for Kane, one of cinema's great hero. The plot, character decisions, cinematography and themes could be analyzed for hours, but that's not the point of this review: I just want you to take the time to see this 60 year- old classic that you've probably heard of but haven't seen. It's fantastic. 8.7/10",

            "content": "`High Noon' is frequently mentioned among the best Westerns and even among the best films ever made.  It is rated #33 by the American Film Institute on their top 100 of the 20th century.  It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including best actor for Gary Cooper, best song and best editing.  But, was it really that good?  After all, it was a bare bones black and white Western in an age of Technicolor spectaculars.It was that good and more.  `High Noon' was not really a Western as the genre had been defined to that point.  It was more of a character study of the human condition.  It just happened to be set in the American West. Westerns at that time were action films with white hats and black hats. There were fistfights and gunfights throughout the entire film.  They clearly differentiated good guys, on the side of justice and righteousness, from bad guys who spurned laws and sneered at those who obeyed them.  The heroes were always noble and fearless, typified by actors like John Wayne and Roy Rogers.  Moreover, the good guys always stuck together, despite all odds, to prevail against the outlaws.`High Noon' was the complete antithesis of this formula.  Kane is a flawed hero who is proud to a fault.  Although it is clear who the villain is, we never see him until the last ten minutes of the film.  The story is not about good and evil in the larger sense.  Instead, it is about conviction and integrity on a personal level.  Kane is portrayed as stubbornly putting his own feelings above the safety of the town.  He stands against everyone, willing to sacrifice his marriage, his friendships, his good name and his life for his honor and self-respect.  The biggest departure from the formula was his unabashed manifestations of fear.  This was unheard of for a Western hero.Controversy swirled around this film, released in 1952 amid the Red Scare and the McCarthy Era.  The fearful and selfish townspeople who turned their backs on Kane were seen to be allegorical of the movie industry that abandoned those who were blacklisted as communists.  Many in the industry saw it as smug slap in the face.  John Wayne called the film `un-American', preferring to think that Americans would always stick together to fight injustice, ignoring the reality of numerous branded actors who couldn't get work.  Stanley Kramer, in an interview forty years later, continued to deny that there was any hidden agenda.  He said it was a film about human nature, and the coincidental fact that there was such a striking parallel was just an indication that human nature doesn't change.The vanguard direction by Fred Zinnemann was nothing short of brilliant. Zinnemann eschewed the Western formula and struck out in a completely different direction.  He chose black and white to give it a stark look.  The sky was overcast rather than sunny and blue.  The entire film was shot for only $700,000 (an extremely small sum even for 1952) almost completely on a studio lot.  This was the first Western, (and possibly the first film) to tell a story in real time (the story transpires in roughly the same amount of time as the length of the film).  The villainous Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) was known only through dialogue and he did not actually appear until the end of the film.  Zinnemann hung the pall of Miller ominously in the air like an evil spirit who was feared but unseen.  This made the villain bigger than life and added to the suspense.  Even when Miller finally arrived on the noon train, Zinnemann didn't let us see his face for a full two or three minutes, showing him strapping on his guns from behind and talking to his gang.  Finally, there was no action until the very end of the film.He uses two very effective techniques to build suspense.  The first is the use of clocks.  In the beginning of the film, they were small clocks in the background that had short pendulums that swung quickly.  As we got closer to noon, the clocks got bigger and the pendulums swing more slowly making them more menacing.  At noon, the clock took up the entire screen as we waited for the last tick and the train's whistle.The second technique was the repeated use of a static vista looking down the railroad tracks from ground level with no train.  This was a constant reminder that Frank was coming.  This created an extraordinary amount of tension.  Tinnemann's use of reaction shots and the editing by Harry Gerstad and Elmo Williams (who won an Oscar) were also brilliantly done.The use of music was also innovative.  Rather than a full orchestra pumping out heart pounding adventure music, we had a simple ballad featuring a harmonica and the voice of country great Tex Ritter.  This haunting tune emphasized the loneliness of Kane's situation.  The acting was marvelous.  Gary Cooper is masterful as the tormented Marshall who stands against the entire town and his own fear to face down the Miller gang.  This film launched Grace Kelly's career.  She was not only shockingly beautiful but gave a fantastic performance as Kane's wife, who all but abandons him.  Lloyd Bridges also shines as the hotheaded deputy. Other notables included Lon Chaney, Harry Morgan, Katy Jurado and Lee Van Cleef.This film redefined an entire genre.  It has been called the quintessential Western, but that is too narrow in its praise.  It is quintessential filmmaking, a perfect 10.  It is required viewing for film buffs who appreciate the creative aspect of the art.  Besides that, it's great entertainment.",

            "content": "Overall the film is good, but there are two sides of it.Good side. Everything about the leading character is simply outstanding. The Mexican woman and the marshal's wife are powerful characters too. The timing of the movie is impressive: the clock is ticking, the marshal seems to get older with each minute, and the pressure is increasing. The interaction of the main hero and the town's people is very interesting (only two persons show their free will to stand up and fight: a teenager and a one-eyed drunkard).Bad side. The main villain. He is so lame and unimpressive that I really felt frustration when he appeared. Is this what we had been waiting for? Jack Colby is a sidekick only, but he is so much more memorable. The way Jack Colby glances, the way he walks, and the way he talks are at least cool. What I am driving at, Frank Miller sucks. The final shootout. Here lies another weak point of the film. We've been waiting for something amazing. Well, I have been waiting. And what do I get? The choreography is almost non-existent. I cannot even see what happens. Bang! And one of the villains is out of the game like a toy soldier. We don't even see how it all happens. Bang! And another is falling at such a long distance from the camera that it looks impersonal and unemotional. Here I remember watching \"The Wild Bunch\" \u0096 a few minutes of the movie passes and you already have a very stylish bloodbath. I also would like to compare \"High Noon\" to \"The Hitcher\" \u0096 remember that one? The final fight in \"The Hitcher\" is as powerful as an A-bomb. And there's nothing to do with colour. Black-and-white is not a problem. I guess \"High Noon\" gives me an example of anticlimactic ending. The shootout is very real, I guess, but it is not stylish. For me it is a problem.Verdict: as a psychological drama this movie is fine (if Mr Bill Clinton really likes this movie that much, he surely has a good taste in cinema), but as a western it is a weak attempt (if I want a stylish western, I will watch \"Per un pugno di dollari\", \"C'era una volta il West\" or \"The Wild Bunch\" instead).Still, I give it a 7 out of 10.

            "content": "Gary Cooper gave his second Academy Award winning performance as Best Actor as a beleaguered frontier town marshal in director Fred Zinnemann's western \"High Noon,\" who must alone face a quartet of sworn killers on his wedding day. This suspenseful, 85-minute, black & white oater is an allegory about the Hollywood blacklist and how the industry abandoned stars and technicians during the McCarthy witch hunt years. Scenarist Carl Foreman, who wrote the screenplay, suffered enough from the Hollywood blacklist that he relocated to England. The protagonist, Will Kane, discovers what it feels like to have everybody turn their backs on him as if he had become a leaper. Indeed, \"High Noon\" does not qualify as your standard horse opera with colorful characters and a charismatic hero. The \"High Noon\" hero is vulnerable and suffers from acute fear when none of the townspeople plan to help him. Cooper sweats throughout the action and has nobody to turn to for help. Zinnemann stresses our hero's isolation in one spectacular crane shot that shows Kane standing alone on the main street of Hadleyville without a soul in sight. Tex Ritter supplies a poignant title tune and composer Dimtri Tiomkin furnishes an atmospheric musical accompaniment.\"High Noon\" opens with Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef in his screen debut) sitting on a rock, smoking a cigarette, and waiting for Ben Miller (Sheb Wooley of \"The War Wagon\") to show up. Not long after Jim Pierce (Robert J. Wilke of \"The Magnificent Seven\") rides in and joins them and the trio head off for the town of Hadleyville. Later, we learn that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald of \"Two-Gun Lady\") has had his prison sentence commuted by the people up north. Carl Foreman's screenplay never specifies what 'north' means in this context. Frank is a wild sort of man and Hadleyville preferred his kind until Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper of \"Sergeant York\") arrived and helped it up with the help of some of the townspeople. Kane is getting married in a civil ceremony to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly of \"Fourteen Hours\") officiated by Judge Percy Mettrick (Otto Kruger of \"Saboteur\") with the town fathers surrounding them. Amy is a Quaker so Will and she are not being married in the regular church. Indeed, all of this action from the assembling of the villains, Kane's marriage, and the final showdown occur on a Sunday.No sooner has Kane gotten married than he removes his badge. Amy and he are going to leave town and start a new life elsewhere with Will owning a general store and working the counter. The telegraph operator breaks things up when he delivers message about Miller's impending arrival. Mayor Jonas Henderson (Academy Award winning supporting actor Thomas Mitchell of \"Stagecoach\") and the judge hustle Will and Amy into their loaded up buckboard and send them packing out of town. Will's young, impetuous deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges) is up in Helen Ramirez's room when he sees the Kane race out of town. Initially, Helen doesn't believe that Will would run from his enemies. Will doesn't get very far before he realizes that he must return to Hadleyville despite Amy's protests. Will explains that they will spend the rest of their lives living in fear about the Miller gang, so he returns to town. Amy leaves him, buys a ticket on the noon train, and awaits it in the hotel lobby while Will pins the badge back onto his chest.Judge Mettrick shakes his head in disgust. He is packing up to leave because he sentenced Frank Miller to prison and he exhorts Will to leave town. It seems that Hadleyville will be without a marshal for a day and Will decides to stick around and sets out to form a posse. Mettrick argues against Will's decision to stay. \"This is a dirty little village in the middle of nowhere,\" he says in contempt. \"Nothing that happens here is really important.\" Later, at a meeting in the church, Mayor Henderson comes out in favor of Will leaving because he fears that another gunfight will dampen the spirits of investors who want to locate factories in Hadleyville.There are more characters in \"High Noon\" than just the heroes and the villains. An integral character and an off-beat one to boot is Helen Ramirez (western movie stalwart Katy Jurado of \"Arrowhead\") who is a Hispanic woman of questionable means. She is the silent partner in a general store and though it is never outright mentioned is probably a madam. Once she learns about Frank Miller's scheduled arrive on the noon train she sets about getting her affairs in order so that she can flee.Zinnemann does a superb job of creating tension. Look at the perspiration that covers the actors' faces. He shifts emphasis between Kane's efforts to round up a posse, the clock shots as time ticks away to noon, and the trio at the railroad depot watching the tracks. The final gunfight in Hadleyville is no great shakes. Zinnemann's staging of the action leaves a lot to be desired. Kane approaches the quartet from the rear and kills Ben first off while the others scatter. Mind you, this is a realistic type of shoot-out, not a cinematically savvy one like Hawks, Ford, Sturges, Mann, Kennedy, or Beotticher would have staged that would make the participants look ultra-cool. Instead, this shoot-out is rather sloppy and Kane's wife guns Pierce in the back. The shoot-out resembles the rest of \"High Noon\" in that it is not so much a tradition Hollywood western. Floyd Crosby's black & white photography is crisp, clean, and stark like a newsreel film. This adds an edge to the action.The criticism leveled at \"High Noon\" by Howard Hawks and John Wayne is largely nonsense. \"High Noon\" is as American as apple pie. Further, \"High Noon\" is not your traditional oater based on Hollywood mythology. Hawks' movie, no disrespect meant, were traditional Hollywood mythology.",

Yes, most of the acting is very credible -- what's not is the entire ridiculous plot along with the overly-etched subplots and the relative unbelieveability of why the protagonist isn't going to leave town, which is either the fault of the script or the actor, and likely both.

            "content": "A landmark in the making of moody westerns, High Noon proved that Gary Cooper still had it, despite being long past his prime. He gives an above average acting performance, and the screenplay is very good in most spots, too. In fact, a few scenes even play out like a silent movie (Gary Cooper was once in silent movies, believe it or not). It's not perfect, but it's almost perfect.Gary Cooper plays a sherif of a small town in the middle of nowhere (typical western plot device \ud83d\ude42) whose town is being threatened by a gang of two or three killers, who want to face him alone at high noon. Everyone else is scared, cautious, hiding, and they want Coop to come into hiding with them, especially his new bride Amy (Grace Kelly). The film alternates between the people who want Coop to do the right thing, and him getting ready for the intruders. There is an uneasy mood throughout the picture, and you can feel the fear seeping off of the characters. As I mentioned above, the picture is very well directed, the shots capturing exactly what they need to capture. I can still see whole swatches of the film in my mind, and I watched it over a year ago (from the writing of this review)- the ending scene in particular is very memorable.The actors all give pretty good performances, especially Gary Cooper (seeing as ue was WAY past his prime) and the actress who played the Mexican woman (). I do wish they had cast a different actress than Grace Kelly, though.I can slightly forgive her for being so disappointingly wooden as this was only her second feature film and first important role, but she was still this wooden by her final feature film, High Society (1956). She's pretty, but fans of her glamour will be disappointed- she only wears one dress throughout the film. Also did find the age difference between Kelly and Cooper slightly disturbing (twenty-nine years), but an age difference like that can be expected from a film of this era. Alright, now I'm just nitpicking.Overall, one of my favourite westerns (I'm not typically fond of the genre), and for very good reason. May not be to everyone's taste, but neither is Casablanca. It's true that High Noon makes its hour-and-twenty-minute runtime seem a lot longer, but the film is shot in real time, so that's why.Strong 8/10 from me. If only they'd cast another actress in the Grace Kelly role, and then it would be perfect.",

At any rate, rather than disclose the rest of the story and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that, although there isn't a lot of action in this movie, the director (Fred Zinnemann) did an excellent job keeping the suspense going up until the very end.

During WWII there seem to have been dozens. (For instance, Yankees are invading in the 1860s, and heroically, a Quaker family comes to its senses to do the honorable thing.) Naturally I don't aim to judge a movie by its ideology, but this is the kind of movie that asks to be so judged; and while I'm not a Quaker myself, I can't help groan at every reformulation.* Look, Mr. Cooper: If nobody wants to be your deputy in the entire durned town; and the only people this notorious murderer aims to be gunning for are you and your judge pal; and the judge pal early off decided to hit the road: Then what makes you a hero for sticking around?  As I see it: A cowardly town will eventually be preyed upon; in the West, sooner rather than later. If you, Mr. Cooper, aim to leave tomorrow anyhow... well. (On the other hand, the men of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN left their adopted Mexican village, and it felt fine.)  And: I should venture to say that it is cowardly for Mr. Cooper to stick around and put the townies in direct danger, simply because he disdains their civic character.  So, Frank Miller ought to be hanging with Mr. Cooper.* Grace Kelly put in a real ...bland? lackluster? performance. Like unadulterated farina or grits. (Understood, it was her first big role.)* I'd say John Wayne might have had a point when, as reported, they disdained the movie as \"un-American.\" I don't have any truck for HUAC, and I'm not sure Wayne did either (but I wouldn't know that). But, Mr. Cooper stepping on his badge; generally being dispirited about his duties and about the town that didn't want him to help them -- why can't Coop just let the people live their lives as they please, 'stead of begging for help to serve his pride?Coop, indeed, \"...a man too proud to run away.\" Only everything in HIGH NOON indicates the audience ought to admire this stubborn pride.",

In my opinion this would have worked much better as a short.I didn't really understand most of the characters and their intentions weren't all that clear.

For someone who \"saved\" the town and \"made it a safe place for women and children\", no one comes to his aid when he needs them. In fact, he proves to be one of the most unpopular guys in town. Not much of a marshall, of hero for that matter...Will's love is Amy (Grace Kelly), whom he just married. But there's very little to no chemistry between these characters. Less than an hour after being wed, she packs her bags to leave him (!!!). Then there's Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado) - wood-faced and short-tempered throughout the movie, and I actually have no idea what her purpose in the film was, or who exactly she's supposed to be. Was she Will's ex wife? Ex mistress? What??For a Western, there's also very little action here. And there's a lot of talking! (Wow, so much dialogue...). Most of the film is talk about what might be, could be and predictions of what might happen when the train arrives. The entire movie felt like a waiting game, and when the waiting is finally over, so is the movie!!! The action lasts about 5 minutes. The finale is so theatrical, there was no suspense whatsoever. I also knew so little about the gang that I didn't even care what happened to them.How did this film win 17 awards including 4 Oscars?? Maybe at the time there wasn't anything better, or they simply viewed films very differently back then. Yawn, this was boring... it felt like a very, very long short story.Would I watch it again?

It happens in real time, which is an incredible achievement reflecting the precision of Zinnemann's direction; acting is faultless by all, even in the smallest parts; Gary Cooper's performance is sublime in its simplicity and honesty; photography is perfection itself, with angles that subtly highlight Marshall Kane's dilemmas and increasing vulnerability and isolation. And the musical theme by Dimitri Tiomkin is unforgettable, perfectly fitting in with the film's atmosphere.HIGH NOON also boasts one of the most literate, significant, and incisive scripts ever. You can see it as a straight and credible Western, but if you consider it against the backdrop of events in the USA at its time, 1952, you can also detect a criticism of the situation in the country at the height of the House of Unamerican Activities Committee (HUAC's) crusade against communists in general, and those in Hollywood in particular -- they, too, are left to fend alone for themselves as HUAC targets, ostracizes, and punishes them with jail and with prohibition to work, often forced to leave the USA, just as Kane is strongly invited by his town's residents to leave and take his problems elsewhere, as if those problems were not the town's as well.This deceptively simple film is one of the most complex I have ever had the privilege to watch, and of the cinema's great achievements anywhere any time.\nI have now watched it some 10 times. and I have always enjoyed it immensely and found new details to ponder over and interpret. It defintely stays on my mind for days every time I re-watch it.And every time I do I am reminded of John Wayne's sadly limited interpretation that the events in the film could never happen in the USA.I cannot recommend HIGH NOON highly enough.

It will continue to represent the genre for many decades to come.It stars Gary Cooper, one of the most beloved of leading men who personified soft-spoken heroic courage in scores of important films, including Beau Geste (1939), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Along Came Jones (1945), The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955), etc., and Grace Kelly in her debut role. Directed by Fred Zinneman, whose credits include From Here to Eternity (1953), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Julia (1977) and a dozen more, High Noon tells the story of Will Kane, a small town marshal who, on his wedding day faces a man just let out of prison with three of his outlaw friends who are aiming to get revenge for his being sent up.The enduring image of the film is Gary Cooper walking tall in the deserted streets of the town in a black Western hat, a black vest, long-sleeved white shirt, black string necktie, watch chain, boots, and low slung holster and two belts, while off to the side inside the wooden buildings we see \"that big hand move along, nearin' high noon--which is when the train arrives carrying the freed prisoner.Will Kane has cleaned up the town, but now the gunslingers return and he is their target. His wife of less than an hour (Kelly) demands that he leave town. The town itself, in fear of the gunmen, also wants him to leave town, hoping to take the fight away from them. He tries to recruit deputies but everyone is afraid. Even his lone deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him. In the background is Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting ballad, sung by Tex Ritter: \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling (On This Our Wedding Day).\" Both Cooper and the song won Oscars. Noteworthy was the fine performance by Kay Jurado as... Ramirez, Cane's ex, a shrewd barroom lady and proprietress.What is interesting about the moral conflict (from the story, \"The Tin Star\" as interpreted for film by screenwriter Carl Foreman), that of facing your enemy rather than running, is that Kane's rationale is logical. If he runs they will only come after him again and again. Only two people get this, Kane and Ramirez. The larger moral issue of whether to fight to defend yourself (Grace Kelly is cast as a Quaker and does not believe in killing) is resolved during the climatic shootout by Grace Kelly's character herself in a manner that did not set well with Quakers.How well does this black and white classic Western play today? The towns people seem clich\u00e9s and the outlaws are quickly drawn, but Gary Cooper as Will Kane seems entirely believable, admirable, heroic in the best sense of the term as a man who knows the dangers, feels the fear, and yet must act, and he does. He is no shallow, two-fisted, machine-gun hero so often seen in Hollywood productions, but a man of maturity whose \"grace under pressure\" (a fine definition of courage) tells us and himself who he really is.See this for Gary Cooper whose \"slow-talking, slow-walking,\" (lyrics from the Coaster's hit song from the fifties, \"Along Came Jones\"), and soft-spoken heroics delighted and enthralled a couple of generations of film-goers.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

Things seem to move slowly at first but as this lack of action persists it begins to build tension as Kane's chances only seem to get worse. All this builds to a climactic showdown and a truly great ending.Another thing worth mentioning is the music. The film won Oscars for both Original Song and Score, both of which were right on the money. The theme song plays over the credits and we hear snatches of it throughout the movie as it echoes Kane's troubled thoughts. The score further builds upon this foundation with motifs based around the theme.On my first viewing, Gary Cooper's performance seemed a little wooden, particularly for an Oscar winner, but now I can't imagine anyone else in the part. Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado also turn in excellent performances in the roles of the two women in Kane's life.

Inasmuch as we started in August, 2001 and sometimes we were hard pressed to 'find' a subject with which to write. Well, HIGH NOON, wait no more; as you're finally joining the ranks of our honored films.ALTHOUGH THIS STORY is, on the surface, another Western, there is far more to it than just a 'Horse Opera.' The elements that are woven into this have universal truths behind them. They are just as valid today as they were in 1952 or 1870 or whatever. The author, the director and producer were all out to tell us so; albeit in a subtle, easy going manner.WHEN RETIRING LAWMAN, Gary Cooper asks the town's folk for aid in his time of trouble, his requests fall on deaf ears. No matter that Frank Miller, newly released from prison, is returning to town and has promised to kill him, the very people who the Marshall has served refuse him any comfort or aid.THE MARSHALL IS leaving town and his employment following his marriage to Amy (Grace Kelly). The plot is complicated when were learn that his new bride is a Quaker; the others being mainly Evangelical Protestant.FROM THE VERY beginning, the tension is introduced, carefully nurtured and maintained all through the unfolding drama. The question about whether or not it is done in real time is unclear. Buit, the excellent use of clocks on screen give that appearance and serves as a fine, dramatic tool.HAVING SPENT MY entire adult life as a peace officer, the theme is driven home powerfully. The attitudes of the town people reflects that of our people today. On the one hand, we demand outstanding police service and then we want extreme retribution when some cop falls short.OH YEAH, WE can't finish up without mentioning the theme song that Country & Western singer and \"B\" Movie Cowboy, Tex Ritter, did such a commendable a job singing throughout.MAINTAINING THE PEACE is the job o all of us.

Directed by Oscar winning director Fred Zinnemann (JULIA 1977, 8/10; FROM HERE TO ETERNITY 1953, 7/10), HIGH NOON runs a succinct 85 minutes which neatly synchronizes with the storyline, after the arrival of the culprit of the gangsters, a heroic face-off sets the old scores with an annihilation of either side.It is a 1 Vs. 4 predicament for our lone hero when number matters, Zinnemann launches an absorbingly direct route to unfold how the weathered-but-merry man suddenly plunges at his wits' end in less than 90 minutes, his wife (Kelly) threats to leave him after her persuasion falls flat, his deputy marshal (Bridges) hangs up the badge due to some trivial jealousy issues, the judge (Kruger) is eager to flee, the mayor (Mitchell) doesn't want to spoil the veneer of peace and his mentor (Chaney Jr.) sympathizes him but refuses to get involved, while among the village people, some hold grudge towards him for self-serving reasons, others righteously offer their help but either is chickened out by the lopsided situation or too clumsy to wield a weapon. So more or less the huddled masses are complicity of the revenge plan of the quartet, a reluctant truth we have to admit and we are among them too if we are placed under a similar context, the downsides of human nature has been wondrously encapsulated by this compact piece of work. On the other hand, the execution of the gunfight can only be quoted as mediocre, anyway Zinnermann is never a keen action planner. Cooper won his second Oscar for the film and gratifyingly carries the emotional curve from principled confidence to disillusioned cold feet, he is a good man who is too proud to overcome his own self-importance, he learned the lesson in a hard way. Kelly was on the cusp of her glory, her role as an anti-violence Quaker is a borderline controversy since finally she has blood on her hands too apart from a liability and hostage in the plot; the Mexican Jurado has a more intense presence although shamefully we never have a chance to hear the story from her side. Lloyd and Chaney Jr. stands out among the rest by a barn fight and one-liner delivery respectively. On a whole HIGH MOON is a genre-breaker among the Western pictures, its influences will last thanks to its morality-challenging acuteness. PS: Have any one noticed the name of Kelly's role is Amy Fowler Kane, with Gary Cooper, is it this film THE BIG BANG THEORY's Shemy pair names after?",

            "content": "I'm aware of the background behind the creation of the \"High Noon\" screenplay and film, i.e. it being a metaphor for the cowardliness of the Hollywood establishment over the McCarthy Communist witch-hunt scare of the early 50's. I like even more that it got up the nose of draft-dodger American hero John Wayne, even if the film which he starred in under fellow-sympathiser Howard Hawks' direction \"Rio Brava\" is actually just as good a movie. But turning away from the allegorical politics, \"High Noon\" still stands as a classic film, examining traits of self-respect, heroism and on the converse side cowardice, along the way delivering a gripping, suspenseful 85 minutes of high tension and excitement. Shot in realistic black and white, the camera seems to show every line on the ageing Gary Cooper's face, the lines drawn deeper by fear itself. Even in his physical movements, Cooper's Marshal seems hesitant and wary, running on adrenalin and counter to the sometimes well-meaning but often self-serving advice that he should leave own before the revenge-seeking gang come after him when they've rendezvoused with leader arriving on the high noon train. Every man in town finds an excuse to opt out of helping Coop in his hour of need so that it's only fit and proper, after he completes his task, with the unexpected help of young wife Grace Kelly, that he wordlessly tosses away his badge and leaves town. Certainly by then, he knew who his so-called friends were. Cooper is superb in the lead role and dominates to the extent of carrying the whole film in his wake. The direction is taut and sure, a clock never far away to keep the tense countdown to the forefront of the action. My only criticisms are that Grace Kelly does seem much too young to be Cooper's wife, the relative ease with which he disposes of the supposedly unstoppable desperadoes and that pesky omnipresent theme song which just never goes away and ends up being, to these ears at least, extremely tiresome. Otherwise a brave and outstanding movie on just about every level.",

            "content": "\"High Noon\" is a western movie in which we watch a marshall who wants to protect his city but also himself from a gang. The captain of this gang went to prison because that marshall busted him. After some years the captain of the gang is free and he is returning to this city to reclaim and take his revenge from the marshall.I liked this movie because I think it's a classic western movie in which we can watch the fight for the survival and the change of the emotions of a man who just want to help his friends and his citizens and these people do not do anything to help him. He starts full of ambition and prospect but after that everything collapse and change to the worst case scenario for him. And in that exact moment you can observe how everything change inside him and what he does in order to survive alone. Of course as you can understand I really liked the interpretation of Gary Cooper who played as Marshal Will Kane and I believe that he was simply outstanding in his part (won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role). I also liked the interpretation of the two beautiful ladies, Katy Jurado who played as Helen Ram\u00edrez and Grace Kelly who played as Amy Fowler Kane.Finally I have to say that \"High Noon\" is a really good movie to watch because it shows us how difficult are some choices in our lives and what we have to do in order to just survive. It also shows us many things about relationships either are friendly or erotic and in which you want or have to depend on.",

            "content": "I've talked before about the resurgence in classic movies making their way to blu-ray format. It's a treat for movie fans and students of film to finally see these films in the most pristine condition possible. One company that's been releasing films this way, everything from schlock drive-in films to full blown top notch older blockbusters, is Olive Films. Most of their releases have been simple, the title alone with few to no extras. Now they've decided to add their name to the list of companies that handle the classics they have the right to in full blown fashion with their Signature Series. These movies offer the cleanest prints possible as well as some extras thrown in. It's a pure pleasure to see these this way and Olive has kicked it off with one of the all-time classics, HIGH NOON. If you've never seen the film the plot on the surface is fairly simple. The sheriff of a small western town, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is taking off his badge and getting married to Amy (Grace Kelly), a Quaker who doesn't believe in violence or his carrying a gun. But immediately after their marriage and before they can leave word reaches Kane that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) has been pardoned from prison and Miller's gang is waiting at the train station for his arrival on the noon train to arrive. Kane straps his guns on again against the protests of Amy who says she will leave him if he does. What follows is Kane's attempt to get the town people to rally behind him to take on the gang. But no one does, leaving him to stand alone against the four men. So that's a long paragraph but sums up the surface story being told here. What it doesn't tell is the story that lies underneath it all and one that Hollywood reacted to. The reality is that beneath that surface was the story of screenwriter Carl Foreman who wrote the screenplay and the problems he faced with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). While most think of Sen. Eugene McCarthy and the word McCarthyism with these activities he actually came into the situation later and investigated politicians as opposed to Hollywood. HUAC was investigating the influence of Communism in the world of entertainment and looking to find out just who was a Communist. They put aside the fact that many were registered as such during WWII when Russia was our ally. Instead rather than seek out any true saboteurs of traitors they labeled anyone connected to the Communist Party as such. Foreman had registered as a Communist years before and only remained involved with them for a year before leaving. But he didn't like the tactics used by HUAC to ferret out people they felt were traitors. HUAC offered two alternatives. You either provided them with names of anyone else you associated with the Party or you were basically run out of the business or worse imprisoned. Foreman stood up to these methods by admitting his being a member for a single year but refusing to name names. He ended up leaving the country for England. Now the story of HIGH NOON might seem about a sheriff against an outlaw. But in truth the parable is telling the story of a man standing up for what is right and finding that no one will stand with him. The worst examples of western folk hate him for sending Miller to prison and taming their town, the result of which was their inability to do what they pleased. But then the upstanding members of the community don't back him either. They claim he was paid to handle things, that they will find themselves looking bad before politicians or that this isn't their fight. In the end he finds himself alone taking on the problems the world has placed in front of him, the same situation Foreman found himself in with his fellow writers, producers and studio members. No one stood with him. That is the real story behind HIGH NOON. Olive has done a spectacular job with this release. I've never seen the print of this film look so vibrant, something that many won't understand since the film is in black and white. But never fear black and white films. It is the story that matters not the flash of color. And if you are one of the few who've started down the 4k trail it is indeed a 4k master. They've also put together an impressive collection of short featurettes that add to the enjoyment of the film and its background. Included are: A Ticking Clock - Academy Award nominee Mark Goldblatt on the editing of High Noon; A Stanley Kramer Production - Michael Schlesinger on the eminent producer of High Noon; Imitation of Life: The Blacklist History of High Noon - with historian Larry Ceplair and blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein; Ulcers and Oscars: The Production History of High Noon - a visual essay with rarely seen archival elements, narrated by Anton Yelchin; Uncitizened Kane - an original essay by Sight and Sound editor Nick James; and finally the theatrical trailer. None of these is overlong and actually add to the enjoyment of the movie you can discover after your first viewing. With the quality on hand with this release it makes me look forward to future Olive Films Signature Series releases. My guess is that all other film fans will feel the same way. And at a list price on amazon of $16.99 it makes it a value not to be beaten.",

            "content": "(possible spoilers)A very simple film with a simple story, but very effective. Gary Cooper is great as a marshal who gets wind of a deadly gunslinger planning to return to his little town for a vengeance spree. Although Cooper is planning to get married and retire, he insists on sticking things out for the sake of justice - though nobody else in the community cares to lend a hand.I thought everything about the movie was pretty dead on, from the performances to the direction. I'd always heard how much Lon Chaney stood out in this western, and I can only agree after watching him in his small but sincere part as the sheriff. One of the best parts I've ever seen him play, in fact. I also spotted other actors I have admired - Otto Kruger, of course, and even Virginia Christine. And if I may say so, I really enjoy looking at Katy Jurado as the Mexican woman. I first took notice of her when watching ARROWHEAD years ago. HIGH NOON is loaded with tension, and has a \"real time\" feeling to it as the High Noon deadline approaches. I also enjoy the theme song, \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' \".I might quibble with the ending a little; how hasty it seemed to end, and how easily Cooper winds up defeating the bad guy after all the suspense we've built up. Other than that, a very good film and recommended.",

            "content": "I will never understand the popularity of High Noon, when there were so many other better westerns made in the 1940s, 1950s, and even that very year. It's a mediocre-at-best western with a simple story, a talentless leading man, a miscast leading lady, boring direction, and an overrated theme. What's the big deal?Gary Cooper has just quit being a marshal and married a Quaker: Grace Kelly. Besides the offscreen affair between them, I can't see any other reason why she was cast. She's as unconvincing as a Quaker as Marilyn Monroe would have been. In her first leading role, she's incredibly green and looks scared to death to be acting in a major motion picture. Cooper finds out a group of bandits are headed into town looking specifically for him, he puts his badge back on and tells his nonviolent wife that he's got to face them for a showdown at noon. Grace doesn't support him and threatens to leave him, and the rest of the town abandons him, refusing to help because the bad guys are too scary. The deputy marshal, Lloyd Bridges, the mayor, Thomas Mitchell, and the judge, Otto Kruger, also turn their backs on Cooper.The last hour of the film is shot in real time to mirror his growing anxiety, and it's supposed to be incredibly tense as he waits alone for the gang to show up, but it always leaves me cold. There are so many other great westerns out there! Riding Shotgun, starring Randolph Scott (the real king of westerns) and Silver Lode, starring John Payne, were both made in 1954 with extremely similar themes to High Noon. They were both infinitely more exciting and better movies. Neither one of them is as well remembered as their predecessor. I could list dozens of westerns made before 1952 that were better, but that would take another couple of paragraphs. This wasn't even the first movie to be filmed in real time; Robert Wise tackled that breakthrough in 1949's The Set-Up.High Noon just isn't suspenseful. You'd think, given the little they had to work with, the filmmakers would have insisted on casting someone who could put expression into his lines. Gary Cooper seems to be in a lot of suspense worrying about remembering his lines, but not about facing a shootout in the wild west.",

Unfortunately, he receives news that a criminal whom he sent to jail has been released and will arrive in town at noon. Kane tries to enlist help to fight the criminals, but the townspeople are too cowardly to help out, forcing Kane into the showdown of his life.The movie is a masterpiece from any angle, but the haunting theme song (\"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'\") adds to the mood.

Basically Marshal Will Kane (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Gary Cooper) has just got married to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), and he planned to go into retirement, hanging up his badge to have a regular life away from Hadleyville. But when he was about to leave with his new wife he gets the news from men coming into town who tell him that a man he arrested and sent to prison years ago, Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), is making his way on the noon train, and he wants revenge. This puts fear into the townspeople, and they tell the Marshall that he should leave while he can, and Will does originally plan to do this, but he knows he is the only one can face Miller. To go against the villain and his gang however he needs the help of anyone who can handle a gun like he can, but everyone he asks refuses because of they are too scared of being killed in combat, they and Amy just want him to leave town. Will also warns Miller's first lover, and his own former lover, Helen Ram\u00edrez (Golden Globe winning and nominated Katy Jurado) that he is on his way, and knowing what threat he will bring if he finds her, she sells her business and makes preparations to leave. As Will asks around Hadleyville he gets increasingly agitated but equally determined as the criminal makes his way, with the minutes passing by very quickly, and the time of noon getting ever closer. Finally it comes to the time that Miller is to arrive in the town, he and his gang make their way through the quiet town, with everyone hiding, and the shooting begins as they and Kane in the hay barn do gun battle, of course the hero prevails in the end, he throws his badge down, and Will and Amy ride away out of town. Also starring Airplane's Lloyd Bridges as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell, Otto Kruger as Judge Percy Mettrick, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly's Lee Van Cleef as Jack Colby, Thomas Mitchell as Mayor Jonas Henderson, Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin Howe and Harry Morgan as Sam Fuller. Cooper gives a terrific commanding performance as the law man awaiting the showdown with the bad guys, Kelly is also well cast as his innocent wife, and Jurado is also great in her role as the woman that knew both men that will do battle. I can see what the critics mean by this film having a psychological element to it, and it is certainly a clever aspect playing out the action in real time, i.e. in the one day with the hours passing until the noon deadline, a most watchable classic western. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Song for Tex Ritter's \"High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin')\" (number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Songs) and Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, and it was nominated for Best Picture for Stanley Kramer and Best Writing, Screenplay for Carl Foreman, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Cinematography and Best Motion Picture Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Grace Kelly was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Will Kane was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 10 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was 82 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, it was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

He hands in the badge and is ready to live \"happily ever after\" but something from his past caughts up. Frank Millar, a criminal who Cooper put behind bars many years ago, is coming to town on the noon-train. He is out to get the marshal with the help of three companions. The movie explores the reactions of the marshal and the towns-people in relation to this inevitable conflict.Cooper is trying to get help but gets turned down everywhere he goes. Furthermore it seems that nobody wants him to confront the criminals which also isolates him on a psychological level. Some have responded that he is not a true hero since he searches for help \u0096 but why is it that he has to fit in as a stereotyped hero? That he doesn't confront the villains alone doesn't make him a coward.The intellectual challenge in this movie is to understand the motivation behind Coopers decision to meet with Frank and his companions. Why doesn't he just get out of town? His first hunch is to escape with his young wife but then decides not to because as he says, they will come looking for him for the rest of his life and its better to face them in the town they are in. So it isn't a sense of duty that makes him stay or a moral dilemma he is in? Its only a matter of survival? The suspense builds up very well. He writes his will in his sheriffs office before having his \"ok corral\" with the bad guys, thereby showing us that he is in no way certain that he will come out of the meeting alive but still you sense his determination to confront the villains. And maybe its here that the movie takes heroism to another level, a more modern one; the hero recognizes his vulnerability but despite the anxiety that is involved in this does what is right and what serves a bigger purpose anyway. This in no sense makes him a \"pussy\" but only adds an extra dimension to his character and makes him easier to empathize with. The shoot out itself is predictably and he can at last ride into the sunset with his wife with that banjo in the background.So all in all the movie adds some new elements to the western-genre which is why it, after all, can be recommended./Simon",

The human race keeps his cowardice, he has no memory, he chooses the easy way, we do not deserve the hero.What I liked is this way of making the link with Greek tragedy (the little story of the city which opens its doors to the bandits they had banished), but also this simplicity in the writing leading to this film in real time in the unity of place and action. Frankly grandiose.And suddenly the train arrives, the tension is really strong, the music flies away. It really is a well done and well thought out movie.

The gunmen came to gang up and kill for revenge, for they were killers. The lone lawman had put down his badge, married to ride away, but came back, abandoning his new bride's passivist want, put on his badge, gun and went back in character as a lawman, also predictable. Death was being faced by all driven both by the fear and want of it. The town then abandons the lawman one by one, including his foolish, jealous, young deputy, leaving the lawman alone. His Quaker bride boarded to go out on the same train that carried in the killer, meaning to abandon her husband over his stance to kill or be killed and go on her own way.Here, the character of the wife becomes both bold & loyal out of love & duty. She becomes both savior and hero. Saving her innocent husband's life twice, first by going against her upbringing and religion by shooting one of the killers in the back, then when held hostage, bearing her nails to claw the face of the villain, allowing her then unarmed husband to re-arm and shoot it out with the villain, killing him. So, the pretty little, fresh, non-threatening peace loving lady stepped out of character in a major way and quietly becomes the hero of the film, taking an evil life to save innocent lives.",

It follows recently retired Marshal Will Kane unsuccessfully trying to raise temporary deputies in the town of Hadleyville in order to take down the criminal Frank Miller, who is arriving on the twelve o'clock train. Gary Cooper is great in this role as Kane slowly descends into despair, highlighted in the church scene when his one hope is slowly snatched away and again in his fight with Deputy Marshal Pell - the point when he realises he is on his own. The score by Dimitri Tiomkin deserves a special mention. Playing over the majority of the movie, there lays subtle undertones of the impending doom in the often melodic notes that only darken as Kane is left alone.",

Sure, GARY COOPER has the kind of noble, sturdy role he was always adept at playing and GRACE KELLY, in a less impressive role, does okay as his loyal sweetheart, but the whole thrust of the story--and its theme of bravery vs. cowardice--did not seem as powerful as it once did.But what did still strike me as impressive was that wonderful song, \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'\" which runs through the score at various points. Other than that, it's definitely a good western with a very capable supporting cast--but just not one of my favorites. Maybe it's just too simplistic--I don't know, I can't put my finger on it, but it doesn't resonate the way it should under Fred Zinnemann's taut direction and Carl Foreman's tight screenplay. Wisely, it all takes place within 85 minutes, pretty much in real time.I'm still impressed by KATY JURADO in one of her early film roles and LLOYD BRIDGES and others do well as the various townspeople--THOMAS MITCHELL, OTTO KRUGER and LON CHANEY, JR. But I have to admit, it's mainly for that catchy tune that I remember the film with a certain fondness. That and the very tense ending seem to make it worthwhile.",

Unlike its macho peers, it's as much love story as action movie, thanks to its iconic theme song and breakout performance by Grace Kelly. And its ticking-clock urgency remains the model for every movie aiming to tell its story in real time. Sure, it's contrived - do we really believe Gary Cooper's Will Kane gets married, quits and faces his deadliest enemy within a matter of hours? Would the townspeople turn away from Kane in the way they do? That said, the vision of cowardice and apathy feels scarily relevant - and, between the meticulous editing and Cooper's stoic heroism, it still delivers in terms of thrills. Extensive extras deliver the insight that such a classic deserves: several documentaries, two commentaries, even the short story the film was based on. Best start on them now; the clock is ticking.",

            "content": "\"High Noon\" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1952, so this one is getting closer to its 70th anniversary and nobody should be surprised that this was still a black-and-white production. The director is Fred Zinnemann and he won his first Oscar for a short film the very same year this film came out. The writer who adapted the original story named \"The Tin Star\" into a movie screenplay was Carl Foreman and he was still over 5 years away from winning his Oscar. But both were nominated for their work here, but came short in their respective categories just like the movie lost out for Best Picture too, but still won 4 Oscars, namely for lead actor Gary Cooper (his second already), Best Editing and the two music categories with the latter giving Tiomkkin two Oscars in one year. I must say though that the only Oscar I somewhat think was justified was for Best Song. The soundtrack is not bad, but not great either and sometimes maybe slightly over the top. Cooper did not impress me that much, so a nomination would have been a lot already in my opinion, but it is certainly one of the least deserving Best Lead Actor winners I have seen. It's not even that it was a career Oscar for him because he already had one, so no idea why they picked him. Maybe the year was not too good in this category. And finally, the editing was not exactly overwhelming either.It is still a decent movie. I must admit there were moments when I struggled a bit with it, but eventually it holds up well and I think it is worth checking out. If you have seen Eastwood and also John Wayne westerns, then it is obvious this one here is really different. Pathos is virtually non-existent in her, a key component un uncountable other western movies. The central character does not have girls falling for him constantly, but is married right at the beginning and his wife is about to leave him because he wants to stay in town and fight the bad guys. She is played by the very young Grace Kelly by the way in what was a really ungrateful role I'd say. The character feels totally irrelevant until the ending and there she feels unrealistic. The other female in here is played by Katy Jurado and she has much better material (that Golden Globe win was a bit too much though) and in my opinion is also more attractive, perhaps because of her self-confidence. She plays a former lover of the main character and while she still says on one occasion that he is a real man unlike her new love interest (or actually rather she is his), there are no feelings anymore for her towards Cooper's character and this also would be a no-go for a standard western in which all the girls want the badass lone wolf central character. Also the lone wolf component is actually something worth taking a look at. There are differences again too. Yes he is one, but not at all because he wants to be. The entire film is about him talking to the townsfolk to become assistant sheriffs and help him in his upcoming gunfight. There is a high-profile criminal being released out of jail and his brother and two other crooks are already waiting for him as he comes with the noon train (therefore the title reference) and they want to kill the sheriff who got him into jail in the first place. So will he leave? No he will not. Unlike the judge who gave the crook the sentence. As for the bad guys here, I kinda liked the way they handled it moving occasionally to their location and we see them waiting for him and that's it, sometimes we see the rails as well. Nice intermission. Who was most interesting to me though was not the main villain, but the one played by Lee Van Cleef because the actor has such amazing recognition value and is also in an all-time great western, so you know immediately it is him, even if you have seen almost nothing from the genre.In the end, it was all about the question if our lonesome hero will live or die. Actually, his unsuccessful attempts to recruit others made me think it could very well happen that he dies and that the twon is doomed then as we hear on some occasions before that. It could have made for a nice ending as well and delivered a good message to the audience that it is right to stand up to the bad guys in order to save what is most important to you, but they took another route and that is alright too. After almost getting beaten up by his friend (played by Jeff Bridges' dad when little Jeff was basically a toddler), he is up to the challenge and kills the bad guys. The only bad thing there was really Kelly's character's involvement. I was curious if he would win the fight or not, so I guess even if I did not love the film they did enough right to get me hooked at the end, even if I did not care too much early on I must say. I struggled a bit with the quantity of characters here, all males basically, and yet we rarely find out something about any of them such as the priest or just pick everybody from the townsfolk who has like one scene only during which they talk, such as the one who says the sheriff has no chance and then gets a punch in the face for said comment. So yeah, maybe fewer characters and more elaboration on the individuals they focus on could have been better. But it's also alright this way. It probably helped Cooper too in his awards quest. It is a really short film at 80 minutes approximately without credits, so I am not too happy really that it dragged a bit in the first half nonetheless because with this running time I can impossibly say they should have cut it shorter. Luckily as I stated already it did get better the longer it went and the final climax sequence with the quartet going up against the protagonist was pretty good. Still not great though. Nothing about this film was really great to an extent where I would consider giving this 4 stars out of 5. But if you like old westerns (even if this is really uncommon for a western for several reasons I mentioned already, another would be no horses in here except the ones he lets out before the fire can kill them), you should give it a chance, even if it is not in the imdb top250 anymore where admittedly it does not belong. However, then you have probably seen it anyway already a long time ago, so no recommendation needed.",

High points in this film are the way it was filmed in real time, Fred Zinnemann's direction and the fact that it was held to only 84 minutes.High Noon has none of the greatness of westerns like Shane and The Wild Bunch and doesn't even come close to a mediocre one like Unforgiven.

It raised some very topical themes when it was released in 1952 at the height of the Communist witch-hunt. In fact, writer Carl Foreman was one of the blacklisted figures in Hollywood.Gary Cooper, who was suffering from a painful ulcer during the 28 days it took to shoot High Noon, plays one of the great Western heroes Will Kane. As Marshal, he took a small, lawless town and made it fit to live in. He is now turning in his badge to leave with his new bride (Grace Kelly) and become a shop-keeper. She, being a Quaker, is anti-violence. Over the 84 minutes between the marriage and the end, a lot happens, virtually in real time. A deranged criminal, with his gang, is set to return to town and its fascinating to see how one by one every one in the town deserts the Marshal who did so much for them.The tension in the film is nail-biting and Gary Cooper, ulcer and all, won a well-deserved best actor Oscar. I personally think original choice Gregory Peck or better yet Henry Fonda would have fitted into the role better. The photography and the atmosphere in the film are brilliant as one would expect from a director like Zinnemann and a script as powerful as this. High Noon ranks up there with Fonda's The Ox-Bow Incident and Eastwoods The Unforgiven. Whether or not you like the ending (I liked it), this one has to be seen.",

            "content": "I had got this one on a whim. I didn't know anything about this movie except that it starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly and that it had won a couple of awards. I enjoyed many of the classic Western movies (mostly the ones that did not star John Wayne) and so I just got this one on impulse...I'm glad I did. This is unlike any Western film of that time. The tension is excellently maintained throughout the entire film. A sheriff prepares himself to protect a town that is under threat of being attacked by bandits. However, non of the dwellers are willing to support him. They're either prepared to leave or hide in the church. No one wants to face the bandits. Incredibly, director Fred Zinnemann's Marshal Wil Kane is nothing like the untouchable, invincible, Western hero who single-handedly takes down all the bad guys without as much as getting a single scar. What we witness here is a vulnerable, desperate, confused and frightened man who nearly loses all hope after being turned down by everyone. What Cooper is portrays is a very human character and he is amazing. His nuanced portrayal redefines the 'cowboy' in cinema. Graceful Grace Kelly is far from your typical damsel in distress. Saying much about her character will risk leaking spoilers. Katy Jurado and Lloyd Bridges are equally impressive.'High Noon' is a landmark film that has reinvented the cowboy. It's Suspenseful and tense but above all, human. I'm happy that I made this impulsive decision.",

            "content": "Although the film, directed so ably by Fred Zinnemann, was written as an allegory of the anti-communism crusade of Senator Joseph McCarthy, specifically as that campaign personally affected screenplay writer Carl Foreman, during the time of its production in the early 1950's, its message to me is far more universal and not confined to a very brief period of modern American history. For me, the key theme concerns the uncommon courage that is often required in the face of bullying or extreme forms of intimidation. In this case, an entire town is threatened by the terror of a lawless, depraved gang, and only one man has the will and the ability to confront it head-on.The famous \"pull back\" shot of Gary Cooper in the middle of the town has been frequently mentioned in user reviews here, but I have to repeat its powerful impact as it conveys the stark solitude of his character, Will Kane, in the face of overwhelming and very dangerous odds. While Cooper was not well during the making of the film, his worn physical appearance only served to enhance the crushing pressure that so heavily weighed upon his character, Will Kane.Although I have not always appreciated the films and the roles of Gary Cooper, to no fault of his own, his understated yet powerful performance here amounts to the best of his career. We are so very fortunate that he was able to complete the task while he was physically strong enough. The fight with Lloyd Bridges was apparently enough of a challenge by itself. Grace Kelly, a newcomer to Hollywood, may have been wooden in appearance, but her stiffness and discomfort only heightened the very real predicament of Amy Fowler Kane, a Quaker pacifist from the east on the first day of her marriage. What the heck was she doing in the wilds of New Mexico Territory in the first place? She would have been much more fulfilled on the Main Line of Philadelphia where she belonged. Katy Jurado as the much more \"worldly\" Helen Ramirez, the sheriff's former Latino lover, was stunning in her subdued and dignified presence. The rest of the cast, from Bridges to Harry Morgan to Lon Chaney Jr to Thomas Mitchell and beyond, provided excellent support to the outstanding and very appealing leads.The music by Dimitri Tiomkin solidly boosts the dramatic tension from start to finish. Yes, the same song is repeated throughout the film's nearly real time duration of eighty five minutes, but what a captivating song it is, and he varies the basic melody to suit the mood of the moment, which I think is brilliant on his part. Accolades to director Zinnemann and cinematographer Floyd Crosby, musician David's father, for their very tight, highly efficient use of every, single moment to its maximum advantage. In a world consisting of so many overly long, self-indulgent, and downright boring movies, I very much appreciate their abilities and talent. In this masterpiece, and I do not use that term as loosely as others, every element, including the finest acting by Cooper and Jurado, superb direction, innovative photographic techniques, a compelling story, and a beautiful, basic theme song that is adaptable enough to express each different mood of the moment, blend together to create a highly successful product that not only stands among the best westerns of all time but among the best films ever.",

I looked at it through young eyes originally and now many years later I still look at it with genuine affection. High Noon is in a nutshell timeless. The message I am aware of is one person trying to do the right thing in spite of fear and all of the other emotional turmoil. Nearly Sixty years on and trying to do the right thing is actually more rare now than it was then but as far as I am concerned the film is perfect and is a lot greater than the sum of its parts. This is one of those rare films that feels right from the first second and to be honest I never realised it was almost in real time. Once you have seen this film you will never ever want to forget it. Yes it is that good and all of the cast and crew deserve a thank you from me personally for its creation.

We also have to assume that at least half the audience back in 1952 totally missed the 'message' embedded there by writer Carl Foreman, himself a victim of HUAC who was forced to flee the US and work in Britain. In this 'reading' Frank Miller is Senator Joseph McCarthy symbolically 'persecuting' noble left-wing writers/actors/directors who were, after all, only 'doing their jobs' i.e. providing entertainment for the masses and if they slipped in the odd left-wing sentiment no one really got hurt. The Gary Cooper figure, Will Kane was one such figure who may well have been to the odd 'meeting' and now needs upright citizens to testify to his essential 'goodness' and comes up empty. Hawks, of course, saw it differently; in his eyes Cooper was drawing a salary for a job that meant, if necessary, putting his life on the line without bitching about it and soliciting help from ordinary townsfolk who AREN'T being paid to risk their necks. Disgusted, Hawks came up with lawman Duke Wayne, also paid to stick his neck out, faced with a gang very similar to that of Frank Miller and taking them on without crying for help. If it did nothing else High Noon was directly responsible for a superior movie so we shouldn't be too hard on it. It was probably extremely tense at the time but time shows only the woodenness of Grace Kelly, the stiffness of Cooper and immaturity of Lloyd Bridges.",

And while there is a moment where Grace Kelly brandishes a gun, the shooting is tidy and neatly wrapped up, with no hint of lingering effects. The sudden, quiet ending is supposed to be thought-provoking, but it all seems too obvious and heavy-handed. While the screenwriter of High Noon is a blacklisted member of the Hollywood community, most of the actors and technicians seem to be in no danger of the blacklist. Is it prestigious to be part of such a project, but not be too subversive that you do not get blacklisted, too?In many ways, the picture seems like an irresponsible piece of propaganda masquerading as Americana. We must also note that the story is depicted in a very American genre, the western. I am not sure if the reason the message wasn't presented as a horror picture in which the marshal was a policeman trying to deal with scared people and aliens wasn't because only certain films in certain genres better lend themselves to artistic and philosophical statements.

They seemed more like a collection of brain-dead punks! I can't quite figure out how these four particular guys can inspire anything more than a neck-tie party on the part of some bloodthirsty mob!The whole movie, Cooper knows where they are and what direction they'll be headed from in which to kill him. On top of that, Cooper has a large rack of long-rifles in his jail, while the killers are armed only with pistols. It seems to me like the marshal would have quite an easy time, picking off the four men from a fairly safe distance and in the open too! Hell, Cooper dispatched them pretty easy anyway!It also seems a little far-fetched that every single person in a town full of people would roll over and go back to sleep instead of grabbing one of Gary's rifles and quickly killing the four men. It seems like there would be at least three or four nitwits in a 19th century western town that could be easily goaded into a fight by being slapped in the face with a glove and labeled a coward.It seems like the marshal's greatest failing was being unable incite a crowd to violence. He should have gotten Lon Chaney all liquored up and sent him into the church!As far as the town goes, one minute they say he was a good marshal, the next minute they don't seem to like him very much. There seems to be a certain level of unspoken animosity between the marshal and the townspeople, that I couldn't quite put my finger on, as most of the town seems either amused or indifferent to Cooper's plight. Very few people actually seem conflicted about their decision to not help!Regarding the cast, Gary Cooper was good at portraying a man in various stages of desperation and finally in a bit of a silent panic, while Lloyd Bridges is in fine form, continuing his string of portraying good-looking, but empty-headed heels.Katy Jurado is beautiful, but I couldn't quite figure out why her character was given so much screen time. Grace Kelly was adequate, though I couldn't see her marrying Cooper in real life.Despite my reservations, I'll give High Noon credit for helping popularize the trend of low-budget, noir-like black and white westerns in the 1950's, like Terror In A Texas Town and 3:10 To Yuma.",

            "content": "Classical Western with a serious chip on its shoulder. \"Classical\" because *High Noon* literally adheres to Aristotle's recommended unities of narrative, place, and time: Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly get married just after 10:30 on a Sunday; the showdown concludes just after noon on the same day. The \"chip on its shoulder\" is a result of the HUAC hearings, at which screenwriter Carl Foreman proved to be an unfriendly witness. This movie was made by folks in a high dudgeon. Foreman and director Fred Zinnemann lash out at the snitches in Hollywood, comparing them quite explicitly to the cowardly, equivocating, morally relativist citizens of Hadleyville.Fine, but we could have done without the lectures. They really mar this movie, preventing it, in my opinion, from being a masterpiece. Some 20 years after *High Noon* was made, Robert Aldrich's *Ulzana's Raid* -- to cite one brilliant example -- managed to be an allegory of the Vietnam War while keeping its mouth shut at the same time. Or, to view this movie's flaws from another direction, George Stevens' *Shane* (released around the same time, I think) managed to portray the loneliness of heroism without all the fuss. But in *High Noon*, we have to endure lectures from absconding judge Otto Kruger about the fickleness of the Athenian mob circa 400 B.C. Gary Cooper looks unimpressed, thank God.The fine folks of Hadleyville are portrayed as either decent-but-cowardly, or actively anticipating -- for unexplained pecuniary reasons -- newly-freed ex-con Frank Miller's arrival. Ah, the fickle Athenian mob. It's an obnoxious enough message as applied to terrified, snitching actors in Hollywood . . . but I got news for the right-wingers out there who took (brief) solace in *High Noon* a few years ago: it's an even less applicable message to those who protested our current Arabian adventure. First, comparing the Hadleyvillains to the Sheehanites presumes that the War on Terror and the War on Iraq are one and the same (the proverbial Professor writes \"Prove?\" in red ink in the margin). Second, Bush's irremediable supporters tend to forget that Cooper's cause was just; the Administration's cynical, not to mention illegal, war, isn't.To quote Mercutio, \"A plague on both your houses!\" What's so often forgotten about *High Noon* is how excellently executed the movie is, aside from its lecturing tone. DP Floyd Crosby achieves a gritty, documentary brilliance with the black-and-white imagery, eschewing the usual travelogue prettiness of the typical Western for a dusty banality. Even the sky above Hadleyville seems soulless: not a cloud in it. (The Fifties-L.A. haze was a considerable help, doubtless.) Editor Elmo Williams deservedly won an Oscar for his precise quick-cutting that jacks up the sands-down-the-hourglass suspense. As for Gary Cooper: Marshall Will Kane was his apotheosis as an actor. No other actor of his time could have done this role better. Some have complained that Coop was too old for Grace Kelly, but it's more accurate to say that she was too young. His age conferred a sense of urgency to the part: a younger man would have had less to lose, or at least he would have felt that way about it. Another great success in the acting department is earned by then-newcomer Katy Jurado as the fiercely independent, and independently wealthy, Mexican businesswoman, \"shadow partner\" of most of the business establishments in town. Her noble portrayal is worthy of the part, which, in the final analysis, is far more daring than the movie's picayune political \"commentary\".Despite its unfortunate flaws, *High Noon* remains a gritty, ahead-of-its-time, downright \"indie\" film that holds up well today. 7 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "The film opens as Will Kane (Gary Cooper) and his Quaker fianc\u00e9 (Grace Kelly) wed and prepare to depart on their honeymoon. Word comes, however, that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) - an outlaw who swore that he'd kill Kane - was pardoned by the courts and is coming in on the noon train. Three other outlaws (Lee Van Cleef, Robert J. Wilke, Sheb Wooley) await for him at the train station. Kane, despite his new wife's strong objections, stays to face Miller when he arrives in just over an hour's time. His attempts to round up a posse are disastrous, however, as nobody is willing to stand by the man who kept their town safe and lawful.The decision to shoot the film in real time creates immensely tangible suspense which exponentially intensifies until the climactic shootout over an hour into the film. Cutting to various clock faces during this build-up is only the most obvious technique use to create suspense. Kane's increasingly desperate appeals to the townspeople and their increasingly adamant refusals to assist him reference the shortness of the hour far better than any clock ever could.Gary Cooper's acting here is nothing short of excellent. He seamlessly transitions from blissful newlywed to stern law-man to a desperate and condemned man too proud to run away. His acting carries with it the soul of the film - desperate betrayal from those you had come to trust and depend upon. His performance reflects this realization of betrayal, making \"High Noon\" perhaps one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen.The film stands as perhaps one of the standards of the western genre and the character of the tragic hero (specifically, the tragic western hero). Fans of the genre should find a wealth of enjoyment while watching this film.",

            "content": "The Western is a uniquely American form of cinema, and they are depicted in many different fashions.  Deep morality plays like RED RIVER,  or John Ford's classic, THE SEARCHERS, are usually referred to as the 'best' westerns.  Viennese director Fred Zinnemann, with the help of screenwriter Carl Foreman, have created a Western for the masses.  Gary Cooper plays Will Kane, perhaps his greatest role, with such subtly it is numbing.  I've never seen a lead performance so strongly played with such little dialogue.  The look on his face is so disheartening throughout, because we know this man will not have a friend in the world to help defend his honor and his life.HGH NOON takes place in 'real' time, which makes it all the more suspenseful.  Clocks are seen regularly to give you an update on when 'Frank Miller's' train is arriving.  At first sight, while Coop is marrying the prestine Quaker, played by Grace Kelly, the surrounding characters seem to have a backbone.  When news of the villain's return to Hadleyville spreads, Coop slowly learns that his true friends are few and far between.  The film's best individual shot is a crane shot that starts as a closeup on Coop and slowly pulls away to reveal the dusty, seemingly empty town.  This sums the movie up.  No one will help him.  The famous montage at high noon is an amazing piece of filmmaking, sending chills down your spine.  The viewer feels this way because we naturally are rooting for Coop to pull this miracle off.The swinging pendulum, the dolly-in on the chair where 'Miller' once sat and vowed revenge,  train tracks with an approaching train billowing black smoke,  the reaction shots.    All make the montage thrilling and unprecedented for a Western.  This most American of films was picketed when released because of the blacklist status of screenwriter Foreman and many critics felt it was not a true western because of the stark black and white photography.  HIGH NOON is not a travelogue like so many others, but a real piece of realist movie-making.At the center of it all is Gary Cooper, the quintessential American playing a man who is running out of time.  The situation of one man against four could take place on any canvas. See it.  You'll love it.",

I happened to be watching the film on television so I didn't notice whether the poster had legible details other than the title itself.Ivan Mazeppa was a Ukrainian Cossack hetman (elected warlord) who had long been allied with Russia and Czar Peter the Great. But during the Great Northern War against Sweden in 1708, when King Charles XII of Sweden invaded, Mazeppa switched sides. Peter defeated Charles at the battle of Poltava, and Mazeppa fled into exile where he died.The parallel with this film is clear enough. But why show the poster during the fight rather than as Kane's friends are betraying him through inaction one by one? Good taste probably. As a throwaway during the climax, it retains its subtlety.\"High Noon\" was produced by Stanley Kramer, directed by Fred Zinnemann, and scripted by Carl Foreman. From what I know of those three, any one of them could have had the odd idea about the historical motif.This film still seems fresh and relevant to me today. Its McCarthy-era provenance only adds more depth to an already excellent drama. The story is allegorical. The characters are very well drawn within the context of allegory. Aesop's characters are as identifiable after 2500 years as Foreman's are after 50.A throwaway comment: The production manager on this film was Clem Beauchamp. (I am pronouncing his name like \"Beecham\"; those two are in fact the same name, anglicized Norman I gather.) I happened to see him as the lead in one of his silent comedy shorts earlier this year at the Toronto Film Society. Beauchamp's a funny enough guy -- hardly any sort of a comic genius though -- but it's difficult to find any documentation on him. He's just another of the lost silent comedians forced to get a real job after the talkies arrived.",

I found it on the \"Movies!\" channel. It uses a unique approach for the script in that the whole elapsed time represented is about 90 minutes, from about 10:30AM to Noon on the same day. About the same as the running time of the movie itself.In this small old west town in the 1800s, Gary Cooper (about 50) is Marshal Will Kane. He is an imposing man with a serious demeanor and is credited by townsfolk as having brought the town to respectability, turning it into a place where women and children were safe. But he is retiring, getting married, and moving on, the replacement Marshal will arrive in a couple of days. His bride is very young (about 22) Grace Kelly as Amy.But bad news arrives in town just about as Will and Amy are to get into their wagon and leave. A notorious outlaw that Will had put away for murder some years earlier had somehow been released, and it was clear that the outlaw and three of his cronies were coming to town to get revenge, to kill Will. The outlaw was to arrive on the Noon train into town.That is the core of the story. Will decided, rightly, that it was no use to head out of town, if they didn't get him here then they would track him down, wherever he and Amy went. So he had to stay and deal with it that day. Much to the disappointment of Amy. His job was made more difficult because of the refusal of the townspeople to volunteer as temporary deputies, they were all too fearful. They figured Will would get killed and the outlaws could do what they wanted afterwards. Classic old western movie.SPOILERS: As expected the 4 outlaws came into town looking for Will. He was able to shoot a couple of them, but as a third was re-loading his guns at the corner of a building, he was shot dead through the window. Amy had gotten off the train when she heard the shooting, and she shot through the window. In the final showdown the bad guy had Amy in the street, she was able to throw him off balance as Will shot him. Showdown at High Noon and Will prevailed, he and Amy would be able to go off and lead a good life.",

For that matter, most of the characters, such as the one played by Grace Kelly, are irritating and annoying. By comparison, one can see how, for example, in \"Red River\", Tom Dunson (played by John Wayne) slowly evolves into a dictatorial cattle baron and Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift) matures when he stand up to him.In addition, the plot of \"High Noon\" is a thinly-disguised political statement about the anti-communist campaign led by American senator Joseph McCarthy and that diminishes what could have been an excellent story.I didn't like it when I first saw it many years ago.

He anchors the movie as Will Kane; it's his journey as high noon approaches quickly that we're spellbound by. Kelly plays his newlywed wife, she plays the young, but less naive than you'd think romantic link in Kane's life perfectly. Thomas Mitchell is the mayor of this small town and his scene at church - and how it twists and turns the movie, is a highlight of the film. Then you've got Lon Chaney as the brutally honest former marshal who recruited Kane. He was chosen for the role because of his flat voice; his one meaningful scene with Kane is a somber moment with implications far beyond what may or may not happen at noon.This movie is considered a classic for good reason. It's a rebuke, a powerful allegory, about blacklisting in Hollywood and the House Un-American Activities Committee in general. It's also about a man, a man not too different from us, who faces an enemy from his past alone; precisely because no one else will if he doesn't.",

Made at the tail end of the Golden Age of movies it was all downhill after this anyway, but how could something as apparently simple and insidious as this ever be topped? My favourite Western ever was Destry Rides Again, but even that was made to look like a complex psychological thriller in comparison to High Noon.Town Marshall Gary Cooper gets married to Quaker Grace Kelly only to find that a mad killer has been released and with his gang of three desperadoes will be gunning for him for imprisoning him in the first place, after the arrival of the noon train in eighty minutes. He feels morally compelled to stay and fight it out for his own peace of mind, never mind about for anyone else's sake. The film would be much poorer without Dimitri Tiompkin's explanatory theme song Do Not Forsake Me \u2013 the whole time is spent in trying not to be forsaken either by begging, reason or ethics and being forsaken by refusal, subterfuge or excuses. And Tex Ritter provided a much better deadpan sparse version of the song for the film than Frankie Laine did for the 78. Maybe Cooper was a shade too old for the part, maybe Lloyd \"I picked the wrong day to stop being a deputy\" Bridges was bashed out of the story too soon, maybe Katy Jurado had her best role ever with this film - but still a pity her enigmatic relationship to friend Sam was never divulged, maybe the gang were rather bland especially Lee \"Man With No Voice\" Van Cleef and maybe Kelly was almost transparent in her wishy-washyness, but at this distance I wouldn't have it any other way. It's all classic, hope they always leave it as it is especially the glorious black & white. I've seen it so many times over the decades I feel I know the position of every post on the High Street, where every shop was in the ballet scenes. Probably realistically but didn't it drag at 11:51?The orgasmic build up to noon, together with the ensuing double-boom shot indicating Cooper Alone is one of cinema's finest minutes ever, probably difficult if not impossible to ever be bettered.

Repeatedly, we return to these characters as they await the noon train bearing their villainous leader, and every time they strike some artful, menacing pose. I loved it. There was a second unit director, so I guess he was responsible for that.Then the leader steps off the train, and frankly it's a let-down, as he's kinda anonymous and, in a later shot, is revealed in profile as a bit chinless.

High Noon was playing for the first time on television at the very hour of our intended wedding. Yes I lost many points with my future wife, mother-in-law and guests, but a small price to pay for seeing it for the first time on TV.

This is a very focused one-purpose movie leading us up to an inevitable battle between the bad guys and the marshall and giving us the hoped for conclusion.  The movie is well-done but not spectacular, with a few nice tricks like the continual focus on the clock until 'high noon' and the way that we learn about the past here in the present helping us to understand the complexity of the relationship between the Marshall and his nemesis as well as the rest of the town.   Another winner of the Academy award was the song which is nausingly played throughout the movie and probably won because how much it's played rather than the quality of the recording.  Despite this, the film is still entertaining.",

            "content": "There are some films which never age. This is surely one of them. Fred Zinnemann's classic western is all about a marshal's love for his town, his duty and his extreme courage. Marshal Kane (superbly portrayed by Gary Cooper) has every reason to leave the town. A notorious criminal is just about to come into the town. The newly married marshal's duty is over and everyone in the town is telling him to go. But it is the pride which just cannot let him run away. It's a tension jerking drama in which he has to race against time to build the resistance. But he gets nobody's support.. everyone showing their backs with some excuse. and in the end he has to face the battle single handed. It's all about one man's bravery and pride. Movie brilliantly begins with Lee van Cleef's entrance and its mind-blowing track. The best feature of this film is it is almost real-time. The tension is felt so closely and showdown sequence is just about perfect. Usually I haven't seen much westerns in B/W but photography here is surely adorable. But above all its technical aspects it is Gary Cooper whom I absolutely loved. Superb character. And a Great movie.",

Also the effects they used in the movie were clich\u00e9 and bothersome. Perhaps from growing up around better actors and colorful movies with digital effects that make you want to watch more. This movie was just not one I wanted to view.The plot of the movie was weak and very predictable. It just so happen that when he was going to leave he was getting challenged to a showdown. I realise it was a movie but it was poorly planned and produced. The other characters didn't add any help in the plot of the movie either. It was a scatterplot of events that made no connection. Why did he need to fight the guy in the barn? It just had no real significance in the movie. None of the characters were likable, they had no significance and they were all just really unnecessary to the plot. While watching this movie in class, others I could see were losing their interest in it as well as I.

But as an adult I expect a certain amount of plausibility and realism in a drama. I think this movie failed on everything but the premise, which was great. The acting, dialog and fight scenes were all poorly done.I love westerns. I grew up on them. But many films of this era do not hold up by today's standards. They are almost comical. Especially the fight scenes. Unless you've never been in a fist fight you can't possibly think the fight between Gary Cooper and Bridges was realistic. They both looked like they had never thrown a punch in their lives. Girls fight better than that.I know the movie was about the marshal overcoming his fear upon realizing he was on his own, but they made him look cowardly not fearful. They are not the same thing. And as an experienced marshal who just cleaned up the town only 5 years ago why would he go into a gun fight against superior numbers without taking a rifle with him? Since the bad guys conveniently walked up the middle of the street, he could have easily taken out at least one or two of them right off the bat. The movie made him look stupid.Everything bothered me about this movie. Well, the actresses were attractive. I could name a number of much better Western dramas than this. Shane, though also dated, was a better movie. My favorite is the TV mini-series, \"Lonesome Dove\". \"The Shootist\" would have been one of John Wayne's best films, if they hadn't cast Ron Howard in it. \"The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance\" is another favorite of mine. \"The Wild Bunch\" makes this movie seem like a chick flick.

'High noon' is unquestionably one of those movies, and it's not especially surprising that to even read of the production history is a fascinating and worthy pursuit. Largely bereft of action, a sorry tension nonetheless pervades the feature as the minutes inexorably tick by: there's an earnest, dire complexity to the story of one person standing alone. With Carl Foreman involved in the writing process, the parallels to the real-life history unfolding at the time are umistakeable; Kane is as principled and upstanding as he ever was, but as the winds change and for one reason or another it's no longer deemed advantageous to support him, everyone around him raises nary a finger. Each subsequent scene of Kane's solitary walk is quietly captivating, and as the climax finally arrives, it's all the more exciting and impactful on account of the path taken up to that point. Simply put, I can't believe it's taken me this long to get around to it: 'High noon' is outstanding!Everything about this is brilliant and exquisite. In one particularly ingenious stroke, the regular shots of clock faces emphasizes the impending showdown, while also highlighting that the story effectively takes place in real time. The final moments, following the resolution of the climax, are an ending that is notably brief and curt, but very purposefully so, and all the more sadly meaningful for the fact of it. And even putting aside these artistic flourishes in the writing and direction, the work poured into 'High noon' is exceptional. The costume design, and hair and makeup work, is fetching and winsome. The filming locations are marvelous, and the set design and decoration, helping the course of events to feel very real and tangible. So it is, too, for those stunts and effects we see, and certainly the bursts of action and violence. And the cast is excellent - not least of all star Gary Cooper, who gives a strong performance of nuance and range that alone makes the movie worth checking out.What more to say? The story is wonderfully compelling, even as it's decidedly low-key compared to many of its genre brethren. Foreman's screenwriting is pointedly sharp and intelligent, and it's infuriating to know how his career was sidelined by the zealous fear and hate of cretins and cowards. Floyd Crosby's cinematography is impeccable, as is Fred Zinnemann's direction - nothing about this picture strikes me as flawed in any capacity. Of course I can understand that it won't appeal to everyone strictly as a matter of personal preference; there was a time when I had a hard time engaging with old movies, too, and I freely admit I've less knowledge of westerns compared to other genres. Yet by and large 'High noon' is so soundly, perfectly solid that I'd be remiss not to give a blanket recommendation for all comers. Some movies are so great that they deserve a look even from those that may not find them entirely to their liking, and in my opinion this is one of those movies. Wherever you're able to watch, these are 85 essential minutes.",

Yes, Gary Cooper turns to stand and fight, but the town will not back him up against the bullies. Filmed almost in real time, there is far more thrillerish tension than is normal in a western, but it works. Going through the strands of the differing elements in the town - economic, social, and louche - the story spins along as Cooper becomes ever more agitated (though why he does not take a rifle with him for the final shoot out beats me). Of course, it is very much of its time. Look at other films of the period and it was a very common theme whether people would work together to defy bullies and enemies - cold war or Mccarthyism paranoia or at least Hollywood's version of it. But 'High Noon' stands out as a simple but complex tale of right and wrong and real heroism. Cooper is too old, but when you think he was carrying on an affair for real with Grace Kelly off screen, you can't really complain! Good script, direction and acting make it a treat every time.",

Wilke, Cleef, and Wooley played their parts in what I would call an understated and very believable way. Grace Kelly has to be the most beautiful woman to ever have graced the silver screen.

A lawman \"Will Kane\" (Gary Cooper) who has retired so that he can marry a woman who, as a Quaker, disapproves of any violence, finds that before a new marshal can be appointed to his town, a bad guy just released from prison on a pardon has set out to take revenge upon him -- along with three other thugs who have carefully done nothing to give him cause to arrest them. Kane has sent Miller to prison, and Miller will chase Kane to the ends of the Earth if he is not stopped in Hadleyville, the town in which all action takes place.Oddly, we never meet the bad guy \"Frank Miller\" until the closing scene; all that we know about him is hearsay -- that he is not only evil and ruthless, but also crazy. No viewer has any chance to develop any rapport with this bad guy, which is part of the success of this movie. But in the end Will Kane is outnumbered badly, even if he gets some aid of an unlikely kind from an unlikely source (identifying either the person or the aid introduces a spoiler) as everyone in town, including the deputy, refuses to take on the villain and his associates for inexcusable reasons -- cowardice or venality.Although -High Noon- has none of the usual attractions of Westerns -- no spectacular panoramas, no stunt riding, and little violence except at the end, the movie illustrates how people can give in to their worst tendencies and allow a hero to face impossible odds. Personal conflicts are well defined in all characters except for the outright criminals who have no conflicts with their own vileness.The biggest special effect is, of all things, clocks which demonstrate the arrival of the inevitable end. The music is hokey, but it alludes to the heartbeat of Will Kane, so it makes its point.",

The \"real time\" device works well, building up tension naturally and coming off smoothly. The settings and sequences were each well-conceived in themselves. All of this makes up for a story that is occasionally too forced (perhaps due to a too-earnest attempt to make parallels to contemporary events, or perhaps for some other reason) to be fully believable.The basic set-up is believable and compelling, and it gets things off to a quick start. From the beginning, there is a sense of anxious anticipation for the impending showdown between Marshal Kane (Cooper) and Frank Miller. The further developments from there work well on the level of basic drama, although the story would have been more satisfying if it the rest of the characters were not so one-dimensional in comparison with Kane.Aside from Kane, only Katy Jurado's character has any real depth, as the rest are just props for Cooper to play off of. Grace Kelly and some of the others do a good job in their roles, but they are limited by the characters. For a while, it is satisfying to see Cooper's character tower above everyone else, but a somewhat more complex story would have done better justice to Cooper's performance and to the technical strengths of the film, while not losing anything dramatically. Still, \"High Noon\" has a lot going for it, and it is certainly a worthwhile classic.",

            "review_title": "High Noon, High Standards (spoilers)",
            "content": "The genre of the Western is seen as holding a single basic form. A lonely town on the edge of the North American frontier falls victim to an evil, black-clothed, murdering desperado who can only be stopped by the good-natured, clean-cut, well-groomed sheriff or local hero. Although these basic elements of the classic Western all exist in `High Noon', the story is arranged so that the journey the film sends its viewers on is far more interesting than the preconceived outcome. The story that engulfs the town of Hadleyville is told not only with the relevant dialogue but also with excellent camera work that establishes characters and moods. Accompanied only by the church bell, the gang enters the town. Little is said by the townspeople, and the camera is used to establish the gang's character and their relationship with the town. The lack of verbal exposition is replaced with pictures of people grimacing and fleeing as the gang passes. Inventive camera angles are used to look at the dusty town in new ways. For one shot, the camera is placed below the front of a wagon between the footboard and the horses, and the audience gets a new low - angled view with the spinning wheel in the foreground. While many scenes use conversations that consist of intercut close - ups and medium shots, only one long shot is used as the judge packs up his things as he gives Cain his explanation for leaving in the time of crisis. This is used to create a feeling of deliberate decision making on the part of the judge, and to assert his character as a thoughtful man with practical reasons for leaving town before noon. Perhaps the most effective shot faces Cain as he moves into the street and then zooms out as it is carried upward on a crane to reveal Cain is totally alone in the dusty street. This simply reinforces Cain's lonely and desperate situation and the pressure of a whole town weighing on his shoulders. Utilizing both the camera and dialogue to create a classic story enables the meaning of the small town to extend beyond that of a simple western. Art enables people to discuss current problems in a context that can address the universal concepts of the situation without raising the specifics of a dilemma which people so often become caught up in. This ability of art to transcend circumstances through metaphor is what makes `High Noon' relevant as a cold war film in spite of its untimely setting. In the film, a single man faces a threat for an entire community. Similarly, during the 1950's, a single lawyer stood up to the fear spread by McCarthyism in the United States. Although each citizen has their own practical reasons for not joining Cain's stand, none of them will join Cain. Those people who ducked McCarthy's so - called hearings, backed out of the legal fight fearing the blacklists just as the townspeople locked themselves in at home to hide from the bullets of Miller's gang. The film leaves people with the choice of leaving freedom to be decided by others while remaining safely locked up or risking the consequences by facing those who would threaten freedom.\nOn the whole, the film is very enjoyable. The story line is exciting as it includes all the traditional elements of westerns, but it arranges them in such a way that all the odds are piled against the reluctant hero. The women in the film stand apart, and in the occasion of Mrs. Ramirez, above the men as they bargain and separate their choices from the men they love. The film delivers its message not only in the hero of Cain, but with the very practical reasons that the townspeople give for not fighting. These reasons are so legitimate that they force the audience to truly wonder how they would behave in similar circumstances. During the varied visuals and pointed dialogue, the only element that can detract from the film is the repeated use of the song, \"Do Not Forsake Me\". While the song is quite appropriate for the film, its many renditions cross into redundancy. Director Fred Zinneman drives home his point both clearly and artistically. Using a variety of techniques, the film brings the audience into the life of the town. The script and actors create very real characters. The challenge is finding the message in the metaphors, so the next time a gang rides into town, fate does not rest on one man alone.9 out of 10",

            "content": "This movie is somewhat of an enigma. In many ways you could see it as being, well, and independent film, yet has gone down in posterity as being one of the greatest westerns ever made. One of the things is that it was actually a low budget film, and another thing is that the entire action occurs in real time. You know that because the film constantly referred to the clock on the wall, as it counted down to 12:00 noon, the time at which the train carrying the bad guy would arrive.Basically, the story is that this crook, Frank Miller, who had been arrested by the marshal of the town and sent to hang, was released on a pardon and wants to return to get his revenge. His former gang members ride through the town and then spend most of the time at the railway station waiting for him to arrive. The Marshall, Will Kane, has just been married and has retired from the job, but as he is leaving he hears that Miller is returning, and under protest from his new wife (who is also a Quaker), decides to return to the town to confront him. There is only one problem - nobody wants to help him. In fact, most of the film involves him trying to rustle up a possie, and pretty much everybody turns him down. Those who do want to help Kane turns down because they are either too young, or crippled, and he doesn't want to be held responsible for their death. So, in the end, it is just him against the four members of the Miller gang.The interesting thing is that nobody wanted to touch this film, though after Gary Cooper won an oscar for his performance, a lot of them regretted turning it down. In fact, John Wayne, who was dead against the movie, was convinced to accept the Oscar on Cooper's behalf, namely because Cooper was in Europe at the time.The reason that the film was considered poison was the time in which it was released. It is in fact an incredibly political movie, and is making a strong statement, not so much against the government, but against Hollywood. This was the time of the House Unamerican Comittee hearings where they were attempting to root out suspected communists from Hollywood. The problem was that there weren't any, but the thing is because any suggestion of having socialist leanings was likely to earn you a blacklist, pretty much everybody kept their mouth shut. This is what the movie was confronting, the fact that people who could stand up to the government were hiding in their houses instead of calling them out. The fact that nobody wanted to touch this film when it was being made is a testament to that.I thought the movie ended quite well too, namely because, not surprisingly, once the problem had been eliminated, everybody emerged from their houses to congratulate their new hero. But Kane is no fool, he remembered, and his action of throwing the star to the ground and riding off is a testament to the fact that when he needed the help of the town, there was no help to be found. So as in the true western tradition, he rode off into the sunset, but it was more in the sense of brushing the dust off his shoes, and leavning them to their fate.Yeah, and the idea of the western. This isn't so much the idea of taming the west, but using a vehicle that was familiar, and popular, at the time. There are numerous interpretations of what the western is supposed to mean, but this movie moves away from the traditional interpretation and instead uses its as a means to drive home an issue that is being faced in the contemporary world, but using a vehicle that was popular at the time. No doubt, a similar film would use a different vehicle these days since the western has declined dramatically in popularity.",

            "content": "spoilersWatched High Noon last night on DVD, together with a `Making Of' made quite recently. This was most likely my 4th time, although it might have been the 3rd or the 5th, as the last time was so long ago.First on universality, the townspeople of Hadleyville could easily have been the peasants in Shichinin No Samurai whose loyalty becomes fickle when survival is at stake.Strictly speaking, High Noon is not even a western, or at least not a typical western. It's a human drama that happens to have taken place in the form of a western. It could also have been a stage play, with the actual time of the events, from 10:50 a.m. to a little after 12 noon (for the gunfight to play out), matching the length of the movie of about 90 minutes. The gunfight at the end is actually an anti-climax and director Zinnemann wisely didn't try to do much with it. The mesmerizing element of a western is always the fast draw duel such as the one in another classic, Shane.\nAs far as I'm concern, the movie finishes with the last two minutes before noon, with interposing shots of Will Kane (Gary Cooper) writing his will, the clock and the pendulum, the empty railway track, various part of the town, close ups of the various key characters, finally culminating in the piercing, silence-breaking whistle and the approach of the noon train issuing menacing black smoke.To the main text of courage and loyalty in face of danger and the often-debated subtext of anit-McCarthism, there can perhaps be another angle. Nowhere in the film does Kane make any statement, either outright or by innuendo, of heroism. Quite on the contrary, he explains at the very beginning to his newly wed Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) that if they run, they would just be running their entire life and end up being caught anyway. To Amy, as well as to some others, he has more than once said that there is not enough time to run. Unless there is something very subtly dishonest about this man Kane, the primary reason for his decision is a pragmatic. There is absolutely no question that he has courage, but he also does not have much of a choice.The film was shot in 28 days, based on the `Making Of' I saw (on which I do not have complete confidence because it said that High Noon was Cooper's only Oscar while in fact he had one before, In Sergeant York (1941)). Regardless of how long (or short) it took, High Noon was made with thoughtful touches throughout. Take the scene when Amy and Mrs. Ramirez go past Kane in their buggy to the train station at noon, the latter turns around in the last minute while the former looks straight ahead without flinching. Take the crane shot that dwindles the solitary Kane in an empty street in the town when everybody is hiding. Even the obvious, continuously recurring motif, the clock, appears in consecutively larger sizes until at high noon, it takes over the entire screen and hits the audience like a sledge hammer.High Noon is shot in grainy black and white, a departure from the norm, a successful departure that enhances the films unique quality. Dimitri Tiomkin's `Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling' has become as much an integral part of High Noon as Lara's Theme is to Doctor Zhivago. However, this is the first time I notice that the ballad is not only the background music, but is also played by one of the three goons on a harmonica at the train station while waiting for Frank Millar.I wouldn't comment on the cast because everything has been said. But it was interesting to note, on this n-th viewing of mine, that the first character to appear is no other than Lee Van Cleef, almost too young to be recognized, who later became Clint Eastwood's partner in crime, in a manner of speaking.",

There is no action whatsoever, aside from a fistfight, until the climactic scene. Gary Cooper's finest role, and Grace Kelly's first major one. While there have been many done more recently, this is the earliest film I can recall where the action takes place in more or less real time. This is over-emphasized a bit with just a few too many shots of clocks, but then again, that is part of the suspense-building.

High Noon comes in the category of a western, but it sort of re-defines the phenomena called as the 'Western Movie'. Well for starters the first bullet fired in the movie is at the climax. The entire movie is a sort of build-up towards the inevitable end. The movie is about a Marshal who gets married and ends his Marshal duties on the same day. He is about to leave the village when the news of an infamous Outlaw who was sent to prison by the Marshal stuns everyone. The Outlaw is coming back to take his revenge on the Marshal, and he is coming by the noon 12.00 clock train. The other gang members (3 of them) are waiting for their boss at the village station. Even after repeated suggestions by the local people and even his newly wedded wife to leave the village a.s.a.p, the Marshal decides not to run and face the situation. But the entire village turn their backs on their once very much loved and respected Marshal. They simply in a sense leave him to fend for himself. How does he handle the situation and what difficulties arise during the entire build up is the movie. Another important feature of this movie is the 'wait' for the train which is symbolized by the clock shown at regular intervals to incite tension. On the acting front, this movie is entirely carried on his shoulders by one man - Gary Cooper. This surely is one of the better acting performances in a western movie which are not particularly known for good acting. The others play their part fine but have very little scope of doing anything note-worthy. Overall, a definite addition to my all time favorite westerns list.Rating : 9/10",

That being just over one hour away, Kane takes hid bride and flees the revenge from Miller. But outside town, knowing that the replacement marshal won't arrive for another day, Kane turns back to stand up to the villain, and his mob who waits at the train station. That decision, which makes his new wife to turn her back on him, leaves with just an hour to gather a posse. But he will find that that task is a lot harder than he thought.Comments: A movie apparently with a heavy cargo of political thoughts and commentaries. I will leave that to those interested. The movie itself is actually a thrilling but unusual western. Those wanting to see an action-packed western full of chases and shoot-outs will be disappointed. This western is a much slower, but never dull, story about the lone marshal abandoned by all. It is his struggle to gather the posse and his struggle with his own fear that is the main story here. Therefore, although the movie is full of well-known actors and actresses, it is Gary Cooper aka Will Kane that carries this movie. And he does it well. He both possesses the strength to be the lone gun-fighter, but he is also the lone, abandoned and nervous man standing before his own death.If you keep you eyes open you will see Grace Kelly and Loyd Bridges in supporting roles, and you might recognize Lee van Cleef (debut), Jack Elam, Katy Jurado and Harry Morgan (among others) in small roles.It is an unusual western, a classic at that, maybe more interesting than entertaining to watch. It has a element of suspense and mystery that many other westerns don't have, but it lacks much of the action. Therefore I can't really agree with the high ratings, though it is very good.7/10",

Then he gets a telegram saying a killer with a personal score to settle is arriving on the noon train. Should Will leave, or stay and face this threat ? And is anybody willing to help him ?I think High Noon is the best western of the fifties, for three reasons. Firstly, it's a terrific story about a man in trouble asking for help and receiving none. Secondly, the real-time unfolding of events (true fans should start viewings at 10:35am) generates outstanding suspense and tension. Why have only a few other movies (e.g. Nick Of Time, Phone Booth) tried this trick ? Finally, Zinnemann's great visual flair, with superb photography, inspired editing and brilliant use of music make it one of the most stylish movies of its day, and perhaps the only western that the great Sergio Leone could be accused of cribbing (reinforced perhaps by the presence of Van Cleef in the first shot). The richness of the picture comes of course from its characters and the dilemma they find themselves in. Everyone has an excuse not to help Will (cowardice, politics, ethics, age, business interests) but down deep they all know they should, and his growing sense of desperation as he realises he's on his own is almost tangible. There are a couple of things that slightly mar the film for me though. One is the wooden-seeming Cooper (who won an Oscar); he's okay but he always seems to be to be giving a very ordinary leading performance in a film full of great supporting ones (I especially like Jurado and Chaney). I guess that's not completely his fault though, since Will is intentionally such a straight-ahead guy while everyone else is full of quirks and anxieties. The other flaw is Kelly, who is too pure, too perfect, too moral and far too young (she was twenty and Cooper was fifty). These are minor gripes however in a movie full of superb shots; talented cameraman Floyd Crosby went on to shoot dozens of great B-pictures with Roger Corman. Dimitri Tiomkin's music is outstanding throughout, and the constant recursion of the memorable Tex Ritter ballad, Do Not Forsake Me, oddly adds to the resonance and power of the story (a bit like Fight The Power in Do The Right Thing). Co-produced and scripted by Carl Foreman, based on the short story The Tin Star by John W. Cunningham. Foreman was one of many great talents who was criminally blacklisted in the fifties, and one way to read the movie is as an allegory for the victims of the infamous McCarthy witch-hunts of the time. This is a must-see classic western which has influenced legions of films since (everything from Dirty Harry to Blazing Saddles to Outland), with one of the most memorable and poetic final scenes in all cinema.",

The movie is by far the best western I have ever seen - taut, exciting, well written, brilliantly acted and without a single wasted scene. Grace Kelly is very good as Cooper's young bride and Lee van Cleef makes a strong impression in one of his earliest roles, despite not having any dialogue. A timeless drama for the ages, no wonder it was the favourite film of the great President Bill Clinton. Carl Foreman could not have written a better allegory for the evil of blacklisting, it's no surprise that draft dodger John Wayne made \"Rio Bravo\" as a right-wing response. However this is infinitely better than that slow, overlong and badly acted crap with Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin pretending to be actors.10/10.",

I can't remember any such dramas where the otherwise likeable and very recognizable people behave in a natural but cowardly way.\n**** SPOILERS **** I love the movie for giving the townspeople all kinds of plausible justifications for their refusal to help the protagonist: a) isn't this just a private dispute or vendetta between law enforcement and outlaw, and if so, why doesn't he just leave and avoid inflicting this on the town? Moreover, in other larger cities, he'll find a regular police force, etc. that can stop these outlaws.b) this is the last thing this town needs - a reputation for danger, violence and gunplay while the town is looking to promote itself.\nc) why do we hire a sheriff and deputy and pay their salaries, if not so they can take care of law enforcement? - they're specialists, leave them to the job.d) what good could I do with a gun? I'd just get killed, not help anyone, and leave my wife a widow and my children without a father.e) I don't mind helping if others help - he said he'd get others - where are they? He's not kept up his end of the bargain.f) the townspeople never appreciated me while I was sheriff - I'm too old and tired to do anything now - he should just leave - I thought he was quitting anyway.g) if he thinks I'm good enough to stop outlaws now, why didn't he recommend me to replace him as sheriff? If he doesn't think I'm any good, then fine - I'm out of this line of work.h) he absolutely promised that he'd quit this line of work when he proposed - the very day we marry, he's going back on his commitment - all because of some stupid macho thing. It's not running away if we were leaving this town for our honeymoon anyway - he's just looking for trouble to prove himself as some stupid hero. After all, how many more times in our marriage mightn't someone look for him - this will never stop if he gives in to going back to the town now. These reasons are all arguably just - and so very human. We side with Cooper but what makes this movie great is that the reasons given by the townspeople AREN'T stupid.However one feels about war with Iraq, the Wall St. Journal recently printed a column that drew extraordinary parallels between the townspeople and the continental Europeans' reasons for not getting involved in Iraq. I think the article's title was \"Ok Herb, go back to your wife and kids.\"\nThe realistic portrayal of the human beings in the town, and the searing intensity of the protagonist's consequent loneliness and fear, are what make this a great (and dark) movie - certainly not standard fare.",

Then when one of Miller's men gets ready to shoot Will, you hear a shot, and see his back arch, as if he had just gotten shot from behind.  Then the camera moves back and you see that it was Amy who shot the man.  I think that's so incredible!This is such a great movie, because Gary Cooper is a hero, even though he had no one to support him.

Whether it was a situation at school, in the neighborhood, or at work. I recall a line from another one of my favorite films, the \"Wind and the Lion\". In it Brian Keith plays Teddy Roosevelt, and there's a moment where he tells his daughter that the path to greatness is a lonely path, and one only travelled by other great men, and sometimes they're your enemies. And you may find that your enemies are a lot more admirable than your friends. They're the only true luxury you have.\"High Noon\" is nearly the epitome of that. Cooper is the tin star who confronted a town menace and cleaned up that town by sending that malefactor to jail, and eventually to be hanged. He led the effort to clean up the town and push out the black hats. But, come his time of need, just as he's about to enjoy his life, an age old threat rears its ugly head yet again. Cooper will attempt to recruit the town as he had done before.Cooper's character seeks deputies for a posse. He tries to enlist friends, but winds up with the rejects. Is the town so cowed that they will not help, or will assistance come from unseen quarters? What will be Marshal Kane's reaction? How will his mettle hold up against a threat of resounding odds?This western isn't simple Will Rogers' fair. This isn't a case where the villain wrestles some cattle or steals the mortgage and rides off with the white hat in pursuit blazing away with his six shooter on a swift white horse. There's no comic relief. No funny miner or short cowpoke with a long beard quipping one liners. This is a gritty and emotional western. It's about a lawman on the edge, and having to face a threat as best as he can.We get lots of dynamics underscoring the slow yet sometimes violent pace of living in the old west. There's a subtlety strangely married to a kind of electricity and tension that pervades the film. You have to imagine that you are the one that everyone looks to to solve the more profound and dangerous challenges of the town. You're more than a father. You are a leader and commander on the front lines. You have to make the decision and work the with tools that those you have sworn to protect give you.There's not much else to it than that. Confronting threats or wrong doing is second nature to Marshal Kane, but not to everyone. Even the most ardent and stalwart CO will loose tools and resources for whatever reason. And when the moment of truth comes, he must face the adversary or enemy with a deep hatred and blood lust for him that's been boiling for years.It is not an envious job. But it is his job. The one job he took as a citizen of the town. The job that he must execute to the best of his ability.Imagine you must face down an armed gang led by a crazed man who hates you with all his heart. Imagine that you have no high tech security devices. There are no surveillance cameras, no cell phones or land lines to call for help, no ballistic cloth or plating, nor Kevlar vests and other protections; no night vision, flash bang grenades, no GPS nor tracking devices to help you keep track of the bad guy, nor automatic rifles and other fancy weaponry and devices to help you.What you have are the clothes on your back. You have the star that was given you pinned to your shirt or vest that says you're the law. You have a six shooter, and, if you're lucky, a rifle or shotgun. You need to be not only lightening fast with your weapon, not only to be able to out-think the opposition, but you also need to be brave. You need to go out there and face the threat knowing this could be your last act as a law man. It's all up to you. Few people face that on any level. Could you?High Noon has tension, a smattering of race relations, gangs, religious zealots, romance, and common folk who hate the law, even though they asked for it. For those of us who've lived similar circumstances, it's a reminder of who we are. What makes men, men.See it.",

            "review_title": "\"Do not forsake me O my darlin'\"",
            "content": "It is said that screenwriter Carl Foreman wrote HIGH NOON as an angry allegory about McCarthyism. The basic plot of HIGH NOON is fairly simple: In the western town of Hadleyville, New Mexico, word arrives that bad man Frank Miller is out of prison and headed back to town aboard the noon train. The just retired sheriff, Will Kane, puts off his plans to leave town with his newlywed bride in order to face the returning outlaw and his gang. But Kane can't put together a posse to defend the town; all the townspeople, while largely respectful of Kane, are either too afraid or are otherwise sympathetic to Miller. Thus, Kane is left to stand alone against the Miller gang and their threats of apparent violence.In Foreman's vision it can be assumed that the Miller gang represents the House Un-American Activities Committee and all the conservatives who took an overtly pro-active stand against the threat of communism. Kane represents the few outspoken liberals who stood up to the bullying and found themselves alone in the street as the cowardly masses (the townspeople) hid in fear. Thus the irony is that Foreman wrote an allegory hoping to promote subliminal leftist propaganda as a means of rebuking the conservative assumption that liberal filmmakers might introduce subliminal leftist propaganda into their work.But quite unintentionally, the film illustrates the flawed thinking behind McCarthy-era hysteria and behind any noble and/or sinister plans that Foreman might have had. The film can just as easily be re-interpreted so that the Miller gang represents the communists and their sympathizers, with Kane symbolizing bravely patriotic conservatives \u2013- left standing alone in the street as the cowardly masses hid in fear. Indeed, this so-called communist western is rife with elements that are strongly, if not uniquely, American; not the least of which is the central character of Will Kane. Strong and determined, albeit also fearful and uncertain, as played beautifully by Gary Cooper, Kane stands as a noble symbol of tough American leadership \u2013- be it liberal or conservative. Driven by a sincere sense of responsibility, Kane bravely stands his ground, even as many of the citizens of Hadleyville encourage him, indeed, beg him to leave. The socialist image of strength by the uniting of the individuals is pretty much brushed aside.Thus, there is the flaw: Make it too obvious and the propaganda becomes too weighed down in its profundity. Make it too subtle and it might not even be noticed. Make it too generic and it becomes so open to interpretation that the message might be meaningless. In the end, the propaganda is only as successful and meaningful as an audience will allow it to be. Thus, as a \"message movie,\" HIGH NOON is of minimal value; it is embraced for exactly the opposite reasons that its creator intended. But as a western movie, the film both embraces and rejects the ethos of the genre. In the end, there are many things to admire about the film -- and things that justify John Wayne's notorious disgust with it -- but being pro-communist isn't one of them.To some extent, HIGH NOON is the thinking man's western. Until the very end, there isn't much action in the film; but there is a lot of discussion, bargaining, theorizing and explaining. To some degree, the story would work as a play. As Kane goes from one to another, all the townsfolk have their reasons for not standing with the sheriff: some are afraid, some have families, some too old, some too weak. Some just don't see it as their fight to fight. The cowardly masses aren't so much cowardly as reluctant to look for trouble. In a way, Kane isn't just the last defense against encroaching trouble, he is the lightning rod that attracts it. The war with the Miller gang is his battle, it is part of a war that he took on, even if it was on behalf of people who ultimately turn their backs on him. His feelings of betrayal by his fellow man are just, made all the worst by the realization that he really can't argue with them and has no means to force them to help. And that, oddly enough, is what makes the film so American.In the traditional western, such as Wayne's RIO BRAVO, they might be reluctant to take up arms, but in the end the citizens would stand up for what is right. And they would do so for their own reasons. In HIGH NOON, the citizens refuse to help, also for their own reasons. Wayne's view of America might be more positive and Foreman's more negative, but they both see the same America; a country based on the right of individuals to decide for themselves, free of the heavy hand of governmental power. It is that freedom, which for better or worse, makes America. Foreman sees that as a flaw, not a simple American reality. The townspeople may be wrong to refuse to help, but it is their right. Whatever the consequences.HIGH NOON is a revisionist western. John Wayne's beloved image of the west, wherein the sharing of hardships binds the citizens together is supplanted by a new image, where the successful establishment of a town separates and disunites the citizens. Brave as he may be, Will Kane is also foolish in believing that by making their battle his battle during dark days that they will continue to follow his lead when times are good. In giving the townspeople the safety of civilization, Kane has also given them the freedom to question his wisdom and to say no to his pleas. In the end, like so many leaders, Kane leaves town, bitter and forsaken; feeling his sacrifices are unappreciated, his victory empty.Is it any wonder that HIGH NOON is the favorite film of American presidents, be it Bill Clinton or George W. Bush?",

A hero, who is disgusted with the townsfolk he protects outside his call of duty, risking his life.It is unusual because the theme song runs through the film.

Subsequently, Foreman and his friend producer Stanley Kramer fell apart, when Kramer did not support him during Senator McCarthy's witchhunt to identify \"Communists\" in Hollywood. Both were collaborators on this film. The film reflects the off-screen drama, in some ways, which led to Foreman fleeing USA to work in UK.

            "content": "\"You're a good-looking boy: you've big, broad shoulders. But he's a man. And it takes more than big, broad shoulders to make a man.\" 'High Noon' is not your average everyday Western. Regarding the time the film was made in 1952, in those days McCarthyism was indeed working into the late 1940s and early 1950s, and very few movies, such as this one, used characters in different settings to perform varying roles concerning this group. McCarthyism worked in the following manner. People who held left wing political beliefs were accused of being disloyal to the country. They were investigated and questioned about their past political associations. Often the names of people who did not cooperate would be placed on a blacklist. They would lose their jobs and would not be able to find other work in their chose occupation. Some people refused to testify before the Human Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), citing their right to free speech and political association guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Many of these people were prosecuted for contempt of Congress and imprisoned. The few movies, such as 'High Noon', raised these issues and cleverly disguised them as being about other subject matter and set in another time and place. The screenwriter for 'High Noon', Carl Foreman, was blacklisted as an alleged Communist sympathizer shortly after the film was made, thus afterwards having to write his screenplays under pseudonyms. Though \"rehabilitated\" in 1997 and his screen credits restored, it was too late for Mr. Foreman, who had passed away in 1984. Was this film made to paint the true artistic picture of allegory and symbolism of the day to portray it in one of the highest degrees of Western film-making expertise? Let's take a look. Directed by Fred Zinnemann, who would go on to direct 'From Here To Eternity', it was a Western unlike that of which I have ever seen before. Gary Cooper performed wonderfully as Marshal Will Kane, a man of whom is preparing to leave the small town of Hadleyville, New Mexico with his new peacemaking Quaker bride Amy Fowler Kane (Grace Kelly) but would ultimately and unflinchingly fight for the less-than-helpful community sooner than he had expected when no one else had his back when local psycho criminal Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and his gang come to town on the 12 P.M. train due to a pardon. Kane refuses to run from a showdown as Frank and his notorious band of accomplices (including a harmonica-sucking Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef)) loiter at the station, while even the entire town abandons the good marshal's cause. Of course he admits to being afraid but is willing to fight for the town, even if everyone around him seems to be always called into question. Nobody seems to want to get involved in such a heated battle or take a risk to save their beloved town. All the looming pressure and salvation of the town rested on Kane's shoulders as he boldly went forth to face the fugitives. The film really delves into the true character of the human spirit, especially for Kane, which I believe to be one of the main themes for this picture. Here is a figure that is too proud, loyal and will fight to the death in order to save the town he watched over, even if it means standing alone. Amy just wanted to get out of town on the high noon train before the band of the notorious Frank Miller and his gang of outlaws showed up. She eventually gives in, setting her religious beliefs aside and aided her husband amidst the risk of death in the film's shoot-em-up finale. Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), was somebody who should have held the position he had to his name, but backed out of it in fear of what was to come, removing his badge and walking away. Some intense scenes in the film were when Kane has a fistfight in the stable after being persuaded to leave town as well to the ultimate showdown at the film's shootout ending, all the while with the swinging pendulum on the clock, ominously ticking down as Kane stands as a man alone about to face his true destiny of a town that is unworthy of him. This movie is truly one of those rare films that can still carry a powerfully allegorical and symbolic message even today. Shot during the second Red Scare, along with Tex Ritter's droning but memorable Oscar-winning \"Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darlin'\" sung at the beginning and end (and another Oscar-win for song by Ned Washington) this film dismisses the regular Western and in turn becomes a character study instead of a mere action adventure set in some yesteryear of the Wild West, where the town's loss was, in true retrospect, the marshal's true gain.",

It's quickly confirmed the gunfighters are waiting for Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a killer that Will Kane had caught and imprisoned five years earlier. Miller was to be hung, but his sentence was commuted and now for unknown reasons he has been released and is arriving on the noon train to seek revenge.Everyone urges Kane to leave immediately with his new bride since a new marshal is arriving tomorrow. Indeed Will has turned in his badge, and he and Amy start to leave town. But then he turns back \"because he has to.\" He and Amy quarrel, and Amy, who became a Quaker after seeing her brother and father killed by guns, says she is leaving on the noon train with or without Will.Will then tries to raise a posse to confront Miller but has no success. Mayor Jonas Henderson (Thomas Mitchell) just thinks Kane should leave town. Deputy Marshall Pell (Lloyd Bridges) refuses to back Kane because Kane didn't recommend him to be his successor as marshal. Judge Percy Mettrick (Otto Kruger) flees town himself because he had pronounced the sentence on Miller earlier. Former marshal Martin Howe (Lon Chaney) is crippled with arthritis and can't help. People in the bar liked the town the way it was when Frank Miller ran the town. The people in the church argue about who is responsible, and no one backs Will Kane.Our hero faces the four villains alone, and kills two of them. Amy, who had boarded the train at noon, runs back into town when she hears the shooting start. She sees Will Kane still fighting the remaining two Miller brothers, and shoots Ben Miller (Sheb Wooley) in the back. Frank Miller seizes Amy and tries to use her as a shield, but she escapes and Will kills Frank Miller. As townsfolk surge on to the empty streets, Amy and WiIl ride out of town.In some ways the plot is contrived. What would the townsfolk have done if Will and Amy had left right after their marriage? They doubtless would have waited for the new marshal. The Miller gang may or may not have caused trouble when they learned the marshal was gone.I naturally didn't care for pacifist Amy surrendering to accepting violence as the only answer.This was Grace Kelly's first major role in a film.",

Away go the plans and back comes the lawmaker...High Noon may have one of the simplest plots but its charm is in the interplay of the town toward their once beloved Marshal and his struggle to rouse them against the incoming threat. Former friends become indifferent, beloved wife turns tail, old deputies lend a deaf ear and only Kane can find it within himself to do the right thing and stand up to the Miller Gang. High Noon's pacing is sparkling, as we witness the clock ticking toward doomsday as Kane vainly tries to round a posse until it's far too late...Eventually Miller and his lackeys roll into town and trap Kane in a variety of positions but his ingenuity and know-how see him eventually come out on top. Sadly, it is only here that the town recognizes the jewel it has and tries to convince him to stay to no avail, as he has learned one valuable lesson: Your real friends stick with you through thick and thin.Grace Kelly plays Kane's wife well but seems oddly two-dimensional as the Quaker wanting nothing to do with the vendetta and only a quiet life with her husband. Her interactions with Helen Ramirez (who devours entire scenes with her moxie) are fine though.

A bad guy who terrorized the town of Hadleyville in New Mexico.However some do gooders 'in the North' in their wisdom have changed his death penalty to life imprisonment and now given him a pardon (ridiculous I know).Miller is about to return to Hadleyville to settle a few scores perhaps and is due on the noon train.The film is almost real time as the countdown to noon begins.The wedding day of Kane is ruined and he is betrayed by reluctant townsfolk unwilling to get involved in the impending battle.Cooper like Wayne is a reluctant hero figure and he rightly won a Best Actor Academy Award.Director Fred Zinnemann delivers a suspenseful Western that even critics of the Western genre can enjoy.The film is also memorable for a theme song that crops up throughout the film in days when such a thing wasn't ususal. The song in question being 'Don't Forsake Me Oh My Darling'.The real time element adds some real tension to the film.",

            "content": "Critically, as the film was innovative in its structure (avoiding most real Western 'action' until the end of the film), and avoided a number of stereotypes popularized by higher profile filmmakers like John Ford and Howard Hawks, and Western icon John Wayne, derided it as un-American, as well as worse things. That is has become so lauded, even as it was a low budget project, with almost no great nor spectacular battle scenes, is another reason so many of the classic Western film lovers have railed at it. Cinematographer Floyd Crosby does a good, if not spectacular, job. There is one infamous goof that he and film editors committed, and that is in a crane shot, late in the film, where the camera pulls back and up to reveal the town deserted and Kane alone. Unfortunately, in the upper left hand corner of the film, telephone poles and wires are clearly visible. Crosby's mot notable touch was in not fetishizing the Western tableaux, instead not filtering the light reflected from the surroundings, which led to a blanched, dessicated look to the black and white cinematography; along the lines of then contemporary documentary films.The DVD, put out by Lionsgate, comes with two disks. Disk one is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the transfer is spotless. The remastering of the film is superb. It scintillates with clarity. It also includes an audio commentary by the progeny of many of the people involved- the late actor, John Ritter, Carl Foreman's son, Jonathan, Fred Zinneman's son, Tim, and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria Cooper-Janis. As in most commentaries featuring non-experts, this one quickly descends into meaningless banter and anecdotes, and many, 'Gee, whiz, wasn't dad great' moments. The only comment of any worth comes when it's mentioned that, before he kills the first of the desperadoes, Kane calls out Miller's name, and shorts the man, therefore not plugging him in the back. The comment states this displays Kane's personal code of ethics, and while this is true, it is also one of the weaker moments in the film, because it goes against many of the other realistic moments (as does the plethora of 1950s-speak: Gollys and Gee whizzes abound)- a fact unmentioned in the commentary. But, good observations as this are rare on the track. Given the film's stature as a Western classic, one would have hoped for at least one expert commentary, by a noted historian of cinema. The second disk features a 50 minute making of film, Inside High Noon, and a shorter making of featurette. There is a featurette on singer Tex Ritter; a clip of Ritter singing the Oscar winning song Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' on the Jimmy Dean TV show, a featurette called Behind High Noon, and a radio broadcast featuring Ritter. All of these features are useful, but none is really standout, nor top of the line, compared to the best DVD features. The real killer, as mentioned, is no expert commentary track.High Noon is certainly a classic, and with a few better decisions scriptwise and characterwise, and with a few better decisions technically, it would truly have been a great film. Greatness and classicality, however, are unrelated beasts. This film is classic melodrama stripped to its naked rot, and plays out almost like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. Its narrative bears down upon the viewer like the train that carries Frank Miller. It has moments of poignancy (see the looks between Kane and Helen), black humor (see when the hotel clerk asks Kane if he can find Helen's room when the marshal ascends the stairs), and mythos (scan the characters' names and personal traits for counterparts in assorted mythologies); as well as an ability to amplify these characteristics (note how every shot of the clocks, which visually builds tension, is accompanied by a slightly strumming sound). Technically, the film is top notch, but its fundamentals sag a bit. If only the bulk of films today could display such vices and virtues, what a wonderfully mortal art the masses could wallow in.",

            "content": "People have been reading different meanings into 'High Noon' ever since it came out, including the ever-popular analogies to 'McCarthyism', but more on that in a minute. The story is as simple as could be imagined, deceptively so, as there are layered undercurrents running all through it. And 'simple' is a good way to describe the main character, Marshal Will Kane. One might even say 'simple-minded.' He doesn't have much to say, he's not good at explaining himself, but he is dogged and courageous. The people of the small town where he has served for a long time are generally appreciative of the fact that many years past, Kane 'cleaned up' the town and made it safe for women to walk the streets, etc. But there are others, like the saloonkeeper and the hotel owner, who still harbor resentment and feel he drove away business when he got rid of the bad guys. Kane is no longer a young man and as it turns out, on the day he retires and gets married, he discovers the baddest bad guy of them all, Frank Miller, has been released from prison and is heading back to town on the noon train. Everyone urges Kane to take his bride and get out of town before Miller arrives. Some are genuinely concerned for his safety, others hope that with Kane gone, a deadly confrontation will be avoided. Kane starts to leave, then turns around and comes back. His conscience won't allow him to flee. He determines to face Miller no matter what anyone else thinks. He tries to recruit deputies but no one will stand with him. The townspeople convince themselves, in different ways, that Miller is no threat to them if Kane leaves. Even Kane's bride refuses to stay with him. When the final showdown arrives, it's just Kane against Miller and three of his gunmen. With a last-minute assist from his recalcitrant bride, Kane prevails, then throws his badge on the ground in disgust. The basic idea (which seems pretty clear to me) of 'High Noon' is that of a man willing to give his life to protect a town whose residents are convinced that they are safer by not fighting back against evil. Eventually, no matter each one's initial motivation, they come to the same conclusion: they must, in effect, capitulate to Frank Miller by refusing to help Will Kane. Now what on earth this has to do with McCarthyism, I cannot fathom. As I understand it, McCarthyism means smearing innocent people with untrue charges, blacklisting them and so forth. There is nothing of the sort in 'High Noon' and I frankly feel it is a silly comparison. But there is a curious modernity to much of what happens in the film, such as the moment in church when one of the 'leading citizens' stands up to defend Will Kane, offering a tribute of sorts to Kane's bravery, then suggests the town no longer needs his kind of help. The real message that comes across is that even the most well-meaning citizens in town have turned cowardly, and are no longer willing to fight to preserve and protect what they claim to cherish. They did once; it is suggested that all those years ago, the townspeople rose up against the hooligans, behind Marshal Kane. But they won't do it again. Gary Cooper brings a great deal of battered dignity to the role of Will Kane. He has very little dialogue; his facial expressions tell much of the story. He carries the air of a man who has been doing one thing for so long, he doesn't really know how to do anything else. He's not motivated by thoughts of heroism or rewards, but he would rather disagree with an entire town of people he knows, even his new wife, rather than shirk his duty. Grace Kelly plays his wife with great charm and beauty as always. There's quite a supporting cast in 'High Noon' as well, and it includes Lloyd Bridges, Lon Chaney Jr., Thomas Mitchell, and Lee Van Cleef.",

            "review_title": "Excellent movie despite the flaws",
            "content": "High Noon works because of its mythic story line. Will Kane is a man who must do the thing he must despite everyone who loves him and whom he loves aggressively trying to stop him from doing it. He is alone. He against difficult odds. He fully expects to die in his attempt, but he must continue with his mission. Often in the film characters are aware of the qualities that make Kane act as he does, but the characters can not put it into words. They essentially sum it up with a summation of \"If you don't know, I can't explain it to you.\" It has to be so because the qualities that make human beings do the truly difficult things in life are ineffable.The movie is not without flaws. The acting of the principals is terrible. Only Katy Turado as Helen Ramirez is at all believable. Gary Cooper is stilted, as always, and Grace Kelly is a pretty face. Despite the actors, the scenes and images are what carry the day. Who can forget the image of Will Kane alone on the street awaiting his doom? Or the view down the railroad tracks for the train that will bring destiny? Or the two women, one with a dark dress, dark skin and a dark past, and the other the very antithesis, riding past Kane on the street leaving him alone.Also a drawback is the constant refrain of the ballad that seems to run through Kane's mind as if he, at some level, knows that part of what he must do is to become one of the legends of the West. The use of the song is partly redeemed when we last hear \"Do not forsake me, O my darling,\" and we realize that it is his home that forsook him, not his bride after all.",

            "content": "I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid of about 10. That was about 1960. I remember that I was going to spend a couple of hours watching a western. I didn't think the film was going to be anything special but when I heard the opening theme song I knew I was in for something special. Even at age 10, I knew. I have seen it many times since.The movie is about an unwillingness of the townsfolk to get involved with upholding the law. It came down to the town marshal, a newly-married Will Cane, to stand up to four gunmen alone. There is supposedly a connection between the plot of the movie, and McCarthyism, which was going on at the time the movie was filmed. I did not know that at the time I first saw it and truth be told, I would not have thought of it since had I not read about it.The movie is not quite perfect. Many of the town's people implore the marshal to leave town while he has the chance; before all the gunmen get to town. He makes up an excuse why he can't, an excuse that really doesn't exactly hold up under the viewer's scrutiny. But the movie had to have a shootout, right? Anyway, the movie is probably in my top 25, certainly in my top 50. There are a couple of pre-1960 westerns that are higher on my list: Shane and My Darling Clementine. Post 1960 westerns such as Eastwood's the Unforgiven and The Outlaw Josey Wales are for me, in a different genre I'll call \"modern westerns\".",

But this movie has changed my outlook.Of course I am not sure if it is similar to a typical western, at 85 minutes it is short and runs nearly in real time and there is no usual posturing associated with spaghetti westerns. I would say it is more of an drama film than an action film. It is about human interactions about what we expect from other and from ourselves.I am also an ardent fan of Gary Cooper and he has done a fantastic job, as he has done in all of his movies I have seen.Recommended for all fans of Westerns and for those like me who don't like the Westerns as much also.",

            "content": "Trouble is coming on the noon train. And nobody seems to want to face it. Only one lone man will stand up for what is right. Everyone else seems much more interested in saving their own hides. This is the setup for a film in which the tension builds and builds as the clock ticks inexorably towards high noon.Our story takes place in a small Western town in the 1800s, in a time and place where everyone expects disputes to be settled with gun battles in the streets. Gary Cooper plays Marshal Will Kane who as we meet him is turning in his badge because he is marrying young pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler. The couple are leaving town and the former marshal will live out his life peacefully running a store with his beautiful young bride. How beautiful? Amy is played, in her first major film role, by one Grace Kelly. Yes, it's good to be Will Kane. But, just as the newlyweds prepare to depart, their happily ever afters are rudely interrupted with the news that ruthless criminal Frank Miller is due to arrive in town on the noon train. After being brought to justice by Kane, Miller had been sentenced to hang. But now he has for some reason been freed and he is coming back to town to take his revenge. Three members of his old gang are waiting for him at the train station. A deadly shootout in the streets seems inevitable. Kane has just over an hour before Miller arrives. What to do? Stand and fight? Or flee? Initially Kane chooses the get out of town approach but inevitably he turns back to face his destiny. He fears Miller would hunt him down but he obviously also feels a sense of duty, a responsibility to protect the innocent people of his quiet town. But when he returns to town Kane is in for a rude awakening. No one in the town is willing to stand and fight with him. As the townspeople continue to reject his pleas for help Kane comes to realize he will have to face Miller's gang alone. And everyone in town, Kane included, knows what that means. Kane's coffin is literally already being built. After years of service, after all he has done for the town, in the moment of truth Kane is abandoned and helplessly alone. It seems the \"good\" people of the town are quite willing to sacrifice him to save themselves.This is not your traditional Western. There's a lot of talk and, right up until the very end, very little action. It's a morality play. We know Kane is in the right. And so do the townspeople. But they're not interested in what is right, they're interested in self-preservation. When Kane first returns to the town he figures he'll have plenty of men standing by his side. But as the clock continues to tick, with the film more or less unfolding in real time, despair sets in as Kane realizes he is all but doomed. The tension becomes almost unbearable as we see this good man essentially be led to the slaughter.Cooper is magnificent in his portrayal of this heroic figure. From the joy of his wedding to his despair as noon approaches Kane goes through a wide range of emotions and Cooper captures that beautifully. There are a few moments where Kelly seems a touch unnatural, as if she's forcing things a bit, but her performance is mostly fine. While Kelly inevitably gets most of the attention Katy Jurado does notably fine work in portraying a woman who has her own connection to Kane. Other familiar faces including Lloyd Bridges and Thomas Mitchell also have important roles to play but it's obviously Cooper's film to carry and he is more than up to the task. As for his villainous foil, after so much buildup Frank Miller's ultimate arrival is a little anti-climactic. After hearing so much about him, when you finally see him it's a bit of a letdown. He's just a guy. A mean-looking guy to be sure but just a guy. And when the final showdown occurs it's all over rather quickly and it has a sense of inevitability to it. If you've been paying attention at all the film pretty clearly telegraphs who might have a role to play in deciding Kane's ultimate fate. But all in all it's a terrific, albeit simple, story which captivates throughout. High Noon may not be your typical Western but it's a classic one.",

Speakin' of murderin', the Marshall is at least a triple-murderer.

            "content": "When you see Lee Van Cleef get down off his horse and hear Dmitri Tiomkin's iconic score, you know something's about to go down. And it does, when soon-to-be-retired Sheriff of Hadleyville, New Mexico territory Will Kane marries his darling Quaker Amy Fowler, on the same day as Frank Miller, the outlaw he sent to hang, is heard to be returning on the noon train to settle his hash.For a Western, 'High Noon' is far from typical, relying on grimy saloons, hotel rooms and law offices to create atmosphere rather than the more celebrated wide-open landscapes of Howard Hawks' and John Ford's back catalogue. There are no chase scenes or cattle drives and the only action is reserved for the last ten minutes. Fred Zinneman, a director unused to cowboy pictures (this being his only one), makes deft use of low-angle views of clock faces ticking their way to oblivion in real-time \u2013another breakaway from tradition- to instill a real sense of desperation in the viewer. Towering crane shots also evoke the loneliness of Cooper's Kane as he walks around town trying to round up a posse to fight off Frank Miller.On the way he encounters old friends, young ones and some enemies who support Frank Miller's mission of vengeance but he continues undeterred until he realises that he must stand alone and fight. This is a timeless tale of the individual who fights the collective cowardice and evil in the world and succeeds. Not everybody turns their back on him, some are true to him but too old to fight, some seek adventure but are too young. When his own deputy Sheriff, his last shred of hope, walks out on him after fearfully realising he is Kane's only ally, (\"Go home to your kids, Herb\") Will writes his own 'suicide note' before heading out to the train station at high noon. It is a terrifying moment and the last use of a low-angle shot of a clock face Zinneman will use in the film.Cooper won an Oscar for his sweaty performance as the principled Will Kane, and deservedly so. Katy Jurado, Lon Chaney Jr. and Lloyd Bridges all excel as the supporting cast \u2013Jurado especially as Kane's former lover and saloon owner Helen Ramirez. Its Grace Kelly, who, as she did in 'To Catch a Thief', lets the film down with her fake boarding-school accent and inorganic style \u2013sometimes it's like she's awkwardly squeezing out the lines rather than saying them. For the most part, though, Zinneman directed his cast brilliantly and deserved the Oscar that went to the equally deserving George Stevens for 'A Place in the Sun', a film that dwells more in life's moral ambiguities than its certainties.Much of the appreciation the film has gained since its release was not so abundant when it first came out. 'High Noon' was criticized by conservative Hollywood folk John Wayne and Howard Hawks as \"un-American\" for its allegory of people in the industry not standing up for their colleagues as they were put out of work in the days of 'blacklisting', a process by which the House Un-American Activities Committee would fire supposed Communist-sympathizers for whatever 'liberal' leanings they could decrypt from their work \u2013this would in turn happen to the film's screenwriter Carl Foreman. It is now widely cherished as a great American film, about a man who stands up for the law and for himself when no-one else would \u2013something even Ronald Reagan admitted he could relate to, and Bill Clinton would claim it as his favourite film.When Cooper throws his 'tin star' in the dirt at the end you'll throw your hat off. This is a film that must be seen, as Kane might say, \"(You've) got to, that's the whole thing\".",

The shots of the clock ticking makes you acutely aware of time passing, and it feels like it moves almost 1-1 with real time. I loved the finale montage style shot before noon. There's elements here that work really well, and some that rubbed me wrong, a mixed bag for me.I'd go out and say none of the characters here are likeable. Cooper has too little dialog and background for the viewer to care about. He needed more than just ''he's the best sheriff in town'' in words, but we needed to see that in action. But actually we just get to see everyone leave his side for petty reasons. This would make more sense if the villain: Miller, had any redeemable qualities that would make him a alternative. But he's obviously the bad guy by the way he's shown on screen. In general the performances here are very flat, aside from the bartender in 2 scenes that adds some life to the mix.Music, this for me is a huge negative. The first time you hear the theme I was loving it. Second time, sure. Third time, fine.. 15th time...c'mon. I think in a way the dreary song that played everytime we saw Kane strut about made me dislike the movie more. I just wanted to get it over with. Which is not how I like it to be, especially this being a shorter movie than Westerns in general, I've had 2hour plus westerns feel a lot shorter than this like Red River and even Rio Bravo.The scenes with the 3 others from the Miller posse waiting at the depot were needlessly intertwined in the movie as well. We get multiple scenes of them being bored, just as bored as us. Lacking any real depth to the scene. One of them was drinking and other guy told him to quit it. We have more than one of those scenes, but what do they do with it? Literally nothing. Just objectively wasted scenes, there's no depth, nothing there to dissect.And the moment we all were waiting for, the arrival at High Noon. We get a shootout, it's alright for the most part. But that's kind of it, there's again no depth, no little something that Miller or Kane says. It might as well been a random bandit who walked into town. Unsatisfying and the solution...too easy.This is my first film with legendary Gary Cooper, I'll definitely want to see more of him but sadly this wasn't the best start.So High Noon was a mixed bag for me, I definitely want to rewatch it sometime again just to really solidify my thoughts. But for now it's just that, a mixed bag.",

            "content": "A super classic in more ways than one. The movie can be classified as a western thriller with a suspenseful story told in nearly real time; a useful tool to engage audiences. The movie shows several signs of having been meticulously and most skillfully crafted. It is bewildering that it was not awarded an award for best director. Most of the supporting actors were clearly directed to deliver their parts at high standards with the cameras obliging with appropriate close-ups. The director utilized angle shots and shading to deliver required effects. One is left with the impression that every actor was purposely allowed to demonstrate his or her full potential.Our hero (Gary Cooper) the town marshal has just retired and is preparing to leave town with his newlywed wife (Grace Kelly), a Quaker pacifist, to become a shopkeeper elsewhere. Not far out of town, he elects to turn back to face an ex-con (Ian MacDonald) and three cohorts (including Lee van Cleef) who are about to arrive in town to hunt him down. Nobody in town offers to help him including the deputy (Lloyd Bridges), the judge (Otto Kruger), a friend (Henry Morgan) and the entire church congregation. In fact some prepare to leave town including our hero's former mistress and hotel owner (Katy Jurado). In the end our hero is left to face the hunters alone. The climatic gunfight is seven minutes long as the fighters battle around about the town. As the gunfight starts, our hero's wife, who was one of those who initially decided to skip town, gets off the train that was to take her away from it all and runs back into town concerned about her husband. Our hero kills two of the gang, his wife shoots a third from behind and in the final scene of the gunfight, she claws at the gang's leaders face allowing her husband, who was about to surrender, an opening to shoot and kill the last bad man. The last scene of the film shows the marshal throwing his star in the dirt at the feet of the cowardly townsfolk who abandoned him, climbing into his buggy and driving off with his wife. The marshal was the hero of the movie and did \"...what a man must do\", but the biggest departure from our typical western gunfights is the wife who stood by her man and in doing so, was instrumental in turning the tide against the bad guys.The opening titles of the movie were accompanied by a catchy ballad, Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin', sung by country singer Tex Ritter. The ballad, which became a chart hit, foretells the lead up to the story of the film about to unfold.High Noon was subject to decades of movie-bashing by Hollywood rightwingers because it was conceived by Carl Foreman, a communist in the McCarthy era. The bashers, who included John Wayne, considered the abandonment of the hero by the townsfolk an allegory to Hollywood workers abandoning their colleagues who were caught in the communist witch hunt web. It was detestable, the bashers argued, that the hero would go around town begging support and to be saved in the end by a woman. It appears, however, that Foreman had the last laugh. High Noon rose quickly to become a superclassic rising high over thousands of Hollywood productions before and since.",

And just as Will was retiring, married to his new wife, Amy (Grace Kelly), and it was not until it was a little more than a hour in is when he realizes he has no choice but to confront Frank and his gang all by himself. As he he tries to seek reinforcements, but with no success.A nice little Western film influenced countless of films including \"Dirty Harry\"( throwing away the badge scene), \"Bullitt\" and \"The Gauntlet\" to name a few in which countless odds including time are against the central protagonist. Taken from a short story \"The Tin Star\" from a magazine a sheriff's duty to it's town who may or may not stand behind him when a train arriving at noon. Other resemblences is \"Abilene Town\" which was also about a sheriff and his duty to his town released 7 years prior to this one! Sadly, one of the writers of \"High Noon\" by the name of Carl Foreman was blacklisted as an communist sympathizer but was then reinstated in October 1997 along with other victims for he died in 1984. It had been said that Gary Cooper, was beginning to lose his Western status until this film came out! I love the tension and the dilemma's this film displayed, except that the final gun fight scenes could've been staged better.

For instance the whole town turning their back on Will Kane is similar to the whole city officials turning there back to Harry.

From a technical aspect, it's nearly perfect, but I don't find it very entertaining. 'High Noon' won an Oscar for best editing, which was well deserved as the editing was by the books. However, in my personal opinion, it had too much structure and no style. I like films like 'Lock, Stock, & 2 Smoking Barrels' or 'Magnolia' because they are a little more eccentric with the way the film progresses, not just with each shot but even the plot overall. 'High Noon' is very straightforward and keeps a steady pace, never seeming to speed up or slow down. This makes sense seeing as the film is in real time, but with so few actions this gets tedious very quickly. Again, I will acknowledge that 'High Noon' is very well done. It might be my disinterest in Westerns, or that I like character studies and intertwining stories and than a straightforward plot, but 'High Noon' just isn't to my taste. The character development is at a bare minimum and the acting is very stale.The acting is what reminds me so much of Hitchcock in that the characters follow the story ever so precisely that they don't stand out on their own. Some people prefer that, I don't.From a critical view, I'd give it an 8 or 9/10, but from a personal point of view, I didn't find it very entertaining. 5/10.",

Four killers are coming to town to kill Cain, and the only way to deal with them is to meet them in the streets.  As Cain tries to raise a posse, the town that he protected slowly shrinks away and hides from him. Former friends turn their backs on him and the sense of fear and lonelieness is conveyed in the eyes of the great Gary Cooper.  You can see his fear slowly wash over him as he watches the town state their reasons for not helping.  The reasons run from cowardice to political reasons but in the end, Cain is left alone.  As the clock strikes noon, we see how alone Cain is.  A crane shot starts on him and pulls up to reveal a town that has turned its back on him.  Knowing what he has to do, Cain marches down the street to face the four killers.  Gary Cooper won a well deserved Oscar for his performance.  He knows he has to do the right thing and he knows he has to do it alone. Watching his face in the church scene is almost heartbreaking.   Done a very small budget, and going against the grain of a traditional westerns, High Noon stands the test of time.

Zinneman really manages to keep the tension cranked all the way up with simple little devices like a clock in the background, effective music, and excellent close-ups of Cooper's face (which is at once expressive and subtle).

The film can be understood as such a parable, or simply enjoyed as an intensely thrilling Western (I like to do both), but the film MUST be seen.\nThis movie is by far one of the best Westerns ever made, but beyond that, it is a great drama and a thriller.

            "content": "Lonesome cowboy is sitting on the rock and smoking (film debut of Lee Van Cleef). It looks like the beginning of a regular western movie. However, soon we realize that this cowboy is no hero and that the whole story is an allegory for blacklisting during the McCarthyism era. Directed by F. Zinnemann, High Noon is a drama that has many elements of a western movie (the whole Wild West setting) and its story tells us about a lonesome marshal (Gary Cooper) whose friends turned their backs on him when troubles arose. The main stars of the movie are G. Cooper, G. Kelly and T. Mitchell.After iconic first shots that were mentioned above, camera jumps to the wedding of the town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) and his fianc\u00e9e Amy Fowler (the magnificent Grace Kelly). Kane reluctantly hands back his badge and prepares to set off but before leaving, the telegram comes and we learn that vicious criminal Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is coming back to town on the noon train. Town residents urge Kane to leave without any further delay. He and his wife set off but soon he changes his mind and decides to come back (\"I've never run from anybody before\"). Kane believes that Miller will be easily handled with the help of town residents. However, his hopes are too high and from his comeback, the story goes darker and darker. Firstly, his bride leaves him, then his old friend judge (Otto Kruger) and soon the whole town turns back on him and leaves him alone.While the whole story of the film is quite simple, the success of it lies in the character of Will Kane. He is a kind of man that Tony Soprano (the main character of The Sopranos) would call \"strong, silent type\". During the whole movie, Kane has to face a lot of mockery, humiliation and indifference from the town residents. Even so, he does not say a one negative word to any of them, he does not whine either. His closest friends betray him and all he does is keep going on to searching for people who could help. However, his face says more than thousands of words and that is a remarkable Cooper's merit. He manages to act so well that we can feel the whole pain and misery of marshal who has been betrayed by his own friends (the scene with Sam's wife (Eve McVeagh) deserves special mention). Moreover, it is neither Frank Miller nor his accomplices who stand as a contrast to a brave and careful Kane. It is his own town. Town residents are shown as a bunch of regrettable cowards. They are ready to bow to a new authority if there only will be a need.Another thing that makes this movie so unforgettable is its haunting mood and F. Zinnemann should get a lot of credit for it. The tension increases throughout the whole movie and it is achieved by many close-ups to clocks (there even is a rumor that the movie can be viewed in real time). Also, the film's most famous, memorable shot \u2013 a dramatic high-crane shot shows how lonely and abandoned Cooper's character is. Last but not least, High Noon theme song \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh, My Darling\" should not be forgotten either. Performed by Tex Ritter, it sums up the whole movie and sticks in the memory of every viewer. By the way, this song was the first Oscar-winning song from a non-musical film.To sum up, High Noon is a simple but strong and very moving drama that makes viewers think about the cowardice and indifference of people and in the end, we understand that the words of former marshal (\"People gotta talk themselves into law and order before they do anything about it. Maybe because down deep they don't care. They just don't care.\") perfectly sums up the whole movie. However, there is hope but it lies in individuals like Will Kane.2011-05-29",

Marshal Will Kane finds out on his wedding day that one of the men he put in prison is returning to town with his gang to seek their revenge. In spite of this new information, Marshal stands strong and independent, like a true western man ready to retaliate, if necessary. The Marshal obviously had his life on the line; however it was extremely odd that no townsmen would help him or even stick up for him. Nevertheless, the townspeople tried to get him to leave instead. Through all of this, Marshal stays to face Miller and protect the townspeople, who are so dreadfully afraid of Miller. Although the plot line was extremely clich\u00e9 for a western, the fact that the movie claimed all popular genres was definitely a plus, such as comedy (somewhat), suspense, and even romance. Grace Kelly, who played Amy Fowler Kane, Marshal Kane's wife, certainly add that softness (romance) to the movie. She was that girl in every movie, all the guys drool over.Throughout the entire movie, the most interesting character was Ms. Ramirez. She claimed her role as an actor and made it her own. She captured my eye with her strong personality bursting through the screen, almost as if no effort was placed or even had to be developed to capture this characters true emotions. One scene that fascinated me the most was when Ms. Ramirez told Miss Kane that she should be helping her husband and fighting with him, instead of running off without him. This scene stood out because it presented Ms. Ramirez true character.I would recommend this movie to anyone, who likes westerns and who loves romance and action movies with a passion, if not, don't watch it.",

He's got two of the baddest bad guys in film history in his gang namely Lee Van Cleef and Robert J. Wilke. So when Frank Miller finally shows up at the end of the film who do you suppose plays Frank Miller...? Ian MacDonald that's who! Now this raises a few questions in my mind. Who the hell is Ian MacDonald? Why would the director want to cast an unknown actor in this pivotal role?! This guy is big and pock-marked but he is surely no match for the iconic Gary Cooper. He doesn't display the menace that the part requires. This ruined the movie for me. Frank Miller should have been played by a classic heavy closer to Gary Cooper in stature. Jack Palance or somebody like him. Frank Miller is a psychopathic killer and it's a big letdown to see this unknown actor be the one we've all been waiting to see at the end.That's all I have to say about it.",

Jack Elam provides a small dose of comic relief near the film's end. He's the town drunk and perhaps the model for Otis of Mayberry. :-)3. On my most serious note, I think not even mention has been given to the parallel lives/circumstances of the Marshall & his Deputy. Afterall, if Bridges stood up with Cooper there would be no film. Bridges character is even more interesting than Cooper's because he keeps changing and growing more paranoid. He's got looks, strength and Kathy Jurado yet they all fail him and he fails everybody else. Cooper/Kane is the archetype hero who knows and does his duty with minimal doubt considering the circumstances.Yes I really love this film and particularly Kane.

A retiring Marshall marries his Quaker wife with the blessings of his community. A new life awaits them both in another town where they can run a store and raise a family. Just as they are preparing to depart, word arrives that a vicious outlaw the Marshall once sent to prison has been released and is soon to arrive on the noon train. Now his gang, a trio of cohorts, are awaiting him. The Marshall and his wife bid the townspeople farewell, but he doesn't get far before the pangs of conscience cause him to turn around and head back to town.Even as Will Kane rode off in his buckboard with his new bride, I experienced the sense that I was watching the stuff of myth and legend. Once again, this is a simple story with a fable like quality, fleshed out in overtones of irony and paradox. Its humble themes unravel like something akin to a zen koan of The Old West. This is a tale of RETURN AND VENGEANCE subtly reworked from the point of view and perspective of the villain. It is indeed, as it was criticized to be in the Soviet Union, \"a glorification of the individual\" and yet almost a left-handed critique of it as well. It posits important questions that have yet to be completely resolved in the national destiny of this country. What are the responsibilities of the individual to the community? What are the responsibilities of the community to the individual? How best might these responsibilities be met and served? These are questions of high moment as a little western town seeks to raise itself out of the swaggering high stakes gamblers ethos of its saloon and walk up bordello, to a state of law that transitions itself out of the jungle and into a fit place in civilization.This Old West shoot-em-up is filled with paradoxes, as the outgoing Marshall, stoically presented and portrayed by Gary Cooper to Oscar winning effect, anxiously strides the empty streets of his town doing what a man's got to do. The themes of this story have been revisited and retreated in various ways over the decades. Sean Connery took his turn adopting the High Noon stance with his sci-fi flim OUTLAND (1981), and Kevin Costner paired with Robert Duvall in OPEN RANGE (2003), where that community of town people redeemed themselves by helping out in the last moments. There was also an episode of THE RIFLEMAN (1958-1963) where the titular hero seeks help from various members of the community only to be initially rejected, but in the end is joined by them in the shootout. While exciting and entertaining, none of these later iterations of the theme of HIGH NOON equal or surpass the moral resonance of the original. This film, in its own peculiar way, was both the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.After this, came both the homages and deconstructions of the mythos of The Old West. Sergio Leone was among the frontrunners, serving up Westerns that became increasingly stylized while more and more morally vacuous. There was Dennis Hopper's THE LAST MOVIE (1971), which he intended to be the death knell of the Western, but due to production troubles at the time, is little commented upon these days. The word is it is growing to the status of a cult classic in these modern times. But after Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (1969) and Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN (1992), where the Western genre goes in the future is as always open to speculation.However, if you a looking for a swan song to the Western, for my money, this is it. Shot in real time and weighing in at eighty-five minutes, heroes in Westerns are never again seen to be this virtuous or the differences between the law of the jungle and the law of civilization as eloquently framed in cinematic terms. When Marshall Will Kane stands alone deserted in the middle of a community he was certain would stand by him for all his years of service, he becomes a symbol of something that is vitally needed and yet as well a figure of obsolescence. The townspeople thirst for something more than 'his kind of law' and the dead bodies it brings with it. Even upon first viewing, it was gut wrenching to see Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler sacrifice her stance on pacifism to place a higher value on her marriage and strike a blow for that.Drawing parallels between this film and the Hollywood Blacklist era, the second Red Scare and the Korean War is the easy way out to my mind. This work of cinema, more than ably directed by Fred Zinnemann, is a meditation on the paradox of Peace and Freedom, and in this wise, is about something more than it perhaps intended to be. According to this Hollywood Western Fable, Peace and Freedom are put on auction and marched to the chopping block the second you are unwilling to defend and fight for these values and when necessary, even sacrifice for them and the security they require. The ensemble cast, which includes Lloyd Bridges, Thomas Mitchell, Katy Juardo, Otto Kruger, Lon Chaney and Harry Morgan among others, prove to be all noteworthy actors in their own right and create a spirit of cooperation that brings the message of the story singing home to the music of Dmitri Tiomkin while riding the lyrics of Tex Ritter. It is a shame that producer Staney Kramer caught heat for this version of Western Justice and that screenwriter Carl Foreman was called before the House of Un-American Activities Committee to explain himself. But this story, concerning as it does the triumph of the individual over collectivism and at the same time the aspiration of the community to achieve peace and security with as little or no recourse to violence as possible, aided by the stirring cinematography of Floyd Crosby and the suspenseful editing of Elmo Williams and Harry W. Garstad, still avoids the easy answers and pat categorizations of prior Horse Operas and walks its way into renown because of this very fact.",

Fred Zinemann handles the times and events in a superb way and so interest remains high all along. Gary Cooper gives a strong performance as the frightened lawman, supported brilliantly by the rest of the cast (mainly Kathy Jurado and Thomas Mitchell.

Basically, a marshal has to face off against a criminal returning to town to kill him, and tries to round up townsfolk to help him. The camerawork, acting, scenery, and dialogue are all good, but the real strengths of this movie are in its characters and plot. Each of the townsfolk that the marshal goes to clearly has their reasons for turning him down (some of which are sympathetic, some aren't), and each person's decision not to help feels real, and slowly builds to this feeling that no one is coming. The plot is simple (just a guy going around asking for help), but breaks the standard formula of the time by having the community refuse to rise to the occasion. The fact that Kane doesn't think he can face the outlaws alone, then actually has to instead of the town showing up to help, creates an ending that is almost tragic. The hero wins, and \"rides off into the sunset with his girl\", but the town has failed him, and there's a sense of disillusionment in the community. A more complex movie than I thought going in, and one I'd love to watch again.",

            "content": "This is a shortened review. For my full length reviews, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/High Noon, the 1952 classic from director Fred Zinnemann and writer Carl Foreman, is a unique film in many ways, from the themes depicted to the film-making style used.Gary Cooper plays Hadleyville Marshal Will Kane, who's just wed the beautiful pacifist Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and is turning in his badge, so they can leave town and start a new life together. Kane learns that Frank Miller - a man Kane captured and sent to be hanged - has been released from prison and is on his way, along with his gang of cohorts, back to Hadleyville to seek revenge on the marshal. Kane has two options - stay and fight Miller and his gang or leave town as planned. Of course, he chooses to stay and stand up against the outlaws. Fowler is upset, with good cause, and threatens to leave with or without him, but Kane doesn't change his mind. He can't bear the thought of Miller running amok through Hadleyville. For most of the film, Kane proceeds to look for help from the townspeople, hoping to deputize as many as possible in order to fight off Miller when the time comes. He runs into problems, though, as most of the people aren't interested in helping him, for various reasons.High Noon plays out almost in real time. This film-making choice is interesting and effective as it results in the tension and suspense being ratcheted up each time Kane glances at a clock or at his pocket watch. The audience knows that something terrible is going to happen when the train comes in and we get to experience the lapse of time right alongside Kane. There's not a lot of traditional action in High Noon, or at least certainly nowhere near as much as most westerns. When it comes, though, the action is handled extremely well. What really intrigued me, though, was the psychological action that fills most of the film. As I said before, Kane spends most of the time speaking with people, trying to get them to join him. Each conversation is like a mental brawl, with Kane fighting for his life. It's excellent stuff, thanks to the writing and performances. Cooper, who won the Best Actor Academy Award for the role, is simply magnificent. His tired and weathered face shows a lifetime of hard work and worry - you can tell just by looking at him that he's paid his dues and deserves some comfort in life, even if he's reticent to actually retire. Cooper perfectly nails not only the rough and tumble nature of a lawman in the Old West, but also the sweet and civilized side of Kane - the side that wants to make and keep his new bride happy.While Cooper dominates nearly the entire film, he's surrounded by a stellar supporting cast. Grace Kelly may be the most beautiful woman to ever grace the silver screen, but she was also a talented actress. High Noon was one of her very first film roles and she plays the part with elegance and just the right mixture of emotion and iron will. Fowler isn't one to mess around - she knows what she wants and won't settle for any less - and yet Kelly allows you to see the scared, young woman hiding just under the surface. The last major supporting player is Katy Jurado, who plays Helen Ramirez, a woman who used to be romantically linked to Miller and then Kane, but is now involved with Pell. She's a very interesting character and I can't imagine there were many like her in the early 1950's. Jurado's performance is full of smoldering passion and barely hidden subtext - she's promiscuous, but not ashamed of her past, and is even able to help the slightly repressed Fowler in her time of need.The rest of the cast is filled out with some notable names in some very small parts. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney Jr., Harry Morgan, Otto Kruger, and Lee Van Cleef (in his film debut) all significantly add to the film's appeal, even though they don't have a lot of screen time. The script by Foreman is tight and well written. There doesn't seem to be a wasted bit of dialogue, as each line either moves the story forward or reveals something important about the characters. It's Screen writing 101 type stuff, but it's amazing how much time most scripts waste. I fully believe that High Noon should be held up as one of the best scripts for young writers to learn from. Right up there with Chinatown, Casablanca, Rocky, and Tootsie - scripts that are all taught at colleges and workshops around the country.I have very few problems with the film, but one major component really rubs me the wrong way. High Noon's score and soundtrack (featuring the same song repeated throughout) was just awful. I thought the score was heavy handed and obvious - underscoring moments that didn't need to be highlighted - and the song (\"High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin')\" performed by Tex Ritter) was silly, corny, and way too overused. It played in its entirety during the opening credits, but then snippets of it played repeatedly and it even closed out the film, slightly marring one of my favorite film endings. My reaction to the song went from mild annoyance to disgust by the time the film concluded. Of course, this could just be a personal preference situation since the score and song both won Academy Awards, so quite a few people must have loved it. I can't understand why, but it happened.Luckily, the music is the only sizable blemish on an otherwise stellar film and I agree with many of the accolades that High Noon has received since its debut.",

            "content": "HIGH NOON is often regarded as one of the best Westerns, if not one of the greatest films, ever made. Based off the short story \"The Tin Star\" by John W. Cunningham, HIGH NOON tells the story of sheriff Will Kane (Gary Cooper), who is getting married to Amy (Grace Kelly), a Quaker, and stepping down. But a dark cloud comes over this happy occasion: Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a man Kane sent to prison, is getting out and will be arriving in town on the noon train. It is 10:35 AM at the moment and the movie unfolds in an approximation of real time. Waiting at the train station are Miller's boys, they all have one objective: kill Kane.At first, Kane and Amy are going to just leave, but Kane feels that he owes the town one last defense. This goes against the pacifistic beliefs of Amy, who simply wants to leave town. Back in the town of Hadleyville, the citizens are divided over what should be Kane's course of action: some think Kane should just leave and there won't be any trouble. Others want to see Kane gunned down because he cleaned up the town and they all lost money from when Miller ran things. One of those who wants Kane to leave is his former deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), although not for any altruistic reason. Pell wants the sheriff's job and feels that it will impress his woman, Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado). Helen has had romantic dealings with both Kane and Miller and, from the looks of things, is constantly comparing Pell to these two men. This leads to a big fight between Pell and Kane and further isolates Kane from the situation.Kane tries to get help from the townspeople, but feel that it isn't exactly their problem anymore since Kane has resigned. As the time runs down and no one will stand with him, Kane is shown to be more human as the film progresses. This is also shown in one of the best shots in cinema history as Kane is shown alone on the streets of the town. The climactic shootout is a real nail-biter and a departure from the conventional way gunfights had been shown in Westerns up until then. Despite being deserted by the townspeople, Kane receives some help from a very unlikely source, which I feel heightens the situation even more. The movie's final image is now iconic.One might wonder why John Wayne didn't play a part like this. He had been approached, but thought that HIGH NOON didn't properly portray the true spirit of the Old West. He would later lament that he wished he could get a part like Kane when he presented Cooper with his second Best Actor Oscar. The film also won Oscars for its film editing, musical score and song \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh, My Darlin'\". Do not forsake this classic.",

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat almost the whole time when I first saw it.  My dad told me he saw it when it originally came out in the theaters, and being a young teenager he went back and watched it again a couple of times.  Its great the way this movie builds.  The first scene (after the musical score and credits) with the ringing of the church bells leads one to think that the movie may be a little hum-drum but not for long.  As any good movie should, it quickly captures the viewer's intense interest soon into the story.I'm not really a Gary Cooper fan but in this movie he was great.   One reason that this movie is so good and which distinguishes it from other westerns is that the hero (Will Kane) is portrayed very human.  He's a man scared to death (and it shows) but he does what he believes he has to do anyway.  Gary Cooper was quite suited for the role.   I don't believe other famous western actors could have portrayed the human side as well (maybe except for Jimmy Stewart).  The viewer is almost put into Will Kane's shoes and we can feel his sense of disappointment and fear as the movie progresses.This movie really makes use of some powerful scenes.  The railroad track that we are from time to time able to stare down, wondering what is going to happen when the train comes.   The clocks, which seem to get larger as the movie goes on and that we pay closer and closer attention to.  And the unforgettable scene of Will Kane standing alone in the street of what looks like a deserted town.  Director Fred Zinnemann knew what he was doing.  I believe also that the movie was correctly filmed in black and white as opposed to color.I really like the musical score and the singing by Tex Ritter.

Will is scared to death to go up against these killers, but walks lonely around the streets, holding up his back. You feel sorry for the guy, we never get to know the history, but for some reason, many of the townsfolk actually cheers for the villain here. And I actually LIKE that we don't know the backstory.

It's a long way to a short shootup, and will alienate many. Unlike many movies at the time, it was shot in black & white, and looks rather grim.

But there are also exceptionally drawn characters that provide credible rationales for being what they are in the frontier.\nCooper's growing dejection and revulsion towards the townsfolk is finely sketched.\nThe shoot-out sequence that runs for only 11 minutes or so towards the end, is fairly balanced and devoid of stylized violence that we are so accustomed to see in westerns.\nWith many things going for it, the movie is a must watch, for exhibiting reserve in this genre.",

I don't need to list them all --any film-literate person knows what they are. High up on th list has to be High Noon. The action in the movie is fast-paced abd direct, but it is only a vehicle for the exploration of the moral and psychological dilemmas faced by almost all the characters --Will Kane, of course, and Amy Fowler, his bride, but also Harvey Pell, the deputy; Helen Ramirez; Martin Howe (the old sheriff), and all the townspeople. Everyone has choices to make, and the real power of the film lies in the relentless pressure that crushes all of them --Kane included-- and forces them all to face their own failings. There is very little that is admirable in these people, but there is much that is real.This is one of the first westerns to look at morality in shades of grey; perhaps not by coincidence, the black-and-white cinematography reinforces that judgment by muting the screen into murky greys, only occasionally split by shafts of light or dark.The storyline is familiar and even, by now, trite: A man faces evil or danger, tries to rally others to his cause, fails, and then faces the evil alone. I can't count how many movies or TV programs in the last fifty years have used that same general theme. But in High Noon, the audience is allowed to see the real danger, the real evil: Not the bad guys coming in on the noon train, but the weakness and fear and selfishness that lives in all our hearts.If you've seen the movie, you'll understand.

He is a real role-model and has a great personality. His wife is VERY beautiful, charming and, in the end, totally loyal.What I really loved about this film was the \"time-thing\". One hour movie = one hour story. That made the movie very thrilling. The combination of the great music, the perfect acting, the \"time-thing\" and the superb cinematography make this movie one of my all-time favorites.Thanks for this GREAT movie. If you like western-movies PLEASE watch this. You will enjoy!",

It does not contain such expected western archetypes as chases, violence, action, and picture postcard scenery. Rather, it presented emotional and moralistic dialogue throughout most of the film. Only in the last few minutes were there action scenes, which were very well done, supported by some great soundtrack. The main thing here is the story itself, the idea of a man being betrayed by all of the town's \"loyal\" people - all of them support him, but none of them wants to put his neck on the line and help him. The script is brilliant and Gary Cooper's acting really stands out. It's not emotional, yet it's his signature strong yet somehow magically restrained. All the supporting actors did a very good job as well, although I felt Grace Kelly's character lacked depth (well at least she was deadly beautiful..). This isn't your usual western as I previously stated - it's a standout film in cinema history, and it's one of the first films which starred the \"lone hero against everyone else\" theme. I'd say it was tremendously done, and it's a true classic.",

Not only does the suspense, and the characters, hold the test of time as Kane prepares for his showdown against Miller and his cronies; High Noon is a fascinating tale of human nature as we see a man, who made the town safe enough to grow, walk from one corner to the next unable to find help. It says something about a film when the term \"High Noon\" remains part of our vocabulary over fifty years later.Marshal Will Kane marries and retires. But just before the couple ride off, a telegram hits the town that Frank Miller is coming back for vengeance on Will after serving a minor sentence for murder. Feeling like he has to do something to save the town, Kane returns only to find everyone wants no part of it, each with their own reasons.High Noon has some of the best of everything that film-making has to offer. An exceptional script, an excellent cast. When Will tells Harvey he's tired of being shoved around, you can really feel his frustration. And there's no more comedic cruelty in film when you see the only people who offer to help Will. An excellent climax to a well built film, High Noon is a must for everyone who enjoys cinema.",

The leader of the gang is due to arrive on the noon train, hence the title of the film. The story unfolds in real time and this adds extra tension to the developments as Coop waits for the showdown. Those who Kane had expected to give him support, gradually desert him and he is left to face the gang alone. Kane's wife(Grace Kelly), although totally opposed to violence, saves him by shooting one of the gang(stalwart bad guy Bob Wilke)during the shootout.

            "content": "Fred Zinneman's \"High Noon\" is perhaps the most serious, multi-layered adult western film ever made. It is a movie void of the startling beauty and magnificence of the old west, an intense melodrama about inner turmoil, personal infliction, the confrontation of a man's own fear and the ultimate reassertion that right must triumph over might in order for law and order to prevail. It stars Gary Cooper as Marshall Will Kane. On the day of his wedding to Quaker, Amy Fowler, Will learns that the three desperadoes he sentenced to prison have been released and are returning to his town, not only to reclaim their territory but to assassinate him. The town - well intentioned but scared stiff - urge Will to forsake his duties and disappear into the night. But Will's old flame and resident madam, Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado) knows that his conviction and honor are too great to avoid the impending doom. The resulting showdown is as epic and startling as anything in a John Ford western \u0096 yet told from such a subdued and sublimely critical vantage that it's really no wonder why \"High Noon\" has become such an enduring classic.THE TRANSFER: The previously released print from Artisan was in better shape that the reissued collector's edition. This \u0096 for lack of a better explanation, is a curiosity. The real problem with the reissue is in its digital anomalies. Edge enhancement, pixelization, shimmering of fine details and aliasing are glaringly obvious and distracting on the reissue, while only a minor distraction on the earlier DVD. The gray scale on both is very nicely balanced with solid blacks, good contrast levels and a considerable lack of film grain present. Fine details are nicely realized. The audio has been re-channeled to faux stereo but betrays its origins.EXTRAS: There's a comprehensive documentary on the making of the film on both versions of this film. The collector's edition also includes an audio commentary and some junket material.BOTTOM LINE: Because the print quality of the film is so flawed, I recommend that the customer seek out the original DVD version \u0096 still readily available \u0096 instead of the collector's edition. What you lack in extras you more than make up for in image quality.",

            "content": "High Noon is a monument to the collapse of modern day society. This film exemplifies the cowardice we often experience today; the people who so often support a man turn on him in his hour of need. Throughout the film we see how the main character, Marshal Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper), is rejected by his peers. Kane was expecting the worst when a criminal is expected in town and he pleads with the town folk for help but all they do is say how sorry they are and turn him away. This is exactly what happens in today's society; whether it's a child lost in the supermarket or an elderly man crossing the road, we look, recognize an opportunity to help but are consumed with timidity that we do nothing.Although the plot line was underwhelming, it demanded the audience's attention. Basically, the main character is confronted with his past and is denied any assistance from his peers but becomes the hero in the end. The simple plot is made exponentially more exciting by incorporating guns and violence, who doesn't love guns and violence? Although I am not too fond of pointless violence in movies, the scenes that involved fighting were completely necessary and improved the overall quality of the movie. The entire movie took place in real time which was also really nice touch and added a depth to the story line.Now for the characters, Gary Cooper did a great job portraying the lonesome law enforcer with a past that haunts him and the drive to always be the hero. His wife, Amy (played by Grace Kelly), on the other hand was not quite as charming. To start, she always had the sort of innocent voice, as if she were a child with no idea as to what to do, she appeared clueless. As for the rest of the characters such as Helen Ramirez (played by Katy Jurado) and Frank Miller (played by Ian McDonald), their characters fit very well into the overall plot.The overall experience was very good, the plot worked well with the characters and made for a captivating.",

And here the Sheriff won because his wife took deadly aim.I never got this to be a movie about McCarthyism, even though its principals were all caught up in McCarthyism. It is a great story-line even without that political element and that political element adds not a bit to the story.The film's time span is not really synched in real time. I started watching on TV (thanks to PBS) at 8 PM and Noon in the film occurred at about 9:05; as one of the trivia commenters stated, even thought the film starts at 10:35 AM, you would have to start watching at 10:50 for Noon to occur in the film and in real time.While \"High Noon\" stands the test of time, I'm not willing to call it a great movie. \"Unforgiven\" or \"The Shootist\" seem to be in that quality of great. Why is it not a great movie? Perhaps it is too simplistic: good vs. evil; good guy vs. evil guys. Too easy and too predictable.

His acting is very simple minus any dramatics but still the effect is so powerful. The movie itself is very simple but the message is so powerful. The selfishness and the nobleness in human nature are very sensitively pitted against each other. How the rank cowardice of human beings leaves a bitter taste in the hearts and minds of high minded people is very beautifully shown. Ultimately, the good people are overcome with disgust and throw in the towel. ( The last scene where Gary Cooper drops his tin star ). How many times have we witnessed this in real life ? Watching this movie one can easily figure out how tyrannies are made in this world. In my opinion this movie is noteworthy for its effects on the art of movie making itself. According to me Kurosawa's classic \"The seven Samurai \" is deeply influenced by this movie. This movie triggered a spate of movies all over the world whose plots pit cowardice against tyranny and how a few brave men come to the rescue of the not so innocent victims. Though, the negative message in 'High Noon' may not be shared by all of these movies but you can see very clearly the influence. In that context this movie is an instructive lesson in simple movie making with a powerful message. Thus the message in this movie cuts across various cultures and climes and yet retains its power.One last line for the song: the background song 'Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' elevates the thrilling effect of this movie.

I was thinking of a thousand other actors who would have chewed the scenery. the same with the other characters, who look like they are just phoning in their lines,reducing what are actually genuinely interesting characters into plain cardboard stereotypes. incompetent direction:don't get me wrong, its not that I stumbled upon this movie, completely unaware of the prestige both the movie and its cast enjoy. but, did not work for me. did not work for me at all. except for one stirring scene, where the impending doom is writ large on all the characters'faces as they hear the whistle blow; the rest is a simple out and out amateurish dramatization of the script, bereft of any sign of creativity or the directors touch.

            "content": "In my opinion, the best Westerns are the ones that can have a simple, straightforward plot (in this case, a sheriff left alone as a vengeful criminal seeks to kill him) but subverts it with great character work, a deeper sense of morality and fantastic direction. This is undoubtedly the case for High Noon, which, despite having a rather short runtime, has still been able to establish itself as one of the best entries in its genre.Firstly, it is only ironic that the production process of this movie was blemished by allegations of communism during the Red Scare, while the the film was criticized in the Soviet Union as \"glorification of the individual\".Kane is effectively a law-committed individual whose loyalty is challenged when he engages in a a noble fight for justice and freedom.The cowardice of the entire town is striking, as Kane is left alone in his enterprise. And this is what makes him such a quintessential hero, because he is willing to stand up for what is right, even when he is solitary, risking his life and marriage in the process.As one reviewer put it, it's simply a man \"who does not to run away\", although being explicitly asked to do so several times. He wants to defend his town against an oppressive and terrorizing force.Taking into account that that particular threat does not appear until the final minutes, the common interpretation of the allegorical meaning behind it is completely legitimate.The odd-defying, spectacular and visceral climactic shootout is a satisfactory conclusion to the story.The iconic and fantastically done sequence, however, should not be dismissed as mere, meaningless exchange of bullets.The action, so to speak, is in fact an extension of the characters singularity. In fact, it's about a man left alone who heroically fights to preserve his town he cares a lot about. In a shocking moment, his pacifist Quaker wife shoots an henchman, an act which diametrically opposes her religious beliefs, which was her defining characteristic throughout the film, showing the deep affection she has for the Marshall.As the production history shows, the main part could have gone to John Wayne, Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston or even Marlon Brando. All great stars. But Gary Coopers silent and strong acting style carries the movie. His Oscar was well-deserved.The delightful and lovely Grace Kelly, while not giving an outstanding and particular memorable performance, also makes an appearance as the Marshals wife.Additionally, Lee Van Cleef, a later star in Spaghetti Westerns, also makes an appearance, although a minor one.Furthermore, the fact that the plot progresses in real times heightens the intensity, as do the ingenious shots featuring clocks, continuously remembering the viewer and our characters of the looming threat.Moreover, the score of the movie fits perfectly into it, the tune of the famous \"Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling\" still echoing in one's mind long after credits.To cut a long story short, if you want to see a qualitative, thoughtful, suspenseful and substantial Western with marvelous music, then this is the perfect film for that. Truly a masterpiece of its genre.Fun fact: This is Ronald Reagans favorite movie.",

High noon separates itself from other western movies by the well thought out plot and the astounding acting. The main character, Will Kane was a marshal in Hadleyville who just turned in his badge. He just got married and was about to leave town with his new bride, Amy, until he finds out that Frank Miller is coming to town. Miller was a criminal that Kane sent to jail and Miller is desperate to get his revenge. To makes matter worse, Amy decided to leave town with or without Kane. Kane is torn between having a new life with his wife or his loyalty towards the town. He decides to stay in the town and tries to find people to help him deal with Miller. However, no one tries to help him. Instead, they tell him to quickly leave the town as he'll only bring trouble. Kane is left to fend for himself. Miller finally comes to the small town with his small gang and the final showdown begins.A unique feature of the movie is that it was filmed in real time. Clocks can be seen throughout the whole movie. It makes viewers feel like they are actually witnessing the scenes as they unfold. This help creates more suspense and tension. The viewers can see Will panicking more and more as the clock ticks towards 12. The acting is superb in the movie, especially with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. The characters they play both have two difficult choices to make. Kane had to choose between his wife and his town, while Amy had to choose between her husband and Quaker ideals.

Stuck in an unrelenting battle between his true love and his personal duty, Kane must find the strength to protect the people he cares for whilst surviving the storm that is the criminal underworld. Gary Cooper is a star that portrays this haunted persona to a tee and never falters with his performance. Every twist and turn, the pacifist wife, the vengeful enemies that relentlessly add to the body count, and the upstanding and honorable marshal that brings justice to the town all coordinate to make this movie easily compete with any movie made beyond its time. This movie shows the world that love is strong than hate and determination is stronger than anger. This movie is a must-see hit that keeps watchers on the edge of their seat and finding a faint sympathy for the Marshal's dissever of love and war.

The constant frantic vibe keeps the movie hypnotizing; making viewers captivated in the plot.'Another aspect of the movie that I found unique about this film was its timing.

A song titled Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Darling by Tex Ritter won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1952, and it's easy to see why. It truly is a catchy tune, and it fits well with the movie.

            "content": "Few motion pictures, whether they be a Western or another genre, are as allegorical as this one. Scripted by the soon to be blacklisted Carl Foreman, HIGH NOON was intended as a statement against the anti-communist witch hunts then plaguing the film capital and the rest of America. It was made by independent producer Stanley Kramer, a liberal known for the social commentary in his movies.HIGH NOON's parable about hysteria and betrayal wasn't lost on some of Hollywood's most rabid hawks, such as John Wayne, who actually decried the classic Western as un-American and unpatriotic. Even apolitical types like director Howard Hawks chimed in, saying it was tantamount to heresy that a movie lawman would back down from a fight.Curiously, none of that vitriol was directed toward its star Gary Cooper. Long known in the industry as a Republican, Cooper was described by former lover Patricia Neal as \"conservative, but not necessarily right-wing\". Translated, that meant he drew the line when it veered into reactionary territory. Against the grain of his fellow conservatives, Cooper remained supportive of Foreman until his death from cancer in 1961. In hindsight, that quality made him the perfect actor to play Marshal Will Kane.HIGH NOON was directed by Fred Zinnemann, who at that time was under contract to Kramer. Being an Austrian of the Jewish faith, Zinnemann seemed as likely a director of a Western as Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. But as a boy, he read with fascination a series of Westerns written by Karl May, a fellow Austrian who had never set foot in the American West (!).",

It was many years before I realized that the movie had taught me a valuable lesson about manhood, or adulthood.  This is not a Western so much as it is a morality play on a Western movie set.  The lesson to be learned from the story is simply this:  When evil, or the thing you fear the most, becomes personified and comes to town looking for you, you have two choices.  You can face it, or you can run from it.  If you run, you will spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder.  But if you face it, you may face it all alone.  Friends are good to have but you will learn who your real friends are when the crunch comes.  I can recount several incidents in my life when I felt the way Gary Cooper's character must have felt as the clock ticked towards noon.  The ending of the movies is perfect.  As the good citizens of the town crawl out from behind the woodwork, he drops their badge in the dust and rides off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

            "content": "High Noon, to me, was simply another drab Western movie with a clich\u00e9 plot and story line that wasn't worth following. For some people, the few who enjoy classic cowboy films, High Noon fills out every quality to make it a perfectly fine Western. However, I am not one of those particular people. To start with, the characters were sporadic in personalities and decision. They surprised you with sudden acts of courage and fear, leaving and staying. I grew to dislike many of the characters. Amy Fowler, wife of protagonist Will Kane, was one in particular. Her ultimatum of leaving on the train, with or without her new husband, was selfish and did not strike me as very loving or devoted. She was over-dramatic, jumped to conclusions quickly, and failed to gain my liking.The effects bothered me too. Perhaps, from having grown up in a generation with movies advanced in their special effects, I do not know how to fully appreciate classic films and their antique stunts and tricks. A man would shoot rounds of bullets at another man and the bullets would simply land about his feet, coming nowhere near a killing point, unless it was one exact shot killing from the head or heart, in which case it only took that single shot. Some of the acting was second-rate as well. Corny reactions, bad Southern accents, and off dramatization made the movie less than the potential it could have had. Overall, these problems I found are opinion-related to myself. The people watching High Noon, sitting across the room from me, could have been having the time of their life, and that is absolutely fine. Growing up in the era well after that of these Western films, I cannot fully admire the movie as it should be. However, disregarding myself, this aged film fits the bill for anyone looking for a classic, dated Western picture.",

Gary Cooper is arguably in the role that he plays in: the hard-bitten cop whose five-year plus stance as effective law-keeper puts cold feet into the people who he protected, the people who do not help him at his one hour of need. Katy Jurado is also adept here as the unsympathetically sympathetic Ramirez, Cooper's first lover before the lovely Grace Kelly stepped in. It is a tale of eloquence and grandeur, and nonetheless, who have its detractors as well: those who attacked it as being 'non-Western'. I disagree. Time changes everything, and the fact that Zinnemann changing the usual tone of a Western in almost unjust. Who attacked D. W. Griffith when he changed the art of cinema with The Birth of a Nation or Intolerance? Who attacked Michael Curtiz when he made the rather strange Bogart-Bergman romantic Casablanca? The thing is, Zinnemann knows how to make films. His creations touch the very brink of parody and fun; yet there are those times when the characters in his films face moral setbacks, inhumane brutality (like From Here to Eternity) and of course, psychological frustration. Cooper is not the Wayne-type usual cowboy you get to see with John Ford: he is the unusually frustrated, deeply maddened persona, who shows not his breakdown openly (just like Clift from A Place in the Sun). 8.5/10",

            "content": "There is d*** little that I ever loved about the 1950's, but \"High Noon\" is one of them. What some people seem to forget is that it was written and shot during the time of the McCarthy witchhunts, the Hollywood blacklists, the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, and other related miseries. The message that all \"good\" parents wanted to impress on their children could be boiled down to a single word: \"Conform\". This movie is a challenge to that essentially cowardly attitude, reaffirming everything about what is great about American individualism.The thing I remember most about Gary Cooper is not so much his words (though one phrase, \"I'm tired of being pushed.\", sums up his character rather nicely, I thought), but his actions. The slow walk up to the bartender to give him a richly deserved smack in the jaw...the rigid, almost military walk he makes to the townpeople who all abandon him (even his new bride does that; a shot in the back doesn't take out the earlier sting of the initial rejection to me)...the final look of contempt on his face just before he tosses the tin star that an hour and a half before the people he just saved wanted him to give up to avoid trouble.Considering how ungrateful and cowardly these people are, why did he do it? Because when push comes to shove, like a lot of other men before and after him, Marshall Will Kane just can't do anything else. It goes against their grain to just bow their heads for the executioner's sword or run from an enemy, no matter how bad the odds. Those are the kind of men who couldn't live very well in the 1950's, because they refused to stand down, no matter what. That, to me, is why this film endures, because it's ultimately about doing the right thing regardless.",

            "content": "John Wayne infamously said that this film was the \"most Un-American thing\" that he had ever seen, and that he'd never regret \"having run Carl Foreman out of the country.\" As much as I have enjoyed many of his films, I have to say that he was absolutely wrong to say that this film was Un-American, because it represents two emotions that are present in all of us, cowardice and courage, which is something that is very realistically portrayed in the film's characters. Furthermore, it's a testament to the type of character that Will Kane is, in which he exerts a form of bravery and strength that's like no other.High Noon is a classic in every conceivable aspect, with it being one of the best films in the entire Western genre. With an engaging story, masterful directing, stunning cinematography, and stellar acting, this film exceeds on every level. In addition to that, it's also different from the standard Western of the era, as the film has a rather atmospheric setting to it that plays up the tensions and suspense. The end result is a stupendous film that marks one of the most memorable achievements in the history of cinema.In what might be his most famous role, Gary Cooper stars as Will Kane, a very dependable marshal who has seemingly everything going well for him, in which he's just handed over his badge and is planning to leave town soon with his newlywedded wife. Unfortunately, things suddenly take a dark turn he receives something that comes as a thunderous shock. An old adversary of his, a man named Frank Miller, has been pardoned for some crimes that he should've been hanged for, and is heading to Kane's town to exact revenge. With his adversary due to arrive on the noon train, Kane has two options, in which he can leave town, or prepare himself for a fight. At first, he and his wife leave town, but they don't get very far before he decides to go back. Since the new marshal isn't due for a day, Kane feels that it's his duty to protect the town. Upon returning, he finds another shock, in which no one, and I mean, no one, is willing to help him. The clock is ticking, and Kane realizes that he has no choice but to face Miller and his cohorts alone.What makes High Noon a standout is that it isn't the typical Western that Hollywood was usually known for. In fact, the film is very much a deconstruction of the genre. The film shows the struggle of a man who has to defend a town against an enemy, and with no one to help him. That's one of the reasons as to why Will Kane is without a doubt one of the greatest film heroes of all time, because of how courageous he is. He's someone with seemingly unsurmountable odds stacked against him, and yet no matter how tempting it is to give up, he remains firm and stands up for what he believes is right. To say that Gary Cooper deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor is an understatement, because in my opinion, this is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. The supporting cast is also extremely effective, in which none of them feel flat or out of place. Grace Kelly was luminous as Kane's wife, in which she finds herself torn between her convictions and doing what's right. Lloyd Bridges was also very good, playing an assistant Marshal who repeatedly makes attempts to get Kane to leave. Katy Jurado also deserves mention in her role as a woman with a rather colorful past that puts her in an undesirable position when the tensions mount. So, while Gary Cooper was hands down the best in the film, he also had superb efforts from a great supporting cast.Fred Zinneman directs the film with the utmost attention to detail, in which not a single moment of it is wasted, whether its with the story, the setting, or the characters. He especially knew how to play up the tension, and he does so in a rather novel way. Surprisingly, there isn't much action until the climax, with most of the drama focuses on the desperateness of Kane's situation. As the stakes go higher, Kane grows more desperate, which is shown throughout the film. This ultimately comes to a head in a scene near the climax, where the camera pans out to show Kane standing by himself in the center of town, to show that he is alone, in a literal and metaphorical sense. However, as mentioned, even under this intense pressure, Kane is not the type to give in, which as also stated, makes him one of the most powerful heroes of any film.Something else that's interesting to mention, is that the film rather famously lost Best Picture to The Greatest Show On Earth. While High Noon is still regarded as a classic, The Greatest Show On Earth is now considered to be among the weakest of the films to win Best Picture. There's no doubt that politics played a large role in such a decision, since McCarthyism was at its peak, and Cecil B. DeMille was one of Joseph McCarthy's biggest supporters. Perhaps it was because High Noon was a rather bold and daring film, one that seemed to challenge such ideologies, with the forces that Kane is facing representing McCarthyism. However, the film doesn't completely indite McCarthyism, it seems to indite those who failed to stand up to McCarthyism and HUAC. Even so, regardless of the politics, High Noon is a cinematic masterpiece that is one of the most creative Westerns of all time, and for that matter, could even be considered one of the best films of all time.",

The pulsating action coincides exactly with the 85 minutes' running time, as well as brilliantly setting the marshal in isolation among the ominous wooden buildings and dusty streets of a small frontier town.It was the high point of Zinnemann's career, and Cooper, in his Oscar-winning role - at 51, his handsome face lined and drawn - gives possibly the most poignant and profound performance to be found in any western. No doubt Sergio Leone remembered the movie (in which Leone star Van Cleef makes his debut) when he embarked on his homages to the American West, while Morricone has echoed the effective use of the 'Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling' song on the soundtrack.",

It is the product of godless liberals who want to undermine the morals of America, and is nothing more than propaganda to justify taking away your guns, your last defense against the commie atheists who would take away your Bibles next.Marshal Will Kane is not a hero for shooting the ex-cons who return to town; he is a coward and a vigilante who should have been arrested, tried for murder and hung. They did their time, and now, having been released from jail, all they wanted to do was return to make an honest living, such as running for mayor, or perhaps sheriff, or, who knows, maybe one day president. This was their right. Besides, Frank Miller found Jesus in jail, and was a born again Christian.The town voted democratically to allow them to return. What gives Will Kane the right to be different? Does he think he is someone special, above the rest of the town, above even the preacher? Maybe the town had it right, in the first place.As the hotel clerk said, \"It's good for business.\" And everyone knows what's good for business is good for America. This gang would have spent their hard earned money in town, thus creating jobs. And as job creators, they would have been entitled to be elected to public office, unlike those liberal do-gooder politicians, whom we all know are crooks. This is the American way. The way of High Noon is the commie way. The movie was probably funded, directed and written by Kremlin stooges, like so many other commies who infiltrated Hollywood at the instructions of the USSR, spreading the gospel of godless individualism, questioning Americanist morals and winning Oscars. It worked: look at the moral decay that has spread through America since this movie was released. The commies know all too well not to show such immoral fare in their countries; you will never see High Noon shown in Red China. They put individualists and free thinkers in jail or simply execute them. We could learn a thing or two from their example. Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon should have taken away the union cards of (F)Red Zinnemann, Karl Marx Foreman, and Gary Pinko Cooper, banned them from ever working in Hollywood again, and, in my opinion, put them in jail for being un-American, like they did so many other Hollycommies. If you are a good, God fearing Repubican, do not watch this movie. Do not allow yourself to be corrupted by the ideals of individualism, of standing up for what you believe in in the face of unanimous opposition, at the risk of your life.

If Kane were to leave town, Miller will come after him and then he is all alone on the prairie. Although no one helps him in town, at least he has some buildings and such for protection. The prairie is wide open - no where to hide. Then he would be killed for sure. So I think even if he didn't believe it was his duty to stay and fight Miller for the town, he was still wiser to stay in town for the simple fact that he had something to hide behind while he was shooting and being shot at.

It feel so perfectly shot, cleanly edited, well-timed; I just love the way Gary Cooper fits into his character Will Kane, and I get more and more attached to him the more and more everyone abandons him.The last few minutes of gun fighting feel very real. For the most part Kane is on the run and yet he fights back without any trace of cowardice. In contrast to another great Western The Searchers, where the heroes are the pursuers, the hero is the hunted one. I think that works very well; it also feels more satisfying to see his defeat of the bad guys in the final moments.Yet there's a real bittersweet thing going on here. Helen Ramirez is gone from the town, never to return. The town is full of corrupt and cowardly people. Only the young boy who was eager to aid Kane but was turned down gets a smile from Kane at the end of the movie. And Will Kane's wife had to abandon her Quaker pacifism to save her husband. Nothing comes easy here.\"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\" felt a bit tacky at first, but I took a liking to it.Everything feels stripped down, meat-and-potatoes, and I think it surprised a lot of American moviegoers when they first saw it in 1952. Now it feels less strange, but it still feels \"other\" compared to the great Westerns of John Ford or Howard Hawks, or even the Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns.I think this is one of my favorite 1950s films, alongside The Big Heat, The Searchers, The Ten Commandments, Seven Samurai, and Ben-Hur.

            "content": "I don't usually go for westerns when I watch movies.  All of the shoot 'em up action of them is usually a little bit too much for me.  But this film had none of that.  It really wasn't so much of a western, as a story of morality and duty that happened to be set in the west.I don't like some of the acting in the film, however, because melodramatic acting almost always gets on my nerves.  Grace Kelly is guilty of that crime here, but she really didn't even bother me.  She has such an elegance when she is on screen that it always just wins me over.  We don't have such elegance today, and its a shame.  The closest would be Nicole Kidman in 'The Others', but its still not the same.Gary Cooper is excellent in this movie.  If you have ever felt betrayed, scared or alone, you will be able to relate perfectly with what Cooper is feeling, and you will feel a deep sympathy for his character, and hatred for most of the town folk.  His facial expressions are fantastic, and I can honestly see how he could have won an Oscar for best actor.  I was very pleased with his performance.There are not a lot of shoot outs or action in the movie.  It all builds up to one shoot out at the end of the movie, and it takes place in almost real time.  That was very interesting.  The ticking of the clock was ominous, and the constant repetition of the theme song was oddly haunting. \nThe acting was really quite good, the direction was fine, the editing was fine and not a whole lot was out of place.  Overall it is well worth a watch.  Starts off a bit slow, but its all worth it when its said and done. If you love movies, or if you want to try something new, give it a go.  8.5 out of 10.",

Thinking back on it now all they are doing is waiting for the noon train to come bearing men with criminal tendencies with a plan to shoot the town's sheriff. Something with that thin of a plot should just be a 15 minute short film. Why pour so much into characters that you can't follow further than 12 o'clock that day? Some people might like that short snippet of time a little window into someone's world but I'd rather take an adventure with the characters spanning months with more conflict and suspense. May I say this film seemed a bit predictable too? Marshall reigns supreme while the criminals they've been waiting the whole film for all die in the last 5 minutes?

            "content": "As `High Noon' begins Sheriff Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is getting married to Amy (Grace Kelly).  This is his last day as sheriff.  He and Mrs. Kane are going to open a store in a new town.  Amy is a Quaker and a pacifist so Kane can't stay in a job that requires carrying a gun and killing people. At the same time, Colby, Pierce, and Ben Miller (Van Cleef, Wilke, and Wooley) are riding into town.  They are members of Frank Miller's (MacDonald) gang. Kane busted up the gang just 5 years ago and Frank was sentenced to hang. But the politicians and judges up north changed his sentence to life and now he's already back on the streets.  Frank is not happy and he's coming to Hadleyville on the noon train.  Frank wants to kill Kane.  Everyone in Hadleyville wants Will and his new bride to get out of town.  But as the newlyweds are leaving, Kane turns back.  He can't leave; he can't let anyone make him run away.  At the risk of everything, his wife, his friends, even his life, Will Kane is going to standup for what's right and more importantly he's going to standup for himself.The hour and twenty minutes between Kane's decision to stay and high noon are among the best minutes of any movie ever made.  This movie is good on every level.  The acting is excellent.  Actually there is only one character and that's Kane.  All the other parts are little more than cameos but there isn't one throwaway line or scene.  Cooper won the best actor Oscar for `High Noon.'  (One of the great behinds-the-scenes stories from `High Noon' is that Cooper was suffering from a bleeding ulcer and injured hip during the filming.  The pained and desperate look that Zimmerman was looking for on Kane wasn't always Cooper acting.)  Real or acting the pain, loneliness, and introspective looks of a man deserted by all and facing a desperate killer are right on.  Zimmerman's direction is perfect.  Kane has spent over an hour looking for deputies to help him face Miller.  Everyone has turned their back on him. His deputy, Harvey Pell (Bridges) is mad because Kane didn't support him for job as sheriff.  His wife of one hour has left him.  The judge that sentenced Frank Miller rode out of town as soon as heard Miller was coming. Kane is the butt of jokes at the local saloon and the barber is building a new coffin.  Bets are that Kane will be dead 5 minutes after Miller gets off the train.  Kane stands alone on the main street of Hadleyville.  The camera pans up and away.  It's only Kane and his shadow; an unforgettable moment at the movies.Dmitri Tiomkin won the Oscar for best musical score.  He and Ned Washington won the Oscar for best song.  `Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'' as sung by Tex Ritter haunts the entire movie.  It's one of those songs that's perfect for the movie.  It's not just a slick tune added to the credits to help sell a sound track. `Do Not Forsake Me\u0085' is part of the movie.  The makeup and costuming are part of and important to the story telling.  Colby, Pierce, and Miller spend most of the movie standing in the hot sun at the train depot.  It's hot and they're at the end of long trip via horseback.  Their clothes are dirty and sweaty.  There are other scenes where makeup is important.  Kane and Harvey have a fight following Harvey's last minute attempt to push Kane and get him to leave town.  Kane wins the fight.  As he walks to the barbershop for some clean water to wash up, he wipes his face. But in addition to the usual blood, Kane's knuckles are deeply bruised, a small touch but illustrative of the detailed addressed by Zimmerman. \nOn a historical note, `High Noon' was filmed and released during the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings.  Many in Hollywood saw `High Noon' as an allegory of the times and their town.  Hollywood was a town too afraid to stand up for itself.  Hollywood was a town full of small people willing to let others suffer while they stuck their heads in the sands of denial. Carl Foreman, `High Noon' screenwriter, had refused to cooperate with HUAC and didn't stick around to see the movie made.  He sold his rights to the film and left for Europe. In the movie, Martin Howe (Chaney) is a long time friend and mentor of Will Kane.  Howe was sheriff of Hadleyville before Kane and when he retired, Howe got Kane the job.  He tries to encourage Kane to leave before the train arrives with Frank Miller. When Kane protests and pleads a case for the town and its people Howe says, `The public doesn't give a damn about integrity. A town that won't defend itself deserves no help,' a thinly veiled reference to Hollywood in the 1950s.No matter how I view this movie it comes up a winner.  It's a great story. The acting direction, photography, music and all other production details are perfect.  `High Noon' is a psychological drama of a man willing to risk all for himself.  `High Noon' is one of the best movies ever made.",

Not like any Western I've ever seen in so many respects, with the movie moving forward in real time, the inward, pensive focus, and the fear that reveals itself as ambivalence, reluctance or outright cowardice when the townspeople are asked to stand by the Marshal against the outlaws. You see the weight of real consequences reaching all of them, except maybe the four would be killers. It's more realistic than most Westerns for these reasons, and Gary Cooper really stands out in the protagonist's role, for which he won an Oscar.There wasn't the sense of reckless fearlessness that you see in so many of the Westerns from that era. Cooper's character had a real appreciation of the danger and consequences of what lay ahead of him, and was in no way fearless about it, which made his character all the more captivating.The movie shows the response of each and every man who did back out in revealing detail. Most of them seemed willing to stand and fight when they had other men beside them and the odds in their favor, but absent these odds, the men all found reasons not to show up.Outside of Will, the bravest people in town - when it really counted - were among the least respected by the townspeople, including the shamed town misfit, a 14 year old boy, Will's ex-girlfriend, and his wife. And the person who merited the most respect, Will himself, was clearly the most under-appreciated person in town, given that he was the only thing between them and lawlessness.",

            "content": "My favorite American movie of the 1950s, HIGH NOON is a deliciously tense and emotional powerhouse of a western/drama that delivers pretty much the bravest character ever in Will Kane. Ruthless Frank Miller is coming on the noon train to join his crew of bandits (including a young Lee Van Cleef!) and get revenge on Kane and probably destroy the town, and the freshly-married, former sheriff is having a hard time forming a posse to confront them. The town, including Kane's own friends, abandon him for a variety of reasons (some liked it better when Miller was around, some worry they will only hinder Kane, some think violence will give the town a bad name, but most are just plain scared). The only two who agree to help are a broken-down guy with an eyepatch and a 14-year-old kid, and Kane refuses both their help. The movie was intended to play out in real time, which adds to the suspense as we await the arrival of noon (however, upon reviewing the film I found that it's more like 60 and 1/2 minutes from the time when Kane first hears of Miller returning (10:40am) and the whistle of the arriving train.Helen Ramirez (the ex-lover of both Kane and Miller and the current lover of Harv the Deputy) stands as one of the strongest woman characters ever, complete with her own Mexican flair of the theme music. The scene in which she tells Harv the difference between he and Kane's manliness is priceless. It's clear she and Kane had a profound effect on each other--they even use the same expressions (\"If you don't know, I can't explain it to you...\" or the like).My favorite sequence: An intercutting between Lloyd Bridges (as Harv the Deupty) going through an intense inner turmoil, and Kane walking alone in the street, over a piano version of \"Buffalo Gals\" playing from the saloon.Most powerful shot: a push-in on the empty chair where Miller once vowed revenge right before the blaring whistle of the train that has finally arrived.",

Basicaly, the man our hero Kane sent away to be hanged for murder some years ago has been pardened, and he's coming back.  With friends waiting to help avenge his jail term. Before to long you know whats at stake, what it will cost, and why Kane feels he has to do what he is setting out to do. \"I just gotta, thats the whole thing...\"  Once this is set in place the tension screws are steadily and constantly set in motion.  His foe is on the 'noon train, and he's going to drive him out of town, with the help of the ungrateful townsfolk he's served faithfuly (and his new bride), or as it transpires later, without.The dramatic use of clocks in the film (there's one in just about every scene) provides a simple but effective way for the director to ratchet up the tension in just about real time.  Its getting on for 10.45 as we join the film.  As 'noon arrives its Kane against them all, and a cracking action sequence ensues.  Justice is restored to town, but Kane leaves, understandably upset at the lack of help, his new (and now trusting wife) at his side.  Cheers alround, \"THE END\", fade to black, goodnight Vienna!The film is simple, moralistic, and highly effective. The realism seems just about all there, guns actually run out of bullets and people take more than one punch at a time, not reeling around crashing into matchstick furniture. The camera work is stricking without the use of fancy tricks, and the theme music that runs through it will have you whistling in no time, despite trying its best to give away the ending in the opening credits.As said above a real eye opener to the western genre.Give it a go!!!8/10",

            "content": "This is why we go to the movies: it is about feelings, relationships, real people. I remember that I first saw that western 20 years ago when I was a teenager. Praised in the television guide as a classical movie I was very disappointed to learn that there is no action in it. I smile about my teenage-self now...This IS a classical movie, an all time great and it\u00b4s not \"unAmerican\" as John Wayne said. Just like what is shown in - for example- \"Mississippi Burning\" is not typical American. Thank God! It is the story of a man afraid to fight alone. Though townsfolk has every reason to join the fight, they choose not to do. I admire John Wayne, but this is American, too. It is said in the movie: \"It just happens to soon!\" People need to adjust to the situation, unfortunatley. Wayne forgot that the USA struggled to join WWI. There was a very long and heated debate about doing it or not (Griffith\u00b4s \"Intolerance\" being a part of it.). Same to WWII, when brave English men fought alone for a whole year (yet supported by US transports across Atlantic of course) against Nazi-Germany. It\u00b4s just human, after all. And that\u00b4s why we go the movies, to see human beings.\nBy the way: Fred Zinnemann, the director, is Austrian and jewish. And in an interview from 1982 he says: \"I am feeling at home in France, England and in the U.S., but I am not feeling at home in Austria.\"This is a great movie.Macaulay J. Connor 10/10",

            "content": "Hadleyville's clocks hands beat the same time of our wristwatches as a result of a coincidence between reality and narration: That's the driving force of High Noon. Under a merciless, clear sky we are thrown on a Far West town, and we are guided into it by Dimitri Tiomkin's leitmotif theme and a disreputable trio (Miller's gang).Zinnemann's studied and perfect frames describe the Western revenge'canon embodied in the silent action of Frank Miller's mysterious remains. A name which frightens the whole Hadleyville and it also upsets Will Kane (Gary Cooper) so much that he renounces to go away with his new bride Amy (Grace Kelly) in order to obey to his duty: Defending the community in his last day as a sheriff even.And here is the duel between the law guardian Will Kane and the lawbreaker Frank Miller: On one side the heavy presence of a lonely man and on the other side the vague absence of a ruthless man. A duel that recreates itself upon the axes of time: It re-emerges from the past (Kane arrested Miller) and projects itself in the future (noon running on the railway).Everything tends to that moment in a spiral of increasingly tension while minutes pass identical to us and Kane; and we are literally suck in that dusty town where Will Kane is wandering in search of allies to face Miller and his gang. But as time goes by the more we understand Kane will be alone. Even Amy leaves him, because she is the virginal principle of nonviolence, and also she is waiting for that fatal noon (not definitely to stay but to get on board on the train).She's going to move out just like the Mexican Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado) is planning to do. Probably because she had been Miller's woman, and has been Kane's fianc\u00e9, and then she's the girl of Kane's vice Harvey Pell (a young Lloyd Bridges, well known for his role as McCroskey in Airplane!), a symbol of that pretentious youth which claims for a vested right power.Zinnemann is a punctilious surveyor who doesn't leave anything to chance, who upholsters everything with symbolisms as bright as the West blinding light. So we encounter some archetypical figures: inhabitants' cowardly selfishness not inclined to help he who has fought strenuously to bring back order in town; uncaring politics represented by Henderson, who takes Kane's side except saying his presence threatens the town in fine; finally judges' recklessness who have turned Miller's life sentence into probation.Will Kane is all alone and he has to fight against everyone. He becomes the paradox of a society in which only weapons can guarantee compliance and civility. He is waiting alone for Frank Miller. And we can see him in a backside-dolly-frame walking through a disarming desert, lost in the dust of the inactive Hadleyville. Finally the whistle of the train reveal us Frank Miller's traits (Ian MacDonald) but it's not only the alert of an imminent fate: It's also the sound of Amy's love for Will. The sheriff is no longer alone to fight Miller's gang: the justice puts back in order in the sequence of gunshots, a marriage does the same in front of Frank Miller's corpse. Yet a society is definitely split and mirrored in the dull sparkle of a sheriff star tossed on the ground. And Tex Ritter's Do Not Forsake Me takes us away from there, beyond the high noon of a man too much people have betrayed but one person has saved.",

A young Lee van Cleef, with a face about a wide as a weasel's, is one of the great evil characters in any movie. I am not sure, but I think he never says a word the entire movie.The scene in the church---every face--male and female--is terrific.How could the director who did all this so perfectly in High Noon make such a mess out of casting the MAIN character in The Day of Jackal?Zinneman (sp) cast a guy who looks and talks like a prep school student in the role of the fearsome hired assassin in the The Day of Jackal. It destroyed that whole movie for me.How could he cast so perfectly in High Noon and then not bother to do better for the main character in Day of the Jackal?A couple other points on High Noon:Claiming that the story represents the Hollywood Communist story makes no sense to me.It would have been bleeding heart, leftwing types who released the convicted killer and caused the whole story of this movie to take place. That is the reverse of the lefty claim that Cooper's character represents the plight of the commie Hollywood writers of the 1950's.Another point---Lon Chaney Jr. has small roles in High Noon and in another great movie, the Defiant Ones.Yet in both movies a short scene where he alone is on screen is the most telling single moment in each picture.In High Noon he sits alone waiting for the showdown between Cooper and the scum badmen. He says, \"It's all for nothing, Wil. It's all for nothing\"In the Defiant Ones, after releasing the two captured runaway prisoners and watching them run away from the turpentine camp over the hills, Chaney says, \"Run, chicken, run.\"In each case the tiny scene and the single comment sums up the whole movie.And two great movies they were.",

Will Kane the marshal in town was ready to move on with his life when he decided to marry Amy. But of course, his heroic ways came back when a telegram came in that Frank Miller his old foe he put away in prison for murder had been freed and is coming right for the town. With Amy's self centered attitude she did not agree with her newly husband going to risk his life for a town he no longer-ed served. Amy decides shes going to the train station and leaving at noon. Who would believe that the person you love would just walk away and leave you in the dust? Alone Will Kane tries to find more help, but who wants to die right? The town people we're frightened and some are on Miller's side. And it didn't help Harvey being envious that Kane came back to town to be Marshal again. It doesn't help when Kane visits the hotel and finds Amy sitting there. Thinking she came back to stick it out by his side and Amy thinking Kane is going to hop out town they both ended up in disappointment. Kane goes to tell his previous love Helen to get out of town. Knowing that she was close friends with his old foe Miller. With Kane searching for help still, one of the town people Jimmy asks nothing but to join. But Kane won't let him. Not realizing he needs it as its getting closer to noon. Going to the town's church pleading for them to not let some crooks come take over again. Seems like Kane is on his own now. Meanwhile his wife realized that Kane still cared for Helen and both of them decide to go out. What a shock both of his loves are leaving him together. Kane only gets the farewell good bye look you always see surprisingly from Helen. If this movie doesn't describe how selfish people are to help someone who risked his life everyday for them. I don't know what does. But its time, noon was here the town was locked away in hiding. Frank Miller and his guys come in to town destroying windows making his call to Kane that he is here. With guns drawn it begins, you can't stop Marshal Kane as he kills one of Miller's guys. Shots echoed and Amy finally realized that she can't be widow and runs off the train back to her husband. Another down as Kane gets stuck in the barn with a fire starting. But everyone knows you can't stop the hero. Even when Kane gets shot. Well you can say his wife Amy meant she was not going to be a widow and kills a guy. Miller should of known not to mess with the one he loves as he takes Amy hostage. Marshal Kane saved the town as he took Miller down. And Will and Amy Kane leave town for good. This movie was of course one of the best classics I have watched!",

Lacking effective law enforcement they used guerrilla tactics as often as not--example --wait 'til villain slept, then burn down house, waiting outside with guns, just in case.High Noon was made during the McCarthyism scares, and reflected, perhaps, the writers/directors views of Americans paralyzed with fear, a theme repeated in many movies of the time.None of this diminishes the power of the film and the performances.",

The story begins with Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) getting married to Quaker Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly). Soon after the wedding ceremony, he receives news that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), previously sentenced to death, has been pardoned and is returning to the town of Hadleyville to kill him. That is as much western movie essence as you get until the end. The typical western plot of someone has a problem and the law deals with it, is only seen for about ten minutes. As the movie goes on the movie suddenly changes genres and drama ensues. The story begins to focus less on whether or not the day will be saved, and more on the drama of Kane's former lover, the morals of Kane's wife and the character development of Deputy Sheriff Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges).The great thing about this movie is that it is in real time. The time is crucial in the plot and it adds to the suspense of the movie. As a western, this movie is terrible don't watch it expecting to be a typical western.

It is directed by a brilliant filmmaker,Zinnemann, who uses a thriller atmosphere mixed with classical western elements to produce a pearl of the genre.

Moreover it is worth to mention Katy Jurado, in my opinion, she does the best job in this film. Notwithstanding Gary Cooper is a star an very familiarized with this kind of film, I did not like his performance in this film. In some moments, where Will Kane was under considerable pressure, he was not able to demonstrate all the tension and doubts that take control of the character. The dialogues are interesting and totally met their aim: to support the atmosphere of fear and anxiety that dominated the city.",

As the marshal of the town of Hadleyville, Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper, is abandoned by the townsfolk and left to defend himself against bad-guy Frank Miller and his gang, who come back to town seeking revenge for Kane's role in sending Miller to jail. Cooper's portrayal of Kane is a classic \u2013 as he subtly plays this dark, complex, realistic and flawed lawman. Likewise, the lead female characters are atypical of the genre \u2013 as they are not only capable of looking after themselves, but play key roles in the outcome of the plot. The film's gritty look, unorthodox screenplay, original characters and unapologetic ending were years ahead of their time \u2013 which is good reason why High Noon remains one of the most important westerns ever produced (Klaus Ming March 2010).",

            "content": "This is one of the few films where the story plays out in real time.  Star Gary Cooper has about 80 minutes before the Noon train brings a bad guy to town for a showdown and that's how long it takes.  The train arrives on time and the shootout occurs on schedule.It is the clock that makes this suspenseful Western work.  Director Fred Zinnemann makes sure that the camera focuses often on the clock.  As the time nears high noon the clock becomes noticeably bigger until the end the pendulum practically fills the screen.  Don't bother with this movie on commercial television.  Commercial breaks absolutely destroy the timing which drives this film.The cast does an excellent job with the great script.  Gary Cooper plays one of his best roles as the sheriff and Grace Kelly is very good as his Quaker wife who doesn't quite understand the need for violence.  They are backed up well by Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Katy Jurado and Lon Chaney.  Jack Elam has a good comic moment as a drunk sleeping it off in jail.  Lee Van Cleef has a key role as one of the villains.  He is the first of the four gunmen that the viewer sees, appearing in the opening credits.  Incredibly, he gets through the entire film without uttering one word of dialogue.The movie is loosely based on a story entitled \"The Tin Star\".  The film has no connection to the movie of that name.  The movie entitled \"The Tin Star\" ultimately honors the badge.  In \"High Noon\" the sheriff finds that the badge carries little honor when the town doesn't support law and order.  The townspeople are too eager to sacrifice Cooper to save the good name of the town.  Much of the film follows Cooper as he tries to recruit help.  He can't find any and perhaps he shouldn't have expected any.  In \"Rio Bravo\" sheriff John Wayne turns down help from his old friend Ward Bond.  \"You're not good enough\", he tells his friend.  One of the great moments in \"High Noon\" is when Cooper realizes he will have to face the four baddies alone. He lays his head down on the desk and cries.  It's a touching and credible moment in this great film.The other element that makes this film work is the music.  Dimitri Tiomkin's pulsating score repeats the title song \"Do Not Forsake Me\" over and over. This has the effect of increasing the tension and pacing the film.  In the opening credits Tex Ritter sings Ned Washington's lyrics.  The song won the Academy Award and helped the movie succeed at the box office when Frankie Laine--not Tex Ritter--made the song a hit.",

I will give the cinematography a 100%; it looks great. A man on the verge of leaving his job gets married to leave town. How did a Quaker get out to this rural outpost.? Mail order bride? The editing needed an expert. The fight between Cooper and his deputy looked like they were dancing. When Cooper tries to get out of the barn with the horses it's not clear where anyone is. And of course the gun fight at the end just means these hired killers (whom everyone seems to know and enjoy) can't hit the side of anything. Too many shots of Cooper walking down the main street of an empty town with the endless repeating of the theme song. Frank Miller is seen as some sort of monster but we get no background on him or any of his cohorts. I suppose this could go down as a medieval morality play but it just didn't work for me.

There were no conflicts between cowboys and Indians, between farmers and ranchers, between land barons and homesteaders...none of the stereotypical western fare, until the very end of the film when the train arrives. There was conflict however. It was the marshall's struggle in deciding whether to put off his decision to retire from the marshall's job and leave with his new wife, a non-violent Quaker, or to stay for the impending showdown. A careful listening to the recurring theme song reminds us of that struggle, \"Oh, to be torn twixt love and duty....\" If one watches the film and listens carefully, he/she will find a great deal of deeper meaning and emotion than might initially appear. An excellent film.",

            "content": "Few motion pictures,. Whether they be a Western or another genre, are as allegorical as this one. Scripted by the soon-to-be blacklisted Carl Foreman, HIGH NOON was intended as a statement against the anti-communist witch hunts then plaguing the film capital and the rest of America. It was made by independent producer Stanley Kramer, a liberal best known for the social commentary in his movies.HIGH NOON's parable about hysteria and betrayal was not lost on some of Hollywood's most rabid hawks such as John Wayne, who actually decried this classic Western as un-American and unpatriotic. Even apolitical types like director Howard Hawks chimed in, saying it was tantamount to heresy that a movie lawman would consider backing down from a fight.Curiously, none of that vitriol was aimed towards its star Gary Cooper. Long known in the industry as a Republican, Cooper was described by former lover Patricia Neal as \"conservative but not necessarily right-wing\". Translated, that meant he drew the line when it veered into reactionary territory.Going against the grain of his fellow Hollywood conservatives, Cooper remained supportive of Foreman, even after the latter's blacklist, and continued to be until the actor's death from cancer in 1961. In hindsight, those qualities made him perfect for the role of Will Kane.HIGH NOON was directed by Fred Zinnemann who, at that time was under a three picture contract to Kramer. Being an Austrian of the Jewish faith, Zinnemann seemed as likely a director of Westerns as Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. But as a boy, he read with fascination a series of Westerns written by Karl May, a fellow Austrian who had never set foot in the American West (!). After Kramer acquired the rights to Foreman's property, Zinnemann was excited about having the opportunity to direct an American Western.",

Two of the greatest movies ever, were made during that period. \"High Noon\" and \"From Here to Eternity\".

When the couple prepared to begin honeymoon, a bad guy named Frank Miller threatened to revenge on the whole town. However, no one is willing to help marshals. The small town will be involved in a bloody vendetta. Finally, Will have to fight himself.The movie is a classical one to describe frontier. In the movie, Gray Cooper is a super hero who saved the town. He is self- reliance, tough and honest. From the movie, we can see, the heritage of frontier is still evident to the society.The film won the Oscar for best actor in 1953 and won more than ten professional rewards. According to a survey released, the film high noon is the one that any American President love watching movies. It is said that President bush had watched the video of up to 50 times . The main reason is that the president often faces the situation that Gray Cooper faced in the movie. They always have to find a solution to the current crisis without understanding, support and help.From my perspective, this movie is not just for build up a hero image. It is actually a sad movie. The gun fight only lasts for little time, and the rest of the movie mainly depict how people are not willing to help Will, how people betrayed the hero who used to save the town. People is always superficial and forgettable, so the hero is always lonely.I personally highly recommend this movie. Unlike other frontier movie, it is not bloody, but very profound.",

While the train is pulling in to the station, the clock is ticking, the music methodically builds suspense, the camera flashes to the various townspeople who have rejected Will Kane, and the 3 bad boys look like they are ready to chew nails and spit them out! THESE ARE CLASSIC WESTERN BAD BOYS! Not the cream puff villains we get in most movies.I could watch that scene 50 times and still be intimidated by those guys.

However the one in his rifle was a 1866 Winchester.

            "content": "This review is written from my perspective as a 90's child. High Noon is likely to have a different meaning to me than it does to a majority of its fans. Why? It's because my generation did not grow up with western movies being anything but a fond memory in American history. That's not to say, however, that we can't enjoy them all the same. This was a well- made movie. It was worth the watch for sure. Although I cannot say I have seen many western movies, I would certainly say this is the best. High Noon embodies what a western movie should be like. You know it's exciting if it could keep my whole 11th grade English class's attention throughout most if not all of its duration. This movie features everything a western should: love, gun slinging, plot buildup, and an exciting climax. That combined with the wonderfully and tastefully done music makes for a true western watch. However, I give it 8 stars because I have a couple of complaints. Keep in mind that this is coming from the perspective of a 16 year old that did not grow up with westerns movies being very common among modern culture. To sum it up, the rising action of this movie was too dragged out for my taste. It simply took too long. A decent portion of the buildup was not very meaningful; it contributed little to the plot. With that said, although the climax was exciting and felt very western, it was underwhelming for such a long buildup. That is not to say this movie is bad, however. I really did enjoy it. As stated before, it truly made me feel the western atmosphere. Perhaps I found the rising action too empty because my generation is not accustomed to westerns. I'm used to faster paced movies with more over- the-top effects and less talk. Though, I should be fair and judge this movie for what it is: A western movie from the 50's. With that said, I give this movie a solid 8.5 stars.",

I'm still wondering whether I'll like it or not.' OK I get where you're coming from. Well, even if you don't feel like watching \"High Noon'' by the time you finish reading this, let me see if I can at least get you the slightest bit interested in the movie.The basic outline of the story is as follows: In a town called Hadleyville, New Mexico newly wed sheriff Will Kane has gotten hold of news declaring Frank Miller is returning on the noon train to return the favor Mr. Kane did him of putting him behind bars. Initially Kane decides to take Amy( his new wife) away with him and flee from the town, however assuming his responsibilities he feels compelled to stand up to Miller and his gang. Returning to the town, Kane tries desperately to no avail to rally up anyone who will help defend the town whilst Amy has made the decision to leave the town without Kane. When the train finally arrives, Kane is the only one waiting to stop Miller and his men, while Amy, influenced by Helen Ramirez(Kane's former mistress) has decided upon staying along side her husband no matter what. In the end good does triumph over evil and Miller and his men are beaten by Kane with the help of his loyal wife Amy. Even if your not into western films, I would give this one a shot.:) I personally don't even think about a western film when I walk into a movie rental store, however I legitimately did enjoy his one.",

            "content": "Attention: I don't know English. My text was translated by Google Translate.On the morning of his wedding day, Deputy Will Kane is informed that a dangerous bandit, whom he had arrested, will arrive on the midday train to kill him. At that very moment, three bandits arrive in the city and go to the train station to wait for their boss. The deputy's friends force him to leave the city with his wife. They leave, but halfway there he stops the cart and explains to his wife that he never ran away from bandits and that they would chase him wherever they went. Back in town, Kane's wife, who is opposed to facing the bandits, fights with her husband. Aware that his chances against the outlaws are slim, Kane begins to look around the city for help. Almost everyone fears bandits, even their closest friends, with the exception of an old one-eyed man and a teenager. It then remains for him to wait alone for the decisive moment.Classic western, awarded with four Oscars (Actor, Editing, Music and Song) is considered one of the best works of filmmaker Fred Zinnemann (1907-1997). However, this western - a genre I am passionate about - never made me feel admiration for the work as a whole. The reasons that lead me to dislike the film in its entirety, are: the music of Tiomkin, the singer Tex Ritter, some of the supporting actors (explanations later), some details of the work of Zinnemann and the writers, and the main one reason: the conclusion of the story (explained at the end). However, I cannot fail to congratulate Zinnemann for a scene of singular effect: the camera moves away upwards until it shows the deserted street, except for the presence of Kane, despised by everyone and left to his own fate. Still on the work of the director: I would like the punch fight between Kane and Harvey, inside the stable, to be better.The fact that I don't like the ending does not mean that I despise the film, I even like the script by Carl Foreman (adapting \"The Tin Star\", by John W. Cunningham), but let's look at the script a little further: why Sheriff Harvey was not present at Kane's wedding? After all, the fight between them occurs after the wedding. Why is that old man at the hotel so faithful to Helen Ram\u00edrez? Why do thugs remove their spurs from their boots before the confrontation?The casting was not appropriate: Grace Kelly (very beautiful) was too young to be Cooper's wife (the veteran actor was 51 years old, Grace was 23); Lloyd Bridges fails to be convincing in the role of the immature sheriff; Katy Jurado was also young, she was not pretty (a necessary requirement for a character so harassed by men), but she makes up for it with a good performance (she won the Golden Globe); the supporting actors who play Kane's cowardly friends are good; the worst are the four actors who embody the bandits.The film is well known for the fact that the time the story takes place is equal to the length of the film. Check if it's true. To increase the tension experienced by Will Kane, director Zinnemann inserted several close-ups of clocks on the walls, thus, the viewer is also informed that the final hour is approaching.Now, as I promised, the reason I don't like the ending (don't read if you haven't seen the movie yet): nothing wrong with Frank Miller using Amy as a shield against Kane, the problem is the way she gets rid of him and don't get shot; just as I don't accept Miller's slowness in shooting Kane. The scene that ends the film shows Will Kane with just a scratch on his shoulder, leaving the city with his wife, without even taking care of his wound. I find this ending despicable. So, how would I do if I were in Zinnemann's place? Simple: Miller would kill Kane and then rape Amy. Or else: Kane kills all the bad guys, but seriously injured, he dies hours later.Between successes and mistakes, this western is a beautiful example of the genre. No fan of the genre should miss seeing this film.I must have seen it for the first time on April 30, 1989.",

It is also very modern as it shows tremendous skepticism about democracy, religion and makes hints that the hero is flawed. This story is also housed in excellent production, an excellent score, and lots of subtext.But, WTF about the casting? Grace Kelly is absolutely radiant, and appears like a innocent teenager, in love with a old, violent Gary Cooper who appears weathered, beaten down and with a lot of mileage. I just can't believe the two as newlyweds. What is her motivation? Yes her father and brother were apparently killed violently, but that speaks to her pacifism, but not why she would be in love with Kane. She never appears desperate for him, nor seeks his protection. She presumably wants to change him, but only tries to save him at the end. If another chance to 'save her father' was the driving force that brought them together, would she not try harder to convince him to leave, rather than chose to immediately run away?Ms Ramirez story is more convincing as a past love interest with Kane. That she was involved with both him and the outlaw is an interesting story and a believable one, as she is also an outsider. Someone who is brave and stoic in front of a world that doesn't accept or stand with her either. This would have a much more compelling love and redemption arc than Amy Fowler.Definitely worth a watch, among the top westerns of all time, but far from perfect.

But do!Yes, it's black and white (which is how you MUST see it).  Yes, it was made in the starkly moralistic post-war period when we questioned little about our self-righteousness (hey, we had won the war, hadn't we?)  Yes, it's a western (in only the most superficial way).  And yes, if you don't like the cowboy's lament sung by Tex Ritter in the film you're going to throw up by reel two.  (But this isn't a tune really -- moreso than in any other film I can think of, the song is a character on the screen.)  But these are really just details about a film that transcends any label you think you want to put on it.  This film brings us to an immediate confrontation of very personal and inescapable truths which test and define our humanity.It gets harder and harder these days to know what it is to be courageous enough to live free, because in our sterile, politically correct and homogeneous world there is very little to really test our mettle (why else this obsession with \"extreme sports\").  In the early fifties' this wasn't the case.  Many of those contemporaries had had more occasion to stare down their demons than most of us will ever know.  And without a Conradian moment of truth to overcome, we all get complacent and lethargic, our lives get soft, we lose touch with our neighbors and our community, and can't easily see how our liberties are being threatened by erosion to our humanity.Not so for Marshal Wil Kane in High Noon.  Though not at all by choice, he is faced with his moment of personal truth, and decides he has no alternative but to meet it head on.  This isn't just a test of courage for him -- it is life defining.  His near breakdown just prior to the final shootout is testimony to his fear and anguish over the rightness of his decision.  But he doesn't give in to the doubt.  He overcomes it, despite his being forsaken by all he holds dear to him (his town, his friends, his wife).  At that moment, all he has is his belief in himself and the knowledge that to run is to die a worse death than possibly being overcome by his demons.This theme has been used many times (Four Feathers, Straw Dogs, and Outland -- a transparent retelling, come immediately to mind), but none ever to better effect than in this film.  It is timeless.  It is why we love movies so.  There's a reason so many put it in their top whatever lists.  As a film it is as close to perfect as I've ever experienced in any genre.  As a lesson for life, it is one we all need to stare down.  I bet you'll think so too.",

I've seen it a couple of times since and now refuse to watch it ever again. It may be a western, but it goes against the grain of the western. People of the west, men especially, were as tough as shoe leather. They were not all gunmen, but they all knew how to use one. If 4 toughs rode into town with as much notice as this bunch telegraphed, they would all be armed and ready to cut them to doll rags. The town people in the Great Minnesota Northfield raid were the perfect example.\nThe movie had an agenda. To this day, I don't know what it was, but it had one. An honest portrayal of the American West was not it.",

This movie was made during the McCarthy era and was meant to depict it, but it is just as true a depiction of the hypocritical, corrupt demagogues running the country at this moment. No one cares, as long as they can make some money. And all the Gary Coopers have left town. A quick note: A film professor said this movie was shot in real time, meaning that the amount of time depicted in the story corresponded to the time on the screen. I have never synchronized watches at the beginning of the movie, but this is one of the reasons you keep seeing shots of clocks: to keep reminding you of the time.",

It is a classic western, but unusual in many ways.  Despite being a great action movie, it only has one shoot-out in the entire film.  It is very dark and somber, unlike many westerns of the 50's and 60's which were bright and full of shots of the cloudless, sunny sky.  The story is a simple one.  Will Kane must follow his conscience and do the right thing. It reminded me of a Shakespeare play. Gary Cooper is a wonderful actor. He won an academy award for this performance.  All and all the movie collected four statues. Cooper reminds me of Clint Eastwood, because his characters are very mysterious and his acting seems effortless.  Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, Harry Morgan and Lon Chaney round out the all star cast.  You don't have to love westerns to love this timeless classic.  By the way, it is one of Leonard Maltin's all time favorites....enough said!!!",

            "content": "I just saw this masterpiece, and was simply blown away. This movie is what a western should be like. I would almost go as far as to say that this is the best American western ever made along with the wild bunch, the man who shot liberty valence and unforgiven. All though this movie is just a tad better by my opinion, because this is not a traditional western with lots of action and gun fire. This is more realistic in a way. It's much easier to identify with the characters in this western than with all the other \"traditional\" westerns because it gives a more realistic view. I really liked the way this movie was shot, I'm a big fan of black and white, but there was something special about this movie. It didn't give me that high production feeling, not that I don't like high production black and white pictures, but I think it was necessary for this movie to emphasize the realism of the movie.The Cast is great as well. Gary Cooper, which I personally haven't seen much of yet, does a spectacular job, well worth an Oscar. At the end when he is all alone you can see how afraid he is and that he really doesn't want to die. This is one of the things that makes this movie so great, the hero isn't afraid to show his feelings. Grace Kelly, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful creature that ever walked this earth, does a fine job as well. And Lloyd Bridges is good too. The fact that it is directed by an Austrian was a bit of a shock to me, but that goes to show that western isn't really best when Americans make it. In my opinion Fred Zinnermann and Sergio Leone has made the best westerns ever, and none of them are Americans.This really is one of the best westerns out there. It can almost compare to The good the bad and the ugly and Once upon a time in the west. It probably is the best American western ever made at least. But all in all a fantastic movie. Please see this movie if you are a western fan.",

            "content": "I just watched High Noon for the first time in several decades. Never cared for it but thought I'd give it a fresh look. It's just highly over-rated, unrealistic in its depiction & very depressing. John Wayne thought the movie was un-American. Not sure I'd used that term, but I understand what he meant and I agree. Americans are not a bunch of cowards who wouldn't stand up for their own town. To be specific:1. I can't believe that Marshall Kane could not find one man who would stick with him in this fight. This is a frontier Western town of men used to handling guns. Even some of the women probably could. It's just not realistic that no one would back up Kane. In fact, it's a silly and insulting idea about American communities. Maybe John Wayne's term WAS right.2. The villains are no big whoop. There are only 4 of them. None look particularly menacing and Frank Miller is a BIG let down when he arrives. I'd at least expect a Jack Palance. Hell, I'd take a gun and fight these guys, lol. Even 1 man who was good with a gun might stand a reasonable chance with these 4. Not menacing.3. Grace Kelly is simply awful. As an actress and as a character. If I married a woman and had her leave me an hour later when I was gonna be in the fight of my life...I'd get an annulment. Frankly, I don't see what he'd see in Kelly as opposed to the totally hot and classy Katy Jurado, who would DEFINITELY stand by her man. Can't stand Kelly's Quaker act, it just seems stupid and short-sighted. People have to fight for freedom & to live a certain way, if you don't fight, the bad guys automatically win.4. The acting is just not compelling here including Cooper, who does not look well. Quite wooden.I honestly can't recommend these depressing movie that has such a negative view of American communities. Watch Tombstone instead.",

            "content": "I have only seen only a few westerns in my lifetime, but out of the few I have seen, High Noon is not one of my favorites. When I think of westerns, I think of action packed hero vs. villain battles over half of the time. While in high noon, there is just one short battle at the very end. Even though it isn't very action filled and doesn't catch my eye as a \"classic western\" I do think it is a very good movie for its time. I think Gary Cooper plays his role as Marshal Kane very well. In the very beginning of the movie, Marshal Kane is shown getting married to his wife Amy Kane. After he is married, he gives up his role as marshal and is planning on leaving town with his newly wedded wife. Marshal Kane then learns hat a man, Frank Miller, an ex-convict is seeking revenge on him after being sent to prison by him. Marshal Kane will be at the train station at noon and will be ready to fight with his gang. Marshal Kane thinks it is his duty to stay and keep the town safe. Everyone tells Kane and his wife to leave town and to runaway from Miller and his gang, but Kane refuses. Kane asks people in the town to help, nut they wont, and Kane is left to fight the gang alone. As noon approaches, the tension and urgency rises as everyone knows they might be the death of Marshal Kane. When noon came, Miller and his gang are at the station like they said. The fighting begins quickly and it is a three on one shootout between Marshal Kane and Miller's gang. Kane starts to get cornered in, but Kane's wife helps out and shoots one of the gang members as Marshal Kane finishes the rest off. The Marshal can now safely leave town and enjoy his life with his newly wedded wife.",

            "content": "The following contains some information regarding some of the plot, though not the ending of the movie.High Noon works because of its mythic story line. Will Kane is a man who must do the thing he must despite everyone who loves him and whom he loves aggressively trying to stop him from doing it. He is alone. He against difficult odds. He fully expects to die in his attempt, but he must continue with his mission. Often in the film characters are aware of the qualities that make Kane act as he does, but the characters can not put it into words. They essentially sum it up with a summation of \"If you don't know, I can't explain it to you.\" It has to be so because the qualities that make human beings do the truly difficult things in life are ineffable.The movie is not without flaws. The acting of the principals is terrible. Only Katy Turado as Helen Ramirez is at all believable. Gary Cooper is stilted, as always, and Grace Kelly is a pretty face. Despite the actors, the scenes and images are what carry the day. Who can forget the image of Will Kane alone on the street awaiting his doom? Or the view down the railroad tracks for the train that will bring destiny? Or the two women, one with a dark dress, dark skin and a dark past, and the other the very antithesis, riding past Kane on the street leaving him alone.Also a drawback is the constant refrain of the ballad that seems to run through Kane's mind as if he, at some level, knows that part of what he must do is to become one of the legends of the West. The use of the song is partly redeemed when we last hear \"Do not forsake me, O my darling,\" and we realize that it is his home that forsook him, not his bride after all.",

This is the way producer Stanley Kramer and director Fred Zinnemann took to the classic western High Noon, Zinnemann would go on to direct another classic, From here to Eternity. This film is Spartan in virtually every way, from the low-key acting of Gary Cooper to its virtually real-time exposition of the events in Hadleyville to its black and white presentation. At just 85 minutes in length, this is an outstanding example of how a film can succeed by avoiding excess. Cameraman Floyd Crosby's years of filming New Deal documentaries is evident in the film's sparseness, static compositions, and authentic feel. This simple, stark, low-budget Western classic with a total budget of $750,000, was shot in a mere 31 days and nominated for seven Academy Awards. High Noon was notable for its complicated psychological themes not normally seen in traditional westerns. There was also a great deal of action taking place behind the scenes during the making of the film. Filmed during the time of the Hollywood Blacklisting, High Noon was a collaboration of both sides of the issue. Screenwriter Carl Foreman was a Communist sympathizer whose blacklisting Cooper managed to postpone until the end of filming. The film's screenplay was his last Hollywood film before blacklist exile to London. Cooper himself was a staunch anti-Communist, Tex Ritter had strong Republican leanings, Stanley Kramer was a declared liberal and Lloyd Bridges and Howland Chamberlain both were blacklisted. John Wayne, a hard-core right-winger, declared the film to be the most \"un-American\" movie he had ever seen. Not only was he displeased with the political composition of the film's staff, but also having a plot in which a marshal would plead for help from people of the town disgusted him. The final gunfight was not played out in traditional \"John Wayne\" fashion, with two men staring down one another across an empty expanse of street, with a lone tumbleweed blowing around in the background, instead, it's quick and dirty, with a cowardly hostage-taking and a man being shot in the back by a woman none the less. Director Howard Hawks and the \"Duke\" both responded to what they perceived as being the liberal preachiness of this 'un-American' film and its cowardly townspeople by creating a no-nonsense, right wing rebuttal, Rio BravoCast out of traditional character, Cooper took on the role as Marshal Will Kane. Sergeant York and as Lou Gehrig in Pride of the Yankees had Gary Cooper portrayed as staunch, fearless and unquestionably brave. Audience reaction to the all to human Will Kane was that of the shock when in biblical passage, Christ calls out in pain asking why his father has forsaken him. Cooper instills Kane with equal parts dignity and humanity. There's no doubt that he's a hero, but, unlike the usual cowboy hero, he is filled with doubts and all-too-human weaknesses. These are frailties each of us finds in ourselves; seeing them in Kane allows us to identify with him intimately and makes the film more personal. In 1952, the movie was unsettling for some audiences because they were unprepared to see a reflection of themselves on the screen. They expected an invulnerable hero; they got simply, a man. The ravaged look etched on a 51 year old Gary Cooper's gaunt face was due to an actual recurring hip problem, bleeding stomach ulcers, and lower back pain as well as the emotional stress due to his recent breakup with actress Patricia Neal. When Gary Cooper was given a special Oscar in 1961, his friend and fellow star Jimmy Stewart accepted the award for him and revealed that Cooper was dying of cancer. Cooper died less than a month later.High Noon has also has been interpreted as a tale of the Cold War and US foreign policy during the Korean War. The solitary, stoic, honor-bound marshal/hero, past his prime, already retired, who is left desolate and abandoned by the Hadleyville townspeople he had faithfully protected for many years is representative of the United States, symbolic of the post World War II years. The townspeople's cowardice represents the cooperative witnesses before the HUAC. The deadly four-man group of outlaws could be perceived as being symbolic of the aggressive threat in the Korean War, or the HUAC itself. High Noon complex in its simplicity plays effectively on various levels, political, sociological as well as well as psychological.As well as setting the benchmark for Westerns to come, High Noon was also credited for launching the careers of four notables of the silver screen, Grace Kelly who would be discovered by Alfred Hitchcock. She would later go on become Princess Grace of Monaco. Lloyd Bridges would later find lasting fame on the small screen in Sea Hunt and Henry Morgan would attain television viewer's lasting love as Col. Sherman Potter in the iconic series M.A.S.H. and lastly the Spaghetti Western favorite, Lee Van Cleef.",

            "content": "I first must say this: i care not for westerns. now that that's out of the way, this was pretty fair. I can't say I cared too much for Gary Cooper's performance. It seemed stale. (i was gonna add a clever simile but I'm drawing a blank here.) Grace Kelly is beautiful and amazing and this lawyer fellow played by a Mr Otto Kruger was simply superb, totally stomping the yard all over Cooper's acting and totally introducing me to now one of my new favorite supporting actors (Kruger where hast thou been? Supporting some lesser actors?) He shoulda been in some lead roles! The story made me reminisce of Tombstone (a movie that's a little too close to my bosom. I was thinking of applying a restraining order on it at some point..mainly on Val Kilmer) only to my gleeful surprise the the marshal received no help xcept for his wife at the end. iT WAS THE GREAT BADASS story of one against many for that one has the only pair of cajones in the entire town (You're all cowards townsfolk! Cowards!). And as I proclaimed in the summary, the shoot out was indeed worth the build up... it's actually quite a short movie...maybe that's why I liked it. There wasn't very much dilly dallying. Side-qualm: The musical score is a bit much and heavy with the cheddar in terms of lyrics. but its bearable . It looks nice, it's concise and has some grand supporting actors 6.7 / 10",

            "content": "Will Kane (Gary Cooper), the longtime sheriff of Hadleyville, New Mexico Territory, has just married Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), a very religious and pacifist young woman. Right after the wedding, the town knows that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), is going to arrive on the noon train. He was a criminal brought to justice by Will Kane. Will Kane, forced by his wife and the people in the town, leaves with Amy, but Kane wants to protect the people in the town, even when they don't want him in there, and they come back. Frank Miller is looking for revenge and he is coming with 3 more gangsters to give death to Kane.

            "review_title": "A western with current political implication and European veins",
            "content": "the concept was not new nor was it the best of the western genre, but with a few added twists the story surpasses other westerns in terms of meaning and novelty of production.As many already know, the duration of the story is also the duration of the film. this lends to tension but also the inevitable failure of its tiresome western style ending. We know whats happening, how much time is left, and that the protagonist or \"good guys\" will inevitably prevail. However, for all its negatives, the actors were able to take advantage of it and show how 2 hours is enough to destroy a mans confidence and bring his friends to despair. The novelty of its timing paired with other elements, was not a detriment.The movie had farther reaching implication. There are a few common strains of which most westerns seem to derive. The man who must single handedly defend a town of old men and defenseless women. The man who is lonesome but essentially good, who ends up accomplishing political or moral good without initially intending. Or something derived from the classical battle of good vs evil. This movie had no good. We were initially led to believe that kane was a headstrong and moral man defending a town against the evil Miller, only to find out that no one would help him, and even his fellow deputy wanted him to leave. Subsequently we realize that Kane is not defending the town nor is it better for anyone that he stay.Kane exchanges his own needs for those of the people he tirelessly strove to protect for many years. His own need is to see justice served, but a man of law is sworn to --protect & serve-- . From a European director, could this be a shot at imperialism? A country that has sworn to protect and serve others is now only serving its exported ideals? Its hard not to side against Kane; we would expect the towns people to help him out of gratitude for the years he has put in. His stubbornness not only loses him his friends, but also breaks the bonds he once held with the towns. an analogy for European identity, imperialism, etc? Whatever the meaning, recognize that this western does not tread the familiar ground.",

            "review_title": "Phenom western movie",
            "content": "Some remarks tell a lot about their authors' artistic conceptions. Howard Hawks said that \"High Noon\" wasn't his idea \"of a good Western\". John Wayne went even further, saying it was the most \"un-American thing\" he ever saw. Even Roger Ebert disliked the film and so did many viewers who -I guess- expected fights, chases, vast landscapes and other Western archetypes.I find these views artistically oppressive. Fred Zinnerman's masterpiece Phenom western movie. \"High Noon\" is a pure and authentic western with an innovative psychological dimension, incarnated by Will Kane, Gary Cooper in a career-defining role, and more than in any film, sublimated by a beautifully haunting song. 'Do not forsake me oh my darling' The first notes with their catchy poetry and lyric purity, plunged me into the heart of the film, penetrating mine. The genius of Dimitri Tiomkin's song is its total embodiment of the film's inspirational message of moral duty and obligation, about a man who must face the killer whose rhyming name is Frank Miller, and ask his woman to stick with him. And as the song is like hummed throughout the score, I couldn't help but feel a total empathy to Will Kane, Hadleyville's Marshall, and ask myself, what would have I done if I was Kane? Or a more disturbing question: if I was a member of the town?These interrogations takes a darker significance when put in the context of the film's release : the McCarthyism. The story has valid reasons to have been called \"un-American\", as this absurd word totally fits this infamous period. It's about a man, in danger of death, finding out that none of his friends, of the citizens he protected, volunteers to help him, standing for him against a deadly enemy, but all push him to leave Hadleyville, in a town's self-preservation impulse. The McCarthyism allegory of the blacklisted Carl Foreman's script couldn't have been more explicit. The most iconic shot of the film, is Gary Cooper standing alone, while a slow zoom out reveals a deserted street while you can see the frustration of a man, abandoned to his fate.It's a pessimistic view intelligently tackled by Foreman's script. All these people have 'reasons', starting by Amy, Kane's Quaker wife, Grace Kelly as the fair-haired beauty who rejects violence, and doesn't want to trade her new white dress for a black one. Some friends refuse to help Kane out of obvious cowardice, or admittance of physical or outnumbered weakness. \"Thou Shall Not Kill\" says the reverend and the people in church start a whole argument until the Mayor makes a long speech concluding that Hadleyville's prosperity asks for Kane to leave the town -and transfer the shootout out of it. Harvey, the immature deputy, played by a young Lloyd Bridges, wants to take the credit alone but conveniently drops his tin star when Kane refuses to name him Marshall. And finally, as stated by the cynical judge, sometimes, returning tyrants can be acclaimed as heroes by the very city that banished them, an irony demonstrated by the cheerful reception of Ben Miller in the saloon.Frank Miller's arrival ultimately highlighted Hadleyville's hypocrisy and meaninglessness of Kane's tin star. And from the announcement, we follow in real time, Kane's vain attempts to recruit a posse. The doors constantly slammed in his face make him more endearingly heroic as a man who faces an unfair adversity. Asked to leave the town, he obstinately stays and stands alone. Kane can't leave the town without a Marshall although he knows Miller comes for him. But he knows he couldn't escape forever, he must face him. Cooper hardly smiles during the film, his face almost agonizing with an increasing pain devouring his heart as he's realizing some disturbing truths. He embodies the tragedy of a man, left alone to vultures. He deserved the Oscar in this performance that exuded the bravery of a man who sticks to his moral duty despite fear, doubts, hesitations, even weaknesses. Will Kane is one of the most fascinatingly inspiring cinematic characters, rightfully named #5 hero in AFI's Top 50 list.And the one who understands Kane, as we do, is Helen Ramirez, the beautiful Katy Jurado who should have won an Oscar for her performance. Obviously shocked, she tells Amy that if she can't understand Kane, it's useless. Katy loved Kane after being Miller's girlfriend. She enriches Kane and Miller's antagonism, by making it more personal, deadlier. Helen Ramirez mirrors the viewer's fascination toward Kane and a true contempt for the townspeople.",
