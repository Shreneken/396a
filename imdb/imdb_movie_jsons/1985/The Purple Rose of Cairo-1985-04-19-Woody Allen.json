            "content": "\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" poetically defines what it means to love movies through the story of Cecilia, an ordinary woman whose cinematic passion plays as a back-and-forth ticket to escape from the Great Depression (literally).But this era also coincided with the Golden Age of Hollywood films : adventure movies, romances, screwball comedies or films-noir, the decade started with an immediate transition from the silent era to the talkies, allowing so many genres to finally emerge on the screen. And people came to see movies because of this constant capacity to surprise, to create new worlds, to become the ultimate escapism with a popular appeal, incarnated by the magical opening image of Astaire and Rogers dancing \"Cheek to Cheek\". Cinema is ordinary people living extraordinary moments.This is what loving movies is about, and this translates Cecilia's obsession with films as a desperate need to forget about her lousy husband and her waitress' job, two situations she handles with a poignant, if not annoying, clumsiness, beautifully embodied by Mia Farrow's natural vulnerability. Cecilia, like anyone, can go to the movies, but more than anyone, she needs them. The only bits of enthusiasm in her voice and her eyes are hinted when she talks about movies, and her shy heart suddenly becomes passionate, only a movie lover can understand this weird state of constant amazement.Cecilia's endearing quality also is her poignant weakness, as she uses movies to fantasize on improbable love stories the way women used to do with literary romances. Cecilia enjoys films in an old fashioned way, not an intellectual appreciation or some sort of quest for a deep meaning. This is the nostalgic aspect of \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" , an ode to these times where distraction and amusement were simple, when people's eyes were easily amazed and their hearts easily thrilled, when Cecilia needed to watch the titular film, over and over again, to forget about the job she just lost, and the husband (Danny Aiello) she couldn't lose. In a way, the film's atmosphere foreshadows the tone of Woody Allen's \"Radio Days\" with an extra fantasy element (literally again)Cecilia indeed lives in a fantasy that spectacularly materializes on the pivotal moment where \"The Purple Rose\" hero emerges from the screen to finally meet her, provoking a chaotic situation that none of the audience or the still on-screen characters can handle. And this is where Allen's genius writing emerges too, when I applauded, excited to see where would lead the romance between Cecilia and Tom Baxter, the explorer, played by the actor Gil Sheperd, played by Jeff Daniels. And Allen's approach is subtly iconoclast in the way it totally denudes the characters by underlining the gap between their unreal qualities and the real world.First fascinated, we start looking at them with very compassionate eyes. Tom is like a child impressed by this world, his life freed from any script's diktat, but whose journey with the prostitutes reveals him as an asexual character ... no money, no sex, no religion, Baxter's Utopian background betrays the Disney-like innocence of these old movies and the dead-end aspect of his real-world adventure. The irony is that he mirrors Cecilia's own condition, as a woman with no job, no money, not even a sexual life, so she would be living the same life with Tom but happily. So the process in reversed and Cecilia gets in the film to live with Tom, in a world where the only colors inhabit Tom and Cecilia's hearts.But as much as we enjoy seeing the thought-provoking inventive script exploited to its core, this part only reflects the dream-like quality of the movies, as illustrated in the most hilarious moment in the film, when the restaurant maitre d' realizes he's allowed to do whatever he wants, and starts a spectacular tap dance number. It reminded me of these lucid dreams where you allow yourself to go as far as you can, movies are nothing but artistic lucid dreams, after all. And the most delightful ones lead to the most painful wakes, and I consider the script to be one of the best thanks to the genius idea of confronting Tom Baxter with Gil Shepherd who, in an ironic twist, pretends to be in love with Cecilia in his attempt to convince his alter-ego to get back to screen.What follows is a love triangle and a cruel dilemma for Cecilia, torn between an unreal and a virtual reality, virtual not as the opposite of real, but of actual, of Cecilia's current life. What is virtual is potential, might happen and will happen, and this is where Cecilia's fragile naivety conditions the sad conclusion of the film, confirming that nothing in Allen's scripts is irrelevant. Cecilia chooses Gil over Tom, Tom understanding real life's cruelty gets back on-screen and Gil to Hollywood after having accomplished his mission, with Cecilia as a collateral heart's damage. Realizing her one-way ticket to Paradise was phony, she sadly returns back to her husband who warned her that life was not like the movies. Allen just furnished the cynical proof.Cecilia was obsessed with unreal stuff, while her heart was broken by something virtual, because of her trust on a real man, not a character, this is the alibi for movies, and Allen's ending with Cecilia enjoying again the sight of Astaire and Rogers proves that she doesn't blame it on the movies. The bittersweet last shot shows Cecilia as one of these poor souls, not heroic in their acts, but in their faith in humanity and people, despite the encountered treacheries and deceptions, the ending reminds of \"Night of Cabiria\", Fellini's masterpiece about another woman's heart victim of her own goodness.And despite all the hell Cecilia went through, her illuminated eyes prove that with movies, she'll always have her back-and-forth ticket for Heaven, even for one short moment, she'll feel she is in Heaven ...",

            "content": "Woody Allen's Purple Rose of Cairo is a brilliant piece of film-making. He combines drama, comedy and even a little bit fiction (people jumping out of movie screens into the real world). Its a great story involving a woman with marital problems played superbly by Mia Farrow. Here Farrow gives one of her best performances, much better than she was in a film i recently viewed called Shadows and Fog. Jeff Daniels is also good in his role as the movie character who comes into the real world, as well as the actor who plays that role. This is by far one of the most complex yet well written Woody Allen flicks. All the performances are good as well as the direction and writing, almost everything is perfect. A must-see for any Woody fan.10/10 #60 on my list of all-time favorite films",

            "content": "Mia Farrow is wonderful as Cecilia, a small town waitress during the Great Depression. Married to a selfish lout named Monk (Danny Aiello), she's often in need of escape. And she finds it in the movies that she repeatedly watches. One day, to the astonishment of Cecilia and everybody in the theatre, movie character Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) emerges from his picture and enters the real world. He's become utterly taken with her, and is sick and tired of his dull routine, uttering the same lines over and over. Life becomes even more surreal for Cecilia when Gil Shepherd (Daniels again), the actor who played Tom, comes to the town to do damage control and HE falls in love with her as well!\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is an ingenious concept film, well realized by writer / director Woody Allen. It's utterly charming, especially to any fan of the cinema. Some of the brightest moments happen when A) the other characters in the film-within-the-film become utterly lost, and just mope around, interacting with theatre patrons, and B) the golly-gee-whiz completely naive Tom is taken by prostitute Emma (Dianne Weist) to a whorehouse, where he seems to have no idea what goes on in such a place!The recreation of a Depression era town is effective, as is Woody's emulation of classic 1930s black & white Hollywood pictures. Dick Hyman does the upbeat jazz score, and the excellent cinematography is the work of masterful Gordon Willis.Mia and Jeff are just perfect, with the latter getting to do a memorable scene with the character and the actor arguing with each other. Aiello and Weist lead an excellent supporting cast consisting of talents such as Edward Herrmann, John Wood, Karen Akers, and Van Johnson, and top character actors like Irving Metzman, Milo O'Shea, Robert Trebor, John Rothman, Raymond Serra, and Michael Tucker. Glenne Headly has a bit as one of the hookers.Clever through and through in its melding of reel life and real life, with both fictional and actual people struggling to come to terms with their new surroundings. The finale, however, really does break your heart.Eight out of 10.",

            "content": "A movie I like to recommend to people who really dislike Woody Allen (because of his on-screen characters or off-screen life).  And I usually get positive feedback.....he does not appear in this movie, and that makes sense because there really are no characters he could play in The Purple Rose of Cairo.  It is a hugely entertaining movie--one of his best.  Sharp, hilarious, and poignant.  And anyone who can keep a dry eye for that ending must be a machine. This is the movie where Jeff Daniels really gets to strut his best comic stuff.  He's always been underrated in my opinion.  He's terrific at playing the \"Everyman,\" but in Allen's movie he has a duel role--the clueless movie hunk who leaps off the screen to be with Mia Farrow, and the frustrated actor who plays him.  Farrow is also good, back to playing mousey after her bold turn in Broadway Danny Rose. I really can't say enough about this.  I would rank it as his best film of the '80s.  I never get tired of watching it.  I don't like using this adjective, but it seems to fit the movie....it is magical.",

            "content": "The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)There's no way you can't like the ingenuity of the movie, and the fun it has. It's about the joy of life, and love of the movies, and the difficulty to tell the difference sometimes (at least when in the theater). In some ways this is one of Woody Allen's lightest movies, and certainly lightweight compared to the more serious movies of this period (like the stunning gem, \"Another Woman\"). It's not zany like his earliest comedies (\"Love and Death\"). And it's not deeply observant and sometimes downright moving and brilliant like his best movies (like \"Annie Hall\" or \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\"). In that way it feels like what some novelists would call an \"entertainment\" to distinguish from their heavier masterpieces, and sometimes these are the most readable of all. Or the most watchable.\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is inventive, warm, and touching. It's really high brow hilarious when the people on the screen react to the situation, not only because of the existential reality shift going on, but because they are all high brow types. Then there are the everyday scenes with Mia Farrow, the lead actress in the real world (usually), and support from Danny Aiello, really just a foil for the main romances (two) going on with Farrow (singular). It's not as complicated as it sounds, which might prove the elegance of Allen's writing. A beautiful, delicate movie without undo weightiness. Joyous, yes, even in its melancholy end.",

            "content": "Woody's stories are often derivative, but he's forgiven that, usually, because the results are good and ultimately do deserve his signature.  For PURPLE ROSE, he swipes Buster Keaton's gimmick in SHERLOCK, JR., then lets his imagination run free as he did in the best of his NEW YORKER stories. We wind up with the most fascinating and realistic meditation regarding what it is to be an audience, a viewer's relationship to art, art's relationship to reality.  The triumph is amazing, because, despite the depth of the symbolism, PURPLE ROSE can also be seen as sheer entertainment; on its surface, it is still one of the most entertaining pictures Woody has ever made.Farrow and Aiello are marvelous here; Mia, who is quite underrated, has only been as good once -- in BROADWAY DANNY ROSE.  The photography is superb, influenced perhaps by Edward Hopper with generally less obvious light sources.Splendid, splendid work.",

            "content": "THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO has got to be one of the most original and inventive of all the films Woody Allen has done--and all the more enjoyable because we're not subjected to the Allen character in the film itself. Instead, we get MIA FARROW (one of her very best performances) and JEFF DANIELS in what has to be the most original role of his career, as the man who walks off the movie screen and into Farrow's humdrum life.Farrow is the Depression-era movie fan whose film idol walks right off the screen and interjects himself into her life--brightening it, at least for awhile, until the rather downbeat ending. DANNY AIELLO, as Mia's abusive husband and DIANNE WIEST have good supporting roles, but the story really depends on the wonderful chemistry between Farrow and Daniels--and they truly bring the bittersweet comedy and fantasy to credible life.Furthermore, the script is not only very clever, but the film is technically brilliant in the way it has the film within a film characters on the screen interacting with the movie audience.Summing up: Stylish mixture of comedy and fantasy, fully deserving the many nominations and awards it won that year.",

I've seen several others copy this sort of thing, although it also was done in some silent comedies, too, if memory serves. Nonetheless, it was done well here and I got a kick out of watching it back in the '80s. It's part fantasy, romance, drama, comedy. Woody Allen, who made this movie, is not on screen. I have found (with one or two exceptions) that I like the best when he only narrated, such as in \"Radio Days\" and \"Sweet And Lowdown.\" I like it when he leaves the acting to others.Mia Farrow as \"Cecilia\" Jeff Daniels does a terrific job in a dual role, playing Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd. One an actor, the other a \"real-life\" guy.

Each project adopts a different set of ideas he finds, so the whole body of work is a sort of encyclopedia of notions about self-reference and folding. In a way, what films you like are determined by what set of ideas you use in your own home world of film. This one is often compared to `Sherlock Jr,' where a projectionist enters the world of film. There is a framing element of that notion here, with Mia's fantasies. The fantasy we see is the other way around, which is more clever: the world of fiction entering the `real' world.It's an amazing idea, until here always found in science fiction in the form of `virtual' or artificial beings seeking a more human existence. Mapping it to film is an imaginative leap. It is as if the viewer creates something that in turn creates the viewer.Everyone lives in their own movie, and for most of us that movie controls us.Inside that film world, Woody comes up with some clever ideas: each screen has its own world, parallel with the other instances of that film. The characters are aware of repeating each instance; some would rather be doing something else. Without a script, they are lost.At this point, Woody was changing girlfriends, and switching therapists from Freudian to Jungian. It shows.Ted's evaluation: 3 of 3 \u0096 worth watching",

            "content": "The Purple Rose of Cairo really does rate up there with Woody's best - from Annie Hall, Manhattan to the earlier, more slapstick efforts, such as Love and Death and Sleeper. Cairo happens to be one of the best 80's movies Woody actually made - Crimes and Misdeameanours and Braodway Danny Rose being other greats.The reason why I think that Cairo is better than the other 80's efforts is that the idea is really inventive. The movie raises so many questions of reality and fantasy, but does so in a highly surreal fashion. The switching of scenes, from reality to fantasy (movie) made me realise where movies take us as a viewer. Cecelia finds solace in the world of movies and comes up against the decision of which is better - the perfect world of movie, or reality, where things are never certain.Jeff Daniels is so enigmatic in this movie. Not only as Tom, the screen legend, but as Gil the actor. Two very different characters, both played brilliantly. Mia Farrow is great as usual, and shows how broad her talent is (Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days - both very different characters. Danny Aiello is good as the lazy slob-of-a-husband, Monk.Like Radio Days, Woody isn't actually on screen (he narrated Radio Days, mind) and in a way this eased me up. Woody is fantastic when he is on screen, but this film benefited from losing his neurotic nature, and instead concentrated on the era, the love of movies and the complex themes of a movie within a movie. I will admit, some neurosis is retained in the dialogue (talk of morality to prostitutes!) - and this added to the surreal nature of the movie.This has to be one of my favourite films Woody has directed. Annie Hall probably being my fave, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdeamenours and Sleeper following. Cairo is so constantly fresh and inventive, I couldn't help being captivated during it's short running time. I recommend this to any fan - or any lover of movies themselves. A real treat.",

She works in a diner, and when she tries to forget her lousy life in the Depression she turns to the movies. Currently she is seeing a \"B\" feature again and again called THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, about a bunch of bored socialites (Edward Herrmann, John Woods, Zoe Caldwell, Van Johnson) who go to Egypt for a change. They meet an archaeologist played by Jeff Daniels, who is trying to find a mythical flower (the one of the film title) that will lead to a true love. We see Farrow go again and again to the film until Daniel starts noticing her and asks if she really likes the film that much. This unsettles Farrow who leaves the theater. But she returns and she sees that Daniel is interested in her. Interested enough to leave the film, much to the consternation of Herrmann and the other characters in the film because they are trained by the fact that they were shot in a way by the film company and edited to follow the same pattern forever. So the characters are at a loss at how to continue. Also they can't leave the film (as Daniel did).Allan is one of the few directors brave enough to look at philosophical situations in his film. Here it is the odd rules governing reality and falsity. The world of the movie is as rigid as that of the real world, despite the cinematic Daniel's discovery of color and real space in the outside world. The real world requires real training (not the idiotic false title the cinematic Daniels has as a so-called archaeologist) and real money (Daniels has fake money on him from the movie set). But the characters in the film are losing their mind for being unable to go ahead with the plot without Daniels. That is some of them are: the actress playing the African-American maid in the movie becomes more real in her not acting like a female stereotype (she takes off her shoes and plots down on a couch, to the dismay of the others).The revolt sensed by Daniels stepping out of the screen spreads consternation in other worlds: the theater management and the movie company see it as a threat of left wingers trying to undermine the American film industry. Indeed, we hear that other copies of the film have incidents elsewhere in the country. The film company sends the real Daniel to the site where his character came to life, and soon it is Daniel v. Daniel wooing Farrow. Who will she choose - and will she choose wisely, between a naive fictional character who adores her and a man of flesh and blood and potential, who is ambitious and devious? But what is wisdom in such a choice?THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO is one of those films that makes one look twice at reality in the world we inhabit, and the world that we seek to enter through our imaginations. It is an exceptionally clever film, and a very funny one. Certainly one of Allan's top five movies.",

            "content": "Purple Rose of Cairo, The (1985)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Woody Allen's terrific fantasy centers around an abused wife (Mia Farrow) who finds her happiness going to the local movie theater. The latest film is one she falls in love with and while watching it repeatedly she falls for its leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) who eventually notices her in the crowd, walks off the screen and into her life. This doesn't sit too well with the woman's husband (Danny Aiello) or the actor who played Baxter on the screen (also played by Daniels). There's no doubt that Allen's screenplay has a nod to Buster Keaton's SHERLOCK JR., which features Keaton playing a movie nut who walks into the movie. As with that film, the level as writing is just so perfect that you really can't help but fall in love with the characters even if the story is so far-fetched that you could poke holes in how it plays out. The performances, direction and screenplay are so flawless that you can overlook what happens in the story because everyone makes you want to believe what's going on can really happen and I think Allen really does do a terrific job at expressing how a movie can make you forget your troubles and go off into a fantasy world. At just 82-minutes the movie is extremely fast-paced as the writer-director really doesn't waste any time getting us going and he perfectly tells us everything we need to know about the characters within the first ten-minutes. We meet Farrow, see her poor life and can understand what she gains from the movies. Even the Aiello character is perfectly written as is both roles played by Daniels. I won't ruin the ending but it's said that producers begged Allen to change it as they felt they'd have a major hit on their hands but thankfully Allen stuck to his guns. Again, I won't give anything away but the ending is one of the most perfect ever filmed and it says so much without having to resort to any lame dialogue. Farrow and Daniels are simply perfect together as their chemistry jumps off the screen at each second they're together. Daniels is really impressive as his has to play two parts and do them so differently. Aiello is also perfect as the jerk husband and Diane Weist is also quite good in her small part. Farrow easily steals the film in what has to be called one of her greatest performances if not her very best. I just really loved the wide-eyed nature Farrow brought to the part and especially some of the early scenes where she's in the theater falling in love with what she's seeing on the screen. I thought the actress did a remarkable job at making you feel for her character and you really do want to see her get out of the various troubles she's in. Allen's screenplay is certainly one of his most creative and while none of the laughs are as big as some might hope for, I think he does a marvelous job at getting all the magic in the film done right.",

This romantic fantasy tickles your funny bone and tugs at your heartstrings at the same time and I go through a myriad of emotions whenever I watch it. Mia Farrow stars as Celia, a depression era housewife, trapped in a dead end marriage to a pig (Danny Aiello) whose only escape comes from going to the movies. She goes to see the movie of the title several times and then at one show, the main character in the movie (played by Jeff Daniels)speaks to Celia directly from the screen saying, \"You must really love this movie, don't you?\" The character then walks off the screen and into Celia's life, claiming that he loves her and wants to be with her forever. Meanwhile, the actors in the movie on the screen are stuck and don't know what to do because they can't finish the movie without Daniels' character and they are seen conversing with each other about what to do and to the audience in the theater, who for some reason, sit and watch the actors on the screen trying to figure out what to do. Further complications arrive when the character starts walking off the screen in other theaters around the country and the actor who played the character (also Daniels) arrives in town to try to convince his character to go back in the movie. Woody doesn't delve into the territory of fantasy too much, but this one totally works with one of his most intelligent screenplays and winning performances from Farrow and Daniels and the ending is a heartbreaker.

            "content": "Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdeameanours, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters are among the best Woody Allen films to me, but as of now The Purple Rose of Cairo has replaced Husbands and Wives- still another of Allen's best- in the top 5. Even those who don't like Woody Allen may find that they might enjoy the film. With the luminous photography showing off the equally striking locations, The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of Allen's most visually stunning films, perhaps second to Manhattan. The music is memorable and understated, having a presence while not being overbearing. Allen's direction is more sympathetic than usual but every bit as thoughtful and assured, there is no signs of self-indulgence. The Purple Rose of Cairo has a truly wonderful script as well, there is the smart and witty touch that has Woody Allen all over it and also a genuine poignancy that has not been matched by many other Allen films. It is also very too the point and doesn't become rambling. The story has themes that anybody in the same situation can relate to, it's steadily paced but the writing, how the characters and their relationships are explored and the heart and truthfulness really captivate here, so it's never tedious. Other than the emotional impact, what makes The Purple Rose of Cairo perhaps one of Allen's most accessible and relatable is that it is one of his least neurotic, but even without that the characters are still compellingly real, which just goes to show that good writing and characters can happen without neurotises(and this is not meant in a bad way, it is a style that doesn't click with many but I've never had a problem with it). The ending is one that may fall flat with some but strike a chord with others, the latter was the case with me, but it is understandable why anybody would think otherwise because it does take a different tone to the rest of the film. The acting is great all round, Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels are incredibly charming and the performances from both rank among their best. Their chemistry also is magic. Overall, a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Cecilia is a New Jersey waitress during the great depression.  With a boring job and an abusive husband she longs to escape to the world of her favorite film `The Purple Rose of Cairo'.  During a repeat viewing the main character of the film notices her and decides to come down off the screen to meet her and start an unlikely love story.  However with the characters onscreen left in a void by Tom's disappearance and reports of other Toms breaking free, Tom's real life actor Gil Shepherd is called in to help reclaim his character.This is a charming little fantasy piece from Woody Allen using his other leading lady Mia Farrow.  The story is excellent and a real credit to Allen's writing.  The love story between Cecilia and Tom is slight but touching but my favorite pieces are the incident scenes.  The surreal chaos that Tom leaves behind him is really funny as all the characters simply lose motivation and carry on on-screen (to a packed out audience, eager to see what they'll do now!).Farrow is good as the wide eyed dreamer.  Daniels is great in two roles, even if his Tom is a little wet and weak.  Aiello is really good in his husband role and the rest of the cast are great in support.  Allen weaves a great film out of a story that needed to right touch to just keep it the right side of silly.  He blends emotions well and creates a genuinely moving story that still manages to have touches of his trademark surreal humour.Overall this is a good Woody Allen film.  It will appeal to fans because it is a great mix of comedy and romance.  It will appeal to those that don't usually like Woody because he's not in it - thus removing his ticks etc! The only criticism is that occasionally it feels like it's moving very slow, but this is a minor problem.",

            "content": "\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" was the first Allen's movie I saw back in Moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films. \"The Purple Rose...\" is wonderful, is one if Allen's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor, romance and drama, reality and fiction. It is the movie-within-the\u0096movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man (Danny Aiello). Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day, as she watches \"Purple Rose of Cairo\" for the 10th or maybe 15th time, the leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and \"trapped\" in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening. On the top of all, Tom Baxters in other theaters try to leave \"Purple Rose of Cairo\", too... It is not the first or last time Allen has played with the concept of the thin line (in this film, the silver screen) that divides film's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet, gentle, sad, technically realized and simply terrific as \"Purple Rose of Cairo\".9/10",

Luminous Farrow is at her most vulnerable, and writer-director Woody Allen allows her to be funny too, yet the film is a preconceived, bittersweet whimsy about dashed dreams; it's ready-made to collapse. In the interim, we get bland Jeff Daniels in two roles (occasionally working the same scene!), a whorehouse full of romantics, a group of acidly funny movie actors on a theater screen, and Danny Aiello as Mia's abusive husband. The theme of \"Cairo\" concerns the blurred line between movies and reality--it's a valentine to the magic of the movies--but the central idea plays itself out too quickly, and Allen's sub-plots don't always work (you can sense that he's biding his time).

            "content": "During the Depression, Cecilia escapes her dreadful life and abusive husband by going to the same movie again and again. And little does she know that while she is watching the movie, the movie is also watching her, particularly Tom Baxter, the star of the movie. And in the manner that Cecilia longs to escape into the focus of her own voyeurism, so too does Tom longs to escape into the focus of his, to break out of movie into reality, so he can be with Cecilia.Their voyeuristic objects are just inverted. She's watching the screen, completely unwitting that she is being watched. And he is watching out, voyeuristically relishing her voyeurism, knowing she does not realize his ogling. As a result, Woody Allen creates yet an extra metaphysical tier of voyeurism between his own film and us. We too, the watchers watching the film, are made conscious of our own standpoint, and our own urge to bond with the focus of our attention.It's as if the visual stare is so compelling as to be essentially boundless and infallible. God and film are equated. Tom can't fathom the things of the real world, but when Cecilia attempts to explain God to him, Tom equates the description of God with the filmmakers who made his movie. Everything considered, the filmmakers conceived him as a character. They decide the plot of his reality, and they are the conclusive judges of his existence.Together with this interpretation of unlimited voyeurism, one also sees aspects of Woody's artistic and creative moral code. By the end, Cecilia has been obligated to decide between her real life and going into the movie eternally: she must decide between reality and fantasy, to be eternally entrenched within the affectedly artful universe of fantasy, where she can become what she wants, live her dreams, and command her fate. But then what is reality if you can indeed control that much?When Woody every so often makes a movie that departs from his usual formula, I'm doubly pleased. The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most brilliantly weaved and most original stories I've ever seen on film. It doesn't even just stop at the inventive and inspired premise. The film manages to arouse every emotion. It's hilarious, it's romantic, it's heartbreaking.In all, The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most effective movies I have ever seen in stimulating one's sense of imagination and fantasy. I'm getting corny and about now is where I realize that there's nothing else specific that I can substantially comment on. I mean, the acting is great, the camera-work is fine, et cetera. But it's inarguably one of Woody Allen's best films. It's proof that he is one of the greatest, funniest, and smartest screenwriters.",

Everything he took on whether it be romance, comedy, mockumentary, or fantasy, he managed with unparallelled panache and creativity. In The Purple Rose of Cairo he delivers a film that is so wonderfully balanced between the lines of fantasy and reality that it truly strikes at the heart of cinematic genius.The basic plot is that Cecilia, played by Mia Farrow, is unemployed and in an abusive marriage in the midst of Depression-era New Jersey, and her one method of escape from the drudgery of her surroundings is via the movies. One day whilst watching her favourite film for the fifth time one of the characters suddenly starts interacting with her and from there starts a chain of events that range from the absurd to the deeply touching, handled in a way that only Woody Allen could pull-off.It may be easy for younger cineastes to underrate Woody Allen and his contribution to cinema based on the Luke-warm fare that is now attached to his name but for anyone curious about one the most inventive, hilarious and brilliant film directors to have emerged in the entirety of cinema's history, watching films like this one will reveal just how brilliant Woody Allen is at his best.This film is a meditation on the nature of existence, reality and love, reflecting on the merits of escapism versus the value of acceptance of reality, whilst also being extremely entertaining and immensely original and creative.It should also be mentioned that Mia Farrow's performance is one of the most enchanting I have ever witnessed. What a lovely and wonderful film created by one of cinema's greatest talents.10/10",

            "content": "Yes, it was a depressing time for many who could only find solace in the movies, and for troubled housewife Mia Farrow, the only way out is her regular visits to her local cinema. One of the characters in the movies notices her repeat visits after she walks out on her husband (Danny Aiello) and is fired from her job, and before you can say, \"Action!\", he is walking off the screen and grabbing her so he can find life on the outside of the celluloid closet. Jeff Daniels, one of the brightest finds of the 1980's, has such an innocence and spirit in his acting, that after playing the wise-cracking husband of Debra Winger's in \"Terms of Endearment\" seemed perfect for these types of wide-eyed roles. Of course, he's playing two characters: the character in the movie (\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\") and the actor, Biff Baxter, who played him, and it must be up to Biff to get his character to return to the screen so his career isn't ruined.\"Do you really want another guy walking around?\" someone asks, while one of the movie characters makes a comment about men who walk around wearing pith helmets. Director and writer Woody Allen kept himself off of the screen for this one classic 80's vehicle, and ends up with one of his very best movies, practically perfect. It is a throw-back to the type of romantic films of the 1930's where the poor girl going through a bad time could find sudden adventure, dream about living a more glamorous life, and yet somehow have a bitter-sweet ending that could bring the hardest of New York audiences to tears, as is the case here. Farrow and Daniels are surrounded by a great supporting cast which includes Dianne Wiest as a big-hearted hooker (in her Woody Allen debut), Zoe Caldwell as a genuine countess with a lot of dough, and Van Johnson as her hanger- on social climber husband. The last two are part of the movie which also includes the typical Jean Harlow hard-boiled not so dumb blonde and a sassy black maid who once she has the freedom to escape from the script questions which one of the wealthy white characters is trying to sucker her. Annie Joe Edwards, who plays this part, would later get some good lines in on Jennifer Tilley in Allen's brilliant \"Bullets Over Broadway\". There's also nightclub/Broadway performer Karen Akers as the singer who is supposed to end up with Daniels on screen, Milo O'Shea as a priest, Edward Hermann as one of the dashing on-screen characters and that cute little old lady who played around with the Fruit of the Loom underwear boys, Loretta Tupper, playing a music store owner who doesn't say a word but steals a brief scene when Daniels and Farrow come in to her shop. This is filled with a great 30's feel, some fantastic jazzy background music and a finale that is heartbreaking. When Fred and Ginger start dancing as Farrow looks on, you begin to hope that somehow they'll come off the screen as well. Stage legend Caldwell gets some of the wittiest lines in the screenplay, telling one of the audience members to \"Stop yapping because we've got problems of our own\", and insulting someone else with, \"If that's your wife, she's a tub of guts!\" Give yourself a little romance, Woody style, because beneath all that bad publicity surrounding his personal life with Farrow in years to come, he had a truly romantic heart which at least got to escape from his brain thanks to his pen.",

I speak, of course, about the silent era of filmmaking, back when a still-young Buster Keaton released the 45 minutes-long masterpiece entitled \"Sherlock, Jr.\"\nKeaton's use of illusions and smart editing mesmerised the audiences, creating one of the most important short-films ever made. Woody Allen, one of the most significant filmmakers of all-time, made his own version of \"Sherlock, Jr.\" back in 1985: The Purple Rose Of Cairo. \n \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\" is not only a tribute given to the works of Buster Keaton but also to the art of filmmaking itself. Woody Allen is never shown on the screen in this magical piece of cinema, but we can feel his presence everywhere. It's within the story, the script or, better said, the reel. We simply know he's there, even though we can't see him.\n The plot is simple: an everyday woman escapes everyday problems (including a not-so-caring husband played by Danny Aiello) by going to the cinema. She already watched \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" for about 4 times, but that doesn't stop her from watching it the 5th time when one of the characters (Tom Baxter, played by Jeff Daniels) is so impressed by how much she likes the movie that he jumps off the screen and runs away with her out of the cinema. Things go a little crazy of course, no story that plays with reality is simple. But what Woody Allen tries to tell us is that fantasy is just as important as reality itself, and it can help us remain sane. How many times have you said that one single book, film, or even song saved your day? That's the power fantasy has on us.\n \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\" is probably on of the most delightful films a cinephile could ever watch. It's beautifully crafted, funny, romantic and it has a lovely cast. It's not only the \"Sullivan's Travells\" of the 80's and Woody Allen's \"Sherlock, Jr.\", it represents the reason why we watch films and when you'll get to the final scene, you'll know what I mean.",

            "content": "There's sometimes a tendency to take for granted what Woody Allen can do when he makes films \"outside the box\". Usually, the box for Allen is considered to be tragic-comic takes on neurotic personalities in modern Manhattan. But a film like the Purple Rose of Cairo displays his gifts at spinning stories that are unexpected and, actually, really delightful. Years before he made Everyone Says I Love You, which was also a big 30's Hollywood homage, Purple Rose of Cairo was a nifty take on the separation between fantasy and reality (or as one of my friends calls 'magic realism') and how it relates to the depression and the escapism inherent in those fluffy romantic adventures. Cecille (Mia Farrow) is the one who takes the full trip down the movie-hole, so to speak, when she meets Tom (Jeff Daniels)- except that Tom is a movie character, who's seen Cecille so many times seeing him in the movie that he walks off the screen and falls in love with her. But things are complicated by two things- Cecille's brutish, one-track-minded husband (Danny Aiello), and the actor who's really playing Tom, Gil, who also falls for Cecille when he comes to town to rectify the situation. Meanwhile, the Purple Rose of Cairo's characters, on the screen I mean, seem to be completely unable to function.What Allen has best of all in this film is a deft ability to mix sensibilities all within a wonderfully fantastical backdrop. If anything else it also reminded me of was the recent Pan's Labyrinth, where a little girl left the dire problems of the real world, also with a brutish figure of ugly masculinity, and when in the fantasy world, even a flawed fantasy world, it's much more inviting than what the real world has to offer. But the question comes for Cecille, as it did for Ofelia in the other picture, how to balance the two, and what really should not be taken for granted. Can Tom really provide true love for Cecille, or Gil, or her real husband? Probably none completely, which makes up the sadder part of the picture. But Allen also has too much warmth going on, in humor as well as his affection for the up-front plastic appeal of 30s movie characters and atmosphere, to make things sour for too long. Farrow's totally empathetic as the waitress-turned-apple-of-Tom/Gil's-eyes, who brings out a really touching feeling in a viewer during the last minutes of the film, as she looks up at the screen and provides what Allen claimed *was* his happy ending. Daniels is also excellent in one of his best turns as a figurehead of innocence (i.e. when Tom's invited to the whorehouse) as well as Hollywood pragmatism that gets peeled away slightly. And Aiello, in his minutes on screen, adds that perfect level of crushing realism needed for the period.With a few unforgettable Allen moments, like when Cecille herself goes into the movie (and one character's self-realization after discovering the wonders of, gasp, improvisation), or when Tom can't pay for a meal cause he has 'movie-money', Purple Rose of Cairo is one of those fuzzy but rare treats in the movies where we're reminded why we go to the movies in the first place. It's a fable that's also rare for the filmmaker to take on, but as a sort of challenge he makes it one of his most charming and well-crafted films.",

            "content": "Woody Allen movies are often original or so unoriginal that they become original (\u0091Manhattan Murder Mystery' comes to mind). \u0091The Purple Rose of Cairo', a title that says nothing about the real content of the movie, belongs to the first category. It is about a woman Cecilia (Mia Farrow) who enjoys watching movies and on one day she visits the movie \u0091The Purple Rose of Cairo' and Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) suddenly steps off the screen into the theater and into the life of Cecilia. The problem is that Tom Baxter is the character of \u0091Purple Rose' and knows only things his character is supposed to know for that role. More problems occur when other Tom Baxters in other theaters want to step out of the movie as well. Of course there is also the actor who plays Tom Baxter who is named Gil Shepherd. Both Tom and Gil fall in love with Cecilia.Like I said the movie is pretty original. The way Allen plays with the possibilities of this fiction is done in a terrific way. There is a part where Tom ends up in a whorehouse and he has no idea what the women are talking about because his character didn't need to know these kind of things. It is one of the funny parts of the movie and a perfect example of how Allen uses the situations for funny moments.It is also the problem with the movie. Near the end we grow a little tired with the same kind of jokes over and over again. Every time we see how Tom Baxter is incapable of doing or understanding things, or the opposite, because his character has no idea of real life. Allen is a great filmmaker and therefore the movie does not get boring. When we are not entertained with the jokes anymore at least we can be entertained with originality of the story. The closing scenes are pretty standard and predictable but the ride up to that point was so interesting I was willing to forgive him that. There was probably no other way to end this entertaining and original piece of cinema.",

            "review_title": "One of five bona-fide Woody Allen masterworks.",
            "content": "The Purple Rose of Cairo shows us just how vital a filmmaker Woody Allen is when removed from the bumbling, neurotic caricature, who often overwhelms the broader aspects of his work. Along with Love and Death, Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours and Bullets Over Broadway, The Purple Rose... is a bona-fide masterpiece; one of the greatest American films of the last fifty years, and further proof that Allen is a filmmaker equal to the more celebrated likes of Coppola, Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, et al. Like those films aforementioned, Purple Rose demonstrates that Allen can take on board the influence of European cinema and combine it with a style of his own, creating a film that relies heavily on character and conversation, and yet, is totally enjoyable and occasionally very funny.The script is really one of Allen's best, combining a great and imaginative story with intelligent characters and believable scenarios... while the whole thing is made just that little more enchanting through the evocative recreation of depression era New Jersey, and the mannered, though no less impressive directorial flourishes from Allen. The cast is perfect too, managing to bring Allen's world to life, as well as presenting us with a believable emotional centre on which the director can navigate the more elaborate elements of the plot. Farrow has never been better as the put-upon dreamer swept up in her love of cinema, and, in particular, her dashing \"leading man in the making\" Gil Shepherd. As a result, the entire film, from almost the first frame to the last, can be seen as a treatise on the idea of escape and escapism, and how these ideas correlate with Farrow's character Cecilia, who, whilst attempting to escape from her life of drudgery, work and her cheating husband, becomes infatuated with Shepherd's latest film (also called The Purple Rose of Cairo) and his character Tom Baxter, a fearless adventurer cast adrift in the complicated world of New York's glittering social milieu.Allen's script, like his later film Crimes and Misdemeanours, is full of self-reference and contains many different layers that compliment the more obvious elements of the script perfectly. For example, Allen plays with the idea of mirroring; having a character within the film brought out of their natural habitat, and into a world that is completely alien. This is again referenced later when the same character (Tom Baxter) is brought out of that environment for a second time and dragged into the real world. Later, Cecilia is taken back into the film (within the film) on an adventure that mirrors the real life adventure the pair had previously been caught up in, before the third component of the story (Gil) is brought into the world of Cecilia... a place that is completely alien to his world of mansions, film premieres and celebrity parties!! These elements might sound confusing within the context of a review, however, the way Allen so casually places them within the plot is amazing. He never lets his ideas dwarf the story at hand, keeping the focus on the characters, whilst, simultaneously, playing a number of subtle games around them.The concept of fictional characters invading the world of the living (and vice-versa) is never fully explained, so really, it requires a great leap of faith and a little suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience to really buy into the 'deeper' aspects of the film. As a result, I think the film can be interpreted on two different levels... either the whole thing is just a series of unexplainable phenomenon, making The Purple Rose of Cairo a fantasy film as enchanting as Who Framed Roger Rabbit or E.T., or the whole thing can be seen as a figment of Cecilia's imagination. The film ends in such a way that Allen seems to be suggesting that none of these events ever took place... creating a circular narrative that makes it easy for us to see the journey that the character has (supposedly) undertaken to be completely redundant; something that has merely destroyed her faith in the world more so than before, and perhaps, left her even more desperate to experience the warming glow and friendly familiarity of the nearest cinema screen.As well as Farrow in the lead, there is fine support from Jeff Daniels as the exuberant character Tom Baxter and his bemused and frantic cinematic creator Gil - who manages to give the film a sense of heart, but also a bitter undercurrent - as well as small roles for Danny Aiello and Allen regular Diane Wiest. There's also some nice cameos from Edward Herrmann, Van Johnson, Zo\u00eb Caldwell and Milo O'Shea as some of Tom's bewildered supporting characters, left to sit and (literally) chew the scenery, as they find themselves without their pivotal lead player. The ending might be a little too downbeat for some... not wanting to give too much away, but Alan does have a tendency to leave his characters high and dry, sacrificing the feel good factor in favour of some important life lessons, and the intrusion of real-life's cynical streak.Regardless, The Purple Rose of Cairo is a fantastic film... one that draws you in with it's subtle and believable characterisations and eventually takes you completely by surprise with the deep emotional resonance of the plot. For me, it's one of Allen's masterpieces, and is proof that (along with Bullets Over Broadway) that he doesn't need to be in the film to deliver solid entertainment. It's certainly not as light as say, Love and Death, Annie Hall or Broadway Danny Rose, but it is lighter than the likes of Interiors, Another Woman and Manhattan. As a result, it'll probably appeal to the kind of people who don't normally appreciate Allen's particular blend of cinema, but really, regardless of personal tastes, this is a fantastic film.",

Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels) who played the role is brought in to fix the situation.This is a great concept from Woody Allen. I do wish that Jeff Daniels could differentiate his two characters better. Tom Baxter should be more swashbuckling and heroic. He should be a fantasy character. The husband is also a bit too much. He should be dialed back a little and maybe he shouldn't be violent.

Obviously, the whole concept is clever and well-executed, but Allen also managed to make the \"old\" movie footage look old, and Jeff Daniels is really, really good.

Although shorter than the average film, it says what it has to say without dawdling.Roger Ebert wrote, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo is audacious and witty and has a lot of good laughs in it, but the best thing about the movie is the way Woody Allen uses it to toy with the very essence of reality and fantasy.\" So true, sir.",

            "review_title": "One Character in Search of a Life",
            "content": "This film explores a common fantasy theme; the idea that fictional characters can take on a life of their own and interact with the real world. (Pirandello's play \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" is a good literary example). It is set in New Jersey at the height of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The main character, Cecilia, is a young woman trapped in an unhappy life. Her husband, Monk (a name presumably chosen as an ironic joke), is violent, abusive and unfaithful; he is unemployed, but still manages to find enough money to drink and gamble. At the diner where she works as a waitress she is bullied by her unpleasant boss.Cecilia's main distraction from her troubles is the cinema,either going to watch films or obsessively discussing the private lives of the stars with her friend. She has been several times to see the film currently playing at her local cinema, a romantic comedy called \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\". Despite its title it has little to do with Egypt but is mostly set among the wealthy members of New York's high society. During one of the performances of this film Tom Baxter, one of the characters in the film, steps down from the screen and addresses Cecilia, saying that he has seen her come to watch him several times and declaring that he has fallen in love with her. The film then chronicles the romance between the fictional Tom and the real Cecilia and the complications which ensue. The film production company are unhappy that a character from one of their film has escaped, and send Gil Shepherd, the actor who originally played Tom, to New Jersey to try and persuade his creation to return to the screen. Cecilia finds herself falling in love with both Tom and Gil.When Tom comes down from the screen, he discovers that the real world is very different from the one that he inhabits, and much of the humour in the film arises from his discovery of this strange new world. He is only aware of those matters which exist in his fictional world or which have been written into his character, so he has no idea that poverty or unemployment exist until Cecilia enlightens him. Through a misunderstanding he finds himself in a brothel, but totally fails to realise the nature of the establishment, because sex was never mentioned in the light comedies of the era. (\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" seems to have been an influence on a more recent comedy, \"Pleasantville\", which also featured the interaction between the real world and a fictional one with curiously na\u00efve inhabitants).This plot might seem like mere fantasy, but behind it lies a point of genuine philosophical, even theological, interest; is it better to live in an imperfect world and to have free will or to live in a perfect one and to lack it? Cecilia envies the characters she sees on the screen because they are rich, beautiful and seemingly happy. Tom, on the other hand, envies the inhabitants of the real world because they are free to make their own choices and do not have to go on repeating the same scenario ad infinitum. Cecilia is devoutly religious, but Tom has no knowledge of God, because religion does not feature in the plot of his film; when Cecilia explains the concept to him, Tom conceives of God as having the same relation to the real world as the scriptwriter does to his fictional one. (Perhaps the implication is that even in the real world people are not free, but merely acting out a script written by God or fate).Although the film has a downbeat ending, when Cecilia has to confront the difference between her world and Tom's (where there is always a happy ending), the general tone is light and amusing, a tone set by the acting, especially that of Jeff Daniels in the dual role of Tom and Gil, who have quite different characters. Tom is na\u00efve and innocent, but also gentlemanly, generous and sincere; Gil is more cynical, worldly-wise and self-centred. Daniels is able to convey the contrasting aspects of their characters, while giving the \"real\" Gil a greater sense of solidity than the \"unreal\" Tom. Although their association may have ended unhappily, Mia Farrow did much of her best work with Woody Allen, and her Cecilia is an endearing heroine. Danny Aiello is convincingly thuggish as Monk. The film as a whole is partly light-hearted fantasy, part touching love-story and part philosophical speculation; one of Allen's best films.",

Who's husband Monk, Danny Alello, is a no good drunken bum who should know and appreciate how lucky he is to have such a sweet and caring women like Cecilia, Mia Farrow, for a wife. Trying to forget her troubles Cecilia spends her free time going to the neighborhood movie house, like millions of Americans did back then in the 1930's, to get lost in a dream of better times that are projected on the great sliver screen. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow were never better as a director and actress in this gem of a movie. The ending of the film, even though it's a bit downbeat, was just what the film needed when you realize that dreams are best kept to oneself and in their right place. Not to try to make them real since you'll only end up hurt and disenchanted as well as detached from the real world by thinking that they are. Mia Farrow is sweet and touching as Cecilia as she falls so madly in love with the character Tom Baxter, Jeff Daniels, of the movie \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\". She goes to see the movie every night until Tom,noticing her, comes to life and jumps off the screen to the shock and surprise of Ceilia to wine and dine and start up a romance with her. Tom is charming but at the same time very naive about the real world. Since everything he knows about life is from the movie that he's in, which is G rated where everybody is both rich and happy, and not the hard truths about depression life in America. These realities confuse Tom since he never was in a movie like the world that he's in now. Tom doesn't know what a hooker is and when he's picked up by one who takes him to where she works, a bordello, Tom thinks he's at some social gathering with a number of well dolled up high class ladies. Tom is such a nice guy that when Cecilia\"s husband Monk fights with him Tom after he knocks him down, with the old one two, offers Monk a hand to help him up! Only to be kicked and punched for his noble effort.Meanwhile the actor who plays Tom Gil Shepherd tries to get Cecilia to get Tom back in the motion picture to finally end the movie so he can get back to his acting career. While back at the movie house the cast of the movie are just left stranded on the screen doing nothing and the audience is up in arms and wants their money back. In the end Tom, realizing that he's not meant to be in the real world, goes back into the film \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" and when the movie is over so is Tom and Ceilia's romance. Ceilia find the truth out when she goes to the theater and sees a new movie on the screen and as we see the movie \"Top Hat\" Inter-cut with Cecilia and as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance and sing \"Cheek to Cheek\". Cecilia's eyes fill up with tears and then when she realizes that her romance with Tom was a dream but by being a dream, as short as it was,it will never be forgotten and will always be with her forever like the movies that she loves so much.Beautiful little movie that really tugs on your heart strings and chokes you up in the end that proves what the saying \"Big gifts come in little packages\" really mean.",

Instead of the filmgoer (Mia Farrow) entering the screen like Keaton, it starts with the actor (Jeff Daniels) noticing her and coming down into the real world. I should say, it's the character the actor plays who comes down into the real world, because the actor himself is separate and, because the playing of the film has ground to a halt, he arrives on the scene as well, which results in an odd love triangle (and not counting her annoying and abusive lout of a husband).There are some cute and endearing bits, like Farrow playing the ukulele while Daniels sings 'Alabamy bound,' but the creativity and humor seem to fall a little short here, as if Woody Allen had a great concept but then lost his way a little bit in developing it. The rest of the characters from the movie looking out into the audience, Daniels (the character) interacting with Daniels (the actor), the film producers reacting because the movie is no longer playing, etc ... all of this was of some interest, but not as magical as it could have been. It was reasonably entertaining though, and I loved the clip of Fred and Ginger from 'Top Hat,' performing 'Cheek to Cheek.' The magic and lightness of that against Farrow's wan, Depression-era look was truly compelling.Favorite quote is when the na\u00efve and virtuous fictional character (Daniels) enters a bordello and has this conversation with the prostitutes:\nTom Baxter: I was thinking about something.\nHooker: I can imagine.\nHooker2: Two of us at the same time?\nTom Baxter: I was thinking about some very deep things. About God and his relation with Irving Saks and R.H. Levine. And I was thinking about life in general. The origin of everything we see about us. The finality of death and how almost magical it seems in the real world, as opposed to the world of celluloid and flickering shadows.\nHooker3: (to another) Where did you find this clown?\nTom Baxter: For example, the miracle of birth. Now, I suppose some of you lovely ladies are married?\nHooker: Not anymore.\nTom Baxter: No? Then the absolutely astonishing miracle of childbirth, with all of its attendant feelings of humanity and pathos. I stand in awe of existence.\nHooker2: Do you want to tie me up?",

            "content": "In the \"Purple Rose of Cairo,\" Woody Allen finally stays behind the camera for the first time since 1978's \"Interiors,\" stepping away from constantly playing these neurotic show- biz/writer characters to brings us more of a romantic comedy that celebrates film as a form of escapism rather than a form of art. It's a delightful breath of fresh air for those that love his films but are tired of seeing Woody do his same old shtick.Allen's muse of the 1980s, Mia Farrow, stars as Cecilia, a Depression-era New Jersey waitress with an abusive husband who spends nearly every day at the movies, seeing the same pictures over and over again. The latest movie, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" stars the charming Gil Shepherd as the naive and optimistic Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels). Cecilia is charmed by his performance and returns again and again, until suddenly the character Tom Baxter walks out of the screen and into her life, creating a crisis at the theater and flipping Cecilia's world upside-down.This odd fantasy element is intriguing in concept, but it's rather jarring in the film to start with. Allen must quickly establish that it's only the character Tom, not the actor Gil, coming out of the screen, that it's just this one theater in New Jersey and all these other details to get us to subscribe to his imaginative idea. After awhile, however, it all makes sense and it works brilliantly to create a conflict of fiction versus reality.Farrow is great as this stammering, broken and hopeless romantic who struggles with her convictions and her drive to go where her heart leads her. She ends up in a conundrum as what was only an escapist fantasy becomes a tangible part of her life. She can either choose to live out her fantasies despite them not being real or live a real life.Allen challenges us to understand the lines between fiction and reality, to grasp why it is we go to the movies, what it is we seek there. \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" does this in a silly, satirical way, but occasionally a line will be spoken that is quite poignant (as Allen does well more overtly in his other films).\"Purple Rose of Cairo\" is a really nice change of pace for Allen, the type of film that will still challenge his audience but also give them the escapist romantic fantasy that we so yearn for when we go to the theater.",

Now it is Cecilia has the final say, whom she really wants, Tom or Gil, basically the same guy but one is a blank sheet emerging from the silver screen and another exists in real world, who promises to bring her to Hollywood. It is a tough decision, Cecilia makes a more logical choice, and everything turns out to be a pipe-dream, life continues, but mercifully, there will always be a new movie to fall in love with, that's why we love cinema!This fetching comedy has been my second favourite Allen's film by far (just after ANNIE HALL of course), Farrow and Daniels (utterly refreshing in his dual-faceted charisma) are incredible in their almost screwball dynamism, as for Aiello, manages to leave his own marks of promise despite the cardboard design of a disqualified husband, there is a faint hope that he may learn something from the lesson, which could be the best thing for our ugly-duckling, shattered in her dream but never stop dreaming.",

            "content": "This is a delightful but also insightful Depression-era fantasy by Woody Allen, showing him at his imaginative best. The premise of having a movie-idol step out of the screen and into the life of an adoring fan is brilliant but Allen layers it up even more by giving us the unamused reactions of the fellow-characters in the movie now stranded without purpose and to paraphrase Pirandello, in search of a screenplay and especially having the real-life actor rush out from Hollywood to confront his on-screen persona about damaging his reputation with his walk-out.The film could presumably work in any era but works best here in 1930's America when Hollywood's Golden Age was born out of the unemployed and low-paid citizens' need for escapism. The settings are wonderful, from the small movie-theatre, the cheap caf\u00e9 where Mia Farrow haphazardly works and the abandoned fairground where she and her movie-beau hide out, superbly captured in a golden hue by Gordon Jenkins, while the sympathetic use of background music of the era further enhances the atmosphere.After the eye-popping scene when Jeff Daniels' lantern-jawed matin\u00e9e-idol literally breaks out of character, there was a danger that Allen had played his hand too early and written himself into a corner, but by re-focusing on Farrow's back story, particularly her going-nowhere relationship with her user-abuser husband and the intricacies of the movie within a movie within a movie premise, he steers it to a (forgive the oxymoron) satisfyingly inconclusive ending, telling us that even in movies, happy endings aren't guaranteed.The acting all-round is excellent, Farrow very good as the put-upon housewife seeking release from her drudgery, Daniels too in a twin-part (sort of) neatly delineating the difference between real-life and screen persona, without literally running away with himself. I was also pleased that Allen kept himself out of the movie as an actor, although it is still possible to hear his characters talking in his language and rhythms so that you couldn't mistake the writer of the piece.The only carp I really have is the relative lack of humour, as outside of the catty squabbling of the abandoned movie actors, there are no real laugh out loud moments. Nevertheless this definitely stands as one of Allen's best and most satisfying movies, the better too for its brevity.",

The central device of the wall breaking down between the characters in a film and those watching is great fun, and both Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels do some of their very best work in this.That said, for me, it lacks a little of the depth and complexity of my very favorite Allen's film. It's a little too cute and simplistic in the middle, but the first and last third, and the uncompromised ending are terrific. It doesn't quite hold up (for me) on multiple viewings the way 'Annie Hall', or 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' or 'Hannah and Her Sisters' or 'Zelig' do. But even 2nd tier Woody Allen is better than almost anything else out there. And on a certain level, with great filmmakers its about personal taste, not right and wrong. (Is Chapln's 'Modern Times' better than 'City Lights' ?) So, if you like Allen's work at all and you've never seen this, you owe yourself a look to decide for yourself.",

            "content": "I find this film and what I consider its companion piece RADIO DAYS to be two simply sublime films. I used to run them as a double feature at my seaside cinema in the 80s and they always were attended by a growing number of appreciative fans who often brought new admirers along....great word of mouth successes. in Australia most Woody Allen films of the 70s and 80s were quite popular (until the terrible SHADOWS AND FOG and the stupid MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY and don't get me started on the mind numbing drivel of his latest London effort with Scarlet Johanssen: SCOOP............) and in the 80s at Orion Pictures he seemed to strike a new high in critical and popular successes. I am very surprised to research here and find that this film was 'obscure'... as it is not in Australia. This film and RADIO DAYS were big hits, so I am pleased to say I did my bit as a cinema owner then to help this happen. CAIRO really is a valentine to the moviegoer, and with Mia Farrow perfect as the downtrodden unhappy Cecelia, in a location and town so perfectly realised as well... a bittersweet reality bite with a hilarious RKO society adventure as the pivotal picture at the lovely little Jewel Theatre. If you see the 1932 RKO film MUMMY'S BOYS you will get the PURPLE ROSE for real, even if that film is a very silly comedy with Wheeler and Wolseley. In CAIRO the atmosphere and characters are quite well realised for my affectionate tastes but the real stars of the film to me are the production designers and Allen's hilarious and sad storyline. The idea of the film talking back itself and the movie actors noticing the audience... hilarious! and the chaos that ensues.... all of it is just ideal for my tastes. Along with RADIO DAYS and SWEET AND LOWDOWN and possibly MATCH POINT, CAIRO makes a perfect set of films. The scene with Cecelia looking wistful at the Astaire Rogers film is perhaps one of the great acting moments on film. Her face subtly changing from sad bewilderment to becoming absorbed in the new film is an emotional high only bettered by the fact that she puts her ukulele on the seat next to her; she realises she isn't going anywhere and this new film might just be all right anyway. I think I just sob every time I see that scene. Perfect. I also laughed for about 3 years at this exchange between audience and screen: Man in audience to Old Dame on screen: Hey you can't talk to my wife like that! ..............Old Dame on screen: I 'm a Duchess and I'm loaded so I can say what I like and if that's your wife she's a tub of guts\"",

            "content": "The Purple Rose of Cairo is written and directed by Woody Allen. It's a wonderful love letter to the golden age of Hollywood. Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a softly spoken, introverted woman. Cecilia regularly visits her local to cinema to escape her repressive, abusive husband and her downbeat job, during depression era America.As she gets more and more obsessive with the fictional movie inside this film, entitled The Purple Rose of Cairo, she begins to project what it would be like to be part of that world. She watches the film so often, the fictional side character in the film Tom Baxter(Jeff Daniels) stops the film and addresses her directly from the screen. \"You must really love this film\" he exclaims. This is the pivotal moment of the film. This level of meta could quite easily lose it's audience. Thankfully Jeff Daniels sincere delivery of the line, and scene all together, completely sells this plot turn. So when he eventually escapes from the cinema screen it feels believable. The fact that the audience is readily accepting of this level of absurdity is a testament to Allen's fantastic writing. The film is also one of his best looking films. The set/costume design is excellent and makes the time period in the film look authentic.The film contains fantastic performances across the board. However it's Farrows and Daniels on screen chemistry that is the highlight of the film. They are both incredibly sweet and likable together without it ever coming across as feeling overblown. The Purple Rose of Cairo is a wonderfully crafted film, that in the hands of lesser skilled directors, could of easily gone awry. Allen manages to create an endearing and poignant film, that takes pleasure in it's retrospective look at classic Hollywood, and what makes cinema so magical. From the moment I saw the RKO title card at the beginning of the fictional film, I was instantly won over. This film is Woody Allen at his best.",

            "content": "In James Thurber's \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\" the protagonist lapses into brief periods of colorful fantasy -- he's a heroic pilot, a skilled surgeon, a resolute ship's captain -- because Walter Mitty's real life is so leadenly dull and boring, dominated by a wife who orders him around.Here, Mia Farrow is the fragile wife dominated by the beer-swilling and abusive Danny Aiello. She's a waitress who is fired for her clumsiness and finds herself helpless and alone. Her fantasy is at once more focused and much longer than Walter Mitty's -- and it's shared by everyone else on the screen.Farrow goes to the 1930s movie theater for relief from the pressures of Depression-era New York. During her fifth viewing of the crummy adventure film, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" one of the actors, Jeff Daniels, notices her and steps off screen to woo her.Daniels pulls her out into the streets. The audience is outraged that the movie has been interrupted, and the other characters in the movie are stuck up there on the screen, shouting for Daniels to come back so they can finish the picture, kvetching that they want THEIR freedom from the movie too.When the news of the desertion of Daniel's character, Tom Baxter, reaches Hollywood, the producers and agents go ape. What if the Baxter character starts to rob banks and rape women? A Hollywood lawyer scowls and says darkly, \"I smell lawsuits.\" The team fly in from Hollywood to track down the miscreant couple.This must be a tricky sort of thing to write. After all, it could be a one-gag story. Actor steps off screen and woos audience member. What do I do NOW, Ma? On top of that, or rather under that, is the serious wintry theme of depression, poverty, spousal disagreements, the state of New Jersey, and other disasters, real or impending.So the rest of the movie, after the fantasy is first realized, has to be handled delicately, blending amusing whimsy with gloomy reality, along the lines of Shakespeare's \"dark comedies.\" And it must all lead to some dramatically satisfying conclusion.How does Woody manage these problems? With moderate success. I don't care how much of a nihilist he is, his sense of humor never really deserts him, and the mostly dramatic story that follows is pepped up by the occasional joke. The newly liberated Tom Baxter (in safari suit and pith helmet) takes Farrow to a night club to romance her. When the bill comes, he offers the waiter fake movie money, in all seriousness. And when they rush out and jump into the nearest car, he's puzzled because it won't move of its own accord. There is no ignition key but in Baxter's experience, every time he leaps into a car in the movies, it roars off. When Danny Aiello is about to slap his wife around, Baxter begins a fist fight and gets clobbered by the brutish husband. He's more confused than hurt, because he always wins his fights on the screen.But that fight is an example of the kind of thing that keeps the film from taking off. It's serious and it's sad, and the movie has much more of that than it has jokes. The shabby, wintry landscape doesn't give the film any pep either. The amusement park is strewn with dead leaves, everything closed for the season.The climax is a little disappointing too. The real Jeff Daniels arrives in town, makes pitches to Farrow, and talks the Daniels character into returning to the movie in the local theater, then he takes off for Hollywood again, leaving Farrow pretty much bereft back in Jersey.But not entirely bankrupt. She returns to the theater and there are Fred and Ginger dancing with skill and grace to \"Cheek to Cheek.\" The message seems to be that when life gets a little too tough to handle, she can retreat into the fantasies provided by movies.That's okay. I used to do it all the time when I was a kid -- dancing on top of garbage cans like Gene Kelly and all that. Now that I'm not a child, it's gotten more difficult and the exuberance doesn't last as long and the garbage cans have turned into huge dumpsters.",

            "content": "Plot: Perhaps the least appreciated of Allen's great films, The Purple Rose of Cairo, is arguably his most playful, albeit direct, outing. Set in New Jersey during the great depression of the 1930's, Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a film aficionado and broken housewife. Recently, her marriage has since turned into a considerable disaster and she finds herself in frequent disagreement with her out-of-work, abusive, and even womanizing husband, Monk (Danny Aiello).Too afraid to be on her own, she naturally finds escape at the local cinema where she sits upon hours in admiration of the actors on screen and the lives in which their characters live. When the theater first features the film entitled The Purple Rose of Cario, Cecilia finds herself enamored by the film and its subsequent character, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels). The following day while at work as a waitress, she finds herself distracted from the mere memory of the feature and due to the nature of her reverie is there upon fired for her demeanor. She later frequents the film over and again and it is not until the happening of one her later viewings, perhaps the sixth time over, that her presence attracts the attention of Tom Baxter, causing him to come off-screen and appear before her and all others in the theater.As he confesses his attraction toward her, together the two run off as the audience and too the characters on screen (as if suddenly viable actors taking part in play) remain caught in panic and awe. Word soon spreads that a character in a feature film has walked off screen, discovering the real-world. Not unexpectedly the news spreads quickly to ears of the film's producer, Raoul Hirsch, and the actor who portrays Tom Baxter, Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels). Mr. Hirsch's objective here is to stop the mass running of his picture to cease any further occurrences that share semblance and potential lawsuits. Gil Shepherd finds himself frightened at the thought of losing his growing popularity due to what crimes he believes the character he created, his essential double for all intensive purposes, may be out committing.Cecelia You're Breaking My Heart: Mia Farrow's interpretation of Cecilia is simply charming. It is with such perfection that she plays the role of this lonely, na\u00efve romantic in search of change. Her lamenting disposition and reserved attitude, together, truly make her irresistible to any viewer and impossible for one not to feel sympathetic toward her plight.Jeff Daniels does as well a marvelous job as both Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd. He very well may be amongst Hollywood's underrated.Film as a World of its Own: The Purple Rose of Cairo presents yet another interesting aspect in the sense that Allen depicts the world on the theater screen as a world entirely of its own; and it is! Cecelia mentions over and again her desire for a world similar to the depictions on screen and it is with a high degree of craft that Allen creates that so sought after world. The scene in the picture itself, when Tom Baxter leaves, can no longer move forward or backward, but must remain in place. The characters however are free to move about, discuss at will topics of interest, as well as see outwardly, beyond the screen, into the theater. These characters on screen are alive, disturbed even. Their world of routine has since been interrupted and they are left in a state of restlessness and wait for there is nothing more they desire than to continue their life of pattern. One character even mentions excitedly how he is a \"dramatic character\" and needs \"forward motion\" while another mentions the fear he has of the screen going \"black\". In their impatience others pass time arbitrarily by poking jokes at the audience. As a whole these sequences make for brilliant satire that only Allen could write.Tom Baxter leaves the picture and enters the real-world where he remains no longer a victim of repetitiveness. Moviegoers, however enthusiastic, wish to enter the very world of a Hollywood picture in the hope of escaping theirs.The two worlds do exist and perhaps are separate equals, but after all, what is a life without the movies? What is a life without wanting to or even having an escape, even if only for a little while? Love, Actually: What else Purple Rose so genuinely explores is the unrequited love one may share for a fictional character; be that of literature, film, or even our very own imaginative perception of those so in which living life surrounds us with to a great abundance. Cecilia found herself enthralled by the character Tom Baxter even before he took his first steps off-screen. His charm, his romanticism, looks and perfections that captivated her so, all of course translated to the real-world. However, his limited knowledge of the living-world, what is past and now, as well as being only capable of what has been written into his character, hinders Tom Baxter from certain human emotions. Also, as aforementioned, he, Tom Baxter, is in practical sense, fictional.One has to wonder if it is the artist whom they love or his creation. It is here in Allen's piece that Cecilia falls too in deep affection toward the actor who portrays Tom Baxter. He is certainly a man of a great many faults no doubt, but an artist no less and more importantly, the man who gave life to Tom Baxter. It is such that Cecilia finds herself amidst the grand decision of choosing reality or fantasy for her ultimate happiness.One Sentence Summary: The Purple Rose of Cairo is a fantastic, probing piece of cinema in which, through comedic, romantic tones, great acting and of course music, leaves the viewer appreciating cinema that much more than what was once before.",

Following the somewhat pretentious and self-absorbed Stardust Memories, Allen really stepped up his game with Zelig, the immaculate Broadway Danny Rose and now the charming and magically romantic The Purple Rose of Cairo. Here, Allen explores the relationship between the movies themselves and the audience that connects with them.Allen's longtime compatriot, Mia Farrow, is absolutely wonderful and warm as Cecilia, who struggles through the Great Depression as a waitress as well as being married to an abusive but well-meaning husband. Attempting to escape from the harshness of reality, she attends numerous screenings of the film The Purple Rose of Cairo only to find that the handsome explorer from the movie comes out of the screen and falls in love with her. But then the actor himself comes to town and soon things are happening in a Woody Allen kind of way.I really don't want to say too much more about this film other than it proves that despite his personal life, Woody Allen remains one of the few great American directors working today and a living legend, able in some mysterious way to perfectly balance the sorrow and pity of life along with the magic and eternal joy that seems to exist only in the film world. Yet, despite what people may say, this is a happy story; a tribute to the power of movies and how if we connect with the right one it truly can change our life. This obviously happened to Allen at a young age as well as millions of other cinema lovers. This is a film celebrating life, despite its downbeat tone, and telling us to be optimistic because the movies are.",

Well in The Purple Rose of the Cairo someone is granted that wish, only it is the other way around - the archaeologist character in the movie has had enough of reciting the same lines and playing the same role over and over and wants out. Allen establishes this subtly - again and again we see him addressing his adventure on screen, like he just can't believe that 24 hours ago he was still in Egypt...and there is a hint of weariness that goes along with each repetition. And then he falters one night, because someone has caught his eye...so he does the only thing that seems logical and steps off the screen.What's funny and wonderful about Purple Rose is the way it treats this little incident with an air of mild surprise and absurdity. \"How is that possible???\" they question, before quickly accepting it and descending back into their daily lives. Some complain for their money back. Others are intrigued and sit in the theatre for hours on end, studying the rest of the cast like some science experiment. And the executives treat it like any mini fiasco - telephoning each other in panic and hoping to shush it up while elsewhere (\"The press is on our side!\"), another Tom Baxter is beginning to forget his lines. The cherry on top is the self awareness in the humour (Pleasantville took a leaf out of this section) - the endearing way that Tom questions everything about real life, and how he is idealistic and innocent without any real cause. We see the signs that this relationship can't actually last, but oh, what if it could?And of course Cecilia falls hard for him, because he has been played excellently by Gil Shephard, so he is programmed to be romantic, chivalrous, poetic, charming and passionate all rolled into one. The cartoonish way he and Monk swap sides in their fight and how his nobler intentions lead him to get sucker punched. It's a far cry from her real life, after all. The vicious cycle of her waitress job, the abusive husband who flaunts his affairs in her face, and she of course cannot do what a movie character would; she makes a big show of this being the last straw and packs her things to leave him once and for all, and she is back the next day. We feel that this whole charade has been played many times. Farrow is without a doubt adorable - one of her less glamorous appearances but she brings a vulnerable, naive quality to Cecilia. She is most comfortable in the theatre and it shows - the polite usual pleasantries to the workers, her eyes lighting up in delight during the whole runtime, and the way she absent-mindedly shoves popcorn into her mouth, so engrossed that it hardly matters what she is eating. And then out of the building she is flustered and stammering, daydreaming about the last story, fan-girling when she meets an idol. Oh, so fetching. The main objective of Allen, I think, is to have us empathise with Cecilia - to have us clutching the ukulele and stare at the screen with those wide, desperate eyes, seeking solace in an imaginative world. He would later revisit this sort of longing in Midnight in Paris, but I think it works better here because it doesn't telegraph that neat, emotional ending. Cecilia doesn't have anything left except her movies, and it's like she is trying to prolong that realisation and that tragic ending. Of course in real life, the happy ending isn't always around the corner.",

As while she is watching a film, the lastest attraction, The Purple Rose if Cairo, at her local cinema, a fictional hero : Jeff Daniels, suddenly shows up between the spectators.Marvelous comedy in Allen-style with his usual elements as technical wizandry, romantic scenes, bizarre relationships and fantasy. Wonderful film with an large inventive, ingenious premise and very well developed, including a lot of surprises and a feeling love story. Allen explores the bewilderment of the actor whose movie persona has miraculously gone walkies. Mia Farrow provides an agreeable performance as an unfortunate and hard-working housewife who is really mistreated by his husband Danny Aiello. Jeff Daniels gives a sympathetic acting as a screen hero who becomes involved into reality and living a small romance, as he steps out of the movie screen and goes into actual existence sweeping here off her feet. That's why the main and support cast are pretty good. As the star-struck couple , work wonders with enjoyable emotions. Support cast is pretty good such as Danny Aiello, Edward Herrmann , Dianne West, Van Johnson, John Wood, Milo O'Shea, among others.It contains lively and atmospheric musical score by Dick Hayman. Adequate and appropriate prodiction design by Stuart Wurtzel, with perfect settings on the period detail. Colorful and evocative cinematography in technicolor by Gordon Willis. The motion picture was competently directed by Woody Allen, showing his own wistful sense of intelligent comedy. Being made during a prolific and clever period in which he directed several masterpieces. Including a series of movies in which he provides nice direction, investing care enough, wit and warmth, such as : Crimes and misdemeanors, New York stories, September, Radio Days, Hanna and her sisters, Broadway Danny Rose, Zelig, Stardust memories, A midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Interiors, Manhattan and this Purple rose of Cairo. Rating 7/10. Better than average. The movie will appeal to Woody Allen enthusiasts.",

            "content": "Woody Allen after his 1970s heyday reminds me of something the manager of Spinal Tap said: \"They aren't losing popularity. Their appeal is just more selective.\" Even armed with a good idea and a luminous lead performance by his then-lover, Mia Farrow, Allen's 1985 film \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\" is a comic fantasy that is neither especially funny nor that trippy. Instead, it presents another of his Bergmanesque ruminations on the misery and finality of life, appealing to his ever-more-selective audience and distancing everyone else.Farrow stars as Cecilia, already with three strikes against her. It's the Depression, she's married to an abusive lout, and she lives in New Jersey. Her only refuge is the local Jewel movie house, where she escapes into the \"madcap Manhattan weekend\" that is \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\". While watching the film for a fifth straight time, Cecelia is surprised when one of the characters, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), jumps off the screen and declares his love for her.It's a great concept, and its execution is the film's best sequence, daffy and thrilling. Mia winningly playing a nebbish by channeling her then-partner's on screen personality (it's Woody by proxy in this movie, as the man himself stays offscreen), accompanied by delightful period-sounding music by Dick Hyman.Cecelia and Tom share observations of life in their respective worlds in a decrepit amusement park he makes into his hiding place. He tells her he has been watching her for days, peaking at her when professing his love to another on-screen character. She gives him popcorn, which he reacts to like ambrosia from heaven.\"Been watching people eat it for all those performances,\" he says. \"When they rattle those bags, though, that's annoying.\" The comedy never moves beyond that, except when we return to the Jewel to see the other film actors venting over Tom's desertion. Cecelia and Tom's relationship never evolves, either, as Cecelia proves surprisingly unwilling to accept this dream come true.That's what throws me most about \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\". When Farrow's eyes look up at you so puppy-like you feel her need for deliverance, yet everything about the film, including the character, is too hardhearted to led the fantasy breathe for a moment.Daniels doesn't have a lot to do as Tom, except sit in the old amusement park and innocently chat up some prostitutes. Daniels does double duty as the real-life actor who portrayed Tom, Gil Shepherd, and is not as effective, so clipped and smug in his delivery you know what's going to happen with him from the moment he first appears.SPOILER ALERT - I side with those people who call the ending too downbeat for the rest of the film. It's even more downbeat when one considers Cecelia's inexplicable culpability in the conclusion of the Tom story. Some see her last moments on screen as Woody's testimony to the wonder of cinema; I see an addict taking her final, fatal hit - SPOILER ALERT ENDS.The film has integrity and offers some moments, magic and otherwise, along the way. But for a movie about cinema's spell on people, it proves a strangely inert experience.",

I knew as soon as the opening credits rolled and Fred Astaire is singing \"Cheek to Cheek\" that I would love it. It's a film that celebrates the cinema, and how illusion is sometimes better then reality. Mia Farrow's character could have indeed been written about my relationship with film.",

            "content": "Mousy Cecilia (a luminous performance by Mia Farrow) lives a humdrum existence as a greasy spoon waitress in Depression-era New Jersey. The only solace Cecilia finds in life is by watching movies in a theater. Cecilia gets swept off her feet when fictional film character Tom Baxter (a very appealing portrayal by Jeff Daniels) walks off the screen and right into Cecilia's heart.Writer/director Woody Allen really hits it out of the ballpark with the clever premise that's ingeniously used to explore the stark contrast between harsh reality and gentle fantasy. Moreover, Allen also presents a flavorsome evocation of the 1930's period setting as well as elicits plenty of big laughs from the wacky situation.The stellar cast all do top work: Farrow makes the endearingly wide-eyed Cecilia a hugely sympathetic person, Daniels excels as both the dashing and ridiculously decent Tom and the equally charming, but selfish and insincere actor Gil Shepherd, Danny Aiello does well as Cecilia's crude abusive husband Monk, Dianne Wiest contributes a sharp turn as a whorehouse madam who gets taken in by Tom's overwhelming sweetness, and Edward Herrman, John Wood, Deborah Rush, Van Johnson, Zoe Caldwell, and Milo O'Shea are all hilarious as the confounded movie characters who don't take Tom leaving the picture lightly. Kudos are also in order for Dick Hyman's sprightly swing band score and the handsome cinematography by Gordon Willis. Spot-on bittersweet ending, too. An absolute delight.",

The plot about an unhappy women who goes to see the same escapist film again and again is charming--particularly when the characters in the movie begin to notice that she keeps coming back again and again! Ultimately, the hero of the movie is so taken by her devotion, that he literally walks out of the picture to meet her and then refuses to go back! This is WONDERFUL and surreal. It got even better when all the other characters just stood by and waited and waited for him to return and finally didn't know what to do with themselves!! This was great. Then, for some odd reason (not that it wasn't already odd), the movie could NEVER end until he returned and they couldn't show any movies until this was resolved. I was THRILLED and up until the end, this may have been my favorite Woody Allen movie.Unfortunately, the same sweetness that had prevailed throughout most of the movie completely disappeared at the end. Instead of the expected ending, it provided a \"life stinks\" ending and completely ruined the experience for me. In fact, I think the movie ended on a rather cruel note.",

This is a film i have adored and cherished for a very long time and just now realized that i had not rated it. I was in a state of mortification and amended that error at once. This glimmering cinematic jewel needs to be seen by anyone who truly and sincerely loves the art form we call cinema.The soul, the inventiveness, the beguiling charm, the cinematic artistry and wit of this masterpiece are light years ahead of nearly every film i have seen. It is the most personal film i have had the pleasure of viewing for the sheer fact that it is a film lovers movie and eloquently shows us why we love film, or should i say why i love film because i felt a connection so personal and profound. The escapist enchantment of film in a situation of true zaniness is captured here in The Purple Rose of Cairo. The fantasy, a fantasy many of us have had about film characters coming to life, the stark contrast of the charm and magic of the silver screen and the harsh cold reality so deftly portrayed. The hardships and three dimensions of life, the choices we make and their consequences, the acceptance/facing of reality and the hard truths and ironies this life presents form just some of the philosophical depth this breathtaking gem of cinema possesses. It goes above and beyond that by demonstrating that we are in charge of our destinies and sometimes all we will have is ourselves and no one will rescue us but ourselves. It gets satirical and comedic and strange and just becomes a pure pleasure to behold. The seamless coming together of comedy, sweeping romance, charm, fairy tale enchantment, bittersweet and sometimes sour truths and the pure celebration of the personal effect movies can have on people who are hurting exemplify the enchantment that such art, such film, can infuse into peoples lives. The masterful direction, the down trodden and heartbreaking heroine so perfectly and beautifully portrayed by the iconic Mia Farrow and the period setting together with this astounding screenplay make this film an event like no other.",

            "content": "I like many, but not all, Woody Allen movies, but this one is a favorite of mine. Set in the Depression era, Mia Farrow is Cecilia, a rather simple person, married to a real cad who expects her to work and give him money. But Cecilia endures the boredom of ordinary life by seeing movies at the local movie house. She can go every afternoon and see the same movie over and over, and get absorbed into its fantasy.The movie running now in her small New Jersey town is an older black and white film called \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\". In it Jeff Daniels is Hollywood actor Gil Shepherd who plays the character, explorer Tom Baxter. But Gil has done such a good job of creating the character of Tom, after a number of showings of the film Tom wants to get out, he wants to get into the real world. And he does, during one showing when he looks at the audience, and speaks to Cecilia, recognizing that she has been in the audience every day.So Tom and Cecilia run away and hide, and the rest of the characters object because they can't move forward in the plot. Eventually things complicate because in the same film being shown in other cities, Tom is attempting to come off the screen, but not yet successful. So the studio bosses worry about both loss of film revenue and about liability if their character comes off the screen and causes trouble. They imagine 100s of Toms running around.So the story turns to how a fictional character, Tom, can get along in the real world, with the scope of his knowledge limited by what was actually in the script. Then, how can they get him back into the screen, into the movie, so that they can shut down the movie everywhere. The actor, Gil, must help.Danny Aiello is the cad of a husband, Monk. Cecilia's sister is played by Farrow's real sister, Stephanie Farrow, as they wait tables together in the greasy spoon caf\u00e9.The story is a fantasy, a well made fantasy. I enjoy it on a number of levels, it is funny, it gets you to think. But most of all the acting of Mia Farrow, she is just perfect here.SPOILERS: Eventually Gil has to rely on his acting abilities. He has to convince Cecilia that he loves her, and that having a real person is better than being in love with a fictional character. So, in the theater, he convinces Cecilia that he will take her back to Hollywood, and a disappointed Tom goes back and joins the other characters. Cecilia goes home and packs a suitcase, tells Monk that she is leaving for good this time, and returns to the movie house. But everyone is gone, Tom is on a plane to Hollywood, and she is left to her meager existence in her small town. The movie ends with her attending the new movie in town, one with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.",

            "content": "Review: I've never been a big fan of Mia Farrows acting because she just seems really gullible and ditzy in all of her roles. In this movie, her character is in a unloving relationship and she looks for escapism by going to the cinema and imagines a life with the film stars. When one of the actors walks out of the screen, into real life, which causing an uproar in the community, he turns to Mia Farrow to show him life in the real world. After falling deeply in love with her, which causes more problems in her troubled relationship, she is left with the decision to leave her husband for a life in her dream world. I think that you can tell that the storyline is completely far fetched, but it's a sweat love story without any of Woody Allens slapstick comedy. I personally found the movie boring and uninteresting, but I'm sure that there are people out there that will enjoy it. Average!\u00a0Round-Up: Although this movie made a loss at the box office, it is one of Woody Allens popular films that are highly rated. I personally can't see why it's was so highly rated or were the $15 million dollar budget went, but thats just my opinion. The acting isn't totally bad from the cast, except for Mia Farrow who whines her way through the whole film. The same concept was used in the Last Action Hero, we're Annie walks out of the screen and finds it hard to adapt to the real world, but that didn't really work either. On the plus side, Woody Allen did portray the period well but thats about it.Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $10.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about a woman in a troubled relationship and searches for happiness at the cinema. 3/10",

In the snug atmosphere of the theater she can let the woes of her job as a waitress and the brashness of her big galoot of a husband drain away as she transports herself to a world of glitz and glamor, adventure and romance. One week, she finds herself particularly taken with the character of the dashing explorer Tom Baxter from the motion picture The Purple Rose of Cairo. Though a side character, he seems the heart of the film, and her wide eyes are always on him. Imagine her surprise (and the surprise of the audience around her) when she finds that his eyes have also been on her! Mia Farrow is sublime as Cecilia, endearing and instantly likable. She brings such adorability and sweetness to this poor little waitress, at the same time infusing her with such humanity and believability, that it seems no wonder that a movie character would want to descend from the screen to meet her. And as that character, Jeff Daniels is charming and hilariously innocent; his goofy scenes acclimating to the 'real world' are amongst the funniest in the film. Daniels also does a fine job in the part of the actor who plays Tom in the 'real world'.But Woody Allen's screenplay is the real star of the show. Bright and inventive, it sucks in the viewer in a manner similar to the way Cecilia comes to be sucked into the motion picture within the film. It introduces a world where the inexplicable and magical can occur without explanation \u2013 which only makes it all the more wondrous \u2013 and is chock-full of memorable quotes and sequences. Allen brilliantly satirizes Hollywood, movie conventions, and, in the close of the film, makes a poignant and sobering comment on the line between fantasy and reality that may not be to everyone's tastes, but which elevates this movie from simple escapism to greatness.From the start even unto its bittersweet conclusion, The Purple Rose of Cairo is a fascinating delight not to be missed.",

Blake....Director Woody Allen...Screenplay Woody Allen.Among Woody Allen's best films are those in which he did not star in. His strongest talent is comedy and this film, released in 1985, is a romantic comedy with some thought-provoking and witty writing. Woody Allen's wife at the time, Mia Farrow, appeared in several of his films in the mid to late 80's and this one finds her in terrific acting shape. The time is the 30's, the Great Depression in New Jersey. Cecilia (Farrow) works as a waitress and is married to an abusive, domineering, alcoholic mess (Danny Aiello). To escape the depressing reality of her situation and that of America, she watches Hollywood movies. After repeatedly watching \"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\" an adventure comedy, the characters of the film (not the actors but the fictional characters they portray) come to life and the dashing minor character Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) comes off the big screen to tell Cecilia he has fallen in love with her. This provides Cecilia with a romantic dilemma. Tom is perfect but not real. Her husband is a monster but she can't seem to break free from him. Then along comes Gil Sheperd (also played by Daniels) the actor who portrays Tom Baxter who, flattered by Cecilia's admiration of his work, falls in love with her. Will she choose a perfect but fictional character who lives in perpetual celluloid fantasy over reality ? Ultimately, her decision costs her a lot and the ending, one which many critics and audiences didn't expect or care for, is one that seems to indicate we can't be happy living in fantasy or reality. This writing is the real winner here. Jeff Daniels has terrific lines, but especially as Gil Shepherd the actor who aspires to a greater career in Hollywood and not playing minor parts. The cast of characters who are in the film bicker with the fussy audiences in the theater and this is a most hilarious scene. In order for you to love this film and enjoy it, you have to suspend disbelief and forget about the absurdities of the plot. This film appears to be satirizing Hollywood and if you can laugh at that, then you're very appreciative of good subjective comedy. Rather than taking it seriously, enjoy the great writing and comedy style. Here, Woody Allen gives enough room for Mia Farrow to do her thing and Jeff Daniels, and they do have fine chemistry together. Plenty of hilarious moments. The scene in which the characters/cast on screen are arguing over the minor character's desertion ruining the rest of the movie's momentum is really good. This is also a movie about the magic of Hollywood and the glamour and romanticism/escapism of it. At the same time, it seems to be a sad social commentary on the fact we can't be happy with either too much reality or too much fantasy. But it's a light hearted movie and not nearly as \"deep\" or psychological as they say other Woody Allen movies are. This film doesn't explore human relationships. It is more about escapism and the allure of Old Hollywood on audiences at that time. I really enjoyed this movie for the script and for Mia Farrow who was a fine actress. And again, Woody Allen's writing and direction is also superb.",

            "content": "From writer and director Woody Allen (Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Blue Jasmine), I have seen one or two films where characters pop in and out of motion pictures, I remember Buster Keaton doing, well this film from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die uses that idea for a whole film. Basically set in the 1930's, during the Great Depression, in New Jersey lives clumsy waitress Cecilia (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Mia Farrow) who lives a bleak life in a loveless marriage to abusive husband Monk (Do the Right Thing's Danny Aiello), she has attempted to leave a few times, her only escape from this drab existence is going to the movies. The latest film Cecilia sees at the picture house is The Purple Rose of Cairo, which is about rich Manhattan playwright Henry (Edward Herrmann) going on an exotic vacation to Egypt with companions Jason (John Wood) and Rita (American Pie: The Wedding's Deborah Rush), while there they meet archaeologist Tom Baxter (Golden Globe nominated Jeff Daniels), he is brought back for a \"madcap Manhattan weekend\", and he falls in love with Copacabana singer Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers). Cecilia sits through the film five times, and it is the fifth time that on screen Tom notices her, he breaks the fourth wall and emerges from the black and white picture into the colourful real world on the other side of the cinema screen, Tom tells her he is attracted having seen her in the audience many times, he leaves the picture house with her, the audience and the film characters are left to interact with each other about the situation. Cecilia takes Tom around her New Jersey town, as they spend time together they fall in love with each other, but the defection of the character from his own film has caused problems for RKO Radio Pictures, the filmmakers who made the picture, and the audiences watching other copies of the film, reports come out of other versions of Tom Baxter trying to walk off screen. While Tom is trying to get used to the realities of the world as opposed to the film world, actor Gil Shepherd (Daniels) who played Tom Baxter is called by the studio and told the situation, and they tell him to travel to New Jersey, where they found out the problem first emerged, they want him to convince his character to return to his film. While Tom is wandering around the town alone Gil finds Cecilia, she assumes he is Tom, but he reveals he is the actor, he explains to her that his career will be ruined if Tom does not return to The Purple Rose of Cairo, and he meets Tom for himself to tell him to go back, Tom refuses to do so as he has fallen in love, and as he spends his own time with her Gil finds himself falling in love for Cecilia as well. Tom does eventually head back into his film, but he takes Cecilia with him into the black and white on screen world, they spend a significant montage time with each other in the film, but this bizarre love triangle is for Cecilia to decide, she has to decide whether to stay with Tom and the fantasy perfect character he is, or be with the real man who played him. In the end Cecilia chooses the real world and to be with Gil, she first breaks up with her husband, but then she is devastated to find out Gil not have true love for her, he wooed her to get Tom back into his film, but he is silently racked with guilt on the plane returning to Hollywood, Cecilia is alone, unemployed and homeless, but she returns to the movies to escape, she settles and enjoys Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing \"Cheek to Cheek\" in Top Hat. Also starring Dianne Wiest as Emma, Van Johnson as Larry, Zoe Caldwell as The Countess, Milo O'Shea as Father Donnelly, Irving Metzman as Theater Manager, John Rothman as Mr. Hirsch's Lawyer, Stephanie Farrow, Mia's real sister as Cecilia's Sister and Alexander Cohen as Raoul Hirsch. Farrow is really endearing as the woman with a miserable life wanting to get away from it all and find true love, Daniels is really likable as both the fictional character who enchants her and the actor who played him and is trying to put things right, together Farrow and Daniels are a really charming couple, whichever version of Daniels she spends time with. This film is both really clever and really funny, the concept of a fictional character entering the real world and being used to the conventions of the world in motion pictures is smart, the love story is sweet, the best laughs come from the fictional and real worlds clashing, and the script is full of fantastically witty dialogue and charm, a polished and ingenious fantasy romantic comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

From the start the movies are shown as a medium to transport people away from their cares and Woody Allen does exactly that with this movie. He does this with a light, whimsical touch but with great reverence.The story is fantastical and Allen's development of it is wonderfully funny. The thought of a character leaving a movie and entering the real world is original and preposterous but Allen doesn't use it as a one-trick pony, taking the concept in many hilarious (and even profound) directions.Wonderful conclusion too, bringing us back to cinema's role in our lives.",

Cecilia briefly goes onto the screen with Gil where she upsets the other characters because she is not in the plot. The bored characters sitting around in their evening dress in the film, waiting for Gil to return, are reminiscent of the trapped aristocrats in Bunuel's surrealist masterpiece The Exterminating Angel.\nThis is another one of those Allen films that appeared slight on its first release but which has grown in stature with further viewing. Mia Farrow turns in an attractive performance and shows herself to be the perfect deliverer of Allen's neurotic lines.",

Where this unexplored freedom gives him plenty of possibilities to hit, and to hit hard. The Purple Rose of Cairo brings that posibility to life with Cecilia (Mia Farrow in a delightful memorable performance), a miserably unhappy woman trapped in an awful marriage with an abusive, idle and jobless husband (the late Danny Aiello). She provides for the two as she works as a waitress, where she is just two broken plates away from being fired. Amongst this severe unhappiness, Cecilia, a soft-spoken gentle human being, has one thing she absolutely loves, going to the movies. When she's there she immerses herself in the pictures and ends up with a fascination translated to her face as a big shining smile.After being fired and being mistreated by her good-for-nothing husband, she finds escape from her bleak reality in a particular film, one she has seen multiple times, but this time a character she adores starts adressing her from the screen, and thus begin a dreamy plot that it is so charming and enchanting, that you can't help but feel exactly what Cecilia feels when she watches pictures, a wonderfully magical appeal.Jeff Daniels plays his movie character so charmingly well it oozes from the screen. Simply a lovely film with an unexpected ending (for me at least) and a disconsolate one, to put a proper adjective. One of Woody's most inventive and endearing films, an absolute must!",

            "content": "\"The purple rose of Cairo\" represents in some way what Woody Allen has though all of his life about films. The first time he went to the movies he was just a kid and he felt so excited that he stood up and touch the screen. From that day on, the legendary director has believed that movies are just a fantasy that helps us to escape from the real world, which from his point of view, as we all know, is a place full of misery and loneliness and it ends up too quickly.The film is set in New Jersey during the Great Depression and it tells the story of Cecilia (Farrow), a clumsy waitress who goes to the movies to escape her bleak life and loveless marriage to Monk, whom she has attempted to leave on numerous occasions. One day, she sees a movie named \"The purple rose of Cairo\", which is the story of a rich Manhattan playwright who goes on an exotic vacation to Egypt, where he and his wife meet archaeologist Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels). Tom is perfect, besides of being really handsome, he's kind, loving and caring. Cecilia finds in this character everything she can't find in a man from the real world. She becomes obsessed with the movie and she watches it over and over again until something really odd happens: Tom Baxter literally breaks the fourth wall, emerging from the black-and-white into the colorful real world on the other side of the cinema's screen. The producers of the movie will be told about this event, so as the paparazzi and the ordinary people who will be shocked.In this case, Woody shows us the role of movies in society, emphasized during a decadent period of time in American history as it was the Great Depression in the 30's. Through a very crazy and original tale he leads to reflection upon some questions such as \"Where does reality ends and fantasy begins?\" or \"Should we live merged inside a fantasy world or should we accept life with its ugliness?\"Once again Allen expresses his feelings and ideas through a very well told movie that make us remain sitting after it ends, thinking about some existential matters for a couple of minutes.Eight out of ten.",

            "review_title": "Simply presented yet inventive romantic comedy",
            "content": "With The Purple Rose of Cairo, Woody Allen mixes real drama in with a fantastical concept. It's something he would return to a few times over the years, most recently with Midnight in Paris, the most successful film of his career. With Purple Rose the concept involves a character from a film coming down from the screen to form a romantic relationship with a woman who has been repeatedly attending screenings of his film. The setting is the 1930's Depression and, furthermore, the woman is in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic husband. Consequently the contrast between grim reality and cinematic fantasy is even greater; while the relationship between viewer and film characters is played around with to make interesting points and comic observations.I wouldn't consider it anywhere near Allen's funniest films though. It's more lightly amusing than laugh-out-loud. Most of the humour derives from the absurdity of the film characters interacting with real people, such as the cast being stuck on-screen in limbo while they await the return of their errant colleague, while his encounters with reality are often comical, such as when he realises he only has fake money or that cars need keys to start. Despite the fantastical set-up, it's a pretty straightforward and economically told story. This can make it seem a little under-whelming on a first viewing but a re-watch illustrated to me that its very simplicity is actually one of its strengths.",

            "review_title": "Idealization versus the real",
            "content": "I think everyone is familiar with idealization. Idealization is, after all, what we always do. It is how we deal with the real, we adapt it in a way that can provides us with reassurance, with a certain logic. Philosophers like Zizek would affirm that, in fact, fantasy can be stronger than reality. Because, in the end, what is reality but an amount of statements and common sense that we all agree upon? Cecilia, a waitress trying to survive in the middle of the greatest financial depression in America, lives a common life. She barely makes enough money to get by, she's married to an abusive, alcoholic and jobless man. And she has no real future ahead of her, rather than spend her youth, her whole life washing dishes in the local diner.Her only cheerful moments take place in the cinema. She goes every day and watches the same movie. For a couple of hours she feels transported into a world of glamour, of beautiful men and women, a world in which everything makes sense, a world where happy endings are possible. In an era of poverty, movies are the ideal escapism. Movies are a window that allows the impoverished people to see life not as it is but as it could or should be.Woody Allen is not only a great director but also a true connoisseur of cinema. Hollywood's films in the 20s relied deeply on spectacular images just as they do now, but what today is CGI (and explosions or big action sequences), decades ago was grand sets, hundreds of extras, complex choreographies, exotic scenarios and so on. That's the kind of films that Cecilia has access to. And as enamored as she is with this world of richness and splendor, she must come to reality and accept the hardships of life.That is of course, until Tom Baxter, the adventurer, the handsome hero from the film, starts talking to her through the screen. He knows she loves the movie, she's been there every day. And he knows he loves her. And just like that, Tom Baxter is no longer a black and white, two dimensional character, he is now a person walking out of the screen and reaching out to her.It happens in the movies, but it can also happen in real life: love at first sight. Cecilia and Tom are in love, but she doesn't know how to deal with this strange situation. He is a fictional character, he has never been in the real world, and he carries a certain naivet\u00e9 but also a certain magic, a sense of wonder that reminds her that being alive, and making choices, is all that matters.With a very ironic venue, Woody Allen reminds us that Hollywood is a cruel machinery in which profits and lawyers are more important than directors or actors. And once that these businessmen realize that the impossible has happened in New Jersey, they decide to fix the situation. Giles Shepherd, the actor that plays Tom Baxter, is worried about having a duplicate of him running amok in the streets. He has a career to protect, a reputation to uphold. When he discovers that Cecilia knows where to find Tom Baxter he tries to convince his creation to return to the screen, where he belongs, but to no avail.Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan used to say that desire towards our 'object a' depends on the phantasm; which in a way means that the object of our desire is never ours, our thirst is never quenched and we are doomed to unsatisfactory pursuits, always. This happens because the object of desire comes to us mediated through a veil that conceals the real, and thus strengthens what in this case is only an idealized image, a reflection of something that doesn't necessarily has to be there although that is all our eyes can see. Tom Baxter is the mirrored ideal that originates from Giles Shepherd, but at the same time, both are the ideal partners for Cecilia. One of them is fictitious and because of that he is also perfect; the other one is human, flawed, but authentic.As the days go by, Cecilia falls in love with Giles, and dreams of leaving behind an awful reality, a mediocre existence. At the same time, she has some of the most amazing experiences of her life with Tom Baxter, as he takes her into the screen and into the very world she has always fantasized about. He takes her to the exclusive clubs and the mansions she had only seen in screen. He makes her know a new world, visually stunning; a black and white universe where things have a way of always working out in the end.And then comes a moment, a moment in which she has to make a decision. Will she stay with Tom Baxter or Giles Shepherd? The character or the actor? The fiction or the reality? The ideal or the real? Making decisions is what makes us humans, but then again, pain, hunger, poverty and decay inevitably come with humanity. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice to say that I have never seen a greater, sadder and more significant sacrifice than the one seen here. The Purple Rose of Cairo is truly one of the most magnificent classics ever.",

Like the purple is still sough life is still sought and joy is deprived to our protagonist Cecilia. Acted superbly as any actor under the master director Woody Allen does, Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels have done well. This is the first film I saw of Mia Farrow and she is quite an exciting actress I must say. Set in 1930's depression era, the art direction is quite great as the shallowness in lives of people and so in the spaces in USA is captured well. Cinematography is just there and its very well edited, keeping it down to 82 minutes and thats enough to bring someone out of screen and throw him in again. Screenplay and story, Oh I loved it I must say but will I watch it again, may be not coz there are not many lines that shall make me sit and watch it again. It's a surreal movie and yes it has a symbolism too, Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is drawn into her own figments of imagination and she gets what he thinks about that is being with a lovable man, who walks straight out of the screen and meets her in real life. So reel life Tom (Jef Daniels) meets Cecilia. Now Tom is just a character and his real life is Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels) and then when a choice is given to Cecilia, she chooses the real life Gil and is succumbed to reality that its not that way the life goes. Tom goes back into screen, Gil goes back to Hollywood but with guilt. Cecilia is now back to her escapade, the movies and this watching Top Hat as the song 'Cheek to Cheek' is played.I have revealed the whole story I think but don't apologize me for that coz even after I put the whole thing here, its worth a watch at least once.I will give it 4/5 still coz I am happy for watching it.

When I first saw this film, I really didn't expect anything out of the ordinary, but as the film continues I see that this is no ordinary film. The moment that Tom Baxter came out from the film, I knew it was different then what I have expected. From how naive Tom Baxtor was of the real world to the time when Cecilia went inside the film. At that moment, I knew that the barrier between reality and fantasy was broken. Another thing that I get from this film is that you can give life to things that have no life by believing that it is part of your life.

The result is weird yet charming and at times hilarious, yet it's utterly unique and unlike most other movies I've seen.

            "review_title": "Fantasy & Reality blur to charming delight!",
            "content": "My film lecturer said Woody Allen had inspired him with this 1985 film to believe in the magic and complex tapestry of the art of fantasy film-making by interweaving it with false realities, and I must say, I agree. This film blurs those two elements to charming delight by playing not only on imaginative fictional dream material but also acting as a commentary satire on how how audiences (not just in America) react to film and the relationships and escapades they share as a result of its influence and their chimera or more derogatorily, the ignis fatuus effect on their very subsistence. Never done in film till that point, the plot is as original as it was and still is today, a sheer whimsical reverie to say the least, and is thus very entertaining, much the way you'd assume Allen Konigsborg wanted his films to function- as an imaginative escape from the hum drum banality of this world. That fiction drives the film and the very plot of having a leading actor (a dashing Jeff Daniels pre-Dumb & Dumber- we can understand how Michael Keaton got the boot from Woody, seriously) walk off the screen literally and romanticize an ordinary down-trodden, abused waitress in depression era New Jersey (played elegantly by Mia Farrow pre documentary expose- we can't understand how Soon Yi got the loot from Woody, seriously) is simply spell-binding as a plot line. Moreover, one starts to realize that the technical splendor that emanated out of editing this film to ensure the figments came out all jazz and tangible also stand as an attestation to its quality even upon current viewing. The pacing is rhythmic, almost keeping time with the lilting and jazzy soundtrack of 'Charleston-esque' swing, which for me, really kept the filming dancing 'Cheek to Cheek', with a highlight peaking at the scene where Farrow enters the phantom world of 'the movie within a movie' in a montage of apparition proportions.The biggest flaw with this film probably is that many try to characterize it or compare it against \"Woody Allen's\" scale chart: constantly ranking it amongst other Allen films;weighing it against 'Annie Hall' or 'Crimes and Misdemeanours'. The reality is that it was a film that served its own purpose, like each film by Allen would and does. In this case, I personally feel it was to function as a subliminal parody cum satire of film audiences and a unique look into the relationships between them and films- the latter taking on a symbolic 'life' of its own with characters that felt and 'lived' according to their fictional world, and explores the incubus of what would happen if existing coevally with Farrow's world (representing us, the real audiences)becomes possible. It feeds and thrives on a fantasy moment that many audiences actually have dreamed of at some stage of their lives watching films, providing them with that escape from reality. In the film, Farrow's character does just that, and it is a story about how as a movie about a movie (as Time Magazine called it in 1985), it told us how empty fantasies were, how fleeting they were and how perhaps, cocooned we are to escape our realities only through film as our source of hope. Moreover, in my view, several scenes in the film actually point to the satire existing deliberately and purportedly for the purpose of suggesting that industry of film and its captive audiences were being parodied. Perhaps Allen was taking a jibe at cynical, double standard wielding critics or audiences who needed to wizen up? We will never know I suppose. Nonetheless, there are some clear references, with the main pastiche being that all the RKO producers, agents and executives actually went along with the preposterous story of their actor jumping off screen and thus they had to get him back! There are tons of other references including Daniels' Baxter character comparing the Producers and Writers of his film to the divine; an heiress complaining about her role; a member of the audience marching out claiming 'the film's not the way it was last week and I want it that way' (delusion); etc.Essentially, Allen is taking a burlesque view of the whole thing in my opinion. If a viewer of the film can't see the aforementioned points, its then that the film might end up being looked upon as a one off fluffy piece. Having said that, it is still generally more sweet content than deep and complicated satire- in fact it's just like the popcorn that Daniels' character Tom Baxter first tastes- brittle, the stuff is sweet, and like Baxter says, 'gets annoying when you keep chewing on it'. Similarly, Allen's Purple Rose is good for a one off viewing but one would be hard pressed to chew again unless you really were fond of the the original fantasy, or in this case, the satire of audiences and film.By Stephen Thanabalan",

Those films each completely took me away from my normal life and brought me into the movie world for a few hours. I always want movies to take me to a different place, which is why I watch so many films. But for a movie like Purple Rose of Cairo, which is about a movie character jumping into the real world and having a real life, the film didn't do much for me. I think the writing and music is lovely, but even Farrow didn't impress me too much in one of the many collaborations with Allen. But I will say Allen is always good at creating characters that are memorable, even if they were over-the-top. Jeff Daniels is also somebody who has yet to demand my attention the way actors should. When he was playing Tom I found him to be much more engaging rather than the snobby yet somehow romantic actor he played. The Fred Astaire song in the beginning and end of the movie reminding me of why I love romantic movies, even if this movie wasn't what I hoped for. The song definitely left a good taste in my mouth, which is one of the key things I think a movie should do.While the movie as a whole isn't an all time classic like it should have been, it does have several elements that were not only ahead of its time but memorable in an overall not so memorable movie. I love that most of the movie is spent inside a movie theater, it makes me think how weird but awesome it would have been to see this in theaters. But I did find the actual idea of him leaving the screen too far fetched for the tone of the rest of the movie.+Fred Astaire's cheek to cheek+movie about movies+ahead of its time-Jeff Daniels performance-idea is almost to far fetched-not memorable6.6/10",

            "content": "\"The Purple Rose Of Cairo\" would make an interesting double bill with Arnold Schwarzenegrer's \"Last Action Hero\": the two films travel a similar path, but in opposite directions - in \"Purple Rose\", a fictional character crosses over to the \"real\" world (where he meets, among other people, the actor who plays him) and, later, a \"real\" character enters the world of the movies; in \"Last Action Hero\", the same things happen, but in the reverse order. \"Purple Rose\" is ingenious, imaginative, warmly photographed, and features Mia Farrow's best performance in a Woody Allen film up to that time (1985) - she is amazingly expressive. Yet you can't shake the feeling that it could have been even better - that perhaps Allen missed a few chances along the way, like for example having more scenes of the Tom Baxter character interacting with the real world, like those in the restaurant or in the brothel (he spends a lot of time in an empty amusement park instead). Nevertheless, Allen himself claims this is one of his finest movies, so any fan of his should be compelled to watch it on the basis of that alone. *** out of 4.",

            "content": "Back in 1924, silent comedy genius Buster Keaton thrilled and amazed audiences when he took that remarkable step into the movie screen, suddenly becoming the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Jr. Decades later, another film-making genius, Woody Allen \u0096 obviously inspired by Keaton's classic comedy \u0096 crafted a fantastic nostalgic comedy in which the very opposite occurs: a movie character, falling in love with an audience member, steps down from the screen and treads into the real world. Set in the 1930s, in the midst of the Great Depression, 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' is Allen's warm-hearted tribute to the magic and perfection of cinema, and to its unmatched ability to thrill and comfort in even the most trying of times.Woody Allen fans might despair that the director himself does not appear at all in the film, but they need not. The film stars Mia Farrow, who maintained a well-publicised personal and professional relationship with Allen throughout the 1980s, and she certainly knows how to deliver his dialogue. Farrow plays Cecilia, a dreamy, disheartened waitress who comes home every night to a disloyal, neglectful and abusive husband (Danny Aiello). Cecilia has a passion for movies \u0096 particularly love stories \u0096 and it is the week's newest release at the local cinema that helps her to get through her difficult life. During a particularly stressful week, after losing her job and discovering her husband in bed with another woman, Cecilia finds solace in the latest screwball comedy/romance, 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' falling in love with the character of Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), the impossibly perfect and courageous young explorer with a heart of gold.It is here that Allen's film begins to stray from the norm, and suddenly becomes a fascinating masterpiece. After her fifth viewing of 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' a most unexpected occurrence takes place. In mid-sentence, the character of Tom Baxter suddenly forgets his lines and directs his attention explicitly towards a flabbergasted Cecilia in the audience. Deciding that he has finally had enough of performing the film, Baxter miraculously descends from the cinema screen, takes Cecilia by the hand and escorts her quickly out into the real world. This scene is nothing less than magical, and I was so enraptured by it that I was compelled to rewind and watch it again! Perhaps the sheer casualness with which all this takes place requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but, after all, we are talking about a movie here, and movies are allowed to differ from the real world.As Cecilia and Tom begin a wonderful romantic relationship, the film's producer, Raoul Hirsch (Alexander Cohen), is extremely distressed that a character \u0096 from one of his films, no less! \u0096 has been able to descend from the screen. He orders the actor who portrayed Tom Baxter, the rising Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels again), to travel to New Jersey to mend the disaster. Ironically, Shepherd is nothing like the noble character he portrayed in 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' being an arrogant and conceited opportunist who is more concerned with his career than anything else. Nonetheless, when Cecilia accidentally comes to meet him, romantic sparks begin to fly once again. With everybody pressuring Tom to return to the screen, Cecilia must make a difficult and ultimately tragic decision: should she choose to love the perfect (but fictional) Tom Baxter, or the slightly-less-perfect (but real) Gil Shepherd. After eventually making her decision, Cecilia is to learn that sometimes real-life isn't quite as perfect as the movies\u0085Allen's respect for the film medium is instantly apparent, perhaps even more so here than any of his other films. The meticulously-constructed film-within-a-film (featuring such actors as Van Johnson, Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Milo O'Shea and Edward Herrmann) perfectly captures the typical style and humour of the screwball comedies of that era. Allen also pays tribute to Mark Sandrich's famous Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical, 'Top Hat (1935)', featuring the legendary \"Heaven, I'm in Heaven\" dance sequence in the the film's heartbreaking but reassuring finale. Shot in crisp black-and-white (chosen both to properly evoke the era, and to avoid any possible colour difficulties as Tom steps out of the screen), 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' looks great, and, thanks to the director's patented clever dialogue, sounds great as well. For fans of cinema, this is not a film that you would want to miss.UPDATE: I've since discovered that the film is supposed to be viewed in colour. I can't imagine what happened to my television! However, I still maintain that the black-and-white works extremely well.",

It combines hilarious comedy with serious themes, as all his best films do, and it does so in lapidary style---not a word wasted, not a joke added just for yuks. The comedy, particularly the bickering among the actors stranded on screen, is as funny as anything Allen ever wrote, and the squalor and cruelty of the real world are a perfect counterpoint, managing to make the film's fantasy premise completely believable.Several IMDb reviewers have complained that they were disappointed by the sad ending of \"Purple Rose\"; I strongly disagree. The ending as Allen wrote it is almost inevitable. A happier ending would have brought the real-world half of the film firmly into the area of fairy-tale fantasy, and would have shattered the balance that lies at the heart of the movie. If anything, Jeff Daniels's brooding, regretful look in our last view of him, and Mia Farrow's half-smile in the final shot, soften the power of the ending a bit more than I'd have wished.If you watch only films with happy endings, you're missing a lot of very good movies.",

            "content": "The Purple Rose of Cairo is not just any typical film. It is obvious that the plot was well-done, and i enjoyed the fantasy vs. reality theme. Sometimes we all need that escape from the real world; to just live life with your imagination. The movie was comedic and kept me interested the entire time. I constantly found myself wanting a better life for Cecilia, and enjoying Tom Baxter's romantic personality. Character development was very evident, especially with Tom. He goes from being a clueless wanderer to a more believable, real character with feelings and thoughts. One of my favorite scenes is where he follows \"Emma\" to her job, and all the ladies come on to him, yet he still has no idea what is going on. That was comedic and adoreable on his character's part. Woody Allen's filmic style is also very specific,neat, and comfortable to view. The lighting is usually dark and the characters' dialogues work well with the cameras to convey the feelings of anger, fright, excitement, or romance. The parallelism that is incorporated with the film is very effective because you can establish where each character is in relation to the next. The shots seem well-planned and were carried out well.The sounds in the movie definitely also helped to set the tone. The music played in the movie theatre, as well as other scenes were just right. The movie within a movie idea was brilliant and humorous, and i just wish that would happen in real life! I found the characters behind that screen very entertaining and funny. However, some of the characters' behaviors did bother me at times. Cecilia's lack of confidence made her character seem dependent and less intelligent. Her voice was so childish at times, and the treatment she recieved and ACCEPTED from her husband was ridiculous. I know this is how the movie was meant to be, and I'm sure Mia Farrow's acting is not terrible. I just think Cecilia's character could have been a little stronger. Gil's character is appreciated by me until the ending. I thought the ending was unsatisfactory and was a disappointment. I was expecting her to be with Gil and make a change to her depressing life. I guess that's what the film maker wanted us to hope for. Overall, the acting was great and the dialogue worked with the audience well. This movie is quite an achievement. It was very inventive, original, and displayed amazing creative style...with very few flaws.  I would definitely applaud it and recommend it to other audiences.\n---Indira",

You are taken to a new level, a level that releases you from your real life pain. The audience is readily tempted to imagine himself in his shoes. This is a movie inside a movie and reality and fiction are hard to distinguish. The characters come and go back to the screen which is played as part of the plot. It must take imagination to write a piece like this, a piece Woody Allen easily comes up with. The hard line between reality and fiction is cleared at the end, though: The main character is deceived by the famous Gil Shepherd who makes promises and forces her to make a choice to save his reputation. Only when she opts for the real instead of the movie character will she realize that the real life is not that rosy.",

At one point, a character, Tom Baxter, from the movie notes her, and walks off the screen..!! Yes, the character literally walks out with her. He wanted to learn about the real world, and was in deep love with her. Meanwhile, the movie was stuck in half way, the other characters were in confusion and waiting for the return of Tom Baxter. The theater management calls the studio and get connected with the producer. The real, Gil Shepherd, actor who played as Tom Baxter also panic and reaches the town. Ultimately, Cecilia is trapped between her Husband, Tom Baxter and Gil Shepherd.A really interesting movie. The fantasy element was realistically taken.

Here she makes that the film begins like a straight tribute to Cinema with her big love for movies, always remembering everything of them, talking about them all the time, etc. Is unique because we can say easily that she is affecting her own life mostly because at her work she can't be focused in anything but in the last movie she saw. At the same time her problems at home with her husband Monk (Danny Aiello) are more and more. Monk not only spends all the day in playing and drinking with his friends but also treats her really bad. -Everything set during the Great Depression-. So Cecilia really loves movies and The Purple Rose of Cairo is definitely one of her personal new favourites, the new hit for her during those difficult times. Eventually The Purple Rose of Cairo becomes her method for escapism of her daily routine. Is fantastic, is great, is homage to when an actor/actress is not only making a performance but creating life, a new human being in a different world. Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) doesn't wanted just that, he wanted to be a normal person, a real person and when he is in our world he is like a pure person without the feelings of a real person, those feelings that real persons had because of the world we are living in. There are like two scenes, wonderful ones, in particular where Tom Baxter is like a pure person. One is when he is fighting against Monk without any \"trick\" for the woman he loves and the other when he meets the prostitutes. He is a dumb and that is really funny (the scene when he doesn't know how is after a kiss is also in the same way) and his own \"innocence\" change in a way the feelings of those women, of course they never meet before a guy like Tom so for them is like the perfect man who can only exist in movies. Here we have some fascinating situations since Tom Baxter is the man from the \"fairy tales\" and the \"evil\" is Baxter's creator, the actor Gil Shepherd. Is like a reality vs. fiction conflict and is so great how marked are the sides, is easy to know how is the good and who is the bad since Baxter is there just for the love to Cecilia and Gil Shepherd is there just for his career, to can still be a promising future Hollywood star. And is funnier and stranger when actually this reality vs. fiction conflict is also for the love of a woman, obviously the name of that woman is Cecilia, a woman who loves the worlds that movies can create but who was real. It was the destiny of Baxter, finally he was part of a world, a world that can't exist without his presence, a world that have a script, a world that must be as it was the last night, a world that was filmed, a world that exist for persons like Cecilia.I'm pretty sure that the ending doesn't and will not leave more than one satisfied but is a very logic ending and for Cecilia is a reminder of how is the real world. For me this is a perfect film, funny, charming and really unique. It captures the magic we feel every time we go to the movies, the magic that itself has. Easily Woody Allen's masterpiece of the 80's and for me, after watching Bananas, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex\u0085, Sleeper, Love and Death, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, Hannah and Her Sisters, Radio Days, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Husbands and Wives, Deconstructing Harry, Sweet and Lowdown, Small Time Crooks, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Hollywood Ending, Anything Else, Melinda and Melinda, Match Point, Scoop and Cassandra's Dream, it is my favourite Woody Allen film. 10 out of 10",

Woody Allen is brilliant as a directer, using lightning to his advantage at creating symbolism between faces and settings. The sound, though at first, might seem to be out of place is actually carefully placed to heighten the our experience.

(and how appropriate for this movie!)For some reason or another, I've never been able to sit down and watch this movie until tonight ... nearly 35 years after it's theatrical release. Better late than never, right? And I'm sure glad I finally did get to see it.For Cecillia (Mia Farrow), a night in the theater watching a movie on the silver screen means more to her than it does to the average person. With a thankless job, a husband who takes her for granted and doesn't appreciate her, and during a time when money is tight - she lives for the wonderment and fantasy of an RKO Radio Pictures film. But when the film, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is aired, she falls in love with the film, and ironically, the film falls in love with her (in a manner of speaking). The character, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), literally steps out of the movie into the real world and begins to woo Cecilia - expressing his undying love for her. Of course, this leads to great concern among the film's makers and actors ... as well as the moviegoers who demand their money back. As if things aren't bad enough, the actor who portrays Baxter onscreen also arrives and says he is in love with Cecilia. Now Cecilia must chose - the character, the actor, or her husband.This is one of the most charming movies I've seen in a while. It hearkens back to the golden age of cinema, and the \"real life\" setting is shot in the same way. It bolsters a kind of innocence, even in some of the more awkward situations - for example when he is propositioned by a group of prostitutes at the local brothel. The pacing of the movie is very good, moving you right along, appropriate to the story line. The strength of this movie, to me, was in the dialogue. But, then again, this is a Woody Allen film and that has always been his strong point. Witty, intelligent, and funny.This is a high recommend for me. I feel bad that I waited so long to see this one - yet extremely glad I did settle down into it. It brings back what movie magic should be. Even when the disappointment of real life may win on the outside, on the inside, we can smile at something as simple, yet beautiful, as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing across the screen.",

In yet another viewing of an old musical/adventure tale, one of the characters, played by Jeff Daniels, turns to her and starts talking to her, even coming out of the celluloid projection. He has come to life. What's so extraordinary is that others see this, too! It's not like only Mia can see him. Jeff's real existence creates havoc. People want their money back.

Being new to the whole experience of Woody Allen films I found watching the film \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" was highly enjoyable yet depressing. This film revolves around this somewhat naive, daydreamer from New Jersey during the Depression. Working at a small diner (where she is quickly fired) to support her addiction to the big-screen, Cecilia (Mia Farrow) plays this daydreamer who watches movies to escape the harsh reality of her life. Working at an unimaginative, dead-end job and married to an abusive brute, Cecilia's hum-drum and pitiful life is shaken up when Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) walks off the movie screen to her reality and world. Tom Baxter a romantic archaeologist spouting words of love brightens up and brings brief happiness to Cecilia's life. For once Cecilia finds excitement and gets a taste of the Hollywood life, but she is still living or stuck in this fantasy world of hers. The movie intensifies when Cecelia also falls in love with the actor Gil Shepherd who plays Tom Baxter and has to choose between both men along with which world she wants to live in, reality or fantasy.In a span of just 84 minutes Woody Allen delves into and explores the humanistic need and desire for fantasy, including the age-old question of where humans fit in the grand scheme of things in the universal order. Being use to happy Hollywood endings, a viewer initially might be dissatisfied at how things end. Although eventually one will see that the ending was the only and best way for Cecilia. Creating a universal character, together with his certain flair of filming and great method of telling a story, Woody Allen produces a hauntingly beautiful film that leaves an undeniable impression on every viewer. He leaves everyone with a depressing afterthought that in the end, we all have to choose reality.",

When I discovered this, I feared the worst as I tend to like Allen's movies for his character and not much else (aside from 'Annie Hall', which may well be the most perfect film ever made), but, to my surprise, I found that there's a lot to like about this surreal fantasy. The plot is weird to say the least (although it's less weird if you've seen The Last Action Hero). I feared that Allen might miss the mark with such a strange plot (like he did with 'Sleeper', another surreal fantasy), and although some of the jokes and ideas don't work; I most certainly do think that Allen has hit the nail on the head with this film. Well, almost. The plot follows Cecilia, a bored housewife in 1930's New Jersey. In an attempt to fill a void in her life, Cecilia visits the cinema. A lot. However, she gets an unsuspected surprise one day at the cinema while viewing the new film which is, strangely enough, titled; 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', when a minor character (but one that holds it all together), Tom Baxter gets up and walks off the screen, only to fall deeply in love with Cecilia. However, all is never rosy, as Gil Shepard, the up and coming actor that plays Tom Baxter in the movie is non too pleased that he has a doppelganger walking around, and so turns up in Cecilia's life as another challenger for her heart...Where this film works is when it's concentrating on the film character in the real world. Seeing him learn about the difference between the real world and the world of the movies is always amusing and it allows Woody Allen to make some amusing observations between the two. However, Woody Allen seems too intent on being as surreal as possible, and some of the more weird things in the movie - such as the rest of the movie cast talking to the audience about the predicament they are in - come off being unfunny and therefore don't really work. I can see why Allen would have included that idea in the movie, and it's a good one that could potentially garner lots of laughs, but Woody didn't handle it right and the result just doesn't work. Furthermore, without Woody Allen, it just doesn't seem like a Woody Allen movie. To be honest, I don't think the film would have fit Allen's character - the two lead roles certainly don't fit him, but I like to see Woody Allen in movies, so him not being here is disappointing, for me anyway. That being said, the rest of the cast, particularly the two leads, do a wonderful job of carrying the movie. Jeff Bridges, a massively underrated actor, is a perfect fit for the dual role of Tom Baxter and Gil Shepard and he really does the film proud. Mia Farrow is another inspired casting choice for her character; she's a sublime actress \u0096 and you could certainly imagine her being a bored housewife (no offence, Mia...).And now I come to the 'point' of the movie. The movie most definitely seems like it has a defining point.... but what is it? The point is, almost, lost under a barrage of surreal images and general weirdness. However, there is definitely one here so let's see if we can find it\u0085 is Woody trying to tell his audience that if a movie character steps out of the screen and falls in love with you, don't turn him down? Is Woody trying to say that a perfect man (or woman) cannot exist in this imperfect world? Is Woody trying to tell people that their unrealistic fantasies won't come true, and even if they did; they still wouldn't come out perfectly? Is he trying to say that the world of fiction and reality shouldn't collide? Is Allen trying to tell us that nothing is perfect? That everything belongs in it's place? I think that this film says all of these things, but united under one simple message; life isn't perfect. Fair enough.",

            "review_title": "\"Otherwise, what's life all about anyway?\"",
            "content": "Already from the beginning, Woody Allen was working on characters. In \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\", a very young Jeff Daniels plays two characters: an actor named Gil Shepherd and a character Shepherd plays for the movie of the title, called Tom Baxter. Needless to say the actor Daniel portrays is also a character, therefore we're talking of studying characters inside characters; which is precisely what Allen does in this movie that also contains another movie inside of it.Don't you ever wonder what it would be like? Being in Hollywood, doing an important motion picture? Or the other things you wonder while watching a film: if the characters could really exist, if they are real enough for us to connect with them. There is a rapidly spoken phrase in \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" that could easily explain what Allen was trying to achieve with the piece, and something that's also a simple truth: \"The fictional characters want to live in the real life, and the real people want to be inside a movie\".Both things occur in this film, as Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a movie lover, escapes with adventurer Tom Baxter, who suddenly during the projection of the film (which, as it's been clarified, shares the title with the actual film we're talking about) looks at the screen and tells her: \"You must really love this movie\". It was the beginning of cinema; a film was showed in theatres for a week and it was the only thing you had. Cecilia goes to watch the movie in question a few times, and the fifth time, this character jumps off the screen and takes her with him, to see her city. Some time later, he'll take her back, and they'll both be together on the screen, in black and white, walking the streets of Allen's beloved Manhattan. In essence, the plot description is simple. Cecilia is unhappily married with Monk (a brilliant performance by Danny Aiello) and finds in the movie character played Daniels a fresh breeze of romanticism she's never experienced. But then the real actor comes into the picture and things get complicated. That is what Allen's script describes and what occupies most of his movie. However, Cecilia is no fool, and is aware of the improbable nature of her situation. That's why, at times, after Tom Baxter says something beautiful to her, she responds: \"That's movie talk\". Farrow is great at evoking a sense of admiration with her big wide eyes and at interrupting this sort of naivety abruptly to face her husband. But then there's this other thing, that is more than a romantic story and every girl's dream come true tale, and has to do with characters speaking from the screen to an audience sitting on a movie theater. What is this? What are they saying? For brief instants and with the comedic touch that Allen dominates, in the long time the characters of \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" wait for Baxter to come back, they discuss people, relationships, social status and Hollywood. I wonder what would happen if a movie we know by heart changed its structure, if characters rebelled and disappeared from a film. In this aspect, Allen is making a parody and a homage at the same time, to Hollywood. A parody because he introduces a character who is a producer and goes mad when finding out his movie characters are jumping off the screen; a parody because the characters on the screen are so used to do the same thing every time that they can't understand how something has changed. And a homage when, for example, a character on screen who's a waiter learns that everything is being improvised and, all of a sudden starts to dance; a homage because when Cecilia watches Fred Astaire singing \"Cheek to cheek\" and we understand that watching movies is like being in heaven. But I still do wonder what would really happen if a movie, one of the few timeless possessions of our times, unexpectedly changed. I would probably steal a phrase from a moviegoer that goes to watch \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\": \"I want what happened in the movie last week to happen this week; otherwise, what's life all about anyway?\". I imagine you would also agree with her.",

I hadn't seen it before, but i knew it would be something worth watching, it would have the edge and inventiveness Allen most of the time puts in his films. This is a very worthwhile experience. The set up is juicy just by reading a synopsis, and what he does with it is wonderful.So we have a woman who lives her life, her true life, rooted in the many films she watches. She overcomes her sad reality of poverty and a macho unfaithful lazy husband, with the films she sees, and lives in. So we have a 'real' character (in the reality framed by the exterior movie) who lives in a world of her film rooted fantasies. Nothing so uncommon. Than we are introduced to a specific film within the film. This film is watched over and over again by Mia, to the point in which a character of the film enters the real world of the outer film. So fantasy enters the real world. This is new, it's inventive and it was great to watch. The characters of the film within the film are self-aware, they know they are performers, and after the normal order of things within the film is broken, they feel lost (the scriptwriters were God to the egyptologist). This was a great set-up, in a film which incidentally was of a great visual quality, uncommon (to my taste) in the majority of Allen's films (exception made to Manhattan and a few others).My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Cairo is one of the lesser known films among non-Allenophiles. That is a shame. It is a gem of a film. Rated PG, it is accessible to audiences of many ages, asks provoking questions about auteurship, and is a visually inventive piece of film making.Woody has left a bad taste in my mouth in the past with his ironic casting (hmm...Muriel Hemmingway as his ravishingly beautiful 17 year old lover in Manhattan...almost unbelievable until he goes and hooks up with Sun-Yee Previn, his beautiful, then 19 year-old, stepdaughter). Here, his casting is spot on. Both Jeff Daniels, in his well carried dual-role and Mia Farrow, as the stars-in-her-eyes Cecilia, display a great mix of comic timing and sentimentality.For all those post-modernists, Woody brings us nagging meta narrative questions...what is reality? How can art be said to live on in the viewer? What animates fantasy? How do the characters relate to each other and film?While giving us food for thought, Mr. Allen also gives us a feast for the eyes with his conceptions of depression-era film making amidst the dreary backdrop of industrial New Jersey. His use of color, darkly lit interiors and location shots (the abandoned amusement park at Bertrand Island, NJ) creates a memorable cinematic realm.This is a nice departure for those sick of Hollywood schlock or overly pretentious art house fare. A sweet film to share with any movie fan. Definitely worth the 90 minutes of your life it will take to view.",

            "content": "In the days before watching Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo, i thought that the story was going to be an adventure movie about a man who goes to Cairo, Egypt to find a purple rose, but turns out I was sort of right. The movie tells the story of a poor waitress named Cecilia (played by Mia Farrow) who wants to escape her horrible marriage all because of her abusive husband Monk (played by Danny Aiello whose performance is very similar to both Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire, and Robert De Niro in Raging Bull), for which Cecilia watches movies to cheer herself up. One day after Cecilia is done with her waitress job she watches an adventure movie called The Purple Rose of Cairo five times in a row, and during the fifth time one of the characters Tom Baxter (played by Jeff Daniels) ends up escaping the theater screen and into the real world and at the same time ends up falling in love with Cecilia, but when that first happens the movie leaves us with one question and that is how he is going to be put back into the screen in which he escaped from along with the help of Gil Sheperd (again played by Jeff Daniels) who obviously played Baxter in the movie. One time when Woody Allen was asked on what he thought that his film was about and he said \"Some critics said that The Purple Rose of Cairo was only about the movies, when I think all this movie is about is the difference between fantasy and reality.\" though I do agree with both critics and Allen himself. Allen blends both fantasy and reality in a way never seen before with brilliance. This movie is a true Woody Allen classic.",

            "content": "It's already documented that I am a major sucker for Woody Allen films. How I haven't yet seen all of his films is a mystery to me. A month with two Woody Allen titles included was sure to be a treat, and The Purple Rose of Cairo did not disappoint. Written and directed by Allen in 1985 and starring Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels, Allen graces audiences with a view into the depths of humanity like only he knows how to provide. The Purple Rose of Cairo tells the story of a woman living a disappointing life during the depression whose only escape is her daily trip to the movie theatre where she watches the characters on screen come to life right before her eyes. In 1935 in New Jersey, feeble working wife Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is so lost in her hopeless life that she spends day after day in the cinema watching the same showing again and again. Cecilia has no other positive place to put her mind. She lives with her abusive philandering husband by night and spends her days catering to others who barely notice her. Cecelia eventually gets so lost in her movie that it pours over into her working life as a waitress at a local diner. Her boss has had it with her distraction and fires her, which only gives Cecilia more time for her movie. While enjoying her cinema time one afternoon, the handsome supporting star Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) notices Cecilia in the audience and walks out of the picture to begin talking to her. He is enraptured by the fact that she keeps returning to the theatre to repeatedly see the film. He decides to take a break from the film and learn about the world outside of the studio with Cecilia. His absence leads to an uproar inside the screen as the film cannot go on without him leaving the characters stuck on the screen. Cecilia is enjoying her time with Tom teaching him about life in the real world. Even though Tom has no money or way of earning money he is enjoying his time with Cecilia. The problem deepens when Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels), the actor behind the character of Tom begins to fight with Tom over the affection of Cecilia. Cecilia hasn't been in a loving relationship for may years, let alone having two men fight over her. With both men fighting over her, Cecilia finally gains enough courage to leave her husband. Overwhelmed, Cecilia spends time with both of them attempting to decide who she would most like to give her affections to. Tom is faced with a big decision as well, will he continue to live in the real world and enjoy true love for the first time, or will he return to his life in the movie?The Purple Rose of Cairo is another example of how adept Woody Allen is at exploring the realism of human beings, even when not all of the human beings in Woody Allen films are real. He combs through the depths of Cecilia's soul to show just how desperate she is in a carefully meticulous way that few other writer/directors can as effectively. It's been written that this was Allen's favorite film of his until Match Point, and one can see the passion behind this picture. He is so careful to flesh out each character, as he always does, to give a full picture of the perspective of each piece of the puzzle. Many have criticized Allen's premise of characters on screen interacting with audience members as gimmicky, but I found the premise genius. Separating the characters with their corresponding actor was another tool Allen used to show the multifaceted nature of human beings. Each person had a facade that they exposed to those around them, and yet battled demons in solitude that no one knew anything about. Life is full of disappointments, and sometimes the only place to go is the cinema, to escape the dreads of one's own life. Allen's ending in The Purple Rose of Cairo proves that no matter how well things are going at one time in someone's life, there is no guarantee that they will stay that way. There is also no way to ensure that happiness will always surround you because life cannot be controlled, even by the person living it. Another excellent illustration into the depths of humanity, Woody Allen provides a prize to audiences with The Purple Rose of Cairo.",

            "content": "Even from the opening credits, there is something uniquely different about The Purple Rose of Cairo. Allen's familiar white on black text reveals the film's cast and crew, but the music strikes another familiarity, Allen aside.The song is \"Cheek to Cheek,\" a number made famous by the singing/dancing/acting duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the popular RKO production Top Hat (1935). But what is a song that was made popular in a film doing in another film made 50 years later?The answer lies in Cairo's plot. Cecilia, played marvelously by Mia Farrow, is a waitress struggling to get by in the midst of the depression. As if the constant nagging of her frustrated boss isn't enough, she goes home to a physically and emotionally abusive husband who is out of work and doing nothing about it.Cecilia's only escape from her drudging life is the theater that she frequents. She finds solace in the romance and happy endings that films typify. These films become the only true loves of her life, but who says films can't love you back?Upon one of Cecilia's numerous viewings of a new film, also titled The Purple Rose of Cairo, the main character, Tom Baxter, played by Jeff Daniels, walks right out of the big screen and into the real world. Chaos ensues as the fictional world is irreversibly altered and the film's production team tries to save not only its reputation but also that of Gil Shepherd, the actor who played Tom Baxter, also played by Jeff Daniels. A love triangle is born, as Cecilia must choose between the perfect but fictional Tom Baxter and the not-so-perfect but real life Gil Shepherd.Few people but Woody Allen could have pulled off such an ambitious plot that still held on to its message\u0085and its humor. Not a stranger to comedy, romance, drama or fantasy, Allen has successfully mixed a few if not all of these genres in many of his previous films.In the same vein as Love and Death, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy and Stardust Memories, Cairo is a surreal comedy with something to say. It addresses both the important role stories, in particular film, have on providing an escape for real-life and the danger of becoming so wrapped up in fiction that it is hard to face reality.Given Allen's intensive filmography, directing nearly a film a year for almost 20 years upon Cairo's release, it is hard not to assume the film is at least semi-autobiographical. Allen himself seems to be entranced by the fictional world to the same degree Cecilia is.While a meaningfully deep comedy, Cairo is still a comedy, and a great one. Baxter's ignorance to the real world gives way to some hilarious scenes, in particular when a whore unknowingly leads him to a brothel.Especially funny is how quickly the characters of the film get over the bizarre circumstances and begin to worry about themselves, particularly Shepherd's quick transition from disbelief that his character has entered the real world to anxiety about his reputation. Similarly, there is a classic scene in which the audience members in the theater and the fictional characters on screen bicker back and forth and even end up insulting each other.As Allen's 13th directorial release, The Purple Rose of Cairo proves to be one of his greatest achievements, and also his self-proclaimed favorite film to date. As the opening song cues, it is a movie about movies made by a guy who lives his life through movies. As only the second film in which he is not in, Cairo can even appeal to non-Allen fans. While not gracing his presence in the film, it is quintessentially Allen in every other way, and rightfully so.",

Most of us don't know there are two sides of ourselves, the 'what we do in our physical world' side and the 'what we do in our imagination/thought' side. How many of us know the difference and how much more the imagination/thought side of us affects us more than our 'physical' side and what we are doing in it? Probably not many adults go into too much imagination of what can be, rather than what is or what was. That's why it's important for many of us to learn how to focus on what 'can be' as opposed to 'what is now' or 'what was' in the past. The movie helps us understand and puts a physical perspective on an imaginary mind. So there was the movie character (which was the imaginative and fictional idea which wasn't in the current creation/physical reality) and then there's the real actor playing the imaginative/fictional part of the show. Which one would I rather stay in? That's easy...the imaginative/fictional because eventually as I do, it becomes real to me, so real I can sense it in every part of my being by feeling it, the imagination of myself in an ever-changing and evolving world of desire. It's a interesting concept many of us don't bother to delve into, but I'm learning it all by myself and I couldn't be more proud of how far I've come.

Although if he had to go back in the film, then she should've been with the real Gil. I found it odd that he didn't appear near the end, sure he loved Cecila too! Seriously in my opinion, I think Woody Allen should've had them both living happily ever after. To be honest, I thought the ending was particularly going back to the beginning. It's just Farrows character was beginning to become poor and like, she honestly deserved better. Unfortunately this was 1985, so we can't be complaining now. It is one of the best films at the same time, I really loved the movie! :)",

            "content": "Woody Allen's \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" was actually very interesting, surprisingly.  In my lifetime, I have probably viewed millions of movies and I did not expect it to be comedic or have at all, anything that I would enjoy.  It was a pretty old movie compared to what I was used to watching but this did meet my expectations of a \"decent\" film.  I found several aspects of the storyline that were quite unique...something that I wasn't used to. I am the romantic type so when I learned that this was a romantic-ish movie, I was pretty excited.  As I got more into the movie, the funny parts made it all that much more interesting.  The transition of the character development of especially Tom was obvious.  Woody Allen did a good job with his major theme of fantasy vs. reality.  Sometimes, when life gets too tough, we tend to want to escape our problematic realities into a world where everything is the way he had hoped it would be.  This is clearly shown in Mia Farrow's character, Cecilia. When she was confronted with making the decision of chosing b/w reality, she realized that she couldn't run away forever.  She learned that she had to deal with her reality. As soon as this hit her, another \"sad\" event occurred with her that probably psychologically forced her to return to her fantasy world.  The ending was kind of upsetting because I wanted a happy one but real life just isn't like that right?",

            "content": "When watching a movie, we enter the worlds of both fantasy and reality. However, after two hours, we are forced to enter the reality world once again. Woody Allen directing The Purple Rose of Cairo questions this cycle asking why cannot one stay in fantasy. For Cecilia, she got this chance to stay when Tom Baxter popped out from the screen. But in the end Woody Allen showed that fantasy could only go so far. While maybe perfect in every way, like Tom was for Cecilia, fiction can only be an escape for humans, never a substitute for the real thing. Cecilia uses this fantasy almost like a drug to escape the realities of the Depression and Monk, an abusive and controlling husband, but she knows she will go back to reality eventually. The contrasting colors between the dark and gloomy New Jersey and grayish brightness of Hollywood are key to this movie. When Gil came to New Jersey, he made Cecilia's world a little brighter as did Tom inside the screen. Another great use of contrast was Cecilia's acting towards Monk, who represented realism, and Tom, representing an ideal and innocent lifestyle. She was uncomfortable with Monk, always stuttering and lying, while being humane and honest with Tom. What is disappointing is this well-done movie has a pessimistic ending. Cecilia was once again watching a movie imagining instead of having it all with Gil or Tom. Then again, the ending chosen for this  `movie about movies' was the only realistic and natural approach, reinforcing that the line between fact and fiction has its limits.",

There is nothing that I can say of a negative nature about this movie. It is as if Woody Allen reached deep down into the depths of his creative process to create this marvelous work of art. This movie could have easily become just another goofy piece of Hollywood corn, but Woody Allen invested this movie with a special quality that transformed it to a sublime work of art.

The great depression, the deadbeat husband, naive dreamy wife, were all well played and written. So, because of that you really can enter that fantasy world with Cecilia, knowing that she does not have nothing worth for coming back home after a movie night.I get the sad ending in the artistic way, and is pretty real and touching, but made my heart chilled after smiling so much through the same story minutes before the ending. But in the other hand, I wish so bad she went inside the screen with Tom. I wish I could have told her - HEY, this is what you always wanted, do not be afraid if it seems \" too perfect\", just embrace it!I know that, but the way they explained, once they turn off the movie projector, they disappear. It is kind of sad, but why not jump to be happy for while (I believe most of us while reading or watching, wish we could choose magic over reality), instead of just being miserable forever. In the 30's getting a divorce was not like these days, and that scene at the brothel, showed me how she could ended up like those women.Unfortunately, she chose what it seemed to be touchable, reality. And I understand where she came from, though. I have seen it, in real life people scared of something that seems so good to be true, it must be troubled. There's even a saying about it,and that gets in people's way for the true happiness. If you like to watch movies for all the possible senses, even reading that has a potential sad ending to you, I recommend it.I did not spoil myself in any shape of form before watching it, so my heart is a little bit frozen still. I suppose that sometimes, we all want to see a happy ending (I know there are plenty of movies with it)because the reality is already too grey and full of flaws.",

Anthony, Annie Joe Edwards, Stephanie Farrow, David Kieserman, Glenne Headly. (PG)Depression-era movie patron (Farrow) gets quite a surprise when one of her favorite movie stars (Daniels) walks right off the theater screen as the character being portrayed in the film; things only get more complicated when the actual actor shows up and they get involved in a most unusual love triangle. Allen borrows inspiration from Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock Jr.\" (among others) and crafts one of his most creative and entertaining pictures, dangling a rose-colored prism between fantasy and reality, reflecting on how one side perceives the other. Farrow and Daniels are both just right, and the supporting cast get small moments to shine, including Wiest in her first of five Woody collaborations, bringing sweet grace to her brief role as a prostitute. A light touch is applied to the calculated plotting and relationships; though Allen doesn't milk this great premise for all it has, and the wrap-up of at least one sub-plot is disappointingly rushed, the bittersweet confection he creates is quite satisfying all the same. Scenes of the other movie characters commenting on the bizarre situation are the funniest, and the ending is a heartbreaker.86/100",

            "content": "I must admit to not being a particularly huge fan of Woody Allen. His irritating habit of appearing in just about every film he makes seems a trifle self-indulgent to me. So The Purple Rose of Cairo is unique in the Allen canon, for the simple fact that he's in the directors chair, and stays there. Instead he let Mia Farrow (his partner at the time) have the screen all to herself. And she does just fine in this warm and wonderfully witty romance.The Purple Rose of Cairo is a sadly overlooked film. It was showered with critical acclaim upon its release in 1985. But its never achieved the classic status of Woody Allen's other films like Manhattan or Annie Hall. Its actually a very clever and conceptually sophisticated movie because it was one of the first films to cover the previously untapped medium of meta-fiction.Cecelia (Farrow) is a downtrodden waitress living in New York, under the thumb of her layabout husband Monk. Set in the 30s during the height of the Great Depression, Cecelia finds no love from her husband or her job. The only escape she gets from her tedious life is the movies. She loves going to the pictures. Its a place where she can allow the simplicities of true love and Hollywood starlets wash over her, and make her forget all her problems.When a new film opens, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Cecelia becomes enamoured with one of the characters, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels in his finest film role), a dashing adventurer. Although a minor character, Cecelia only watches the film for him. And every day, she comes back to the cinema to watch the film again and again. Until one day, Tom actually addresses Cecelia, and bizarrely, steps off the screen into our world!Free of the B&W constraints of the cinema screen, Tom starts to explore the full colour world of solid reality with Cecelia as his guide. They start an unconventional romance, complicated by Tom's inability to comprehend the real world. And when the actor who plays Tom, Gil Shepherd (also Daniels) comes to New York to force his fictional alter ego back into film so he can save his career, and catches Cecelia's eye, things really get weird!TPROC is definitely offbeat. But what a film! Even with a lean running time of 85 minutes, the script takes us down quite a few different layers of reality. Woody Allen shows a talent for fantasy cinema with this film, and keeps quite a multitude of character arcs going with consummate skill. It never bothers to explain how Tom can leave the world of film and his fellow co-stars can't, but its not important. The fact that the film weaves such magic out of its conceit is what really matters.The chief pleasure to be had is watching Tom and Cecelia's romance unfold. Allen wittily plays around with conventions, like Tom's old fashioned chivalry at complete odds with real life. When he steps in to save Cecelia from Monk, he gets knocked about because since he fights fair, he expects the same of others. He doesn't know what a brothel is. And when he kisses Cecelia, he expects a fade out. Just like the movies!The very underrated Jeff Daniels probably gets his best film role here. Not only does he play Tom with considerable charm, but pulls double-duty by playing the actor who created Tom, Gil Shepherd. Daniels gets to show off his range with this film, and in the case of Gil, he's the complete opposite of Tom. Slightly smug, convinced of his acting ability, and so sure he's on the fast track to super stardom. His arguments with his fictional self are snappy, witty and even their viewpoints make sense in a weird way.There's also an amusing running gag concerning the other characters up on the film screen, wondering what to do now that Tom's left the picture. Because they're works of fiction, they're stuck in a routine. They can't advance the film until Tom comes back. And the film within a film takes on a life of its own when Tom takes Cecelia into TPROC, and gives her a taste of his life. The life she has always wanted.As things draw to a close, the love triangle between Tom, Gil and Cecelia comes to a startling conclusion. Of the two men, Cecelia chooses Gil over the more decent Tom. She decides a relationship with Gil is more realistic in the long run. A crushed Tom returns to his world.Cecelia feels like a new woman. She leaves Monk and her job behind. All prepared to start a new life with Gil in Hollywood. But Gil abandons her. Cecelia is left with neither man. Nor any job. Or a home. She's left homeless and penniless. Its quite a sad and downbeat ending that took me completely by surprise. Most people jump on it as being shockingly cruel. But I think I understand why Woody Allen did it. Cecelia is in love with the movies and their happy endings. But real life seldom turns out that way. Its a brave and refreshingly unambiguous approach. Kudos to Woody Allen for not caving in to the studios demand for a more uplifting ending.The Purple Rose of Cairo is undeserving of obscurity. It was way ahead of its time, and set the benchmark for equally brilliant films like Pleasantville, the underrated Last Action Hero, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Lose yourself in this remarkable tale. But remember the film's message. You can't stay lost.",

I have no such excuse, other than the trash on TV.To watch the actors jumping off and on the screen is hilarious, and Van Johnson was adorable!!!  Jeff Daniels did a great job-- acting as his onscreen alter ego, as well as a vain actor, leading the little small town girl along.  As the savvy woman onscreen says, \"Honey, go with the screen guy.  He may not be real, but he's perfect.\"You understand completely why Woody Allen fell for the young Mia Farrow, while she was still impressionable and had that virginal , idealistic quality.  He just couldn't stand real life with children (other than the one he married).  A schlmiel but a great film maker!!!  So, as is usual with Woody Allen movies, this is all about him!!!  He transfers his fascination with the wonderful world of movies to this little waitress, going nowhere fast.What happens to her?  Does she go back to the wife-beater?  We don't know, and the genius of Allen is that he makes us care.  You expect her to get beaten up every time she's alone with Aiello (which is a mark of excellent threatening, bully acting by this great actor).If you're going to do a Woody Allen private festival, be sure to align this one with \"Radio Days\"....giving insight into why HE became such a film buff.

            "content": "There's something appealing about those few Woody Allen films in which he doesn't act, as they give us a chance to catch a glimpse of his amazing talent from a different angle. The Purple Rose of Cairo is, if I'm not mistaken, the second time in his career he'd stayed behind the camera (the previous one was Interiors), and much like he would again in the 90's with Everyone Says I Love You and Sweet & Lowdown, Woody has taken the opportunity to examine film and entertainment from a different angle, and not use the kind of sly dialog and dry humor that usually character his starring roles.These films, of course, don't quite have the depth of his earlier, more personal works - namely and especially, Annie Hall and Manhattan. Nor is it as daringly original like 1983's underrated masterpiece Zelig. The Purple Rose of Cairo is closer to it's predecessor of the previous year, Broadway Danny Rose, and like that film it's, on most levels, entertainment as pure in form as Woody has ever made. Still, what both these movies have in abundances is charm and atmosphere, and in my opinion, Purple Rose is the better of the two. In Purple Rose Allen revisits his great love-hate relationship with Hollywood, and he creates a charming ode to Hollywood of the 30's while never neglecting to point out how naive and out of context it really was. Clearly, there's no room for a Manhattenite Woody Allen character in there - he gracefully gives center stage to his spouse and muse Mia Farrow, who gives one of her most powerful performances in an Allen film. She's supported by a lovely young Jeff Daniels and a fantastic Danny Aiello, who both highlight the huge gaps between Hollywood life, small town life and the movies during the Great Depression.The Purple Rose of Cairo is neither deep or particularly involving; the characters and relationships are, for the most part, stereotypical and symbolic and lack any real intense exploration. What Allen does succeed in creating in it, and wonderfully so, is atmosphere, an amazing atmosphere that manages to capture the viewers and transport them. And so, even if it's neither extremely important nor extremely funny, Purple Rose is grabbing and entertaining all the way through, and it manages to blend the comedy, romance and fantasy elements into a perfectly charming piece of cinema. Purple Rose is a pleasure, recommended for viewing with a loved one, in a darkened living room, on a big screen TV, with a big bowl of popcorn.",

Second, pretty much every character in this film is a caricature, leaving it with no originality whatsoever. But that's sort of a hallmark of the writer, isn't it? Mia Farrow is wasted in this movie, as are several other fine actors. Perhaps the only saving grace of this film is that the director decided not to act in it. The other point comes from enjoyable set, costume and production design. Don't watch this movie; you'll want the 84 minutes of your life back almost immediately.",

            "review_title": "Allen's Most Sociological Film",
            "content": "Woody Allen's film The Purple Rose of Cairo is a highly entertaining film that plays with its established reality in a way that is highly engaging.\nMia Farrow's portrayal of Celia is the actress at her best. She is vulnerable and engaging: a perfect heroine for this kind of story. Jeff Daniels balances the two roles he plays well, the contrast between the innocent and naive Tom Baxter and the multifaceted Gil Shepherd is interesting. The reality that Woody Allen plays with is surprisingly believable. The denizens of Hollywood react in a way that is realistic to their creations coming to life: they try to cover their tracks. Allen doesn't attempt to wrap his conclusion up either. The ending is appropriately ambiguous. It finishes with the line between fiction and reality clearly, upsettingly stated.All of these assets are not what makes The Purple Rose of Cairo such a triumph. What does is Allen's sociological analysis of the state of the United States during the Depression. His creation of the film within a film \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" is meticulously planned. He has created an alternate universe that is at a sharp contrast with the actual conditions of the United States during the thirties. All the characters in this fake film are incredibly affluent. They can afford glamorous globetrotting escapades. The Hollywood piece is completely unrepresentative of the hardships of the American people. It is pure escapism. Not many films have been made that are about the way that entertainment affected the Americans living during Great Depression, but (like Celia in the film) many people's only escape from the drudgery of their lives was through their entertainment. Woody Allen makes this statement in such an accessible and digestible film; he is opening up the eyes of the average movie patron to Allen's message relaying the power of film to change ordinary people's lives. Celia is influenced to take control of her own destiny after she is treated humanely by Tom. She realizes that she does not have to be in her negative relationship with the awful Monk. Although Allen makes this point in an extreme fashion by creating a fantastical situation for Celia to grow and interact in, the message he is emoting is very down to earth.The other extraordinary topic that Allen brings up in his film is the relationship between the artist and their creations. Gil Shepherd is not a bad person, just thrust into incredibly abnormal circumstances. His attempt to get his character that he created back into the film brings him closer to Celia in the process and a love triangle ensues. Metaphorically, Allen is simply relating a problem that many artists (including, probably himself) have faced. This is the problem of admires and potential suitors mistaking the artist for the character they have created. Often, Allen has been mistaken with the strong onscreen persona that has been created. His \"Little Schlemiel\" may be more appealing to women than Allen himself. This is also the problem that Gil Shepherd faces. Celia in one scene states \"I just met a man wonderful new man. He's fictional but you can't have everything.\" She clearly likes the fictional Tom better than the real Gil. Allen asks: \"Do all of Tom's best qualities actually stem from Gil's portrayal of him?\" It also makes us ask questions about what we actually admire in fictional characters: the way they are written, or the way they are played by the actors who breathe them life.The Purple Rose of Cairo is deceptive in its entertainment value. Beneath a highly engaging and funny plot are many interesting questions about a sociology of an era and the relationship between the artist and his art. It comes highly recommended for a fun, and thoughtful time.",

            "content": "I found this film a real rarity for Woody Allen. I felt it was poorly written. It attempted to make connections throughout about the real world and the world on the screen. Those attempts were evident, but those attempts were unsuccessful. Once I put aside the pure ridiculousness of Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) walking off the screen into the 1930's of the real world, the idea of the film seemed somewhat clever. There was no easy way to make it happen so once that was done, this film had it opportunities to be good. Jeff Daniels didn't help its cause as he continued to turn in, what is in my opinion, a terrible performance. It was essential for him to differentiate between his fictional character in Tom Baxter and his real life character, Gil Shepard, who plays Baxter. Daniels is not a good enough actor to pull this off, while at the same time delivering those subtle lines suggesting the differences and, more importantly, similarities of real life and movie life. Woody Allen is always capable of bringing his random and unique humor to his movies however; in this case, my laughs were few and far between. The bright parts of the film were the performances of Mia Farrow who played the shy, somewhat nervous and confused Cecelia who gets wrapped up in a love triangle with Gil and Tom while she is trying to better her life during the depression all while she is toughing her way through her marriage to Monk, played very well by Danny Aiello. Ultimately the film was a bit over the top and ridiculous and regardless of the performances, I'm not sure this script had much of a chance.",

It's just pure cringe from end to end with bad writing.I didn't laugh or even smile at a single thing in this movie. The writing is just terrible. All the real life characters treat the super exciting event as a minor inconvenience which makes the whole magical element fall completely flat. Terrible choice to just make an unfunny joke about it all. The characters could have reacted in funny ways, but instead they just sit around and complain about a character coming alive. The most boring scenario in such a movie.The worst thing is how painfully plain and boring it all is. It's just a bunch of talking scenes without any action to them. Even the movie she watches, where the character is from, only has talking scenes and nothing else. So once the character appears in her real world you just feel like he's yet another plain dude instead of being some exciting cool guy. A huge missed opportunity that's barely watchable.",

            "content": "In this film Allen discusses many issues concerning mainly art and artists. Firstly,the films plot is about a simple woman,Cecilia(Farrow,leading a rather miserable life,with no kids and a terrible husband,who beats her up,cheats her and spends his day gambling and drinking.Well,Cecilia loves going to the movies.One night she went to see a new movie called The Purple Rose Of Cairo.She loved this film so much that she saw it five times and actually one day she spent the whole morning on the cinema watching the film until one of the characters,Tom Baxter(Jeff Daniels)leaves the screen and runs away with her.Truffaut once said the film lovers are sick people(and in a way he was right),in TPROC Allen changes the word \"sick\" and instead of the says:film loves are problematic people;whatever that means. Cecilia was so obsessed with films,because that was her only way of escaping from her every-day problems and watching all the things she never or will ever live. Allen discusses the illusion of films that transform people into hopeless dreamers leading them to the misconception that everything is possible,while in life somethings just aren't. Also another issue of the film is how sometimes creations are far more beautiful than their creators.Tom(the creation)is perfect:sweet,poetic,sensitive,understanding,courageous,honest and a great kisser;whereas Gil(the creator)is selfish and egomaniac. This part is actually a reference to actors,especially those who play the good guys.Allen is saying that many people confuse an actor's real character with their roles' character,believing that actor's are they way they appear on screen,psychically and mentally.But that's far from reality.What makes TPROC so special is that it's not lying,it's honest,real and bittersweet,exactly what life is in the end.A MUST-SEE for movie lovers.10/10",

The plot is so silly yet works so well and played in just the right tone. Where fiction and reality blend which is basically where Woody is the strongest.

The Purple Rose of Cairo came to town and Cecilia (Mia Farrow), one of the habitu\u00e9s of the local cinema fall in love with it. Being terrible at her job and married to an asshole she watches the movie over and over until the moment where a character, Tom (Jeff Daniels), strangely notices shes always in the room and comes out of the screen to talk to her. They go out several times, and of course, the situation creates a huge mess between the corporation. If it weren't for the end the movie would be much more poor. Very good end. I liked Farrow's job as well. Very positive and loving. I won't say the same about the argument. This sort of creativity, in spite of its originality, it's too much implausible and strange. Not only the idea but the way it's faced on the movie. And that's not very usual with Woody Allen, that normally can introduce very well his ideas, that normally lack in plausibility. 6/10",

So I decided to take the challenge. Since I love fantasy type movies, this one led me down the proverbial primrose path. As the movie neared the end, I could visualize the many different endings that this fantasy could have. How wonderful to have this poor abused women live happily ever after. After all, we all know that all good fantasies have a happy endings, right??.Well, true to form for Woody Allen and his depressing attitude toward life, he couldn't leave this one alone either. The ending left me flat and disappointed. So many possibilities, only Woody Allen would choose this one. The ending takes a good 7 out of 10 movie and brings it down to 3 out of 10.....Turn it off before it ends and imagine a good ending.",

He made a movie in which makes the viewers think and look out for the deeper revelation of fantasy and reality. I, myself never pictured a real time movie goer fall in love with a make believe character. The funnier part of the movie is when we see the actor (Gil Shepard) and the character (Tom Baxter) both believe they are a significant person in the movie and not a minor character. The sad part of the movie is when one of the characters tell Cecilia to pick Tom, yet because Tom is a fantasy she goes with Gil who by the way broke her heart. =(",

The line between reality and fiction is broken in this film when a character in a movie, Jeff Daniels, breaks free of the screen to pursue a frequent movie-goer.  Naive and adventurous, Tom Baxter is determined to learn to \"be real\".  Mia Farrow's character Ceceilia seems to accept this all too easily and is wound up in a comical affair.  She welcomes the new adventure because her marriage to Danny Aiello's character Monk is leaving her bruised and bored.  Meanwhile the stranded cast members start to get frustrated.  The actor who plays Tom, Gil Sheppard, is called in to gain control of his creation.  But again, irony comes into play when Ceceilia falls for him in an accidental meeting.Mia Farrow is quite convincing as the dreamer, in the gray, monotonous New Jersey setting.  Jeff Daniels provides the comedy in his double role, and Danny Aiello is great as the abusive, out-of-work husband.  The Purple Rose of Cairo is entertaining but predictable, and is definately a Woody Allen film.",

However, my thought that Woody Allen's films are rather difficult for a viewer to grasp its concepts or motives remained intact. After seeing this movie, I couldn't really see why Woody would make such a film. Personally, I don't like movies that make you think too much at what the director is trying to say. I'd rather see a movie where the director's purpose is to simply entertain, not to philosophize or stir up thought in viewers.I respect that there are viewers out there who enjoy \"thinking\" movies. So here's my review for them. Woody wants the viewer to think about how movies or anything can take over a person and sometimes distort their perception of reality. Cecilia is a perfect example. She is a dreamer, who doesn't seem to want to wake up. She must choose to remain in her world and dream, or to wake up and face her reality. Which one do you think she'll choose?",

The beginning of the movie concentrated on the development of characters in 1940's New Jersey instead of introducing the comedy which lures me to his finest works. Within the first fifteen minutes I felt boredom kicking me in the back of the head.Dont expect a full-length comedy because this is among the few that Woody experimented with fantasy, romance, and comedy all in one. The brilliant transition from reality to fantasy is worth watching, especially if youre a real Woody fanatic. However, I have to disagree with those that state this is Woody's best picture. If I would change one thing about this masterpiece, it would be the overly-passive Cecilia. Her dependence and loyalty to Monk, who was marvelously played by Danny Aiello, became terribly annoying.Watching a movie that sparked so many careers is worth the effort. Especially the careers that probably landed Danny Aiello the role of Don Clericuzio in THE LAST DON, and the role Jeff Daniels played in the recent Clint Eastwood thriller BLOODWORK.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed watching the `Purple Rose of Cairo,' because it was uncomplicated in camerawork and layout, but the message which writer/director Woody Allen was trying to convey was indeed complicated. Just to disparage any doubts - the location chosen for this film was excellent, and the technique used to show a film within a film, was in my opinion, superb. The bickering and camaraderie between the actors left stranded on the movie screen is a visual and mental delight. Mia Farrow and Jeff Daniels are a charming couple. The development of Cecilia's character was anything but simple - we see her progress as a woman who takes on the fantasy of Hollywood as her personal reality, then with possibility of true love, she returns to the real world for a brief moment. When a tragic event occurs, she goes back to the movies as a form of escapism.The plot may be ridiculous in that Tom Baxter actually leaves the screen and comes to life for a love of Cecilia, but it provides a venue for the director to argue on certain weighty topics: What happens to a creation out of the hands of it's creator? Do true love and happiness really exist? Where does the line between fantasy and reality fade?Not only does Woody Allen criticize the typical `Hollywood movie ending,' but he goes on to make sure that his own production does not end in such a way. It is for this reason that I believe that the `Purple Rose of Cairo' has been so underrated. Not only is it thoughtful and moving, but it is also highly disturbing. The average American viewer cannot handle this type of serious realism in movies.funny.kinda sounds like Cecilia.",
