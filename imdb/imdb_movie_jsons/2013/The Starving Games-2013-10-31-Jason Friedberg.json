If you like this type of ridiculous, non-intelligent, dirty comedy, good. If not, why do you bother?I had a good few laughs with this movie, and it entertained me more than other films that apparently are great (see pacific rim). This movie is not pretentious nor tries to amuse you with new, all fantastic jokes. It doesn't need much budget and it's something I appreciate. It's also better than other predecessors such as Disaster Movie or Epic Movie (those were actually quite bad). As I said before: if you like the Scary Movie saga and related spoof movies, go for it.Now, 10 is probably a bit overrated, but I can't stand the 3 or so score that this movie shows at the moment, while other trash is in the 7s range.I expect a lot of clicks on the NO button regarding if this review was useful to you. Please, be my guest, I wouldn't have it any other way. The day I am loved by the masses will be the day that I start rating movies like twilight with a score of over 5.",

            "content": "It is not as if spoof comedies are terrible, on the contrary there are some brilliant ones out there like ones from Mel Brooks(Young Frankenstein) and Leslie Nielson(Airplane), even Scary Movie and Loaded Weapon 1 were fun if not quite in the same league. Like a lot of people, I do think Friedberg and Seltzer are hacks and not one of their previous five directing-writing efforts with Disaster Movie, Epic Movie,(two of the worst movies ever made), Meet the Spartans, Date Movie and Vampires Suck have been good. Curiosity and that there are some good examples of good spoofs out there were the sole motivations of seeing The Starving Games in the first place. This said after viewing, The Starving Games really is no improvements over the previous Friedberg/Seltzer collaborations though it doesn't quite stink as badly as Disaster Movie and Epic Movie. There are three fairly small bright spots, Maiara Walsh's game performance and the cute Angry Birds reference and Taylor Swift serenading a dying contestant moment(though that only raised a very meek smile). Visually, it's amateurish stuff, the impersonation costumes are also pretty good but that's it, the production values have low-budget TV quality all over it coupled with (thankfully sparse) poorly rendered effects, too many reaction shots(manipulating us into supposing to laugh) and some really choppy editing. The soundtrack feels thrown in and poorly placed, just there for the sake of it which makes it tiresome and sometimes tedious, that it isn't very catchy in the first place doesn't help either. The toilet-humour-heavy dialogue is vomit-inducingly crude, childish and unfunny is the best it gets which is testament to how truly terrible it is. The parodies themselves are no better, like Vampires Suck there is a main gag and other ones that are not as prominent. The parodies and impersonations are just tired, painfully predictable and often irrelevant, reeking of Friedberg and Seltzer just throwing like the most unsubtle of sledgehammers things in with no relevance or structure to them. And the jokes are drawn out especially the lottery draw one and the tasteless sex scene to the point of slowing the movie down. There was at least a story, unfortunately it comes across as a very thin one and is completely lost within the humour, which explains why some scenes were drawn out. The characters are just caricatures and nothing more, and despite Walsh's efforts you feel no shred of empathy for the lead character. The acting is awful, ranging from over-the-top(Diedrich Bader) to vacant. All in all, incredibly lame but is not Friedberg and Seltzer's worst. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "A few weeks ago, upon discovering known and universally panned parody filmmakers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer were making a parody of the popular franchise The Hunger Games, I sent out a message on Twitter I thought would be seen as encouraging to some. It read, \"Encouragement to young filmmakers: whatever you're writing now is infinitely better than the new parody film The Starving Games. Soon after sending the tweet, I received a reply from the film's official Twitter reading, \"Great! We're working on The Starving Games 2!\" The fact that the PR/marketing campaign for the picture needs to reply in a smarmy way to negative feedback online about their film shows about as much maturity on their part as the film at hand. Unsurprisingly, The Starving Games is another miserable endeavor of a parody movie, directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the same men who have brought you Date Movie, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, among other installments of the dead parody genre. That's right, I'm referring to the genre as dead now. Consider my reviews of A Haunted House and Movie 43 (which I'll throw in the same genre since it revolves around many self-referential skits and lampoons A-list actors) the genre's funeral service and this one a visit to its gravesite. What has happened to a genre so promising and so filled with life? The simple answer is it has been reduced to what appears to be a cinematic competition between writers to incorporate as many pop culture and movie references in one film as possible. In the first few minutes of The Starving Games, we are annihilated as viewers by the abundance of references thrown at us, as if it's a commercial break on Television in mid-December and we're trying to decide on what toy to buy our children. The Friedberg and Seltzer formula is to have no continuity, no logic, and no wit in their story. Just clobber together every successful film character, pop culture icon, current celebrity, etc into roughly eighty minutes and string it along with a loose plot and hope someone laughs (or enough sales come through to cash a large check).As inferred by the title, the film is one long parody of the popular book/film franchise The Hunger Games, with the protagonist of Katniss Evergreen now under the name \"Kantmiss Evershot,\" an inept archer who now must fight for her life in the game where her and another opponent must kill one another in The 75th Annual Starving Games. The winner receives an old ham, a coupon for a foot-long sub sandwich, and a partially eaten pickle. The person who sits through this film in its redundant, eighty minute glory gets nothing but a shorter amount of time left in their day.With all the disgustingly unfunny references, I'm glad this film was shot, edited, and completed before Miley Cyrus and the \"twerking\" phenomenon became mainstream. If I had to witness something of that caliber in a film that already breathlessly tries to include the \"Gangnam Style\" musician Psy, the whole Avengers squad, Harry Potter and his friends (who are told to get out of the film because their franchise has ended), and the cast of action movie legends from The Expendables, I would've probably given up.The reason why I resist discrediting or shattering the likely large egos of directors Friedberg and Seltzer is because, well, why bother? They have found a formula that pays big money and have capitalized off of the lowest common denominator of wit and intelligence there is in the cinematic world. I am anticipating reviews of The Starving Games that consist of death threats, comments about the devolution of humor because of the directors' films, and remarks of their worthlessness because of their filmography. Reviews of their films have become as predictable as the films they make, so why bother attacking them? All I can say is be grateful this one is confined to a video-on-demand released and a very limited theatrical release, as opposed to their other films which garnered wide releases. Let's hope their window of release just becomes smaller and smaller over time.The Starving Games and films like it don't make me angry anymore. They just make me sad. It makes me upset to see films like these gain an audience of young teens who are already experiencing shorter attention spans thanks to Television and the internet. I'd let my twelve year old child watch the original Halloween before a film by Friedberg and Seltzer. Or, better yet, the original Airplane! or The Naked Gun series, both starring the gifted comedy actor Leslie Nelson. Those films worked because they spoofed their own genres and didn't try to incorporate every current celebrity and movie figure that has rose to prominence since their last film. There is no reason anyone should see The Starving Games, but, oh, people will.Run and tweet that.Starring: Maiara Walsh, Brant Daugherty, and Cody Christian. Directed by: Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.",

What's too bad in terms of the humor used in The Starving Games is the amount of low-brow fart/elimination/kick-to-the-nuts stuff that seems to show up in lowest-common-denominator humor. Yes, it's a bunch of sight gags, but many are fun and well-done. The leads are pretty/handsome and very well matched to the characters in the Hunger Games.

            "content": "I'm a sucker for spoof movies. And although I am of the opinion that Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg are a pair of talentless hacks, I keep buying their movies on DVD, in the faint hope that one of these days they will produce something half-decent. I decided to give them a fair shot this time around and actually sought out the real thing - \"The Hunger Games\" before I stuck Friedberg & Seltzer's offering into my DVD player, so at least I would have some idea of what they are trying to spoof.The result is fairly typical Friedberg & Seltzer fare - grab a bunch of unknown actors who bare a passing similarity to the more talented originals, throw in a bunch of gratuitous pop culture references that are way too late ('Harry Potter', 'Gangnam Style', 'The Expendables', 'Avatar' etc.) and try to tell your story in under 80 minutes, including 20 minutes of bloopers and credits. In that respect, \"The Starving Games\" doesn't disappoint and nothing in this movie will come as a surprise to those of you who have seen other works by Friedberg & Seltzer.This is their sixth collaboration as directors (sadly, there are more in the pipeline - next up is a spoof of Fast & Furious) but alas, they are not really getting much better at this sort of thing. The only decent movie they were ever involved with was back in 2000 as two of the six writers on 'Scary Movie'. Based on their career track since then, it is clear that it was the other four writers who actually had the talent.That this film hasn't been picked up by a proper distributor and has basically gone straight-to-video says it all. I'd love to know where Friedberg & Seltzer get the money to keep financing this stuff. It's probably all my fault, as I keep buying all their DVD's! If we all stopped watching, maybe they'd go away and get a real job. The thing is though, I can't help myself. I *knew* this film would be pants. I just had to see it for myself just to see how bad it really was. I'm desperately trying to think of something positive to say about this movie. How about - \"It's not the worst of the six films they've made?\" A final word to Maiara Walsh - you're better than this.",

For a spoof movie, I was expecting at least a couple of laughs, but the director must have been about 2 years old because the whole thing just seemed immature and silly. The only thing that a found a little amusing was the Pink bearded Mr. T lookalike, but that was about it. Some parts go really over the top, and make you wonder if they actually watched the movie before they brought it out, which was why it went straight to DVD. You won't be seeing most of the actors again, so there isn't much to comment about there performances. At the end of the day, it's just another spoof movie. Disappointing!Round-Up: As there dint that much out on DVD, I thought that I would give this movie a go, but I knew what to expect. I didn't really pay that much attention to the film after a whole because I just couldn't find anything funny. There are a few references to some other movies like The Avengers and The Expendables, but the director didn't do that much with the material. If you want loads of laughs then this is definitely not the movie for you, but if you want to play \"Name That Film\" then you should give it a go. A total waste of time and budget.Budget: $4.5million Worldwide Gross: N/AI recommend this movie to people who are into there spoof movies, but don't expect much from this a Hunger Games make over. 2/10",

            "content": "Yet another 'modern spoof' by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, 'The Starving Games' has as its main focus of parody the 'Hunger Games' film. Alongside it, multiple references/spoofs of other hit films like 'The Avengers' or 'Expendables', or popular culture in general.Friedberg and Seltzer have for very long tried to copy the parody style of David Zucker, with varying degrees of success: 'Scary Movie' was very good (though I believe that was more due to the other screenwriters involved, like the Wayans' brothers), as was 'Wrongfully Accused' to a lesser degree (though that was more due to Nielsen than their writing), but the rest of their works tend to range from regular to terrible; in fact, their more aimless, messy spoofs ('Epic Movie', 'Disaster Movie') are amongst the worst films I've ever seen.'Starving Games' falls in the second category, with some genuinely funny moments (like the aforementioned 'Avengers' and 'Expendables' spoofs) but with a lot of bad ones (including, for example, the rather tasteless sex scene). Friedberg/Seltzer try so much to cram as many 'hip' references as possible, that by the end the final product is an unfunny, idiotic-looking mess. The fact no actor here managed to give a good comedic vibe, which could save some scenes (something Leslie Nielsen was very good at), makes this worse than it could have been; the actors don't even seem to try at all, and no one has any charisma (especially the main actress).Unfortunately, while this is a slightly better attempt, It doesn't give me hope for their future career. The fact their comedies seem to keep having a degree of audience success means they will keep with this formula. Guess I will just have to learn to stop bothering with their films.",

I just sucks all the tension right out of you.The books are about a very serious subject and the films are trying to do them justice. The first film was slightly off target and too much about production values and less about the story than it could have been. But \"Catching Fire\" was more in tone with the books.So if you approach \"The Starving Games\" with the serious attitude the books (and films) would like you to take, then that's what makes great satire.

The cross media \"Angry Birds\" and \"Fruit Attack\" turned reality app attacks were a total-hilarious surprise. There is the basic slapstick improbabilities (breadstick arrow); the brief crudeness (a streaker). But, most poignant, in a \"Daily Show\" way of exposure, is Starving's behavior burlesques of the whole \"Hunger\" milieu - the hunt & kill sequences, the cameras, the basic scientifically impossible dome with it's computer controlled environment.

This is undoubtedly down there, burning in the hellish fires of Hollywood's underworld with 'Movie 43' and their own ironically titled 'Disaster Movie'. Solely spoofing 'The Hunger Games', this parody was instantly exhausted of ideas right from the very first second. Kantmiss Evershot? Was that supposed to be funny? No, seriously. Did I miss something whilst I gleefully bleached my eyes?This time around, the directors seemingly gave up trying to be hilarious and instead insisted on presenting as many advertisements as possible. Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Starbucks, Subway, Apple, McDonalds, Nike and a plethora of other brands. Atleast their previous parodies actually attempted to mock films (it's a back-handed compliment...) and not feed into corporate monopolisation. Then there's the outdated pop culture icons that were ham-fisted into this grotesque rectum of a film. The Annoying Orange, PSY and LMFAO to name a few. Playing on nostalgia isn't funny. It's death-worthy. The Starving Games wasn't in first gear to begin with. Heck, it wasn't even in neutral. It was reversing! The film was laughing at me for watching it in the first place!Peter is a device for an elongated homosexual joke, an unhealthy obsession that the directors have had in all their features. Sexual crudeness was included to, yet again, satisfy all those lonesome virgins \"fapping\" to their TV whenever Kantmiss repeatedly forces a teen to \"motorboat\" her. Looping scenes by masquerading them as highlights, from shoving a foot up someone's poop chute to a guy battered by a cannonball and exclaiming \"my balls!\" in slow-motion, functioning as a minor lethargic effort to ensue laughter. Then, the real kicker, the final five minutes of the runtime comprised of a blooper reel! As if the film itself actually wasn't funny, they thought the outtakes would surely inject some hilarity! Yeah, no. Tears were certainly visible. Tears of regret. Technically speaking, there are no positives. Acting? Terrible. Visual effects? Borderline obnoxious. Directing? Wait, there's direction? Costumes and makeup? Cosplayers.To sum up this travesty in one sentence: The Starving Games is a bunch of blindingly white-teethed attractive models running around in their overgrown back garden, attempting to parody 'The Hunger Games', but instead obliterated their careers before they had even manifested.

I'd seen Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's other spoof films such as Vampires Suck and Meet the Spartans and I had hated both of them so I wasn't expecting anything different here. I don't know how they manage to do it, but their films seem to be getting worse when you'd think it would be an impossible achievement to go any lower. At least some of their prior films have a funny joke during the opening sequence, but this film falls flat for its entire runtime. There is no creativity whatsoever here and the jokes are all recycled. The spoof genre seems to have been dead for quite some time now and there is simply nothing entertaining about it. I can't think of the last time I actually enjoyed one, but having recently seen Dr. Strangelove my heart really sinks to how low we've fallen.

Up until this scene, i was planning of loaning the DVD to my brothers and sisters who love the Hunger game films. I cannot do this now. This is not a film to watch with family because of that scene. Which is sad, Because for the most part, this is a cleverly written parody with some great gags. It surpasses the last few Scary Movies and Haunted House film which all got cinema releases and is the best of the straight to video releases ever made. However many of the jokes are topical and based on cultural references which means it wont work for too long. In five years time for example, most the references will be outdated and subsequently the film will not be as funny. Scenes involving the Expendables, Avengers and pop stars will age quickly. I recognised a joke parodying the Sherlock Holmes films which not many others will get or understand. I applaud them for not telegraphing the reference and trusting their audience with knowing what it was parodying. But it is a gag that will be less understood the further we move away from its reference material release date.There is a minor reference to a gay relationship but it doesn't last long or dwell on it. A couple of deaths were rather gruesomely visual which may be a problem to some viewers. But my main issue was the sex scene as previously mentioned. It doesn't outstay its welcome at 80 minutes but still feels long enough to be happy with. I will happily watch it again and the writers did a great job in a genre often tarnished with toilet humour. Other than the one scene, it had very little of that in it, and featured mainly higher quality jokes. I strongly recommend watching this film, especially if you like the Hunger Game films, or parodies in general. But it earns the 12 rating it got for a reason so know this going in. I hope the writers continue making films like this, and preferably original parody moves (not based on cultural references) also.",

It would be unfair to set the standards that high though. So if you liked the Scary Movies (even the latter ones that lost a bit of their appeal), you will like this too.

It could be the most confusing mystery in the modern history!While The Starving Games (2013) is a parody of a weak movie named The Hunger Games (2012), it's weaker than it. Rather, it hit the bottom of \"weakness\", whether as a comedy, or as a movie!Saying that it has laughs is like saying that there are birds in space. There is no fun to be seen. It's like a horror of weird stuff, shown successively, with the least talents. Actually there is something creepy about poor movie that enjoys mixing blood, farts, bad jocks, terrible bore, and cinematic primitiveness!There is clear laziness and dullness in everything. Look how the heroine runs haphazardly into The Expendables, The Avengers, and The Lord of The Ring's leads. It's a pathetic way to mock at these movies, especially when the result is always dry micro-sketches that have no smart line, no stars as cameos, and no criticism for any ironic fault in these very movies!At one moment, the heroine's colleague has a deep wound in his back, which the movie oddly focuses on its sticky repulsive sight, and at another no less repulsive moment, the heroine spits heavy blood. Then, the movie loves the 2 moments to the extent of showing them AGAIN in the blooper reel. Let alone that there is more than one scene for human and animalistic excretion. Well, in my book, when a movie succeeds in making you nauseated; then it's not a comedy at all!And while it pocks fun of an action, how come that it's more violent than it?! Seriously, the original movie doesn't have half of this parody's violence where many killings, by arrows or spears, are shown shockingly and bluntly. You can argue that this is a black comedy. But according to the movie's lQ; it's color blind!It even ends abruptly, like it's a sudden death!But still one matter that kills me. Why repeating the shots?? I mean, the catatonic mother, the sequence of beating the competitors by different weapons, the copious unchangeable cadres of President Snowballs, his assistants, and the stage's wealthy viewers while they're watching the games.. Why to repeat all of this FOR ALL THE TIME??!! It's an agony before being another source of stupidity!Trying to be objective here, and find any positive points to talk about, needs superpower, but I'll try: Maiara Walsh and Diedrich Bader have charisma, and delivered something close to good performance. The first scene of President Snowballs, with the goofy introduction and speech, was the only time where I smelled \"effort\". Bringing up matters like the degeneration of some reality TV shows, and begging sequels by simply adding a lesbian love story in other shows, was into the point satire. Else that, and with all the superpowers in the world, you won't find an extra iota of positiveness in this!The Starving Games is ugly and sanguinary comedy that has no comedy in the first place. So how come that Friedberg & Seltzer are paid money for making comedies with nothing funny like that, while - notice well - others have to pay for watching that itself?!!As for my title's question, the answer is: \"It's my fate\". And as for the rest of my questions concerning Friedberg & Seltzer.. I have no answer whatsoever!",

So, when someone told me there was a movie whose purpose was to make fun of it, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. After witnessing the first six minutes of The Starving Games, I quickly realized that I was in hell. The movie starts terribly and progressively gets worse from there. I must also admit that I avidly watch terrible films just to see how bad they are. Therefore my initial reaction was to finish the film to see how crappy it was as a whole. Try as I did, I could only make it through 45 minutes of this excruciatingly unfunny steel cage grudge match before tapping out.With jokes consisting of a girl pooping, or said girl using a fire extinguisher to. . . wait for it. . .put out a fire, I feel that I could find more humor in self immolation. A good comedy must be a product of clever writing. The Starving Games, however, is written with all the finesse of a bull trampling a typewriter into manure laden mud. It would not surprise me to find out that this writing duo had never actually read a book. They obviously do not understand the definition of the terms spoof or satire. As a substitute for spoof we get things like a kid dressed as Harry Potter. It seriously only works on that one level. . .\"hey that kid was dressed like Harry Potter.\"The ultimate decision to turn this movie off is that I found myself hating it for the same reasons that I hate The Hunger Games. It is a poorly crafted cinematic mistake, ripe with uninteresting poorly acted characters, who plod through substance so heavily \"borrowed\", that in most civilized countries it is considered plagiarism. And don't forget boring. . . oh so boring and predictable.Though unintentional, The Hunger Games proves to be the better comedy of the two. That at least coaxed up some hard guttural laughter, at times accompanied by leg slapping and shortness of breath. With The Starving Games, I found myself staring blankly at the screen until I came to the realization that I was in hell, there is no god, and Seltzer/Freidbergowitzgoldstien is the devil.*Spoiler Alert* This movie has been proved to cause cancer in laboratory mice.",

            "content": "'THE STARVING GAMES': Two Stars (Out of Five) Another movie spoof from the writing/directing team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Friedberg and Seltzer also helmed such loathed film parodies as 'DATE MOVIE', 'EPIC MOVIE', 'DISASTER MOVIE', 'MEET THE SPARTANS' and 'VAMPIRES SUCK'. They also co-wrote 'SPY HARD' and the first 'SCARY MOVIE'. This time they chose to poke fun at the immensely popular youth book adaptation film 'THE HUNGER GAMES'. I think it's their best movie yet but that's of course not saying much at all.The directing duo chose actress Maiara Walsh to do her best job imitating Jennifer Lawrence in the film. She's no Jennifer Lawrence and she doesn't really look or act like her at all but she does an OK job in the role all the same. Walsh plays Kantmiss Evershot and Cody Christian and Brant Daugherty co-star with her as Peter Malarkey and Dale. Diedrich Bader also co-stars in the movie as it's main villain President Snowballs. The film takes place in a post apocalyptic future (much like that of 'THE HUNGER GAMES') in which the 'Starving Games' are in their 75th year. Kantmiss volunteers in the 'games' to save her sister and has to compete to the death with other teenagers (like Malarkey) in hopes of being the sole survivor. She also could win a coupon for a Subway sub, a half-eaten pickle and an old ham.Unlike other blockbuster satires from Friedberg and Seltzer this one mainly just parodies it's main source material ('THE HUNGER GAMES') and doesn't detour from that plot line. It briefly makes fun of other popular movies (like 'THE AVENGERS', 'THE EXPENDABLES 2' and 'HARRY POTTER') but those jokes take up just minutes of the movie (or less). To be fair I've only seen 'DATE MOVIE', 'VAMPIRES SUCK' and the original 'SCARY MOVIE' (out of the other films on the filmmakers' resumes) but I did think this one was the funniest of those four. Perhaps just because I like the movie it's making fun of the best. It's a bad satirical comedy flick that's mostly unfunny but it's not painfully unfunny like those other films.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSU_hwOQSWQ",

Or a more specified question; Why on Earth are people still paying money to see these poor excuses of entertainment?! Anyways, let's talk about the movie.By now, you have probably understood that 'The Starving Games' is a parody of 'The Hunger Games'. We follow the female protagonist Kantmiss Evershot (f*cking genius) from the poor district 12 in a dystopian future where the evil president Snowballs reigns from the wealthy Capitol. From the beginning we're introduced to her attractive friend Dale (whose performance definitely deserves an academy award), as he pops up unexpectedly in front of Kantmiss aiming at a bird made in paint with her crossbow, making her blind fire her arrow out in the wild and hitting the wizard of Oz in a balloon. The element of comedy is ingenious.Well, I can't really explain every bad joke in this movie, that would basically make me re-create the entire script. I didn't laugh one single time. Is seriously toilet-humor still fun? Probably for Friedberg and Seltzer's brilliantly intelligent minds. There are some absurd scenes where Gandalf the Grey and Gimli pops up from nowhere attempting to molest Kantmiss and Peter Malarkey (Gay version of Peeta actually). Towards the long-awaited end Nick Fury and the Avengers steps on some land mines, blowing up, made me cheer as I knew those horrendous parodies were over. If you thought Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans and Scary Movie were beyond hilarious, you'll probably die laughing at this horrendous excuse for a film. Can't wait for their \"Superfast\"-movie, where Friedberg and Seltzer spoof Fast and the Furious, will probably be a runner up for the academy awards in 2015.",

It's an extremely overrated and frankly stupid waste of time to pay attention to, set up for the sheep to follow, so sooner or later a parody was bound to pop up. The Starving Games is one such parody, and don't get me wrong, it started out as hilarious, making fun of every bad part of the Hunger Games series (which was 99% of it). There was some swearing at first but nothing too crude, and I was laughing a hell of a lot throughout the first few minutes.Soon though, the sex jokes and fart jokes came up, and I'm not a prude but I hate crude humor. It's disgusting, vulgar, degrading and only appeals to the idiots in society, the people who find those \"fail videos\" on youtube with fat people falling over to be funny. As the movie went on the fart jokes just kept getting more and more frequent and a bunch of pervy sex jokes followed. A majority of the movie was spent with scenes such as cheerleaders dancing around wearing plastic funnels in their shirts, the two main parody characters having sex behind a picture of the president's face (only to have Gandalf and Hagrid from Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter show up like perverts), people getting kicked in the crotch and a girl hallucinating about being a character from Avatar (another popular movie) and having sex. It just wasn't funny. I hate The Hunger Games but all those nasty jokes was going WAY too far.That being said, I liked how it made fun of a few other overrated trendy movies and internet videos in the background (someone should have done that a long time ago) and this parody had potential.

I wasn't really paying a lot of attention to it but I eventually had to ask him to watch the rest of it at home.I'll be the first to admit that parody films are not my forte. I don't like gross out humor and I find a lot of them to be completely immature. But I'd seen The Hunger Games so I figured I could just glance over every once in a while if a joke was funny. I like the 5 minute parody videos on youtube (you know, How It Should Have Ended and such) so I figured it would be like that.I was wrong.Some of the jokes were nonsensical. And by that I mean I was trying to figure out what the joke was and why it was supposed to be funny. Jokes that make me wonder if the writers just threw in random inside jokes without explaining them are not jokes at all. They're just random events the movie treats like jokes.Some of the jokes were needlessly gross. I will never understand how anyone finds this kind of humor funny but I thought surely professional writers would know how to actually write something that could be funny to someone other than themselves in their addled state of mind. I was wrong. The ridiculous sound effects made it all the more difficult to tune out by the time I knew this wasn't going to be funny. Even the jokes that did have punchlines that pertained to the actual movie it was parodying were so predictable, I literally said \"called it\" at one of them after it was said.No one in this movie looks like they care at all about what they're doing. This is such an obvious attempt to cash in on a popular franchise, it's shameful. I get that movie studios are businesses and they need to make money to keep afloat but at what cost? Nothing about this movie showed any effort whatsoever. I would have thought, for a movie parodying The Hunger Games, that they would have at least made fun of the dim lighting of that movie instead of just making everything brightly colored. Was this so you could see every disgusting physical joke more clearly? It doesn't come off as a parody if you can't even make fun of things that actually lend themselves to humor.I hate movies like this. 4.5 million dollars and there was no talent or effort in this movie. I'd seen the actress who played the Katniss mockery in other things so I know she can act. I felt a bit sorry for her that she actually thought this would be anything but embarrassing. As someone who would love nothing more than to be a screenwriter, it's an insult to people who put real thought into their writing when these kinds of movies get made. There's Hunger Games fanfiction better than this. And anyone can write fanfiction.I know what you're thinking, how dare you judge this movie when you didn't even finish it. But have you ever watched a movie that started out badly and finished as a masterpiece? Because I haven't. And if there was clearly no effort in the beginning, there's no way there was suddenly effort at the end.I really hope Hollywood learns from movies like this and the genre dies out. In the meantime, I'm hoping this review dissuades anyone with a sense of humor and any class whatsoever from watching this terrible, terrible movie. Or even listening to someone else watching it.",

So when it appeared on Netflix I decided to give it a watch. As you have probably already guessed, it was terrible. The movie is completely reliant on its humor. Considering its a parody I think that it's quite clear that this movie isn't going for a good plot or characters, so I'll just talk about the humor.The beginning of the movie is pretty funny at points, and that's about it. Everything else is absolute garbage. The funny parts at the beginning were dark and unexpected at times, and I assumed that that would be how the rest of the movie was. Considering the Hunger Games is about people killing each other, you'd almost just assume that it'd all be dark humor. But that's not the case. After that everything is either random crap that only children would find funny or pop culture references, and it's quite clear that this movie isn't for children. The pop culture references aren't funny though. It feels like the movie just throws in it and says \"Haha get it, it's funny because we mentioned Nikki Minaj. Haha get it? Get it?\" Something isn't funny just because it's there. Sometimes things just being there are funny, but only if done right (yes, there is a specific way to make things funny by just existing), but that's all this movie is. It's funny because you know what it's referencing. That's like saying that The Pianist is funny because it's about the Holocaust and you know what the Holocaust is and it's well-known. No, that's not funny, right? That's basically what this movie does. Now while it doesn't say the Holocaust is funny (because I think that everyone knows that it isn't), that's what its getting at. 'It's funny because its famous' is all the movie is. It's hard to explain because there's really nothing amusing about it, nor is there any reason why it would be funny. So why would anyone think that this movie is funny? I have absolutely no idea. Now while I look back at some of the random jokes and think they were funny, watching them is anything but. They're better remembered then watched. Although I try not to think about this movie as best I can, because it's better not remembered. I almost felt bad about laughing at anything by the end or else I'd lower myself as a person, so even if anything actually humorous happened in the end it was lost. Overall The Starving Games is about as funny as a steaming pile of poop. It's funny at first to a handful of people, but after that it's just a giant turd and now you have to clean it up and forget about it because otherwise your weekend will be ruined. It's funny for maybe ten minutes at the beginning, but after that it's 'funny' because famous. And that's it. It doesn't make sense (even the sentence structure doesn't, yet there's no other way to explain it), and yet it still passes as entertainment. In the end there is not a chance I would ever recommend this movie. If I were you I'd wipe any research of this movie from your internet history and just try to forget about it. Even if you're interested, don't. If you're extremely interest, don't. The only time anyone should watch this movie is if it's a matter of life and death, and even then it'd have to take a lot of convincing to make anyone watch it.",

This joke is really funny but we get very few of these laughs throughout the movie. Its basically Kat- I mean Kantmiss Evershot trying to survive The Starving Games with Peeta or whatever.This movie's plot is rushed and it should have been longer because they should have more time to parody The Capital instead of The Main Arena. The movie is also very low budget. The effects look very cheap even for the gross out scenes. Characters are not very likable ranging to stock characters from the used section that include cowards, tough guys, jealous guys, tough girls and more stock characters.I think Friedberg and Seltzer have no clue what to do with the parodies or comedy scenes so they just decide to put in some audience reactions, deaths, gross out scenes and more. Its not really much of a parody then a depressing attempt to make The Hunger Games more funny.

This is further proof that the duo of Seltzer and Friedburg are pretty much THE worst that Hollywood has to offer right now.

Just stop with the boom boom and the Viagra jokes. It would work if they took some of those outtakes and pasted them in the movie. It would then be far more funnier.",

M 7+ Not quite an 8 because ever since \"Scary Movie\" (Only the first one and maybe the third.) his form requires absolute surprise. Also, from the old \"Police Squad\" days comes a plethora of knock-offs that try hard but just don't make it. The parodies of Narnia related movies come to mind. But as can be seen in the number of parody failures, it's a difficult art form. Maybe more difficult that outright comedy. But his movie hits on several levels and while being no Mel Brooks or Faralley Brothers or Coen Brothers production, some of the lines are well written. Unfortunately they are poorly acted. Others just miss but a few hit. The throwaway line is a great comedic vehicle but timing is of the essence. In \"The Starving Games\" the timing is just a little off with some of the gags. Some were spot on but others fell flat because of terrible comedic timing. Otherwise, an enjoyable movie with just the right amount of quotes from other movies but with a twist. The gay references were so obvious that they just didn't work. The whole Intro to the games scene where the lead male falls for his male counterpart was so obvious that it really wasn't funny at all. Either was the reference to Cantmiss' misunderstood \"hit\" on the young girl. It just didn't work. Maybe we've become so used to gays as a fact of life that the whole \"gay\" thing has little surprise left. One expects something referring to same sex relationships and thus the whole \"gay\" thing has the same impact as a SURPRISE heterosexual relationship. The explanation of the attire was great. Lady Gaga mixed with Mikki Menage (?). One could see it and it was a nice touch. Those places show that the duo can write. Lots of mugging from all and I don't care if I never see a blue haired man bent over backward in laughter. All that mugging was bad direction and did not help sell the good lines in the film. And there are some good lines and funny verbal plays. Bringing in Stallone, Schwartznegger, and ail the other \"action\" stars like a super A-team was a good surprise. I think a better ending would be if they all behaved as if they were in the games and killed each other instead of the boyfriend shooting them all as he bursts onto the set. A good twist was bringing in the Avengers to recruit Cantmiss as a member. Some funny stuff there. Obviously the directors also thought some of the comedic timing was amiss because they included in the film a series of outtakes about the games. Most of it was not that funny. I hope the two director/writers get another shot and learn from the few mistakes made here.",

It sets out to spoof the popular 'Hunger Games' movies and it does it very well. Also it was filmed mostly in the Hammond, Louisiana area which pleases this Louisiana native! The actress playing the Katniss role is cute and capable Maiara Walsh as Kantmiss Evershot. Archer ... every shot ... can't miss. I think it is a very clever character name. Anyway the opening scene sets the tone for the rest. In a very serious start Kantmiss is tracking wildlife and sees a chicken on a tree branch. She pulls back and as she is about to release the arrow a friend of hers jumps up and surprises her, the arrow goes way off its mark, towards a man in a balloon gondola, hits him in the chest and he falls dead to the ground.So the rest of the movie is similar in that scenes start rather seriously but quickly go into absurdity. For those of us who don't take the 'Hunger Games' movies too seriously this is a fun diversion, just to see the clever parodies. Of course there are butt jokes, boob jokes, crotch jokes, and excrement jokes but all done in fairly good taste as evident with the PG-13 rating.The movie runs less than 90 minutes and even the closing credits have a few outtakes in it.

But, this one is just... awh, i don't know how to describe it. OK, \"The Starving Games\" as the title suggests, is a parody on the hunger games saga and follows the same plot of the first one. However, it does nothing actually funny with it source material, and it could. All the jokes are so dumb, old and pointless i really doubt the writers thought they were funny. The first \"joke\" of this movie is Kantmiss, the main character, hunting in the wood, when her boyfriend pops up from nowhere making her accidentally shoot an arrow at a balloon with a \"the great and powerful Oz\" character at it. HOW? How is it supposed to be funny? Do the writers really think just showing a familiar face is funny? And that's my problem with Friedberg and Seltzer, they don't even try. All of them spoofs just show some famous character or celebrity being hit by something or popping out of nowhere like that's funny. Here's an example in this movie we see LMFAO and the avengers exploding, in another scene Psy is shot by an arrow, Taylor Swift appears and starts singing, an Avatar parody in the middle of the film, with no good reason, A man uses Siri for throwing \"angry birds\" and fruits at a character and she cuts the fruits in a \"fruit ninja\" way.

It is my personal opinion that the Hunger Games are in fact a bad series of movies with only three saving graces. One, it had great acting. No question about that. The stars did a terrific job. Two, the casting was great and I don't think anyone can really argue that as being wrong. Finally, third, the movie was way better than the terribly written and poorly thought out book.

            "content": "Let's just get it out of the way... Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are not good filmmakers. In fact, they are bad filmmakers. Dreadful, even. Responsible for some of the worst comedies of the past ten years. Heck, even arguably responsible for at least one of the worst comedies ever made with their shockingly terrible \"Disaster Movie.\"But that being said... (And I can't believe I'm saying this)... their latest film, \"The Starving Games\"... isn't terrible. In fact, I would even go so far as to say it's \"not TOO bad.\" Oh, it's still bad. But it's nowhere near the level of infuriatingly awful that many of their other films reach. In fact (And I REALLY can't believe I'm saying this)... I actually laughed at a few jokes in this film, which is a first. Out of their other directorial efforts, I've only gotten maybe one or two chuckles. Never a full laugh. This one... it gave me about two laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of good chuckles.Bravo Friedberg/Seltzer. Bravo.Essentially a send-up to the uber-popular \"Hunger Games\" franchise, \"The Starving Games\" is a parody (in the loosest sense), following Kantmiss Evershot (Maiara Walsh), a young woman who is forced to take part in the annual \"Starving Games\" death tournament. Along the way, she encounters wacky circumstances, contrived pop-culture references and bad jokes galore.In all actuality, this film really isn't too much different from other Friedberg/Seltzer duds. It follows the same formula (a central storyline that generally is modeled after one or two popular movies, peppered with random pop culture references and caricatures of recent popular characters from film and TV), and it definitely does have their stamp with some awful jokes and nonsensical references. But somehow, it just doesn't feel as painful this time. It is mainly due to an extremely likable performance from lead star Walsh, who is not only cute-as-a-button, but has a great sense of comedic timing, and seems very open to do whatever it takes to try and make a joke work, no matter how silly (or even exploited) she has to become. She pretty much saves the film from being another intolerable mess. In addition, as I said above, there are a few jokes that do actually work here. Heck, I'd even argue that they managed to actually work in one of their random pop-culture references in a way that was actually funny for the first time in any of their films. (A reference involving Kantmiss being asked to join \"The Avengers\", which despite coming out of nowhere, worked because it felt like one of the post-credits scenes from the Marvel movies, where characters randomly show up to talk about \"The Avengers.\")But that faint praise being said, don't think I'm necessarily recommending this movie. Because I'm not. A likable lead and a few decent jokes can't save what is otherwise a pretty big mess-of-a-film. As in Seltzer/Friendberg's other work, the characters and plotting are far too shallow, the direction is cheap and lacks creativity, the production values are sub-par, and the reliance on random references is far more grating than amusing.It just isn't QUITE as bad this time around.I give \"The Starving Games\" a sub-par 4 out of 10. I'd say if you can catch it for free on Netflix or cable, that you could do far worse, and might wanna give it a shot. But it's not worth spending money on to rent or buy.",

Diedrich Bader, who I never could stand watching on the Drew Carey Show due to his general lameness, plays an amusing President Snowball, a parody of The Hunger Games' President Snow. He doesn't bother trying to imitate Donald Sutherland and as a result comes off kinda funny.There's a slow, odd, and unfunny sex scene with LOTR characters thrown in that really didn't fit and I fast forwarded through most of it.These kind of parodies require one quick gag after another in order to keep us watching and for this most part this one succeeds.

In this case there was LOTR, \"The Expendables,\" \"The Avengers,\" \"Avatar,\" \"Sherlock Holmes,\" Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, Honey Boo Boo, Tim Tebow, Siri, Skittles, Subway, and more.One of the big failings with this parody and others is the copious use of CGI. It's made an already bad product worse. And maybe I shouldn't say that the CGI has made them worse, it's more like the discount brand of CGI they use has made them worse. I get it, they don't expect good returns on these movies anyway so they have to keep costs to a minimum.

If you want a bumbling waste of time to leave a smile on your face, and kind of clear your head of any serious thoughts, but want to keep clear of some of the worst of the spoof series, this rates near the original Scary Movie I, II, levels of humor in my opinion.

Unfortunately, the good jokes were far and few in-between. It shows that they did have some good sense in humor although the rest of it was just pure garbage. They missed the mark completely in making this movie. This should have been an easy and simple satire to pull off. Instead, we got this mess.",

I picked this one off the list at Netflix and thought, why not? Terrible jokes, poor acting and a sh!tty script are reasons why not. This is not a parody as parodies contain some wit; this did not. It was the same lame jokes that you'd see in F and S's other alleged parodies. It makes me wonder if fart jokes are pre-printed in the beat sheets when they start story development.The acting was a step above a cold read (if that much). The jokes are heavily forced on you. And most are rehashed from every other F and S movie.",

Liam Hemsworth, who played Gayle in the original Hunger Games was suppose to be in the Expendables, but was written out last minute. Dayle kills the Expendables. And he was going to be cast as Thor, but lost the role to his brother. Also, Nick Fury recruiting Kantmiss was eluding to Jennifer Lawrence's appearance in the X-Men pre-boot since the Avengers die after Kantmiss agrees.I'm not a celebrity geek, but I'm sure there are similar tie-ins for other parts of the film.",

All of the rest of the jokes fall flat though and I wouldnt recommend sitting through the whole movie for that one joke. Avoid.",

It has its funny moments and it does manage to decimate the original hunger games movie in a really funny way. If you really like the spoof genre, you might wanna take a look at this. Hardcore Hunger games fans may wanna kill the produces for making this movie. On the whole, this movie does what it is supposed to do - take a movie and take it apart piece by piece as much as you can and put it back in together after destroying each piece (I mean it in a funny kind of way). Anyways, I guess if you keep idealistic expectation from this movie, you won't be much disappointed.",

And now, after having watched the aforementioned film (if one can even call it that), I probably never will again.This so-called \"comedy\" now has the dubious distinction of being the only movie from said genre to fail at evoking so much as even a chuckle from me. This isn't so much a film, as it is a collection of gross-out gags, terrible special effects, and dated pop culture references.If you're looking for a decent comedic plot, look elsewhere, because the plot of \"The Starving Games\" is basically non-existent. The only way the \"plot\" of this \"film\" will make any sort of sense is based on the viewer's prior knowledge of \"The Hunger Games\". The direction of the film is downright horrendous and it is a wonder that Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg continue to make these atrocities. The dialogue is absolutely terrible and some of the cringe-inducing jokes are repeated ad nauseam. Never before has a movie had me cringing the entire time I watched it. However, if I had the ability to give this movie a zero out of ten, I wouldn't. The reason for that is because of Maiara Walsh, who plays our heroine Kantmiss Evershot. Despite being stuck in one of the worst \"films\" ever made, she has the potential to break free from this side of Hollywood and even showcases a bit of talent, if only for brief flashes.Filled with pathetic attempts at humor, a nonsensical plot, terrible writing and directing, and mostly wooden acting, \"The Starving Games\" is the worst \"film\" I have ever seen. Never before has a comedy film failed to make me laugh. Do yourself a favor and watch anything else out there. It's bound to be better than this abomination (unless it's made by these guys.)1/10",
