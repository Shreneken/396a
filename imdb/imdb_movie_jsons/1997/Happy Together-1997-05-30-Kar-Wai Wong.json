            "content": "Just when you thought that you knew everything about Hong Kong cinema or about romantic adventures in film, director Kar Wai Wong steps forward and eliminates all boundaries. Transforming your typical picture of a straight couple and violently handing us the relationship of Yiu-fai and Po-wing using untraditional cinematography is only scratching the surface of this picture. If you found yourself shocked by the opening sequence or annoyed by the drastic image of the film, then you definitely are not a film junkie. This movie had everything a cinephile would desire like strong characters, a non-linear story, and the brazen truth about modern society's relationships. This was more than just a gay film, but instead a story about emotions and loves, coupled with all the turmoil that surrounds it. It is ironic that the title of the film is Happy Together, because it completely challenges the true themes. It is about love, but about the difficulties that surround a dying relationship. From the visual opening to the amazing use of several different cinematography techniques, Happy Together may not suit everyone, but to this film junkie it opened a new door in Hong Kong cinema.This film would not have worked if it weren't for the apparent brilliance of director Kar Wai Wong. While I have been impressed with his other films like In the Mood for Love and his work on the BMW series, The Hire, this film literally blew me out of the water. To begin, the opening sequence. If this very sexual opening doesn't set the tone for the rest of the film, I don't know what will. I was shocked, disturbed, and on-edge the entire time. I didn't see the love between our two characters at all in the beginning, but that was because it was to show the destruction of their relationship. Then, Wong did several things that just impressed me and kept my attention focused on the film. First, he took these two vacationing men from Hong Kong and set them in a foreign city. So, not only was it uneasy to watch this relationship disintegrate in front of our eyes, but to be lost in a unfamiliar city only made it worse. Second, he focused the camera on only one of the characters (Yiu-fai) to enhance that sensation about Po-wing's indiscretions. Through Yiu-fai we felt the human emotions just boil through of having to see a love that only hurt. Finally, he continually changed the cinematography through different scenes. This was impressive because it only added more tension to our characters and themes. Two travelers lost in a foreign country, trying to patch a dying relationship, with a constantly changing cinematic style, was tough to watch \u0085 but that was the theme that Wong wanted to capture. This is not your typical romantic picture, but instead it showcases the truth about two men that perhaps were not the greatest fit. Even when he throws in the waterfall element, it only adds to the overall theme. The waterfall, to me, represented the falling relationship. Beauty on the outside, a violent tendency as the water falls \u0085 just like our relationship.Wong successfully created this tension by hiring some of Hong Kong's best actors. They carried themselves with the greatest of comfort and control. I felt as if I knew these characters by the end of the film. I felt as if I had gone through a similar struggle as they did. These two men challenged the idea of \"normal\" relationships, yet kept their personas simple, human, and intense. You could not help but feel emotion for these two, even if you did not like the story. They kept the tones light when they needed to be, then brought you deep within the rabbit hole when the darkness erupted. The final scenes of this film are fascinating to watch, and I had to see them again. The downfall of Yiu-fai into a role similar to Po-wing was heartbreaking, yet stunning. Here we have two men who I thought were complete opposites from the beginning, yet somehow, to quote Wong, \"Turns out that lonely people are all the same.\" Finally, I cannot finish without saying that the cinematography was outstanding in this film. The use of black and white in the beginning and slowly bringing in the colors was breathtaking. This film was more than just actors working for a director, but instead a director creating art. Christopher Doyle bulls-eyed the tone of the film and brought forth an intense picture that only complimented Wong's work. It just impresses me to see a film, like Happy Together, where all the elements come together and work in unison. It is a rarity in today's Hollywood, but thankfully we have directors like Kar Wai Wong whom embrace it. From the beginning of the movie until the final scenes, Doyle challenges an brings together some of the most beautiful scenes in cinema, transforming the normal into the extraordinary.Overall, this was a spectacular film. After I watched it the first time, I had to see it again, but didn't know if I could. Its emotional strength was so overwhelming that I had to stop myself. I couldn't watch these two brilliant actors tear my heart apart again. It was a sad film, it was an angry film, but most importantly it was a film about being lost in love. Those who may have enjoyed Lost in Translation, this would be a great film to match with it. While not structured the same, it does give us that feeling of being apart in a new world, struggling to get home or to discover one's self. Wong is one of the greatest directors in the world, and I cannot wait to open my soul to his work again. Brilliant film-making, determined and unmatched acting, coupled with the best cinematography this world has ever encountered! A must for everyone! Grade: **** out of *****",

            "review_title": "Raw, Imperfect, Intense",
            "content": "\"Happy Together\" is a depressing film. Yet it's one which I keep coming back to when I feel down and heartbroken.Lost souls, lonely, longing, and lovelorn, are staples in the Wong Kar-Wai universe. His best works uncannily portray the beauty and misery of being struck by love and its multiple variations and illusions. His fluid, script-free, improvisational style of work is now legendary and applies well to the unpredictable nature of this subject matter while giving his works a raw, open-ended quality. \"Happy Together\" is quite probably his rawest work to date and, as a result, one of the most difficult to watch (this honor goes to \"Ashes of Time\"). The rawness makes it seem organic. It feels as if it's an ever-evolving creature which hides and exposes its multiple facets with each different viewing.Argentina sounds like a great romantic escape for most of us but for our couple, Po-wing (Leslie Cheung) and Yiu-fai (Tony Leung), it's a lonely, bleak, melancholic place on the edge of the world. Travelogue film this isn't. Buenos Aires may have initially held romantic promise for them. \"Let's start over,\" Po-wing asks Yiu-fai yet again, and off they go to South America to work things out. Soon, however, the place becomes a physical representation of their relationship. It's claustrophobic and oppressive, something that could've been so beautiful yet one which they now need to escape from. Wong beautifully portrays spectacular Iguazu Falls with mythical significance throughout the film. Initially nothing more than amusing kitsch, it eventually progresses as the defining geographical manifestation of their amorous aspirations. It achieves such heavy, symbolic power, the last time we see it is one of the most memorable scenes in the film.If the homosexual angle seems downplayed here, it is to parallel the film's treatment. It's so matter-of-fact it's irrelevant and even embarrassing to make an issue out of it. This is a couple who just happens to be gay. Indeed, there is nothing gay-specific about the film, the couple may well have been straight and it wouldn't make a difference at all.\"Happy Together\" is such a vivid examination of a relationship, it's occasionally painful to watch. The emotional authenticity, however, makes it quite absorbing. Wong Kar-Wai often aims for the heart and, with the possible exception of \"In the Mood for Love\", he's never been closer to his target.",

Argentina, which is the antithesis of HK, may be the farthest place you can get from HK, but still they cannot entangle themselves from the emotional baggage they have been carrying. Loneliness is a state of mind which follows you no matter where you are, and ensnarls you when you are at your most vulnerable.While the story may be more famous as a film about gay relationship, it is in fact, not so. The lead characters just happen to be gay, and loneliness, with all the jealousy and melancholy that comes with it, takes centrestage.",

            "review_title": "Sculpting in time; Wong's hypnotic rumination on love and dislocation",
            "content": "Something of an obvious precursor to the subsequent masterpiece In the Mood for Love (2000); Happy Together (1997) is a tragic love story by way of recollection. If you're at all familiar with the work of director Wong Kar-Wai - from his breakthrough film Days of Being Wild (1991), to his more recent masterwork, the unsung 2046 (2004) - then you'll be accustomed to his personal approach to cinema; from that continually drifting sense of quiet melancholy and disconnected ennui - all captured by a roving camera that conspires to alienate characters from one another by intrusive shot composition and naturalist production design - and a beguiling approach to the concept of time continually abstracted in order to create drama from moments of fond reminisce. Once again, the feeling expressed in Happy Together is that of loneliness and despair, as characters drift spectre-like through desolate cities attempting to cling to moments and memories as if gasping for their final breath; and all the while distorted by a frequently hypnotic approach to music, structure, pace and cinematography.If the film lacks the sophistication of the aforementioned In the Mood for Love, it is only because the process of refinement has replaced the edginess and earthiness of this film, with a studied, technical grandeur and ornate beauty that is really quite transcendent. Nonetheless, the style and tone of Happy Together fits the mood of the film perfectly; capturing the feckless uncertainly of the character's lives - both together and apart - and concurrently suggesting the idea of memory and repetition that plays an important role in the way the narrative ultimately plays out. The first viewing might very well be confusing, with scenes occurring that seem to simultaneously represent both the past and the present, and with information presented in a series of incredibly quick cuts, disconnected voice-over and a continually jarring cross-cutting back and forth between lurid colour and an oddly tinted monochrome, which seems to work on an emotional level, as opposed to any kind of narrative convention.That said, the grittiness of the film suggests an uncompromising and starkly unconventional beauty in keeping with the film's central relationship; with the violent and volatile shifts in stock capturing the same unpredictable impulses and urges of the central characters as they fight, break-up, reconcile and drift apart against a rolling backdrop of exotic and atmospheric locations. The use of Buenos Aires as the central setting adds texture to the film, and the vibrant way in which the director captures the strange, mysterious and nocturnal atmosphere of the city is evocative to say the least. Here, the rhythm of the film becomes tuned to that of the Argentine tango that swirls through the bar where the characters rediscover one another; with the staccato rhythms of the movement underscored by the sad reflections of the accordion music and the stampeding percussion of feet against floors, combined with continual hints of tortured romanticism - touching without feeling, sensing without sensuality, etc - that are so central to these characters and the odd situation they find themselves in.The location also ties in with the filmmaker's fondness for the work of author Manuel Puig; whose style of writing has some influence on the tone and languid energy of the film in question, with Wong and his crew - and in particular cinematographer Christopher Doyle - expressing certain unspoken facets of this relationship through framing, movement, colour and rhythm. The fact that the film focuses on a homosexual relationship is ultimately secondary. As is often the case with Wong Kar-Wai, the film is about that urge and desire to belong to something - or someone - and the pursuit of an unrequited love that is powerful enough to drive you to the end of the world. We see these themes repeated again and again, from the inter-linked meta-romance of Days of Being Wild, In the Mood for Love and 2046, to the brilliance of Chungking Express (1994). Through the jarring nature of the relationship between the reckless and subtly abusive Ho Po-Wing and the more sensitive and brooding Lai Yiu-fai, Wong is able to express a series of thoughts and ruminations of the notions of love in a way that is intelligent, but always easy to identify with, regardless of gender or sexuality.Later in the film, the director expresses slightly more profound feelings through the friendship of Lai Yiu-fai and the young runaway Chang. Here, we see a mutual respect and unspoken love that goes beyond sex and sexuality; creating a pure statement on the notion of love and the desire to belong to someone or something, within a certain time or place. A love so great that the person would be willing to carry your own sadness to the end of the world, to lessen the burdens of life and open the door to a new beginning free of difficulties and strife. There are deeper themes expressed throughout - too many to go into in this review - nonetheless, the film is understated and brimming with emotion; in keeping with the director's more iconic or well-regarded films, such as the ones aforementioned, and continuing a number of important themes and motifs that are both thought-provoking and affecting. The film also benefits from the fine performances of the three lead actors, stunning locations, cinematography, great atmosphere, mood and spirit; and an overall approach to cinema that is poetic, to say the least.",

Technically it's amazing - the hand-held camera-work is incredible, and the mindbending shifts from saturated colors to monochrome (which I first felt was a stylish stunt) really underscores the loneliness and alienation of the characters brilliantly - the overall effect by the films' end is devastating.HAPPY TOGETHER was apparently also - at least partially - inspired by the Argentine novelist Manuel Puig, author of 'Kiss Of The Spider Woman' among many other novels, and Puig's fiction tackles similar issues in a similarly fractured style (filled with footnotes, digressions and sudden shifts in perspective), all to incredibly powerful emotional effect. If HAPPY TOGETHER is something of an homage to Puig, it's a great one. On it's own it's also a devastating portrait of a disintegrating relationship.",

            "review_title": "A film about alienation - inside and outside",
            "content": "In \"Happy Together\" Director Wong Kar Wai tells us the story of a relationship that does not survive the alienation inside and outside. The film is set in Argentina where two lovers are stranded because they don't have enough money to return to their native Hong Kong.The film shows us that Fai and Po-wing are unable to find equality or balance in their relationship. It is a story about the way most relationships are defined by the balance of power.. and how this leads to despair. Fai reflects that their relationship was the happiest when Po-wing was ill and had to be cared for like a child. As Po Wing's health improves Fai draws away from him and refuses his attempts of closeness, illustrated by the constant battles over couch and bed. When Po-Wing is well enough to go out again by himself the balance of the power in relationship shifts. Po-wing slowly but surely slips away into the world of hustling. He never finds his way back to Fai who eventually saves enough money to go home. Both are emotionally devastated by the loss of their lover. We only see them being happy together in a glimpse, as they dance a slow dance together in their room. It seems the happiness in their relationship that Fai refers to in connection with Po-Wing's illness, is an isolated kind of happiness that he himself enjoys without Po-wing's knowledge. If they are ever indeed Happy Together we see it only in facial expressions, in their tone of voice but these are expressions of love and tenderness that never seem to reach the surface that remain unspoken. Wong Kar Wai's visual style is absolutely stunning. He conveys the alienation inside the relationship - and the alienation outside - (I am referring to the fact that they are in a different country) through colors and camera-movements. We are constantly looking at the protagonists from a corner high above or through the window of a seedy bar. Every single shot feels claustrophobic and it irritates the viewer. It makes the viewer long for closeness and clarity. It imitates the longing of the characters and their attempts - and failure - at connecting to each other. Their feelings, as does the eye of the lens, float above them in a silent, detached loneliness. \"Happy Together\" is one of those films that I do not really enjoy watching. It is actually physically painful to watch because it hurts the eye as much as it hurts the soul. The film makes its style and subject matter into one flesh, a \"happy\" marriage of form and content.9/10",

            "review_title": "A Highly Stylized Emotional Roller Coaster",
            "content": "Happy Together is a throbbing, raw, and profoundly nostalgic lament from two displaced traveling Chinamen yearning for emotional soundness, for their homeland, and for each other. Wong doesn't front us any of the flickering that can still be struck between lovers who fight all the time. There is no deep poetic interpretation of the story itself, but by leaving so much unsaid, writer-director Wong Kar-Wai doesn't make the misstep of suffocating his characters' relationship with trite soap dialogue. That is not to say, however, that the film even remotely knows the meaning of the phrase \"less is more.\"You don't watch this film as much as seize on to it. Letting it yank you every which way is a raucous yet intriguing excursion, with fertile visual stylizations that trail you long after seeing the film, all with the impact to communicate directly with the heart. The visuals make the film come alive, and make material the displacement, and thus the unhinging, that the main characters feel from their surroundings and each other. Rather than using dialogue, this highly stylized romance chiefly imparts its themes and moods through its images, and Wong fashions an interior audiovisual composition about the mood swings of a love affair. Wong's use of images for purely emotional photogenic value, feverish camera movements, jukebox soundtrack and his improvisation and experimentation with the actors have an effect reminiscent of Scorsese's Mean Streets. In Wong's emotional roller coaster of a film, the characters seem to have a formidable intuitive certainty that their relationship is star- crossed sooner or later, but they follow passionate impulses regardless, giving the film a dreamy texture that it can't shake as its lovers turn-step to and fro during their free-form Argentine spree.Wong gradually layers the relationship, just like it would happen in real life, and the doubts and obscurities are constant. He extracts powerful performances from his lead actors. While Leslie Cheung gracefully fluctuates his moments between yearning, resentment, and anger, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is the calm eye of the storm.Leung acts from the inside. We intuit his feelings through his natural physical subtleties, chiefly through the sensitive eyes. Even purely physical scenes, like the fights he has with Leslie Cheung's character, don't happen suddenly. Leung winds up for these moments instinctively and then defensively underplays them. And when the tears come, they pour without affectation, making me wonder from what part of Leung's soul he quietly unearths these moments from as Wong rolls the camera.",

            "review_title": "Why Did you buy so many cigarettes?",
            "content": "When it comes to the cinematic world of Wong Kar Wai I am still a novice. I watched his film Chungking Express for the first time almost three years ago and have watched it with various friends since then three or four times, but for his other films, In the Mood for Love, Days of Being Wild and even 2046 I have yet to watch them. However, after viewing Tony Leung Chiu Wai's excellent performance in Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung's Cyclo, I wanted to see more of this actor's work. Also, of course, I was familiar with the actor Leslie Cheung and his suicide, but as for his acting I had only viewed Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine. So having coming across Happy Together at my local DVD shop, I figured that I would give it a chance, and, as I felt after watching the films of many other directors that I kept on the backburner, I had to ask myself, Why did I wait so long to watch this film? Happy Together tells the story of Lai Yiu Fai and Ho Po Wing's on again and off again relationship. Much more serious and steadier than his lover, Lai Yiu Fai loves Ho Po Wing dearly, and even though the other man cheats on him, Lai Yiu Fai always takes Ho Po Wing back when the latter says \"Let's start over.\" Hoping to rekindle their relationship, Fai and Po Wing travel to Argentina, however, while looking for waterfall called Iguazu, the couple becomes lost and Po Wing breaks off their relationship. Being completely broke, both Yiu Fai and Po Wing stay in Buenos Aires with the former working at a tango bar as a doorman and the latter earning his way through his way through his rich beneficiaries. Knowing that Yiu Fai still has feelings for him, Po Wing often flaunts himself with his multitudes of lovers and even calls Yiu Fai a couple of times to engage in more intimate activities, however, Yiu Fai, with the aid of strong alcohol, tries to keep himself from becoming ensnared by Po Wing once again. Yet when Po Wing comes to Yiu Fai one day with his face and hands bloodied, Yiu Fai finds himself once again in Po Wing's grasp.One of the things that I like the most about Happy Together is that while the lead couple is homosexual little is made of this. This is not a film that is trying one way or another to make an issue of gay relationships, all it is trying to do is display a relationship between two individuals and how it comes apart. Tony Leung does an extraordinary job of portraying someone who loves deeply and whose displays of affection are displayed quietly. Moments such as when Yiu Fai checks on Po Wing while he is sleeping are truly touching and the scene in which he \"talks\" into his friend Chang's tape recorder is nearly heartbreaking. Combine these elements with an awesome soundtrack and some truly gorgeous cinematography by Christopher Doyle make Happy Together a truly wonderful film.",

            "content": "\"Happy Together \" is essentially a study of a couple falling in and out of love. Their sex - they are a gay couple from Hong Kong - hardly matters: the film could just as well have been about a straight or lesbian couple. The fact that very near the beginning there is as explicit a scene of male anal intercourse as one is likely to encounter in mainstream commercial cinema is far from gratuitously sensational. As the film is meant to start on a passionate high, this is the most convincing way of doing it - so be it. The director has the integrity not to repeat this for the reason that the couple never quite feel the same about each other again - indeed there is a great deal of alienation. Both have arrived in Argentina in search of work. Although the jobs undertaken by one of the pair, Lai, are fairly menial, first as a doorman at a Tango club and then a kitchen worker, he seems more stable than his companion, Ho, who does little but hustle, gets beaten up fairly early on and spends much of his time in an incapacitated state. In the room they share there is a lampshade depicting the Izuazi Falls. The cascade almost becomes a symbol for the relationship they would ideally like to achieve. Early on they hire a car to look for it but lose their way. After their relationship has finally broken Lai finds it, but as he is alone, the landmark seems sadly lacking in excitement. There is a third main character, a straight guy from Taiwan, who works in the kitchen with Lai. With his amiable self-sufficiency he seems to have been introduced to provide a balance to the angst of the main pair, a device that works well as it reinforces our sympathy for them. \"Happy Together\" looks rough and crude. A hand held camera is used with frenetic nervousness. Sequences of monochrome alternate with scenes that are almost perversely over-coloured. I know it is fashionable to give some films a nightmarish look. Here I found it a distinct stumbling block to be got over for the sake of a work that says so much about loneliness, homesickness and the struggle of people simply to be \"happy together\".",

In \"Midnight Cowboy\" redemption of homoeroticism comes through death, a strategy that was quite revealing of the morals that prevailed at the time the movie was produced. \"Happy Together\", on the other hand, deals with romance as if it could have been homo-, hetero- or whatever, and even though homoeroticism is such an essential element to the narrative, the protagonists'love affair is a pretext for the emergence of their decentered identities, their search for love and friendship and, most important, it ends on a note of hope of future encounters.

            "content": "Viewing this film was like watching the Tango! Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung were absolutely mesmerizing as lovers who exist in a state of conflict, constantly estranged from their homeland, their loved-ones and each other. The ending was heartrending (no surprise), but I found the interaction between the couple to be pure comedy. The situations that each character found himself in were anything but funny, however, the ups and downs in their relationship were so realistic that I couldn't help but laugh at how insane love can be.Regardless of race, class, gender, culture, sexual orientation and even geography, this movie will serve as a love letter to anyone who has the misfortune of being truly, madly and deeply in love with the one person on earth who drives them nuts. Those of us fitting this description will find many confirmations (but no comfort) in Yiu-Fai and Po-Wing's story. I could totally relate to Yiu-Fai when he stated that Po-Wing's illness was actually the time when they were the happiest together. Moreover, the story paints a vivid portrait of long-term relationships as swaying perilously between states of codependence, complacency and claustrophobia.If I had to decide on a letter grade, though, I would have to give the movie an \"A-\" instead of an \"A\" because I was hoping that Leslie Cheung would not be confined to the typical doomed drama-queen role. Ironically, the story explores individual, national and global identity when, throughout the cinema world, one is hard pressed to find performers who rival Tony Leung's depth and Leslie Cheung's range. Despite his hallmark androgyny, I personally believe that Cheung could play Rambo convincingly! The universal nature of the story was also threatened by its stereotypical depictions of gay life (violent relationships and promiscuity). I think the film's core message could have been conveyed just as effectively without the use of hackneyed scenarios. Fortunately, the amazing soundtrack and the breathtaking cinematography more than made up for any flaws.",

            "content": "Lai Yiu-fai and his lover Ho Po-wing decide to get away from Hong Kong and head to Argentina. Even as they make the trip their relationship is continuing to fall apart and it is not long before Yiu-fai is on his own and working to get money for his trip back home. But when a beaten up Po-wing turns up at his flat, Yiu-fai takes pity on him and lets him stay, even though it is clear that Po-wing wants to just pick up the relationship like nothing ever changed.To date \"In the Mood For Love\" has been my favourite Kar Wai-Wong film because it featured his usual clever direction without taking away from the film, great acting and a story that had great emotional involvement. So I was looking forward to his newest film (2046) and also took the opportunity to look back at some of his earlier films; tonight it was the turn of this film. Opening with the relationship already in decline, it is hard to really get into the two main characters early on and, for this and other reasons, I found them to be a bit distant and, while I could understand what they (Yui-fai in particular) were feeling I couldn't really connect with them on any real level. The story is therefore interesting but not as impacting as it ever should be. The script doesn't help this too much and generally I felt it was all a bit lacking in the substance that I could see it was trying to have.The direction is, as usual, a mixed bag. On one hand it is award winning and loaded with nice shots and touches that have earned him the reputation he has for being an interesting director. I'm not sure if it is me though, but I can't get as gushing as other reviewers seem to about his films mainly because I find that too often he gets in the way of the film rather than topping it off. Here is not the worst example of this failing but at times the film is more about the direction and framing of scenes than it is about the material \u0096 certainly large sections of the film are more interesting in regards Wai-Wong than the characters. Despite not knowing what he was committing himself to, Leung does a good job with all of his material and seems to have a real understanding of his character \u0096 almost covering for the fact that the film doesn't help us that much. The late Cheung is good but he is secondary to Leung and his character is difficult to really get into. Chang is good in a smaller role but for me the film belonged to Leung \u0096 an actor who is almost always worth watching.Overall this film is a good example of Wai-Wong's strengths and his weaknesses. His direction is impressive and the film looks great throughout but at the same time it feels like this was the focus rather than the actual story and characters being really well developed. Worth seeing for what it does well but many viewers will feel a bit cold thanks to the lack of emotional involvement and strong character development.",

            "content": "After seeing the recent DVD release of \"2046\", I was curious to take in an earlier film by wunderkind Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai. This visually arresting though rather discombobulated film from 1997 is more modest in scope, as it focuses on the unhealthily co-dependent relationship between two on-again, off-again gay lovers from Hong Kong, who end up broke on a last-chance trip to Argentina. In a volatile yin-yang situation, Ho Po-Wing is the cockier and apparently needier of the two, always in search of the next rush of instant gratification regardless of the source, while Lai Yiu-Fai is the controlling partner either unblinkingly morose or explosively volatile. In terms of where the story starts, their relationship has become nothing but a series of arguments and break-ups.With no flashback to point to a happier time or a hint of a positive indication as to why they are together, Wong comes up short in inflaming any sparks that could still be struck between lovers who argue constantly. Moreover, the film really has little structure other than to show the difficulties which people have in sustaining a connection. A third person is introduced but in an intentionally vague manner, as Lai gets a new job at a restaurant and meets the effusive Chang, a young Taiwanese trying to earn enough to fund his travels abroad. A romance does not occur but an emotional connection does, which causes Lai to make moves toward liberating himself from his depraved situation.Except for a somewhat graphic opening scene, the homosexual elements are downplayed in favor of a kinetic energy that leverages Christopher Doyle's creative cinematography. Doyle combines black-and-white sequences with color, as well as the random use of different film stocks, exposures and frame rates to manipulate the passage of time. He also lends stunning overview shots of Iguazu Falls, the movie's metaphorical centerpiece, lending a dream-like, salvation quality to the couple's hoped-for destination. Both the attractive leads lend visceral energy and an emotional authenticity to their roles - Wong's favorite leading man, Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Lai and the late Leslie Cheung as Ho. The passionate, often violent dynamics between the two are convincing. Chen Chang effectively infuses Chang with an idealism that makes Lai's attraction, platonic or not, understandable.Although I think Wong is a supremely talented director, I was surprised to find out that this film earned him the Best Director prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, flawed as the film is. Although it is as visually audacious as \"2046\", I have to admit I was left a bit cold emotionally by the end product. The DVD does include an invaluable looking-back documentary called \"Buenos Aires - Zero Degree\". An hour in length and for once, a truly indispensable supplement, it shows the movie's evolution through rehearsals, script development and cast interviews, including deleted scenes of abandoned subplots and characters.",

I recall very clearly not quite understanding why I kind of liked it ,and couldn't justify it to my friend who I'd seen it with and who didn't like it. 10 years later a friend gave me bag of old DVD's he was getting rid of and this was one of those, so I watched it again one rainy afternoon. What a difference a second viewing made. I recently saw it again on the big screen and my affections and appreciation for this film continues to grow as the film continues to reveal itself and I understand it more. Unlike many, I do not see this film as a love story between to men but rather view the central relationship as just one of the films many elements the director uses to show the individual and solo aspect of life that each of us faces. Family relationships, romantic love, professional relationships, random people that come and go in our lives, and through differing cultures, are all used to illustrate this central theme. The acting is wonderful, the characters unique and interesting and the cinematography and score all combine to create a beautiful and powerful, and haunting experience. Happy Together is not an easily accessible film and for the viewers who saw this film and liked it or disliked it, I encourage a second viewing. Happy Together really is a wonderful and moving film well worth the time and challenge.",

These are works of a visionary mystic. The first two are especially brilliant. `Angels' moves faster than our mind can adjust to the world, shifting among narrators and narrative modes; `Mood' is at the other extreme, minimal, repetitive, moving deeply under our ability to follow a narrative thus provoking an altered state. Both take huge risks in opposite directions. Both are highly intellectual in how they refer to themselves and their making within the story. `Happy' is placed in between the two in terms of risk, no barrage but no meditation. And along the way, no self-reference except the brief smell of sobs on a tape played at a lighthouse at the end of the world. Its a great image, but not integrated into the Jarmusch-like flow of drifting lives.

            "content": "The first and only instance of actual sex in Happy Together is at the beginning. While many will use black and white to depict a nostalgic longing for a memory, here the harsh physicality of their lovemaking actually becomes so damaging in retrospect. Their bodies are intertwined tightly on the ragged bed - the foolish idea that getting away together might mend their relationship finds them stuck in Argentina, although they have their own ways of earning enough to return to Hong Kong. And then slowly, after a violent row, the colour starts to leak back into the frame, and the inevitability of the vicious cycle beckons them once more. Twice, the overhead shot of Buenos Aires shows the night-life in time lapse; a flurry of light and movement and time passing. But it seems to be almost the same thing over and over. And for Ho and Lai, this rings true; they cannot help be drawn into each other, they cannot help that a dance turns into a kiss turns into something else, they are struck by a curse to repeatedly run back to one another. And then they sabotage, and makeup; Lai turns furious and yells at Ho's suggestion that he cooks for him even though he is sick, and then we suddenly cut to him at the stove (happiest times of his life indeed). Ho vehemently defends himself against accusations of snooping, then we flashback to the act itself. And again, and again. Doyle's cinematography adds so much to the film. Look at Chang's introduction, where the camera sways in time with his movements as he shuts his eyes and daydreams and everything in the background is blurred out in shallow focus. He colour codes strongly so that key objects leap out from the yellow tint that saturates the room they share; a red blanket ripe for lust, the lighthouse lamp with a blue glow, spinning ever so slightly in the background of their relationship, and when it finally ends, Lai is either enveloped in darkness or staring at the walls that don't seem to pop so much. And see how the editing subtly evokes a difference between the characters and Ho and Chang and how they interact with Lai; when he confronts him about the missing passport, we get a quick succession of cuts which accentuate and repeat each harsh, hurtful word and every facet of their lies. The same sort of sequence is used again when Lai and Chang say goodbye; the hug is repeated from three different perspectives, as if to fully bask in the moment of physical embrace, and then it cuts to an overhead shot that sort of just hovers nervously in the lull of the moment...and it's such a remarkable difference between the two confrontations. Chang is everything Ho is not: caring, softly spoken, honest, not abusive. There is an almost perfection to the way that post-breakup Lai handles things. WKW was right; this is not a movie about gay characters, but simply characters that are constantly in mourning and celebration over a never-ending relationship. Something as passionate and lengthy as that does not simply leave you quickly; it sticks with you and every moment after. He begins to wander bathrooms seeking male companionship, until he spots his former lover...and never visits that area again. This rings so true. And there is the repeating motif of the Iguazu waterfalls; sequences comprised completely of footage of the cavernous cliffs and the water endlessly falling into an abyss, that becomes so heartbreakingly dreamlike and out of reach. Are we doomed to have a piece of our past in us for all eternity? For Lai, as he steals that photo of Ho, it seems so.",

On vacation from Hong Kong, Yiu-Fai (Tony Leung ) and Po-Wing (Leslie Cheung) are presented in an obviously unhappy state, but we are not privy to the cause of their unhappiness. Yes, there is infidelity, there are outside attractions, and all of the 'things' that could create this state, but we are left to look at this sad young couple as a metaphor for the struggles in emotions and loves that so often surface in a dying relationship, not only in the gay relationship we are seeing but in straight relationships as well. The universals hold true.Kar Wai Wong loves the non-linear approach to story telling and in this early film the method of his direction feels a bit too disjointed, too uninvolved in the character development. Not that the actors do not render fine performances: both Leung and Cheung give brave portrayals of lost souls and we cannot help but care for both of them. And the remainder of the cast is on target (Chen Chang and Gregory Dayton).What holds the little hints of greatness that were to come (this film dates back to 1997) is suggested in the lighting and camera work, both of which provide as major a role in the film as the actors and chaotic storyline. The unity of mood and story is solidly at one in this little film, showing us just how creative the writer director was to become.",

Needless to say, the cinema was full to the brim and Christopher Doyle and Wong Kar Wai were there to introduce the film as well as parried any questions by the audience after the show.What can I say?  Vintage War Kar Wai, I suppose.  Chris Doyle's cinematography was beautiful and enchanting; his birdeye's shot of the waterfall is firmly engraved in my mind.  Tony Leung performance was touching and extremely poignant; most notably when he cried silently into the tape recorder, releasing all his personal frustrations, angst, sense of betrayal, hopelessness and loss in those few minutes.It's not so much a gay film as a show about relationships.  The two main protagonists could be two men, one woman and one man or even two women and the show would just be as poignant - the flighty, flirtatious and capricious lover vs the loyal, stable, long suffering and tolerant partnerl. However, seeing it being played out between two male leads was somewhat refreshing. Still, one can't help but wonder if Maggie Cheung, being one of Wong's muse, took one of the roles, what additional depth she might bring to this project?!",

It participates in a game of soccer, the streetlife and even the portrayed relation: it seems to have associations of it's own.  To achieve that effect, not only is there almost constant hand-held filming, but also several different materials are used for filming.  Some shots are upside down, some slow-mo, some b/w, some through a window, but always from a supposed third person's view.  That is fabulously illustrated by Astor Piazzolla's 'Milonga For Three' and 'Tango Apasionada' (Zappa's music wasn't great).  'Happy Together' is probably Kar-Wai's most emotional film.  The plot isn't very important (or isn't even there): the film consists not of a clear plot, but of 15-20 extremely short episodes, separated by joyful or sentimental music and environmental shots. The acting by Leslie Cheung (A Better Tomorrow, 1986, Chinese Ghost Story, 1987) and Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Bullet in the head, 1990, Days of being wild, 1991) didn't exactly blow my mind.  Maybe it was more improvised than other Kar-Wai movies and I have to get used to that.  Therefore it's not my everyday wake-up movie, but still one of my favourites from Kar-Wai.8/10",

But most of all he does this by is the experimental use of light, focus and speed. He uses his 'special effects' in great abundance and often multiple times in one scene, but he does so in such a matter-of-fact kind of way that one hardly notices it, thus adding immensely to the atmosphere. A special scene to watch for is when Lai Yiu-fai is lying at a platform of the Buenos Aires harbour. Through the waveforming of passing ships, it looks as if the platform itself drifts away. A simple trick, but highly effective and a fine example of the director's genius mind.As concerns the story: the relationship struggles of Ho Po-wing and Lai Yiu-fai are fascinating to watch. Although this struggle is basically all that the story entails and not much spectacular happens, the fast-paced editing, the great acting and the aforementioned camera work ensure a highly entertaining movie experience. A nice twist happens when the focus moves to the voice-over a new character (Chang), whose imaginitive mind is a welcome distraction.

Tony Leung plays the doormat boyfriend and Leslie Cheung plays the spoiled pretty boy.  It was painful to watch their relationship disintigrate in front of my eyes.

As usual, the storyline in the film is rather sparse, which does nothing to detract from the final product. The beauty of Happy Together lies in Wong Kar-Wai and cinematographer Christopher Doyle's unsurpassed ability to simulate a specific mood through film.  In Happy Together, the filmmakers continue their trademark visual style, consisting heavily on strobe, slow-motion, wide-angle lenses, and jump-cuts.  For the first time in Wong Kar-Wai's career, he mixes black and white with color film, creating a complex web of flashbacks.  The color, especially, seems to almost jump out from the screen.  The music, taken from tango album 'The Rough Dancer and the Cyclical Night', by Astor Piazzola, beautifully excentuates the lingering feelings for a lover gone.  Happy Together marks another point in Wong Kar-Wai's maturity as a director. Each one of his films surpasses those previous to it.",

The portrayal of the dynamic between Lai and Ho is ingenious. Leslie Chang and Tony Leung delivered a powerful performance and breathed life and blood into the two characters. It is one of the movies that I love but could not bear rewatching too many times, as its emotional impact lingers on and sends its audience into a mood of infinite melancholy.The choice of theme song is another stroke of ingenuity.

I was right. The film centers around a wandering, on-again/off-again Chinese couple who, presently, find themselves docked in Argentina. Their relationship is TOXIC to say the least and will either party change and finally grow?The movie is breathtaking, but apparently, I was lucky to catch a 4K Criteria Edition on HBOMax.

It seemingly transitions into color and while I still loved the B&W scenes, I really loved the colors.The acting, direction, cinematography and score were all fantastic. Though, that said, it was a bit long at times (I did find myself checking the timer a few times,) and there's weird time-jumps where prior, our couple are headed to do one thing and then, suddenly they're on the bus going somewhere. I even said out loud without thinking: \"Oh, I guess we're on a bus now.\" But, get used to that as that was the first real odd one in the movie. The rest, you'll get the gist and can follow the jumps with where/when all the main characters are.It felt like a far more dramatic and romantic version of (500) Days of Summer and maybe a slight-Sliding Doors for the scene-jumps. I began the movie siding with one male half/narrator, but then thought he wasn't a victim...and then I couldn't help root for him. Especially in a side-plot I lovely longed to have work out.I truly love this movie and glad it was recommended to me for this Pride Month, 2022. And I can't wait to see it again. BRAVO!***Final Thoughts: Never enough praise to go around...the camera angles/movements may have appeared to be experimental, but I really dug them. And the establishing shots, such as the interior apartment where most of the action takes place, was graphic and made me truly feel like I lived there.",

They constantly break-up and reunite, and the film follows this relationship (centring on Tony Leung's Yiu-fai) which for some inexplicable reason both men seem drawn to, even though externally Yiu-fai seems to have a deep resentment for the high-wired and unruly Po-wing. It's highly stylised, the use of imagery and cinematography inspired, beautifully shot and acted brilliantly. I was unfortunate in that my subtitles were ahead of themselves, but even this didn't greatly damage the brilliant pacing of the film. As Wong Kar-Wai plays with the camera, he plays with out emotions. The characters are tragic individuals, clearly yearning for some purpose, taking out each other's anger at being unable to discover said purpose on the other, but the film's ending leaves us with hope.

It is emotionally painful to watch, almost unbearably so. But, when that is coupled with WKW's script-less approach, it means that the film is probably not right for everyone.But I'd just like to add that the DVD edition has an incredible 1-hour-long \"making of\" featurette. It also is filmed in WKW style and utterly floored me. Here, you can see other relationships WKW tested out on this freeform screenplay, including a straight relationship between Tony Leung and a female character that didn't make the cut, and also some interviews with one Chinese living in Argentina who decided to stay abroad there. It really is an insider view on how deep WKW digs looking for that \"elusive something\" that has become his hallmark. I guarantee you will never see a more revealing \"making of\" anywhere! Ona personal note, an extended family member of mine died from AIDS while living abroad about one week before I saw this. So obviously, it does hold some personal associations for me. After finishing it, I couldn't watch it again for about 3 years afterwards due to the depth of some of the emotions it brings up. What WKW does say about alienation and relationships in this film rings completely true, probably more so than in any of his other films. On the other hand, because of the very fact that it is not a film \"about\" homosexuality, his frank, matter-of-fact approach to the relationship helped me to relate to certain aspects of my relative's life and death on very simple, human terms.",

This \"story\" is a mish-mashed mess of sloppily shot scenes, poorly cut, about two people that it was nearly impossible to care anything about. I do not know what the point or purpose of this movie was. If writer/director Kar- Wai Wong thought he was showing us how difficult love can be, he definitely hit upon a theme. And IF he had made us care about these two irritating, strange, selfish people, it might have had an impact, despite how sloppily it was put together. Lai Yiu-fai (Tony Leung) is the only one of the two that seemed to have a sense of responsibility and seemed to understand the value of love and caring. Ho Po-wing (Leslie Cheung) seemed to be more interested in goading Fai into arguments, hanging on him, wanting love, or money, or whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, without earning a single moment of it. I hated him. I couldn't understand what his source of anger was. Did he think money fell out of the sky? Did he think a nutritious meal was a box of cigarettes? Did he think that having sex with whoever he wanted to was going to \"endear\" him to Fai? If he had shown a MOMENT of sensitivity (other than the completely fake one at the end where he \"cries\" over Fai's blanket), I might've been on his team. But I found him repulsive. I believe the Cantonese language was used (not Mandarin), but I am sure there must be something more beautiful about it than what was heard in this movie. No matter what was said, it sounded like a complaint. The main couple always seemed miserably unhappy. There is one scene where they dance some kind of faux-tango in a horrible dingy kitchen. In this ONE SCENE there is the sense of love between these two and that SOMEHOW they belong together. But since the rest of the movie is spent screaming at each other, throwing fists into walls, pushing each other down, knocking cigarettes off shelves, cheating on each other, lying to each other, hurting each other... I just couldn't care. This is the second time I've seen this. The first time was years ago, because it was a \"gay film\" and feature-length gay films were hard to come by. I saw it a second time because I had just seen Kar-Wai's \"I'm in the mood for love\" -- which I found to be sensual and beautiful and erotic. \"Happy Together\" showed that Tony Leung is a wonderful actor with a lot of gifts. He outshone everyone in it. I also thought that he was totally believable as a conflicted gay man. But the problem is: the film only HINTED at how good it could have been. It was really not a story. It was snippets or peeks into the miserable, somewhat pointless existence of these two unhappy men, and it wasn't done well. I don't know what people are raving about. Kar-Wai has a unique talent, but he didn't really put it to good use in this rambling mess.",

It left an indelible impression on me by its strong and original cinematography, unbelievably humane characters, persuasive and brave acting and a moody soundtrack. Adding a beautiful Buenos Aires as backdrop, all those add up to a truly outstanding movie and to me it is WKW at his best (on par with \"2046\"). It is a film which truly touches the mind and soul and goes deep into what a relationship takes.Not much comment on the plot because it is so realistic and resembles a well-captured life documentary of the two gay men venturing abroad. As it is now clear, WKW makes different films simply to manifest his same vision on love again and again: intense but sparse happiness enjoyed by lovers is inevitably accompanied by long term emotional pains and losses, and when the couple separates, the despair and memory haunt them forever. However, 'Happy Together' adds extra dimensions to that familiar theme: firstly, the relationship is homosexual so the day-to-day interaction between the characters is a bit fresher and secondly, the alienation felt by the two guys in Argentina and the desire by Yiu Fai to live a new, and better, life drives the movie forward. The optimism showed at the end of the movie is a rare but welcome breather from his heavier films like \"In the Ashes of Time\", \"In the Mood for Love\" and \"2046\", where the despair is total and insurmountable. Also, as the characters have an end in mind (returning to Hong Kong), the storyline processes slowly but surely so that it adds a bit more fluidity.I am surprised how little credit has been given to Leslie Cheung's role as Po Wing. Tony Leung's performance as Yiu Fai is excellent but comparing to him, Leslie Cheung is simply better. He is the soul of the film and many scenes would lose its impact if it is done by a less charming and charismatic actor (with the scenes of Po Wing hassling Yiu Fai to cook in the middle of the night, the tango dance in the kitchen, and where Po Wing showing his vulnerability after being beaten by his client). Knowing he is homosexual in real life does not take away any of his achievement of playing Po Wing exactly like it should be. His performance here is arguably as well as he did in \"Farewell My Concubine\".It makes me want to see the Igua\u00e7u Fall.",

            "content": "Wong Kar Wai's 'Happy Together' Happy Together is a Hong Kong film released in 1997 and directed by popular Chinese director, Wong Kar Wai. It stars Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung and tells the story of two gay men who have moved to Argentina to escape Hong Kong after it has been handed over to the Chinese. It depicts a turbulent romance between the two characters Ho-po Wing and Lai Yui- Fai. I found the film extremely interesting in the way it represents not only relationships but the relationship between two homosexual men. The film tackles manipulation, neediness and loneliness, all common occurrences in many relationships. It presents Po Wing and Fai as a normal couple, no different than a heterosexual couple. I particularly enjoy how they both have a gender role, with one being more clingy and needy than the other. The film is rather touching and moving in the way it emphasises the damage a relationship can have on an individual involved. The acting was very good and convincing and you did believe the emotion felt. The mise-en- scene is also very interesting in this film, the use of black and white and colour to represent different time frames is very clever and interesting and the general low key lighting of the film makes it feel very gritty. The location in which it is set is not glamorous or desirable and in particular Fai's apartment is very basic and can also act as a metaphor for Fai's state of mind, messy and dark. The cinematography was very good at helping to tell the story in the best way possible and creates an almost claustrophobic feeling with many close and medium shots and locations often being small. The claustrophobic feeling from the closed in cinematography creates a similar feeling to what Fai's character must be feeling, closed in and trapped by his ex/lover Po Wing. All in all, I think this film is definitely worth a watch but could possibly be frustrating if you are easily bored. Its an interesting piece of cinema when it comes to psychology and is a interesting spin on a love story.",

Themes of alienation, loneliness and searching for something bleed through Wong's films like ink on a white shirt, permanently changing our perception of what great film making truly is. Centering around two homosexual, Chinese men, the film depicts modern day Argentina. Having the men as homosexuals alright draws a line between acceptance and alienation for homosexuals still struggle for acceptance today. But also having the film take place in Argentina separates these men even further to the point that they, each other, are all they have. Their relationship is really the heart of the story which goes completely opposite of the film's namesake. Not once are they happy together nor are they happy apart. The film acts as a sort of tug-a-war with these lovers constantly battling to win each other back or push each other way. Never once is one's \"male\" dominance long lasting, leaving these lovers continuing their love hate relationship. Wong has the power to use his sets as not only backdrops but characters themselves. Much of the film takes place in their small cramped room. The leaning walls constantly give off the feeling that their small little world is closing in about them. The room is not glorified nor is it pretty. It is dressed with gritty trash with realism so thick that it transports the viewer into the room as well. The characters look cramped in their environment even outside the room. And even outside the room into the streets of Argentina, there is never a sense of the outside world. Just the small world from work to home, nothing more. The camera is squeezed where ever it can fit and the scene is documented.The non linear story perfectly captures the life of these two characters who are literally fish out of water. Wong's fixation on alienation and searching come through more in this film than any of his others. The powerful acting propels the story and the emotional content of their relationship gives it a heart. The film is not happy nor is it very entertaining beyond the characters. Nothing much is gained and nothing much is lost yet the aesthetic beauty of the cramped and ugly Argentina background leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. Wong's ability to handle such subject matter with grace and power to evoke such real emotions, demonstrates why he is one of the great filmmakers working today and will surely be remember as one of the great filmmakers of the industry.",

To save up for a trip to go back home disillusioned Yiu-Fai gets a job working in a tango bar, while Po-Wing is beaten and bruised and his partner cannot find a way to be in an intimate relationship. Po-Wing is after all they go through not ready to settle down with his partner, and Yiu-Fai next finds a job working in a Chinese restaurant and meets Chang (Chen Chang) from Taiwin who is more youthful. Life for Yiu-Fai takes a new spin, supposedly for the better, while life for Po-Wing continues to shatter and go downward, but in the end they do contact each other once more, but without any good coming from it, but one is able to return to Hong Kong. I didn't understand all of the story going on, apart from the obvious gay relationships going on throughout, and I agree with the critics, it is trying a little too hard to appear indulgent, but it does look good with colour and imagery, that's probably why it would be considered a must see, so it's a relatively interesting romantic drama.

            "content": "I first saw this film in its initial theatrical release in 1997. I sat by myself in a packed theater and when it was over, I just kept sitting there waiting for everyone to file out. I was rocked emotionally big time from what I had seen. I needed to recover...keep my emotion in check...keep it from being a public display. Clearly, there has never been another director who has communicated to me on a more emotional level than Wong Kar-Wai. Vittorio De Sica is the only other director whom I can think of that comes even close. However, not everyone shared in my rapture with the film as evidenced by my experience years later when I tried to show some folks the film on video. Either they couldn't get by the opening sequence of the \"shockingly ribald\" sex scene or past the first thiry minutes of \"constant bickering.\"The film's strengths are derived from its tremendous sense of mood and atmosphere. I found Doyle's camerawork to be lyrical and elegiac. He utilizes color, monochrome, shades of brown and blue to maximum effect. Its as if he is able to visualize the tone and mood which are only able to be described perfectly with words. This is quite frankly a brilliant achievement. How about the acting? Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung, two of Hong Kong's finest and bravest actors, hold nothing back in this film. They literally strip themselves bare right down to their spiritual core and lay their vulnerabilities on the table for the whole world to see. They don't so much as act their roles as they more or less live them. This is the career best ever performance from Cheung. Just look at his eyes as he turns around to look at the fading Leung as Cheung is being driven off by his new found \"friends.\" Those eyes conveyed sadness, apathy, self-pity, and jealousy...all in a single glance!Ultimately, the film is about the transience of physical passion, possessive love, loneliness, as well as about being trapped in our daily existence. These characters are trapped in Buenos Aires, far away from their home in Hong Kong. They went there to get away and start over but left to their own devices, they have progressed no further than the starting point. Iguazu falls would have been a nice destination(level) point, but sadly, not many of us get to reach that \"level\" (both literally and figuratively) with our fellow mankind in our lifetime. In the end, we mostly cry away our tears as we are forced to look at our own failures. Lai couldn't cry away his sorrow and pain with Chang at the lighthouse, but he may have gotten some redemption at the Iguazu falls.This is a beautiful and at the same time painful treatise on man's longing to be loved, protected, and secure as well as on man's desire to be free from himself and his own devices, and ultimately on man's alienation from the world which he lives in. While \"Happy Together\" is technically not quite on par with Wong's \"Chungking Express\", it is philosophically as deep as his \"Ashes of Time\", and is on a similar emotional playing field with his \"In the Mood For Love.\"",

            "content": "Well, I watched this film in 1997 or 1998...and last month again. I have slightly different impression between the time when I watched before and this year (last month).My feeling when I watched before was full of unshed some sort of anger or frustration...until the moment of the psychological relief at the stint of light for humane mutual understandings and affection. That was my impression when I watched this film in 1997 or 1998 firstly.Next time, this time, I could be much patient with the suffocation in such sort of unfairness in love. In my opinion, I believe that love is NOT power struggle, not game of who suppressed or not\u0085 Love is serene mutual understanding and sharing each moment with joy, angry, pain, sadness and pleasure\u0085equally, freely, taking each other as s/he is. Well, some may say... oh no! Love is not supposed to be fair or equal! It is all about political power struggle...There must be someone who loves one sided and who to be loved one sided...! BUT I don't think so. Love can be, and actually should be, equally mutual. If someone may say, there must be someone obeyed and someone rules in love, which is not, in fact, love, instead, is some sort of different form of helpless attempting in seeking some completion of incompleteness of a personality of whom is desperately persistent with forcing and enticed others as knowing/taking advantage of how much deeply the other is caring about and understanding such incompleteness and hollowness. Or say, there could be some sort of mal-catharsis even in the form of obsessions in non-mutual relationship. One always tears; other always cares.... and is happy? pretending happy\uff1fResponding in affection to harmful humiliation helplessly, hoping love can be exist in such unfairness\u0085., which can be assumed love? No.Wonder\u0085. Is everyone qualified to love and to be loved even without determining to give love but seek love from others? I don't think so. Love is not qualification. Love happens. Nevertheless, some sort of determination must be there before anyone is going to be love with someone, mustn't it?But still the former part of this film persistently pressed everyone to ask himself/herself\u0085.. Is there any pocket for anyone or everyone to seek someone whom forces and take advantage of you to give in? Is there any place in heart in everyone in indulging into love others even knowing the other is fully conscious about how far s/he is only interesting in using others? The answer is, for me, no.... but for anyone else, I don't know.As the time when I saw this movie first time, the later sequence indicates some sort of answer, there must be still lots of hope in love if you seek while the movie delicately avoided what is wrong or what is right\u0085 cause love must be seen and accepted as it is, or was or say love cannot be judged maybe. But some sort of genuine self-judgment or judgment can be, must be, reached to any harmful intentions in such guise of form of love, in fact. And there must be, always, exit for something different that makes you believe in the existence of love that accept you merely as you are equally, mutually, unconditionally.And such persistent deep hot thick suffocation finally lead to the real relief. At the near of the end of the film, the beginning of the real mutual love. Splendidly opens up with the melody. Happy together",

It was bad enough to employ alternation of black-and-white and color, but when we are finally rewarded with color (and for some reason, though I'm a black-and-white-film fan, I felt that this entire movie should have been in color--maybe only as some relief from the drabness of the relationship depicted), the color has to be altered, saturated, the images made grainy and/or overexposed, etc.?I feel the technical aspect of this film constitutes a severe disservice to the work of two exceptionally fine actors--three, if you count the brief appearance of Chen Chang, who is perfect as the young, bored, but very sweet and good-hearted tourist whom the protagonist may or may not see more of later.What a missed opportunity.

Tony being the man in the relationship just wanted to see his lover in the apartment after a long day of work. Leslie being the \"female\" of the relationship wanted someone to take care of him, but yet also wanted adventure and hated being stuck in an apartment all day as a \"housewife\".As for the cinematography, it is right up there with In the mood for love. Tony Leung, a big star in Hong Kong, willing to do the sex scene because he knows the brilliant of Wong Kar Wai. Would any of the Hollywood stars do the same? 10/10",

The use of colour (or lack thereof in the black and white sequences) is phenomenal, and I loved the camerawork which is unsteady enough to make things look like they're happening in the moment, but not so erratic or unsteady that it ever feels distracting.Also adding to the film's greatness are two phenomenal lead performances from Leung and Cheung, who completely disappear into their roles and make their characters feel so real, flawed, and compelling.There's some repetition when it comes to pacing and the use of music (both are sort of expected when it comes to Wong Kar-Wai), but the visuals and acting are fantastic, and more than make the film worth watching on their own.",

What sets this one apart is that unlike in \"Fallen Angels\" or \"Chungking Express\" where his impressionistic and expressive style of film-making constantly feels unnecessary and shallow, here the style conveys an incredibly rich and desperately beautiful array of feelings and moods, much more than in his following work \"In the Mood for Love\".\"Happy Together\" is a landmark in the Cinema of the 1990's, and easily one of the best romance films of that decade. But unlike \"traditional\" romance films, HP is a lot more: a true testament to how it feels being lost in a foreign land; being young and in love, and feeling that mixture of pain and happiness that marks our lives; not knowing who you will meet around the corner.Every frame of this film is filled with beauty, love, and an urgent sense of magic.

            "content": "The title suggests a harmonious and smooth relationship between two persons; however, as you watch the film, you will realize that the title is quite ironic. For although the kind of relationship that the two main characters, Li Fai (Tony Leung) and Poh Wing (Leslie Cheung), have is one that is passionate and tender, it doesn't exactly mean that they are meant for each other, that their relationship is \"made in heaven.\"Yet, it should be noted that their breaking apart appears to be not at all willed by either of them, but, even if we find in the film no outright condemnation of the affair, instigated by external circumstances over which they do not have absolute control. As Chinese emigrants in Argentina hoping to find there solace, warmth, protection and love that otherwise they did not experience back home, the fact that they are in a foreign land would not guarantee the attainment of their objectives;on the other hand, its being uncertain in nature could all the more aggravate the desolation and depression that these people want to relieve in the first place.So, no matter how Li Fai and Poh Wing try to make their relationship bloom to the fullest, poverty (having no stable jobs), jealousy (having another object of affection) and unrest (being in a country that is just as volatile as their own) have only contributed to its withering away.The depressing and confusing situation the characters are in is undeniably recognized by the viewers as it is visually presented either in the gloominess of raw black-and-white or in the artificiality of glowing colors, coupled with angles and shots that are astonishing because of their \"unconventional\" mobility, proximity, high standpoint and split-second \"stillness.\"As Wong would have it, the emotional and psychological state of the characters (what's going on inside them) must simply correlate with their milieu (what's going on outside), indicating a kind of interaction wherein the one may just as be the cause of the other's undoing.With this, it now appears that \"Cheun gwong tsa sit\" is not simply about a homosexual love affair, but, more so, about how outside factors (economic, social, political, geographical) can undermine, directly and subtly, something as personal and intimate as a human relationship---it only happens that in the film, both parties belong, by biological standards, to the same sex.",

Kar-wai wrote and re-wrote it many times and re-conceived various parts of the story repeatedly during the shooting of the movie, straining both patience and health of both cast and crew. It proved to be a very long and troublesome film to produce, partly due to the subject matter and party the lack of financial backing. Moreover, it has been said they even ran out of good film stock during some stages of the production, yet the result is stylish, provocative and visually dramatic. It may not have been a mega box office smash hit, yet it remains an intensely passionate cinematic gem which scored no less than seventeen award nominations, winning best director for Kar-wai at the 1997 Cannes Festival, best cinematography for Christopher Doyle during the 1997 Golden Horse Awards and best actor for Tony Leung Chiu-wai at the Hong Kong Film Awards also in 97. Critics the world over seemed mostly enthralled by it, especially the symbolic, ultra gritty innovative cinematography and impressively free and stylistic directorial approach. This is no walk in the park type of movie, nor is it glitz glamour and drag queens aplenty, it is a hard-hitting gritty passionate tale of evolving love and internal courage to break free from a cycle of devastation and destruction toward a more hopeful tomorrow. A movie metaphor for anyone living in a destructive relationship if ever there was one, although it is much more than just a metaphor it is a damn near dramatic instruction manual.

Further, Ho has been been slut-shamed in comments, but although we do see in the film that he loves Lai intensely regardless of his (Ho's) actions, the story uses him as prop to tell Lai's story, rather than treating him as a human. Speaking of props: Chang.A lot of scenes just seemed to be inserted, or extended with no action, for no particular reason.

There are no high ratings to my knowledge where a heterosexual film can be apologised away for its sexuality, or its inference that it could equally be a homosexual scenario. Personally I find the film arty in the worst possible way. despite the fact that I know it is well made and demands thought and attention. I have seen it twice and it is as elusive to me as the work of Manuel Puig upon which it is partially based. Puig was homosexual, and so far that is irrelevant to the reviews I have read. I may not like his books very much but he felt from the inside the very distinct nature of homosexual love and physical expression. It is not the same as the comfort zone of heterosexual experience, and in this specific film it is two men who are the breakdown lovers. They should not be put in that no man's land of the heterosexual eye wanting it to be other than it is so that they can give it the high ratings of the finely made film that it is.",

            "content": "We all know that this movie talked about the life of a homosexual couple. Wong Kar Wai even made them a love scene to make it more vivid to the viewers. But that's it. What is really impressive about this film is that the director used the characters as real people. unlike any other movie that dealt with homosexual relationships (e.g. if these walls could talk, the priest) this movie placed the characters in a situation that still makes them human. They encountered the same problems, trials, joys and even petty fights that usually take place in normal couples. Wong Kar Wai opened the eyes of his viewers that characters are not necessarily limited to the context of their sexuality but most importantly their personality. Let the characters take their course in the story. Mabuhay ang Noypi!",

Like the re-occurring theme of the waterfall, I just let the movie wash over me and went with it.  The relationship was troubled, but realistic and the movie provided hope.  It portrayed profound feelings without offense and touchingly.  I chafe at overly emotional things, but this did a fantastic job at making me feel some of the complex emotions these two were going through.  Many scenes are incredible in their sheer beauty.  Also, it was wonderful that being gay was never the issue.  It wasn't a gay film.  It was just a relationship.  A relationship that ended, but nevertheless, was part of these two men's history, interesting and rich.",

You would have trouble finding it in HK because it was not received that well, but a great movie still.Wong Kar Wei directs two great actors in a setting that is equally great. The homosexual dancing scene that he uses as a vehicle for the story is a great device and since it is true, also believable. Great dramatic performance from these actors. I think that Wong has the ability to get the best out of his actors, particularly because the actors themselves probably realize that it is something special to work with him.The shooting of the movie, the angles, are all excellently done. I appreciate the gritty style of the movie and the dark backdrops and the cigarette smoke everywhere. This movie leaves you in your seat in the theatre for a while, after it's finished, leaving you with a feeling of catharsis...is it possible that Wong Kar Wei wants to show us that homo's are humans too?As I said a difficult subject. Some people will not receive this movie well, because they do not appreciate the art of it, nor the subject matter. That is a loss to them. This story of hardship and love is a must see movie for those with an open mind. The only reason I could not give it a 10 because I myself found the homosexual scenes and the subject matter too hard to stomach.",

            "content": "\"Chun gwong cha sit\" or \"Happy Together\" is a co-production between Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea and if you think that is already a lot, wait till you hear that there are even four languages spoken in this not too long movie that runs for under 100 minutes. Admittedly, also not super short, but the writer and director here is Kar-Wai Wong and he is not a man who is known for films with gigantic running times and that is something that is different with him compared to other Asian filmmakers, especially these days, but then again nowadays films are often longer anyway compared to a few decades ago. This one is from 1997, so same year like Titanic, and this means it has its 25th anniversary this year. I don't think this was the key reason why it was shown here, but just many (older) Asian movies in general have made it to the big screen again in recent months and I am curious to check them out, even if the outcome does not always win me over and this is also the case with this film here. I wish I could say otherwise, but in general Kar-Wai Wong did not impress me too much with the films I have seen from him so far (with one or two exceptions maybe) and this is probably one of his five most famous films too. As I said earlier, he is not just the director, but also the writer and this is also always true for him pretty much. The base material, however, stems from Argentine filmmaker Manuel Puig, who died way too early and even if he is probably not known to really many outside South America, he has still enjoyed a very solid career and quite a few of his works got turned into films and there is even a relatively short documentary about him out there. He was also the one in charge of the base material for Kiss of the Spider Women, the film that won William Hurt the Oscar. But back to this one here now: Unfortunately, I cannot really say too much about the cast in here, not even about the two lead actors. I see Leslie Cheung died from suicide a long time ago already, which is quite sad, while Tony Chiu-Wai Leung has enjoyed an utterly successful life and career until this point with some great credits to his name. Good for him. The duo is featured in pretty much every scene of the movie and when they are not together, they are on the phone with each other instead. That says it all.In-between, you even forget that the film is not set in Asia, but in Argentina, which is of course fitting too if you look at who wrote the novel this is based on. But you do not see a lot of Argentina in terms of people, sights or just what defines this mesmerizing country. The one exception is a spectacular waterfall that can be seen relatively early in the movie and also towards the end. There we have one of the two characters stand there in admiration of the waterfall and say that his initial idea was to watch the waterfall with his loved one. This refers of course to the other central character from this film, so yes this is a gay-themed movie, but not really feel-good for the most part. The very ending then is also not the two together again, so not a happy ending, but maybe it is best for them. Still, the writer did not want to take the fully unhappy route here apparently and we find out from the words of one character that he knows where to find the other, so there is still hope for a romance comeback. Or I should maybe say \"hope\" because honestly the way the two were behaving towards each other for the entire film did not make me think they should be an item. They were arguing, complaining, even playing mind games and there were almost no moments when I felt that they were really caring for one another. One minor exception was perhaps when one of the two was injured and the other feeds him, but this was maybe also only because he felt obliged to and not because he deeply cared for the other. In any case, nothing from the film had me really think that he did. So it also did not make an impact on me when we see one character terribly sad and crying a lot towards the end that the relationship is over. Over for the moment at least because this was a bit of a running gag, but not a funny one, that they always get back together somehow and one character asks the other if they want to try it again. The one scene where I really saw harmony and affection there was when they were dancing, but even this came with initial struggles and one of them simply not being in the mood (no pun intended) anymore to deal with the other not being able to manage the steps right away.Now, let us look at the film as a whole: If you have some stuff from Kar-Wai Wong, then you know that he almost always finds a way to get in restaurants or gastronomy in his movies and if the films are not set there at the key of the story, then at least he includes places like these during one or several scenes. This is also no exception here, especially if you look at the profession(s) the characters have. I am not really sure why the filmmaker is so dedicated to get this in for every film he makes. Here of course it could have had to do with the base material as well that it was simply part of the book. I cannot elaborate on that in detail because I did not read it. Also cannot elaborate on parallels and differences as a consequence there. But this is a movie review anyway, so it should be all good. Songs from the western hemisphere are also something you hear pretty often in the man's movies and maybe you guessed it already from the title which song is featured this time. It is definitely not unexpected and a fairly famous and popular number, even this many years after its original release. What you hear this time, however, is not the original \"Happy Together\" from The Turtles, but a cover version by Danny Chung apparently, which is a bit surprising because he was a truly prolific composer for Asian films, but a singer I am not sure. Anyway, it is also not the only time that KWW uses the song for the closing credits. Of course, don't get me wrong with what I wrote before this, he also often includes Asian music in his films, but overall more music and especially famous songs from the western hemisphere than most Asian filmmakers.As for the film's style, it can be noted that early sequences of the film are in black-and-white and this is something I almost always appreciate and like to watch, especially in modern movies, but here it did not turn the film into a better watch either unfortunately. It just could not win me over. Too much style over substance, which often seems to be the case with Kar-Wai Wong. The scenes and moments when I considered giving the outcome a positive recommendation were not often enough. Still I will state them. There was this early scene when one of the two (ab)uses his injury to be closer to the other and make sure it stays that way. That was kinda cute. Aside from that, there was only one scene from the many scenes inside the apartment that I liked. It was around the time when they also had the passport argument I think. The waterfall scene towards the end was not half as good and breathtaking as I would have liked it to be. What I liked more was a scene when they are not together (exception) when we see one character cry into a recorder after a friend asks him to record something. However, for every scene that I liked there were at least two that I disliked or that did nothing for me, like also for example when after the two had kinda ended their relationship, one character goes to an adult film theater and engages in sexual activity with a random stranger. I guess this was to show us that the characters are also just humans and have flaws and maybe he missed the affection from his man and that is why he did it, but still it left me unimpressed. Then we have inclusions that could have been completely left out for all I care(d). There I would count the football stadium sequence. I mean almost everybody knows that Argentina is really crazy about football, but it added absolutely nothing story-wise, also not in the sense that this full stadium served as contrast to loneliness or so. I am not sure why it was even shown, maybe because it was in the book. As I said, I am not sure there.I wrote early on that this film is not long at all, but if I mention everything I would have been okay with if it had gotten left out, then it would have been maybe an 80-minute movie or so. It was also not really a funny film, also in terms of situational comedy for me. Maybe one very brief slightly funny moment was when we hear a character say that one of the protagonists should hook him up with an Asian girl that has big breasts. I cannot think of more and that says it all. I mean Kar-Wai Wong is not known for his comedic approach, but there is more like that in other films he made. Also more lightness as this one here is a pretty depressing film from beginning to end, which is not a negative criticism, but it makes it even more difficult to appreciate when you really do not care for the main characters at all and do not really want them to sort out their difficulties. There I can mention again the quote from one of the two about how he always suggests after an argument that they should try it again. Maybe listening to a specific Taylor Swift song and following the advice about never ever getting back together would be the better solution for everybody involved and the \"try again\" is something I would give as an advice to the filmmaker here in order to come up with a film that has better quality. I am surprised it has such a high rating on imdb as I did not see much quality and I doubt this would not change on rewatch. Doubtful I will ever watch this movie again, but never say never I guess. For now I give it a thumbs-down and negative recommendation as a whole. I suggest you skip the watch here or at least if you want to get into Kar-Wai Wong, then this film should not be among the first films to check out from him. Go for something else instead.",

            "content": "I come into the discourse of Wong Kar-wai a bit late in the game. Seeing \"Happy Together\" after having seen \"2046\" - well it totally skewed my viewing. I saw in the last scene - the cityscape scene - the start of \"2046.\" To be perfectly honest, I am not surprised that Wong Kar-Wai received the Best Director award at Cannes in 1997 for \"Happy Together.\" \"Happy Together\" is a story of the relationship between two homosexuals set in Buenos Aires - but just like all Wong Kar-wai movies it is also about more than just a straight up narrative. In this movie - as we do with others of Wong Kar-Wai oeuvre we are beset with musings of the hopeless romantic.Wong Kar-Wai zeroes in on the relationship between Lai Yiu-Fai (Tony Leung) and Ho Po-Wing (Leslie Cheung), acting like a typical married couple, a point of view that most viewers should be able to relate to - whether gay or straight. Lai and Ho are ex-pats stuck in Buenos Aires. After an ill-planned attempt to see the Iguazu Falls - they drift apart. Lai becomes a doorman at a tango club, where he exists from hand to mouth. Lai's wages barely allowing him to live in his claustrophobic flat in a rundown building. The mise-en-scene is one of the most striking signatures of Wong Kar-wai. The claustrophobic cityscape is played out in \"Days of Being Wild,\" continued in \"In the Mood for Love,\" and culminates aesthetically in \"2046.\" Ho, conversely, sells himself out as a gigolo, making a living as a sycophant in a series of one-night stands. After finding Ho bleeding on the street, beaten up by a trick gone badly, Lai takes Ho back and takes care of him. The spirit of Iguazu is always a looming presence with the tacky lamp.Happy Together exemplifies the hallmark signatures of Wong Kar-Wai's. The black and white strategy is inexplicably wonderful - it had me at hello. The story, rather than being plot-driven, is theme-driven, with many layers of interpretation. The characters are (as usual) a juxtaposition of existential issues writ-small. The contrast between Lai and Ho is on one level the more obvious tension that Wong sets up. Lai is the more reserved and arguably the more \"maternal\" of the two. Stephen Teo makes the argument that contrary to public opinion, this movie is not a re-enshrinement of Leung's masculinity. I agree with Teo in that the taking in by Lai and caring for Ho is affirmation of Lai's \"femininity.\" Hard to figure what was going through Wong Kar-wai's head when he did this but it seemed like a conscious attempt to reify in our mind the homosexual persona of Lai. We already know that the late Leslie Cheung was an open homosexual - which somewhat already informs our watching of him. Conversely, it is the strong heterosexual persona that Tony Leung has cultivated that somewhat hinders believability. But, for the movie's sake I believe. Lai is haunted by his thieving past. Ho, the more aimless of the pair - is not saddled by memories - time is not an issue with him. Hearkening back to his role in \"Days of Being Wild\" - he is once again self destructive - Yuddy but homosexual.\"Happy Together\" is unfortunately not my favorite Wong Kar-wai movie. However, having said that it is arguably my favorite Wong Kar-wai film in terms of its cinematography. It captures for me the inner city struggle that my favorite \"In the Mood for Love\" could not. Since \"Chunking Express\" was a lighter film - it did not have that same impact on me as this did. The movie is perhaps the straighter in terms of narrative with the usual existential angst and the usual very, very stylish-camera work. In terms of its angst and desperation examination, I have to but it up there with the pantheon of favorites. Bravo! Miguel Llora",

I would go as far to say that this could be Kar-Wai's was aesthetically accomplished film (with perhaps \"In the Mood\" neck-in-neck).This film differs from the more romanticized or fantastic elements of Chungking, Fallen Angels or In the Mood. This is a very real story and while Kar-Wai's universal theme of love plays a huge part it does not transmute the world into a world through the looking glass. It is also worth mention that cultural difference plays little if any role in this film. While Leung is seen interacting with Asian tourists neither he nor his lover seem alienated while in Argentina. You feel the same about the environment as you do when you see the urban world of Hong Kong. Perhaps this is Kar-Wai proving that one's perception is far more important that one's location.Overall this is an incredible film bursting at the seems with originality, humor, emotion and a flair that imbues all of this Hong Kong auteur's prolific and consistent body of work.",

            "content": "The essence of Kar-Wai's magic as a director is 'romantic' in nature, as in most of 'Fallen Angels' and 'Chung-King Express' which are really not much more than comic-book 'graphic novels' brought to the screen.  His characters in those flicks always use their neurotic methods to sidestep and stay above the ever increasing encroachments of the modern jungle on their precarious egos. In 'Happy Together,' Kar-Wai tries to go in a naturalistic direction with a 'warts and all' story of two jealous gay ex-lovers trying to survive in Argentina (one as a hustler, the other a short-order cook), and then tries to reconcile this with his usual method of transcending the banal 'reality' by raising things to a modern, mythical, 'superreal' level (achieved mysteriously through, among other devices, 'poseur dynamics' and 'crazy action'). The result, though it is certainly interesting at first, soon becomes interminable, and isn't anywhere near Scorsese's transcendently naturalistic 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver,' classic Rossellini or DeSica, or 'Midnight Cowboy,' which it certainly resembles in more ways than one. 'Midnight Cowboy' achieves everything Kar-Wai aims for and misses on 'Happy Together.' I always thought Wai's claustrophobic style was forced upon him by the city of Hong-Kong, but here the feeling is entirely the same though most of the film was shot, apparently, in Argentina. Too bad, because some of the cinematography (especially the time-lapse shots of the city at night) is mind-bendingly poetic and seems to belong in a different, much better movie. There are hints of where this movie could've gone in the scenes choreographed in supercool, slow motion to the two Frank Zappa tracks (Chunga's Revenge, I Have Been In You), when the film becomes turbocharged for a few minutes and then levels off again.",

His films take the idea that form should mirror content to an entirely new level.  They capture what it means to be alive, to be human.  Kar-Wai understands that film is a construct, an abstraction of reality, and in doing so works his particular brand of magic.  He operates in a hyper-reality in which he weaves together pop melodies, jump cuts, freeze frames, soliloquy, color and black and white into a fabric which is... just that, more real than real - but human.That is what this is - a story about human beings, beyond, beneath, through, under and up-side down of that the protagonist is homosexual.  This is not a GAY ISSUE film, thankfully, nor is it a gay NOVELTY film, again - spare me (I've been spared).  It transcends what drags so many films (particular character driven ones) into charicature hell and reaches true poetic heights.The film is sped up, slowed down, brightly lit in lush colors, stark in high-contrast black and white.  It's all very Shakespearean... in that Shakespeare oscillated between verse and prose, and not for the simple purpose of differentiating commoners from royalty - the shifts are subtle and more than anything represented characters various states of mind - Kar-Wai, with cinematographer Chris Doyle, does the same thing here, cinematically.Ultimately, for all the stylistic brashness, it is the simplicity of the film that makes it work.  The simple story framework that makes it GO.  As he did with \"Chunking Express\" Wong Kar-Wai pulls off a meditation about what it means to be human, through all the temporal, sensual, and geographical dislocation that is MODERN life.",

It is not an easy movie to watch perhaps and will not appeal to everyone, but as an art film and a gay-themed love story it is a contemporary classic. I had an earlier release of this DVD, but purchased this new edition to see the making-of documentary Buenos Aires: Zero Degrees, which is a special feature on the new release. The documentary itself is a gem as it reveals so many story lines that did not appear in the final film. It is fascinating to see the directions the film might have taken and how such a different film could have come out of the editing room. We can really appreciate Wong Kar-Wai's process, working without a script, and see the difficulties it causes for the actors. Lead actor Tony Leung's comments about working on the film are especially insightful. Wong Kar-Wai's In the mood for love is the film that brought him the greatest international recognition perhaps, but Happy Together was an important step on the road to that masterpiece.

            "content": "Happy Together reviewHappy Together has a pretty basic plot, but gets more twisted and heartbreaking as it goes along. It tells the story of Fair and Po, gay couple who go on a 'getaway' into the urban life of Argentina that on the way discovers the deep emotions obetween one another. Basically, Yiu- Fai and Po-Wing arrive in Argentina from Hong Kong and take to the road for a holiday. Something is wrong and their relationship goes adrift. A disillusioned Yiu-Fai starts working at a tango bar to save up for his trip home. When a beaten and bruised Po-Wing reappears, Yiu-Fai is empathetic but is unable to enter a more intimate relationship.Lost souls, lonely, longing, and lovelorn, are staples in the Wong Kar-Wai universe. His best works uncannily portray the beauty and misery of being struck by love and its multiple variations and illusions. His fluid, script-free, improvisational style of work is now legendary and applies well to the unpredictable nature of this subject matter while giving his works a raw, open-ended quality. \"Happy Together\" is quite probably his rawest work to date and, as a result, one of the most difficult to watch The rawness makes it seem organic. It feels as if it's an ever-evolving creature which hides and exposes its multiple facets with each different viewing. Wong successfully created this tension by hiring some of Hong Kong's best actors. They carried themselves with the greatest of comfort and control. I felt as if I knew these characters by the end of the film. I felt as if I had gone through a similar struggle as they did. These two men challenged the idea of \"normal\" relationships, yet kept their personas simple, human, and intense. You could not help but feel emotion for these two, even if you did not like the story. They kept the tones light when they needed to be, then brought you deep within the rabbit hole when the darkness erupted. The final scenes of this film are fascinating to watch, and I had to see them again. The downfall of Yiu-fai into a role similar to Po-wing was heartbreaking, yet stunning. Here we have two men who I thought were complete opposites from the beginning, yet somehow, to quote Wong, \"Turns out that lonely people are all the same.\"\"Happy Together\" is one of those films that I do not really enjoy watching. It is actually physically painful to watch because it hurts the eye as much as it hurts the soul. The films style blends perfectly with the characters performances and the situations they have to undergo. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the surreal style of film which Wong crafts successfully. 7/10",

            "content": "Wong kar-wai tells this love story in the simplest way possible, without the usual social oppression of such films, and the two eventually separate because of feelings, not anything else. In fact, the two people are essentially different, which is also the representative of the two characters created by Wong Kar-wai. Ho Po-wing is a typical prodigal character, disregarding, can be said to be selfish, emotional exploiter. Lai yiu-fai is a different kind of person, who can bear everything in silence. Two people a romantic, a reality, the final outcome is in fact expected. The shooting of the film can be said to be direct, and the conflict between the two people is simply exposed under the camera, but on reflection, the film still has many touching moments. The turbulent emotions are hidden beneath the surface of the film, making the film like an emotional beast or abyss, which people unconsciously gaze at and fall into its infinite love\nWhen many people watch the movie, they will overlook zhang's character, but he is the character who points out the essence of the movie. Zhang is also wandering, but he is different from He Baorong, he is a family, he knows that wherever he goes, there is a home to return to. This could explain why Ho Po-wing was able to walk away recklessly early in the film, because Ho Po-wing knows he can always go back to his lover. This is why Ho Po-wing fell apart after Lai yiu-fai left, because he had no foundation after his lover left. Speaking of Zhang, he symbolizes homesickness and the call of hometown in this film. He was a visitor to the cinema, to South America.Wong Kar-wai expressed his thoughts and worries about Hong Kong's return to China in the film, and expressed his hopes with the title \"Happy Together\". Therefore, many people say that spring is a bad ending, but I don't think it is. In the end, Lai Yiu-fai returned to Hong Kong and returned home. Wandering and vagrancy ended, which is also a happy ending at another level\nW. Wong Kar-wai in spring should be a tribute to the South American master Solanas \"travel\", including the soundtrack, setting and other aspects of the multiple salute. During the trip, the hero came to South America to find his father, which happened to coincide with Lai yiu-fai's motivation to find a home. The final outcome, but also found their own has been looking for things. So we can guess that Ho Po-wing is actually similar to the traveling lady in red, a beautiful symbol, the embodiment of the magical South American continent, and the embodiment of the word vagrancy\nIt's fair to say that Wong Kar-wai's film demonstrates the highest level of cinematic technology. Cinematography, music and editing are almost perfect. Its in a short period of time to account for a large amount of information in the editing of the perfect, there is quite superb indoor scheduling. For example, ho Po-wing's shot is fast cut, while Lai yiu-fai's shot is relatively smooth, showing the psychological state.of the two people at this time. This kind of shot makes the film very appealing. The color of happy together is also a big advantage, black and white symbolizes broken feelings, high saturated warm colors are heavy feelings, low guarantee and cool colors are the end of feelings. The special lighting in their apartment makes time stand still, while the final city, played to a classic soundtrack, is the real world\nHappy Together is a film that can be read in multiple ways, whether as a stand-alone love story, a highly political fable, or a nostalgic look back. Either way, it's a classic worth watching again and again. It's one of my favorite movies\nPersonal ranking: Wong Kar-wai No.2, Chinese film No.2.",

It outlines his frustrations of his love for his boyfriend, underlining such issues as mistrust, uncertainty, longing, anger, affection. The main character is pretty handsome, with a ferocious temper for his boyfriend who knows how to set him off. They don't have much money between them, but there is a soulful approach with visual icons like the waterfall, the light house, and at times a certain tenderness. Towards the end they fall apart, but at least with the hopes of seeing each other again someday.",

            "content": "I can't believe that this film is a highly-regarded LGBTQIA+ film. It's dated and completely unrealistic. If you think \"Staircase\" with Richard Burton and Rex Harrison is stereotypical garbage - you won't believe how this surpasses it in negative cliches. The two leads here have zero chemistry, and their \"love\" scenes together are static and disturbing.The main cast is obviously two straight actors who were tricked into playing gay... And its obvious they have absolutely no idea how to do this. The script has them fighting and bickering constantly (ala Staircase) and there is also no back story to explain what could have possibly made them desire to be together in the first place. It's such a unbelievable set-up and the film cannot get past it. The two leads are also so indistinct that it is almost impossible to tell them apart. Who is who? Doesn't matter, they are both jerks and hurtful and hateful people.This film is so typical and so boring... there is a small plot twist in the 2nd act where one of the men almost has a relationship with another guy that works in the same restaurant as he does... and this look at longing and desire from a muted perspective is the only relatable thing in the film.Again - I don't get why this is so highly regarded - its not a pleasant or interesting story in any way. It's like it was created by straight people who have only read about gay people in novels.The cinematics are pure Wong Kar-wai -but even these seem dated and trite. Seem on WKW film, seen 'em all...Even when it came out in 1997, it probably felt dated - but in 2023... its just seems hateful and hurtful, Do not be suckered by the high rating this film has. It is worth almost nothing.",

Was it boys being boys or does it cement their masculinity etc?Of course the artistic attributes are undeniable. The film is somewhat a series of photography, every scene is composed that way.This is art you can touch without digging up the gold. In other words, you don't have to be a digger.The soccer scenes will remain with me.But, if one really wants to make the tall claim that this is love, I am confused.Can you imagine a straight couple knocking each other off this way without being taken to the court for domestic abuse? Why show it in Gay films, then? Are gays more prone to abuse each other?I don't mind much about the debauchery 'cause that is an accurate picture of the Gay world, although it doesn't have to be.But for most of the film, it looked like the director was out of ideas what to fill up the scenes with (in terms of storyline, not artistry) & he just chose different forms of violence, mindless abuse and tantrums.",

            "content": "From Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai,the writer and director of the highly regarded CHUNG KING EXPRESS (CHONGQING SENLIN), comes HAPPY TOGETHER (CHEUN GWONG TSA SIT). HAPPY TOGETHER tells the story of a gay Chinese couple in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who are anything but happy. The story, to the extent there is any, consists of a series of vignettes about their petty fights.In this two person drama Leslie Cheung Kwok-Wing plays Ho Po-Wing and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai plays Lai Yiu-Fai. Leslie was last seen in TEMPTRESS MOON (FENG YUE) and Tony in CYCLO (XICH LO). Both are quite capable actors, but the parts they are given in HAPPY TOGETHER almost dares the audience to care. Their lifeless performances are right in line with Wong's dreadfully dull screenplay.Although the movie contains some of the most graphic homosexual scenes I've encountered, the actors present no passion or love during them with the result that the scenes are coldly antiseptic.Most of the movie has them arguing with each other, complaining about the lack of jobs in Argentina and living a life of poverty in their (literally) flea-bag room. Never is the narrative interesting and rarely are the characters the least bit compelling.The picture has a single saving grace. The cinematography by Christopher Doyle punctuates the otherwise uninvolving scenes with fascinating images. Although Doyle's work in HAPPY TOGETHER is not nearly as good as his stunning work in TEMPTRESS MOON, he enlivens an otherwise tedious picture. Using both oversaturated black-and-white sequences and lush color ones, he keeps the audience's attention even when the story doesn't. One evocative scene has our two lonely leads stranded on the highway. Shooting from a distance, the black-and-white highway seems as infinite as Tony and Lai's troubles. Another scene is shot from high above the city streets. Using color at night and a strobe effect, the cars dart around the turns like colored rats in a maze.\"Turns out that normal people are all the same,\" concludes Lai. Similarly, the movie HAPPY TOGETHER has a dreary sameness to each of its vignettes, only the handsome cinematography saves it from being an unwatchable, boring film.HAPPY TOGETHER seems to go on forever but its running time is actually only 1:37. The picture is in Cantonese with Chinese and English subtitles. The film is not rated but would get an R for nudity, profanity, violence and graphic sex. The film is not appropriate for teenagers.",
