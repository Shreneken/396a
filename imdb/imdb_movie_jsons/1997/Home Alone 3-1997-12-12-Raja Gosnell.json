            "content": "I don't think the film is as bad as the rating suggests, but it does pale in comparison to the first two films, which are holiday classics to me! There were some bits I liked, but some bits where improvements would have been appreciated.The positives are that Alex D Linz makes a cute and charming lead, though Macaulay Culkin is definitely better. The film does look lovely, and there is evidence of some detailed direction. And the parrot was awesome. Believe me, this film is much better than the vomitous Home Alone 4.The negatives are that some of the violence, that was classic in the first two films, seemed to have been reduced to cartoon slapstick. Another problem was that I didn't recognise any of the characters, and the uneven script didn't allow them to develop properly. Also, I do miss the antics of the Wet Bandits, the new villains weren't as effective.All in all, a perfectly adequate, but uneven film, that is much better than its abysmal follow up. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Home Alone 3 has a lot of unfair criticism. I mean, how many of you would really have wanted a 16-year-old Mac Culkin doing the same-old same-old to Harry and Marv. Of course it was a better idea to do in a different direction and with John Hughes still producing and writing you know there's going to be a good amount of imagination and creativity.This time around we have 8-year-old Alex Pruitt defend his house against international criminals. Stuck at home with Chicken Pox with both his parents tied-up in work matters, Alex suspects foul play on his snowy street when he witnesses strangers poking around in his neighbor's house. Of course, no one believes an imaginative 8-year-old so he has to deal with them himself.It turns out that a toy car Alex got from the old-lady across the street is actually a Trojan horse to smuggle a priceless defence microchip to the North Korean mob. They really ought to hire better criminals as they fall for every one of Alex's sadistic booby-traps.Yes, that is basically the whole plot but it gets enough mileage out of it and it's still very funny. Set in January, it lacks the Xmas feel of the first two, but I guess that would have just been a distraction. John Williams' theme only gets a brief recital at the start, but from then on it's an adequate (if not exceptional) score from Hans Zimmer pal Nick Glennie-Smith. Despite these key differences of characters and theme, it still feels like it has enough continuity with the others.It's a totally worthwhile and enjoyable sequel that has a bad rep for no reason. Home Alone 4 on the other hand...now THAT is BAD!",

A mixup at airport security leaves Mrs. Hess with the microchip hidden in a remote control car. After Alex shovels Mrs. Hesses' driveway, she gives him the car as payment. The spies have tracked the chip to Alex's neighborhood, and faces off against Alex who is home sick with the chicken pox.I like the cat and mouse game, but the premise is way too serious. It's not so kid friendly to start. But this is not a horrible sequel. The fact is the kid isn't Macaulay. And the movie doesn't have as much whimsy as the previous two. The bad guys are real bad guys, not the silly Wet Bandits.For those of us who want to see Scarlett Johansson, she has a minor role as the sister. It's nothing special to write home about. She does have a few scenes.",

            "content": "Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style.I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie.The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who \"torment\" him. Another flaw was the actual \"home alone\" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure!6/10",

            "content": "Home Alone 3 caught a bad rap because it has not connection at all with the previous movies with Macaulay Culkin. This should not have been called Home Alone 3, but something else. I wouldn't go so far as to calling it the best in the series, but I do stand by this having the best storyline.The general premise about a little kid being home alone and creating booby-traps to catch the bad guys is the exact point of the first two, but it's what's beneath the surface that is the best. A group of bad guys steal an Air Force computer chip and must deliver it to a North Korean terrorist organization. They hide it in a remote control car where it is unintentionally picked up by a retired lady headed to suburban Chicago. Hr taking the bag was unrealistic; in an airport, who doesn't check to see if they have their own bag? Everybody knows some luggage look alike! She gives the car to her 8-year-old neighbour, Alex (Dinz) who just came down with the chicken pox. The thieves get the whereabouts of the neighbourhood, but break into each house hoping to find the car. Alex is home alone and sees the thieves through his telescope and calls the police. Everybody thinks he's crying wolf, but Alex is determined to catch the thieves once and for all. The thieves want to search in the daytime because they know everybody is either at school or working. What if there's people like Alex sick home from school? Or retirees? Then the place not believing Alex is also a bit unrealistic. He notices odd things happening in the neighbourhood ontop of intruders. The thieves are obviously experts, so wouldn't the cops work to plant hidden cameras or something like that? When it goes to classic Home Alone, the traps and slapstick comedy is just as great (sometimes greater) than the first two. Sure there's some unrealistic traps, but the first two had them also. Maybe it is just because I am a 90s kid, but I don't get why this is hated. Alex is just as good a Kevin, the thieves are cool, the story is better than the others. Home Alone 4 and 5 are the bad ones. I mean reeeeaaally bad.3/4",

If this was a stand alone film, it probably would've been better received.\nEither way, I think its a great film. The plot, the actors, the acting, the comedy, the scenes, all were good.(P.S.

Linz playing Alex Pruitt, but the good news is that this is actually a good film. The new idea is that he is left at home on purpose, looking after himself. Four criminals, Mr. Beaupre (Olek Krupa), Mr. Jernigan (Lenny Von Dohlen), Mr. Unger (David Thornton) and Alice Ribbons (Rya Kihlstedt), have stolen a computer chip that goes into a missile. They put it into a toy car and accidentally swap bags. The kid has now got the car and is now defending himself with new goofy and dangerous booby traps set for cartoon like comedy. Also starring Haviland Morris as the Mum, Karen, Kevin Kilner as the Dad, Jack, Marian Seldes as Mrs. Hess, Seth Smith as Stan, and a young Scarlett Johansson as Molly.

            "content": "This is NOT part 3 of \"Kevin's Adventures\", but rather a brand new \"home Alone\" situation. The setting is still suburban Chicago during the Christmas season, the family is still \"upper middle class\", and even the theme music is very similar to the predecessors. This time, however, the \"kid\" is NOT abandoned by his entire family who took off for their Christmas Vacation. This time our pint sized hero is left unattended only for hours at a time, while he is at home and sick with the measles. A gang of foreign spys is after a top secret multi-million dollar computer chip stolen from the US Air Force. Of course, they hide it in a battery-operated toy that ends up with \"the kid\". Although the \"boobie trap\" routine could be viewed as just another rip-off from the first two films, the \"gags\" seem a bit more sophisticated and less forced in \"3\". The mere fact that our hero is not dealing with \"wet bandit idiots\" this time around makes the whole show less of a \"kiddie circus\". The third running is also leaving out the mushy side plots which would've gotten tiresome by now. All in all this is a fun show for the whole family. I showed this film to my 4th grade class and they gave it 20 thumbs up. Not for the \"grown-up\" comedy critic, but definitely a winner with kids.",

            "content": "As a kid Home Alone one and two were absolutely iconic classics, and I knew that they went ahead and butchered it with two unrelated sequels. It was two am, my fianc\u00e9 and I were tired and bored and we were hanging out and suddenly the movie started and fifteen minutes later we were smiling, and a half hour later we were chuckling at the sheer stupidity and craziness and silliness. Maybe this review will be biased by the late hour but while Home Alone 3 doesn't hold a candle to the original films for its key demographic which is likely young, young kids...eight to ten perhaps I think it hits its mark. With virtually no big names in the film it has to rely on the other aspect of the Home Alone franchise which is slapstick comedy, kiddie hi-jinks and ridiculously painful pranks that are taken like Wile Coyote. This film has plenty of that. Ironically the amazing late John Hughes did indeed pen the script for this film as silly as it is. The plot is barely that but Home Alone never relied heavily on any sort of plot. You watch it to see the above listed things. Home Alone 3 is sillier, kiddier, but still entertaining.Alex Linz headlines the cast as the vivacious youngster with ideal traps and toys. Linz is probably the perfect hero for the younger crowd. He doesn't exactly have enormous chemistry but he's cute and does a good job as the antagonist to the bad guys. Character actor Olek Krupa takes the role of head bad guy from the likes of Joe Pesci and the character is not entirely different. He is kind of a quiet dark brooding bad guy, seems out of place in a light fluff piece like this but maybe that makes his role work. He pulls off the silly comedy very well. Rya Kihlstedt does a good job playing the only lady baddie. She probably gets some of the best pranks and traps played on her. Lenny von Dohlen is the half witted bad guy and fills the shoes of Daniel Stern but loosely because something all three bad guys have in common Krupa, Kihlstedt, and Dohlen have very little character or plot. At least Pesci and Stern were fun characters with a story. This is just entirely about torturing the silly bad guys because kids don't care if the bad guys are people with a story. They are adults that are trying to ruin a kid's fun.This was directors Raja Gosnell's first entry into directing and he seems to be doing well currently having directed some solid family films and hopefully will exceed expectations at bringing The Smurfs to the big screen. He focuses on the comedy though I think and not necessary character development which works better for kiddie comedies than actual mainstream films. Still if you want to watch a silly movie with your kids you could do worse than Home Alone 3 but whatever you do, don't even begin to hold this in the same breath as either of the first Home Alone films which became a holiday comedy classic. This one is just cute. 6/10",

Meanwhile, Alex (Alex D. Linz) is a darling youngest child who, after working for an older neighbor lady, doesn't get paid in money. Instead, she got a remote controlled car delivered to her by mistake and she gives this as payment. Bummer. At home, Alex feels itchy and goes to the bathroom, where, after seeing his reflection, starts screaming. His older brother and sister (Scarlett Johanssen) immediately begin razzing him for what they believe he is screaming about. But, no, its chicken pox. Since mother and father work, Alex will be alone at times, with the neighbor lady keeping an eye on him. This is just the moment the four thieves come into the area, pretending to dogwalk and jog in order to find the package. Inside, you see, is a valuable microchip they could sell for mucho bucks. All too soon, when Alex starts playing with the car, they know what house they want. Will Alex be able to do what Kevin McAlister did and foil the evil adult criminals? This cute third installment of the Home Alone movies has a darling child in Linz and some funny thieves. Watch out for Johanssen, future superstar, as a teen actress. The sets and costumes are great, too. The script, which is indeed from John Hughes, has some funny lines and ideas. But, in truth, how many times can we see the bumbling adults fall into a child's booby traps? Imaginative are the ideas, yes, but they go on and on to almost excess.

The new score is quite bad(though the new \"setting traps\" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. It (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it's still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). The fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that isn't the first time in the series). It's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I could follow it, but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. I recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 3/10",

He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. The kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots?

The main reason why I and probably many others don't like it at first is simple- because we're comparing it to the first two movies.This is NOT a sequel, and it's not a remake either. The characters and story are completely different, so when you compare it to the previous movies and try to treat it as one of them, it's only natural to be unhappy with it. But when you treat it as something different, something new, rather than as part of a series, it's really quite good. There is really only one major thing that it has in common with the others, and that is that they all involve a kid setting up a bunch of traps to stop criminals. But the traps too, are different in many ways, often more complex, and the way they end is almost the opposite from the other movies. I would just about guarantee that if it had been given a different name and was treated as a new movie, rather than as the 3rd in the series, it would have had a significantly higher rating.When I treat it as something different, I enjoy it a lot, probably almost as much as the first two, and in some ways more. Some parts of it are not very realistic, but it's a lot of fun. And some parts are a bit frustrating, but in the end it all works out well. It's really one of those movies that gets better each time you see it.",

Its a common enough technique, this bit about shifting frames of reference, and he wasn't the first. Dr. Suess comes to mind with kids and naturally we have the root of science fiction.But Hughes hit a spot that was so sweet because the target frame of reference he chose was one we all have experienced. In fact, he chose only elements of pre-adulthood that were so simple the viewer didn't even have to reminisce. You can trace his own path in this. Over time he became an adult assaulting the world of children.And over time, the child in us started to fight back, because after a certain point we won't tolerate having our past stolen. We know we are unique. We know each time he uses our past as a generic wrapper it becomes homogenized with millions of other childhoods. So we choose to repel the invader.That's what makes these home alone movies so fascinating. He gets into a self-referential loop where the charm isn't about how successfully the adult invades the adolescent, but how successfully the child repels it.The problem is that as time goes on, even though these become more interesting virtual biography of the curse of writing, these become less interesting as amusements.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

It's a pretty bland family comedy typical of the 1990s, aided by a cute child actor in the lead but ultimately brought down by poor slapstick and villains who are so incompetent that they make the Wet Bandits look like Hannibal Lecter. And these are criminals affiliated with North Korean terrorists!The problems with the slapstick in HOME ALONE 3 are 1) the whole sequence goes on WAY TOO LONG and 2) the traps and pratfalls are so cartoony that they don't seem to cause the victims any pain. Harry and Marv's reactions to the booby traps, bricks, and flamethrowers in the first two were vital to why the slapstick worked (heck, even Tom and Jerry understood this-- see Tom's scream). The bad haircut brigade here aren't half as amusing, since they never seem to react properly to being hit and electrocuted and whatnot.On the whole, I found the movie forgettable.",

I'll start with the films flaws, the tone seems to be all over the place. From dealing with terrorists to incredibly goofy humor, it just doesn't mix well some of the time. There is also just a few moments that are just too dumb to be believable, although I will say, there was never quite a dull moment in this film. It's incredibly entertaining, on par on that level at least with the first and second films. The drection certainly seems to be off, but Hughes has written a pretty smart script, and a decently compelling character to go off of. Sure it's not the same thing you have seen before, but thats why its enjoyable. Wouldn't you be tired of Macaulay Culkin running around for a third time? He sure was, in fact he even denied to return to the franchise for this film. His replacement though, Alex D. Linz, who also ironically plays the character of Alex is more than up for the job though, and is truly the best part of this film. Not only is he the best part, but also the reason it works so well, he's a genius, and it is just fun to see him poke fun at everything on screen. The antagonists were pretty generic, and the side plot of their characters felt incredibly out of place, with some weirdly dark moments kinda obscured by the film's central nature. In the end though, Home Alone 3 is more than a decent time at the movies, and is certainly an underrated delight to enjoy this holiday season.\nMy Rating: 7.5/10",

All of the actors and actresses do a great job in this, especially the Pruitt family; you can really feel the family dynamic that they have in this. The crooks each have their own personalities; my favourite is Burton Jernigan as he adds plenty of funny dialogue to this film.

If anything, it's a breath of fresh air (be it as cold as it is). The main character's Alex rather than Kevin which's not a bad choice because Alex's likable maybe even more so than Kevin. The main villains are more competent and threatening yet still bumbling. If there's one thing that didn't make sense it was how Alex's mother kept leaving home alone despite him calling the cops twice and no one believing him.The parrot in this movie is a trip as are the traps. Really, some of them look like they'd be fatal if they were used in real life. One thing that's a welcome addition is the grouchy neighbor who starts out as stern and uptight but gradually reveals her soft spot to Alex after he rescues her from getting tied up in the garage. To sum it all up, the movie's not bad though it's not a classic in any way like the first 2. It's better than the later sequels as they were horrible but that's a story for another review.",

Maculay No-Talent can mug and scream all he wants, but right down to it, he's irritating !! Alex D. Linz is the funniest thing under four feet tall that I have ever seen. His facial expresssions, quirks and grimaces are hilarious for me to watch, but there is a leap of logic on how he can get so many complicated booby traps ready on time or how he can keep abreast of four so-called deadly terrorists. From his \"Rear Window\" perspective, he watches them through the neighborhood, keeps them on a merry chase and turns them into bumbling idiots with a little smile and a lot of charm. I also have to mention that Rya Kihlstedt, the actress/wife \"Ally McBeal's\" Gil Bellows, who plays the female terrorist is a mega-babe with her black hair and blue eyes. There's too many blondes running loose in Hollywood. This is such a departure from the unlikely premises of the first two movies inasmuch as Alex plays a bored kid stuck at home and not one overly and conveniantly misplaced. I can still see the fourth one in the series coming with Pesci and Stern: \"This isn't Kevin. This brat won't have a house full of booby traps waiting for us!\"",

This third installment oozes with something else other than charm. Everything that was great about the first two HA movies is absent from this movie. Not to mention that the story is much different than the first two.Plot: Some hi-tech crooks hide a microchip inside of a remote-controlled toy car. During their time in the airport, their luggage gets switched with the luggage of the crotchety middle-aged woman that lives next door to the Pruitt family. The crooks realize that their luggage has been swapped with the old woman and finds out where she lives. On arrival they meet up with the snotty scamp Alex who realizes something is wrong with them and plans to thwart them while his mother is away.Opinion: After reading the plot, you already know that this has nothing to do with the MCcallister family. That is the least of its problems. What was fresh in the first two HA movies is now mundane. Every gag is the same: people get bonked upside the head with things and fall down. Alex D. Linz is about as bland as tofu. As a matter of fact, the whole cast is about as bland as tofu. The wisecracking parrot has more personality than these cardboard cutouts in this movie. The crooks made Harry and Marv look like geniuses. Did I forget to mention that this movie is lethally dull? Plus this movie is missing what made the first two great: Heart. This movie is emotionally distant like Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter's character in Fight Club). Nothing about this movie is redeemable. It's all routine. You've seen it all before done better. Home Alone 3 and 4 are classic examples of \"milking the cow\". If you love this \"movie\" you love these: BABY GENIUSES, SUPERBABIES: BABY GENIUSES 2, ED, ARE WE DONE YET, HONEY WE SHRUNK OURSELVES and PROBLEM CHILD 2.",

At that time, I didn't fully understand all of those dialogues. But when I grew up, I watched it again. The feeling is the same, but the difference is that I understand all of those dialogues. It makes the film more interesting and more. Also, I become to love this film more and more.What I love the most is how Alex captured those bad guys. He's very clever. I wish I had a brother like him or in some day, a child like him. Too bad that his parents (especially, his own mother) didn't believe him. I know that it's because the story needs to go on, so, they make his family not to believe what he says. But in the real world, it shouldn't be. Even if the other family members don't believe him, a mother should always believe him no matter what. A mother should always on the children's side no matter what. So, I don't like Alex's mother doesn't believe him.All in all, Home Alone 3 might be a junk or whatever to other people, as for me, it is one of the best films and also one of my favourites.

The criminals are arch-villains instead of low rent cat burglars, the booby traps are next level, over elaborate funhouse nightmares instead of the blunt simplicity of paint cans on ropes, and generally the vibe strives for bigger, crazier, more more more. It actually works on its own outlandish terms, with a healthy helping disbelief suspension. The film seems to take place either in some parallel offshoot dimension where the Macaulay Culkin stuff never existed, because let's be real, how many time could such events happen in one country. Either that or they just expect us to believe that this could keep happening to the same family again and again like some hilarious purgatorial curse, which is actually an amazing concept now that I've spelled it out. Anywho, the kid this time is young Alex Linz, whose family has routinely left him home alone, and he has unwittingly come into the possession of a super top secret weapons grade microchip hidden in a toy car. The quartet of criminals searching for it are led to his neighbourhood, and wouldn't you know it, an endless tirade of ultra-violent, slapstick, severely booby trapped shenanigans ensue. The pranks and pratfalls here are seriously convoluted and freakishly well timed, not to mention brutal enough to be borderline horror movie material and so over the top you'd need a team of stuntmen just to get em' on paper. The silly kid even uses a John Deere tractor to set up a giant trampoline/swimming pool snare. Sequels always feel the need to ramp up everything past eleven on the dial though, and this one cranks it til the speakers blow. Surprisingly, the villains are played by a distinctive and competent bunch of character actors, namely Olek Krupa, John Thornton, Lenny Von Dohlen and Rya Kihlstedt, interesting folks who can usually be found in obscure indie fare and off the wall projects. They get pummelled nearly to death here, by everything from electricity, nail guns, turpentine, murderous rogue lawn mowers, firecrackers and one psychotic parrot with attitude to spare. It's one entertaining blitzkrieg though, like the first two Home Alone flicks on crack. Oh, and Scarlett Johansson has an early career role as the kid's sassy sister too.",

The main difference is that this kid (Alex D. Linz) isn't as 'movie-smart' as Macaulay Culkin. Also the violence is marginally less cruel. On the downside, Joe Pesci's manic energy is sorely missing and the film quickly runs out of ideas. As a family film, this is a decent watch but otherwise, a rather average film.Overall 4/10",

It's the cream of the crop, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.First off, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff.The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once, rather, I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird, rather than providing comic relief, was unfunny and annoying.The acting, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well, that's it.I can see some people saying: \"Man, it's for the kids. Don't dis it, man.\" Well MAN, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! So in short, this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is, it completely insults the first two as well. No human, kid or otherwise, should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's THAT bad.0/5 stars",

They missed the point, however. Home Alone converged a set of unlikely yet plausible nightmarish premises and played them out delightfully; Home Alone 2 succeeded by stretching those premises to the limits for parody's sake and inserting clever references at every turn as a kind of tribute to its predecessor.Home Alone 3, on the other hand, turns on the convergence of one completely uninteresting premise--a kid home alone sick from school--and one completely thoughtless premise--an international terrorist conspiracy. Dissecting such highbrow criminals is perhaps not a task within these filmmakers' abilities, but we never know, because they don't even try. But if the villains are bad, the protagonists are even worse: cardboard-cutouts, clich\u00e9d \"baby geniuses\" and greedy bullies, ultimately unsympathetic all around. The conclusion is predictable and contrived, and by then any will to care about these dummies has long since run out.There is no excuse for this. Every member of the original Home Alone cast was cleverly shown to be human, even at their most stylized and most disgraceful points, including the antagonists. Home Alone 3 does not belong in its namesake's franchise. It is an unoriginal, implausible, shameful capitalization.

But it was never going to work with a different child actor and this and the subsequent films in the series are huge disappointments. I do sympathise with Alex Linz because any actor would have struggled taking over from the hugely popular Macauley Culkin.

And at the risk of filling my humble criticism of negative votes I will try to defend, as I can, because it is unnecessary (that is undeniable) third part can be entertaining despite its failures.The story moves away from the McCallister family to present us with a new headline by Alex Pruitt, the new rogue who will pass them on to the bad guys on duty. And it turns out that at the hands of the child comes a toy car with a military chip that high-level thieves want to get at any price. And, as always, Alex will defend his house ... also at the same price. Oh, and it's Scarlett Johansson's sister, almost nothing.Well, when the synopsis is made, the question is: does the movie have fun? Well, in my opinion, of course, as long as you do not have anything better to do, you can enjoy (not laugh out loud, that was in the first two) of this third part. Alex D. Linz I think it plays a good role as a substitute for the original Kevin, I found it funny and nice but it is normal that the shadow of Macaulay is very long. On the other hand this third part has something that improves with respect to his second that no one seems to value: he tries to differentiate himself from the previous ones by putting different situations (Alex is not alone in his house although nobody believes there are thieves lurking) as well as traps totally original Do they make fun? Fair, but the formula is pretty exhausted. But remember that the great evil of his (in my opinion good but somewhat overrated) second part was to be a copy of his predecessor, here does not happen the same, is more original within what fits.For the rest, the film does not give much more than if because, as I said, it is already very seen and it is hard to laugh at something you already know. The family of Alex are quite flat and do not give tender moments but where the film fails miserably is on the subject of the villains. And with better villains, maybe the movie would have been better valued. Now there are not two, but four thieves, but more does not mean better. They are excessively serious and boring, characters identical to each other so their personality is not marked, no doubt you miss the funny Harry and Marv of the first two parts.Finally I will give another reason why I approve this movie: \"Home Alone 4\". And I have had the \"luck\" to have seen this insult (not only the saga, but the cinema in general) in the form of a quarter before the third. Given the level of slop that the saga arrives with the 4, I can not but raise a little this third part that is infinitely better.Conclusion, an unnecessary third part but I think you can see, if you do not kill this saga, stay with the first two (especially the original), if you like the tricks of these children, you can give this third party a chance . But stay there, hell really starts from now on.",

Same thing--kids loved it, adults didn't. This one I was trapped into seeing with all adults. They actually seemed to like it. The appeal of this is beyond me. The comedy is extremely violent--makes the Three Stooges look subdued. Also the bobby traps this 9 year old kid sets up are impossible for ANY kid to do! I found the movie sick and sadistic and didn't even crack a smile once. Also some of the \"hilarious\" things that happen to the terrorists would kill any person immediately. Also Linz does the impossible--his acting was so bad he makes Macaulay Culkin look like Laurence Olivier! But if you liked the first two you'll probably like this.",

This film is better than the first two (I'm not saying that the first two were bad; they were classics in my opinion), for several reasons. For one thing, we see that the kid is not left home alone unintentionally. They had a good reason (actually several), and yeah chicken pox can be serious. For another thing, we have not two criminals, but four, and they really know what they're doing throughout 95% of the film (until the traps are set off). Olek, Rya, Lonny, and David really put character into their roles. We have a believable plot, whereas a kid with the chicken pox finds that he has to protect a missile chip from international thieves who are working for a terrorist organization. Alex (as Alex) delivered, and the traps were well put together and very clever. The last scene was funny too, where the main aftermath for the criminals was chicken pox. Kudos to the crew of the film.9/10",

Whether he was forced or not I don't know.Clearly, Macaulay Culkin was too old so they had to find fresh blood. An entirely different family, still in Chicago, is the subject of this movie. The mother is still a redhead, there's a brother that looks very Buzz-like, Scarlett Johansson plays the sister, but they made the new little boy look different so as to say, \"This is not the same Home Alone.\" And it wasn't. It was worse.This rendition was missing the key ingredients that made the first one so beloved. First and foremost it's no longer original. Home Alone is one of those movies that once you've done it there is not sense in doing it again. You can only redo the same schtick so many times.In order to elicit a positive response they decided to amplify everything. Now there are four bandits instead of two. Now the stakes are so much higher. The fate of humanity is in the hands of this kid because he has the missile guidance chip they want. And now the kid is so much more gifted. If Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) can be considered brilliant because of his booby traps, then Alex (the kid in this one) is Mensa level smart.Everything was so much better when it was just a resourceful kid that set traps for two opportunistic burglars. Alex Pruitt (Alex Linz) is a curious boy that is wise beyond his years. While he's home sick with the chicken pox he plays neighborhood watch with his telescope, his streaming video camera (as if there was streaming from a camcorder in '97), and other gadgets. After he uncovers a team of burglars it's all on him to take them down.The kid is not Macaulay, the burglars aren't Pesci and Stern. This movie sullied the Home Alone name.",

To make sure they pass the security measures in the Chicago Airport, the skillfully burglars of the most sophisticated security systems hide the microchip in a toy car. The only problem is that the toy, hiding a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars gets accidentally at the sullen Mrs. Hess which has a weakness for her eight year old neighbor, the naughty Alex Pruitt. Not knowing what to do, the four thieves decide to break into all the houses on Mrs. Hess's street to find the chip, although they are starting to believe that there are big chances that the lost object is in the Pruitt's house. Alex tells his family that he has seen dangerous delinquents on their street, but because he has a rich imagination, nobody believes him. So, he is left home alone while all the family members are gone with business. But Alex isn't vulnerable without his family by his side. Even though he is only eight years old, only when he's left alone he becomes a real danger for the ones who break into his property. The four burglars have what to fear from: Alex has prepared for their visit. A child with a little paint and some household objects (all used to protect his toy from getting stolen) can get even the American Navy into trouble.For the third \"Home Alone\" movie, Alex D. Linz replaced Macaulay Culkin, which did a quite good job having the lead role. The other actors are Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny van Dohlen, David Thornton. The responsible for the script and play is Raja Gosnell, the director of \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2\".I personally enjoyed the movie and I have seen it many times, although it is not as good as the first one, and no one can be better that Macaulay Culkin.

Linz was able to carry this movie, and he did it again in \"Max Keeble's Big Move\".I'll be honest I re-watched this because \"Hot Ones\" mentioned Scarlett Johansson was in it, and I couldn't remember that. She has a bit role, but even back then (possibly unrefined, the role didn't have a lot to work with) she was a big personality in a small role. She has one, brief, powerful scene that would really be worth remembering: most of it is the messing up the burglars.This has a very different vibe than the first 2 movies. While Kevin was isolated and unable to get help, Alex starts by doing everything right to get help, but no one believes him so he feels forced to \"do the right thing\". However it manifests in almost a psychotic fashion.Of course, almost everything that happens in this movie should kill someone, but doesn't. It also had a very easy out: at any time Alex could give the chip up, and it would be over, the bad guys leave the country: he's heavily volunteering for this carnage. Kevin was being targeted, he saw their faces and was actually defending himself and his home because the \"wet bandits\" were coming for HIM.Ultimately it's fun and charming, and interesting what the limits of technology were back in 1997 with cellphones and pagers, RC cars with block long range, but not wireless cameras, but remote control gizmos that can turn on the neighbors tv.The biggest problem I have with it is that his brother's bird is basically as smart a person, having conversations, and taking bribes (or insisting on being paid at least), and the worst bit is that I know there are people with birds as smart as that. I'm not sure if it would be a Conure, but I don't deal in parrots.That said, it's not overly hilarious, it's not bad, but it's just not great either.",

Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.\u00a0Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.\u00a0As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.\u00a0He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris.The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.\u00a0In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.\u00a0At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.\u00a0The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.\u00a0That means they will have to search them all one by one.Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.\u00a0The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.\u00a0Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.\u00a0Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.\u00a0We'll see.",

So i would say all the Home Alone films are worth a watch, well the first 3 are, Home Alone 4, is the typical sequel, just made to make money and i doubt it made much,you can tell that one was not written by John Hughes, but still you might enjoy the 4th one, spend a day in watching Home Alone and don't forget the popcorn!",

Linz, Hoviland Morris, Seth Smith, David Thornton, Olek Krupa: It was bad enough that Home Alone 2 was a Xeroxed copy of Home Alone but Home Alone 3 is a Xerox of a Xerox. A chip has been planted in a toy to make it past airport security but the wrong person picks it up and it ends up in Chicago. The villains seeking the chip are spotted by young Alex D. Linz but police do not buy his story. The parents exists for the purpose of going to work while Linz booby traps the house in wait for the villains. Linz owns a mouse and a parrot that act upon his every command and this is stupid in itself in its dreadful presentation. The mouse crawls up someone's leg while someone else takes a swing at it with a crowbar. No points in guessing where the impact connects. Director Raja Gosnell provides the same story with absolutely no originality. He just adds a couple more crooks. Linz recites Macaulay Culkin and nobody cares. In lame appearances are Hoviland Morris, Seth Smith, and David Thornton who will likely not gain any recognition from this sh*t stain holiday crap. The crooks are four without the name actors wasting their talent looking stupid on camera. If you have seen Home Alone then you have seen Home Alone 3 and if you have seen Home Alone 3 then you have my deepest sympathy. Score: 1 / 10",

            "content": "The biggest detriment to this film is the absence of it's predecessors' cast and crew. The decision to call it Home Alone 3 is also slightly baffling, in that it bears zero connection to the previous duology. Although, from a sales point of view, what else were they gonna call it? Dealing with such a nostalgic pair of movies in Home Alone's 1 & 2, everyone in or around those productions has become iconic, and near and dear for the hearts of devout fans. On it's own steam, could this movie justify itself or leave any such legacy?Well, John Hughes wrote this movie. Can you believe that? Can't get any closer to home, Jeez that works well here, without the guy who started it all... But the script is not top-form here by any means. There's a couple of lines here and there where you still stop and go, man, he was a good writer. Early on, one of the baddies (of which there are now 4) Earl Unger (David Thornton) remarks wryly to his colleagues; \"When I was in the John, I didn't see anything\", in regards to a misplaced microchip capable of removing missiles from Air Defence radar. This whole Government espionage plot is all well and good, and props to John Hughes for figuring out a new angle after seemingly going all-out in Part II. The four antagonists, including a female this time round, are all great actors, but unfortunately aren't given enough to do, individually. Lenny von Dohlen in particular is such a talent, gone to waste here. Olek Krupa delivers charisma and terrific sinister intent as the group's leader, Peter Beaupre, and gets the most time to shine out of all of them. Our hero in Home Alone 3, Alex Pruitt, played by Alex D. Linz, is a perfectly admirable successor for Macauley Culkin. Both of these kids did such a good job, carrying the film for adult viewers while also giving the younger audiences a likeable character to root for. If it wasn't for Linz, the film wouldn't work as good, since he really proves to be a great little actor. There's no development for young Pruitt however. He doesn't learn much by the end of the film's runtime like Kevin McAllister did. His family, (Haviland Morris) the mother, (Kevin Kilner) the father, (Scarlett Johansson) the sister and (Seth Smith) the brother, all do a good job, but are certainly a downgrade from that huge assortment of McAllister's, who were each quirky and idiosyncratic in their own way. There's no Uncle Frank (Gerry Bamman) anymore, or Buzz (Devin Ratray).The first two movies I can picture anyone enjoying. Home Alone 3 is essentially a kids movie. The humour a lot of the time is directed towards a younger audience, and it's not just the slapstick. As a little tyke, I almost wet my pants watching Mr. Unger fall down a flight of stairs with the mega blocks trolleys attached to his feet. The traps sequence goes on for far too long here, leaning towards tedium. The final thirty-five minutes of the film are devoted to them. Worse yet, they aren't executed with the same level of skill of the previous two films. Former director Chris Columbus had an eye for the subtle choreography needed to make every boobytrap land. There are a few exceptions though. Mr. Jernigan (Dohlen) getting his ass electrocuted on the chair, Mr. Beaupre (Krupa) smashing his arm on the front door going \"wow, ow, ow\" and of course, Ms. Alice Ribbons (Rya Kihlstedt) \"smacking Mr. Jernigan's winky\" with a hockey stick, are all on the level of the first two films. That scene in particular, hitting the partner in crime because of a frightful creature, (a pet spider in the original and now a pet rat named Doris), somehow brings the series full circle. In an odd way, I'm kind of delighted that I can get to call this a trilogy, just cos of the novelty.I feel that people are far too critical of this sequel, due exclusively to their affectionate disposition to the preceding entries. For the first third of it's runtime, Home Alone 3 is actually rather enjoyable. When the same plot point occurs twice, (Alex calling the cops after witnessing one of the intruders), the overall pacing of the film slows down. The set-piece with the toy race car goes on for a little too long as well. It's a shame because prior to that, the movie is surprisingly engaging.Composer John Williams is replaced by Nick Glennie-Smith here, so already you're losing a bit of that magic from the first two. Nevertheless, there's a few good pieces, and the tunes \"Home Again\" by Oingo Boingo and \"My Town\" by Cartoon Boyfriend, are each memorable. This movie isn't set during Christmastime at all. Somehow rather unprecedentedly, it pulls off atmosphere. The late 90's, cold snowy U.S suburbia in January is immortalised on film.For all of these prior quibbles, I'm still happy that this movie even exists. Plans for Home Alone 3 date back to 'Lost In New York', when John Hughes had pitched doing them back-to-back, with the same cast and crew. Despite my undying enthusiasm towards such a prospect, I ask myself how many times could the McAllister's forget Kevin, or how many times could Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) fall for his same old tricks. Still, Chris Columbus and crew really made something special with the original two, and I reckon they could've pulled it off at least one more time...Home Alone 3 is still inherently a Home Alone movie. The premise is there. The slapstick, albeit forced at times, is there. I feel it can sit alongside the first two, but not too close. Kids will love it. I should know, I used to look up to this fictional Alex Pruitt kid...",

            "content": "My Take: Not as bad as reported, but its definitely worse than the first two. It's hard to separate John Hughes with the HOME ALONE formula, and there's a question of why. I mean HOME ALONE, while a decent and likable film with a high box-office count, wasn't THAT great. It's not worth seeing over and over again as \"different\" films. Hughes doing a sequel, HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK, was understandable, but why could he stop when even he knows the red-light is on. As producer, perhaps the blames on Hughes why there's a knife-wielding thug in the big-screen version of DENNIS THE MENACE. After that, he did BABY'S DAY OUT, which takes out the eight-year old kid and the two bumbling burglars and replaces them with a baby and the Three Stooges (actually, inspired by them). Doesn't he know when it's time to wrap it up? Actually no, as he produces (and writes) HOME ALONE 3, a second sequel to the already overused HOME ALONE formula. Actually, however, HOME ALONE 3 is slightly better than other HOME ALONE imitators, even if this one isn't far from being one itself. But for the record, I enjoyed HOME ALONE 3 more than see three full grown men and baby or a smarmy old thug matching wits with Dennis the Menace. Instead of bringing back Macaulay Culkin to play the kid, they probably felt that he (and the audience) have gone far too old for the role, so they instead settle for a much younger and juvenile Alex D. Linz, who actually makes a charming replacement which doesn't try to duplicate his predecessor. And instead of bringing back the two thugs, they settle for four more, and these time, their not Wet Bandits (or Sticky Bandits, whatever!). They're a couple of thieves searching for a microchip which they put inside a remote control car. Accidentally, they get their bags mixed up with an old lady (Marian Seldes), who then gives it to little Alex. So it's bad day for the thugs again, ain't it always? In comparison to its predecessors, HOME ALONE 3 is just another pale imitation. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",

One night he gets the chicken pox and has to stay home from school for a couple of days and his parents could not find anyone to babysit him so they just let him stay home alone. Meanwhile 4 james bond type villains lose a very powerful computer chip and they think someone who lives in alex's neighborhood has it in there house. Anywhoo Alex spots one of the criminals in one of his neighbors house and he calls the cops and they don't believe him so he has to take matters into his own hands and sets up booby traps for the four criminals. Not as funny or classic as the first 2 but It's tolerable but not really needed in the series but kids will enjoy it.

Heck, this film deserves it.ReviewI openly admit that many, many years ago I watched this movie and only made it to the first 10 minutes. I picked up the remote and went \"click\". I never thought about the movie again... Until Netflix streaming. I could not get over the biggest hurdle - the bar that Culkin, Pesci, and Stern firmly established. Home Alone 3 is an excellent case of overcoming the \"Real McCoy\" status most people assigned to Home Alone 1 and 2. Any sequel that succeeded these didn't stand a chance unless it was released 20+ years later. That is the principal failure with Home Alone 3. This winter Home Alone 3 was available on Netflix streaming. I thought, \"It's a lazy day. I'm stuck inside. Let's see if I get past 10 minutes.\" I ended up ROFLOL. I watched it 3 more times that week! Then, I started wondering why I didn't give it a chance many years ago. That's when I figured it out. Culkin, Pesci, and Stern are the Home Alone \"Dream Team\" combo. Any Home Alone production that immediately followed them was destined to have a tough time even if the master writer John Hughes penned it.It's like your favorite player or coach going to a new team. It does not mean your team is worthless. It means things change. New stars emerge. From a technical POV, I was struck by how much spatial integrity was used in this film. You saw crucial characters (the kid and criminals) in the same shots together. There were no cop-out techniques used like the customary cuts and close-ups that \"trick\" the viewers into believing scenes were shot together when they weren't. Spatial Integrity takes time to setup and achieve precision timing. Home Alone 3 actually surpasses Home Alone 1 & 2 in several ways.1. Alex, the kid, has an infectious laugh. 2. Alex is sheer fun to watch. I love Alex's attitude with the police come to his house to dress him down about false alarms, and when he gives the criminals an \"Ouch\" moment. This kid emotes very well!3. Alex is smarter. John Hughes established at the top of the film this kid is different. He enters and wins science competitions unlike Kevin. We are told Kevin is \"le incompetent.\" We don't know how he magically gets skills to take out criminals. And we don't care because we're LOL. After watching Home Alone 3, I started to wonder, \"How did Kevin know how to do all that stuff?!\" 4. These criminals are serious, skilled, and full of themselves. That's why it's even funnier that they \"get taken down by a toddler\". 5. Including a mouse and a talking and snoring parrot is brilliant.6. The supporting cast is better.7. And the story is superior. Thus, if you were like me many years ago that passed on this film, give it another chance. Don't compare it to the Dream Team productions. It's the ignored little brother or sister that has talent, which no one took the time to notice.",

            "content": "It's almost the Holiday Season, so a lot of us are going to want to watch Home Alone and Home Alone 2. It seems that after those films, movies with slapstick humor where a kid takes down adults haven't worked that well. Another film I reviewed which I prefer and it has a lot of similarities to the two Home Alone films is Blank Check which didn't do as well. They have since done 5 Home Alone movies, and while I agree that they didn't need 4 and 5, it seems like everybody's complaint is having a different kid in the Home Alone movies besides Macaulay Culkin, and different burglars besides Harry and Marv not wanting to give the other Home Alone movies a chance. I guess they didn't need to put the title Home Alone in them. Out of all the Home Alone movies that have been made, this one is like my favorite for a few reasons. I remember watching this film over and over as a kid. Let's think, you can watch the trailer and beginning of the movie, and it won't seem like a Home Alone movie, which is a common movie complaint. But, by all means the trailer and opening scenes are really cool. That being said, I like the criminals in this movie better than in any of the Home Alone movies, as the burglars are mostly cheesy in the other movies except Harry. This time, rather than burglars trying to rob houses they are terrorists looking for a computer chip in a neighborhood, for some kind of terror plot that is hard to understand. These 4 criminals are quite smart, and this time they use technology which is even incredible years later, as the prior Home Alone movies didn't show much technology, like no computer in their house or anything. The way these criminals work together as a team is astounding. Other things that make this movie better, one is I like Alex better than Kevin. Alex is a cute kid, and remembering the prior Home Alone films, we can remember how Kevin has a bad attitude, the way he talked to his mom and family in the beginning of the movie, would get a lot of us in trouble. Kevin seemed selfish wanting to spend a lot of time alone. Alex is a more likable kid, and seems like a more typical kid than Kevin, he is no where near as bratty or selfish. He also seems smarter, as Kevin didn't seem like a smart kid, only enough to set up traps. Alex seems like quite an intelligent kid and respectful. He is the only one in his neighborhood aware that houses are getting broken into, as the terrorists didn't leave behind any evidence of burglary. Alex is also more of a role model than Kevin, especially in a scene where Alex talks about taking action and becoming defensive. It sounds better than when Kevin said, \"This Is My House, I Have To Defend It.\" I also like Alex's neighborhood more than Kevin's, as I feel like his neighborhood is more of a typical middle class neighborhood, and in Alex's neighborhood all the houses look the same keeping the criminals from knowing which house the computer chip is in, while in Kevin's neighborhood, we only know of a couple of houses and it seems like the burglars are mostly after Kevin's house. I feel like Alex's family, is more of a typical family than Kevin's family. Rather than see a big family getting ready for vacation, this movie does not take place during Christmas, but early in January where we see his family and neighborhood in routine activities like work and school seeming like a realistic community. Mrs. Hess also seemed more like a typical neighbor than Old Man Marley or the Pigeon Lady. I also like the music in the movie, including the song \"My Town.\" Earlier today, I listened to that song on YouTube and after hearing that empowering song and seeing a couple of comments from people who like this one better, I decided to write a review for this movie when I wrote one way back in 2003. I deleted that previous review. The movie does get a little cheesy when the action takes place changing the terrorists characters, by all means it is still a great movie. Some of us will love it and some will hate it, but seriously if it bothers you that it's a Home Alone movie you should overlook that. I give this movie a 9/10, it getting cheesy gives it a lower review but I really like this movie for my title of terrorists being in a neighborhood that seemed like any neighborhood. It's interesting to think of international terrorists in a typical neighborhood with an 8 year old boy.",

If you ask me, it's a pity no one would believe him the first time he said he saw the bad guys. When Mrs. Hess was tied up in the garage, I got a little uneasy. If you want to know why, you'll have to see the movie. In my opinion, the way the burglars looked at the end was absolutely hilarious! You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why I said that, too. In conclusion, I highly recommend this HOME ALONE that's really good to anyone who liked the first two. You're in a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. I guarantee you you're going to have a good time watching it.",

It was also the last movie in the series to actually play big screens.Terrorists Peter Beaupre (Olek Krupa), Alice Ribbons (Rya Kihlstedt), Burton Jernigan (Lenny Van Dohlen) and Earl Unger (David Thornton, the husband of Cyndi Lauper) have taken a million dollar microchip and hidden it in a remote control car that has been given as a gift by old Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) to new protagonist Alex Pruit (Alex D. Linz) when he shovels her driveway. You can guess what happens next, right?Home Alone 3 going to be made at the same time as Home Alone 2: Lost in New York but that idea didn't happen. There was also the idea to have Culkin to return as a teenage Kevin but that didn't occur either.An 11-year-old Scarlett Johansson is Alex's sister Molly which is, I guess, one thing to look out for while this movie just drags.

I can possibly see why. Because it claims to be a Home Alone film, and Kevin McCallister isn't even cameo-ed in this film. I understand that, but that shouldn't affect the rating that much. If it had a different title, I predict the ratings would go to more of a 6.5 stars average.So about the film, I love it! I recommend it head-on. The music pumps you up, the visuals are a little too white, but you can get used to that, the plot is odd, but its really fun to see it go, the bad guys are very dopey and funny to laugh at, they're supposed to be terrorists instead of just a couple of bandits like from the original Home Alones, the scenes with the parrot are entertaining because the parrot always has quotes to say, and the traps in this film are very violent like in Home Alone 2, but they're very funny traps yet they are extremely precise.Get off your chair and watch it!",

If only I saw a trailer, I'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and \"accidentally\" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to \"laugh\" at the \"funny\" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes.But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he write it as well?",

            "content": "Home Alone 3 is an absolute let down in every way imaginable. Even at its best, it feels like a cheap copy of the two previous films. It's unfunny, mostly boring, and has zero charm. Meaning it basically lacks everything that made Home Alone and Home Alone 2 good.One of the biggest problems, by far, is that this film is boring. For the first two-thirds of the film, nothing happens. It tries to create tension with a needlessly over the top spy plot that lacks any intrigue. The plot, which quite frankly is stupid, never once made me care about it. I had a hard time buying the idea behind it, and for that most part, it made zero sense. There are no heartwarming moments, nor are there any funny moments. It's a film filled with scene after scene of nothing. What's even worse is that this is supposed to be a Christmas film. However, apart from the snowy ground, there is no mention to anything even remotely related to Christmas. A holiday film's main goal is to give a Christmasy feel, Home Alone 3 didn't even try.The story, which thankfully doesn't follow the formula of the two earlier films in the series, is quite awful. Alex, the main protagonist, accidentally receives an incredibly dangerous computer chip, while internationally wanted spies are trying to hunt it down. The spies, who are of course quite dumb, end up facing Alex and all the traps that he has prepared for them and a battle, similar to the ones at the end of the previous films, commences. While that might sound interesting and entertaining on paper, the actual result is the exact opposite. And therein, lies Home Alone 3's biggest problem. It's never entertaining or funny. The end battle, which is the highlight of the two predecessors, is an unfunny and unimaginative copy. The traps rely on the home invaders to make stupid decisions to work, and the reactions that they give to being hit by them can't be compared to the ones given by Harry and Marv.The only redeeming factor I can come up with is that this film ditches the original characters. Had the main character been named Kevin, and the bad guys, Harry and Marv, this would've been even worse. At least now, it feels like it isn't part of the series despite its name. Which begs the question, why is this film even named 'Home Alone'? It has nothing to do with the first two films, and it follows a completely different framework. If I hadn't known that this film was called Home Alone 3, I would've never guessed that it's part of the series. I'm sure that the name brought a lot of money on its own, and that's probably what the people behind it were banking on. But, if you do call the film 'Home Alone', at least make the kid be home alone. The fact that he spends a couple of hours every day on his own doesn't really make it home alone. How hard could it be to come up with anything that would've forced him to be on his own? The atmosphere of this film never works because Alex's parents and siblings are in the house almost all the time.While this film is anything but great, I probably would've enjoyed it more had it not been part of the Home Alone series. However, because it is, I spent most of the time comparing it to two films that are superior in every way. This could've been an okay kids spy film had it been its own thing. Instead, it put all its eggs in one basket and hoped that the name and the battle sequence at the end would be enough to satisfy anyone watching. Unfortunately for Home Alone 3, those things didn't come even close to being enough.",

Linz (red Dragon), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Marian Seldes (The Haunting), Richard Hamilton (Pale Rider), Kevin Kilner (Raising Helen) and Olek Krupa (Hidden Figures).The storyline for this was kind of blah and not that great. The characters are okay but not as good as the previous two films. It was fun seeing a young Scarlett Johansson in this, but overall the cast isn't memorable.The parrot wasn't as funny as they hoped but the butt inspection gloves reference and the boobytraps and hijinks at the end were fun, though a bit too over the top.

(The only 'trap' that I liked in Home Alone 1 was when there was somebody at the door and Kevin used a tape to scare him off.

I have watched the previous two films (the latter I have on VHS), and this is as good as the films that preceded it. I watched this film on Channel Four a few days after Christmas and it was then I began to enjoy it again.It was with this film the series bowed out, as I believe that the fourth \"film\" (I put it in brackets as it is not a film in the conventional sense of the word) was an atrocity and not worth the time Twentieth Century Fox could have spent to make another film that year. This edition you should savour, as it all went downhill from that point onward.One must be reminded of the period the film was made in: it was 1997, when technology had advanced, and it was admirable that the film's producers took notice of it, with the storyline concerning the computer chip and the producers mentioned the political aspect of that storyline, what with the burglars working for a North Korean terrorist organisation. It is on this basis, I believe that the Home Alone series was also modernised.It is humorous and decently written, and these alone amount for any shortcomings it may have (had). That is why I think the film did it for me. So basically, if you think this film is bad, watch the following film instead. Then you will understand my stance.",

The acting in this film is also quite good, especially young Alex playing such a major role at his age, my favourite character in the film is Earl Unger, he's in my opinion the funniest of the gang, i'd love to see the crew back in home alone five trying to rob major electronical stores in Chicago, with Alex (who should make a return) getting in their way!I totally disagree with people who think this movie is a cheap cash-in considered to the rest of the series, i really like this film, it's very enjoyable and i strongly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any home alone film.",

            "content": "Having watched the first 2 Home Alone's when I was a Kid on VHS, I learned from friends that there were (then) 2 more Films in the Franchise & that they weren't any good. I somehow agreed, given that they also said it didn't follow the story of the first 2 & featured different families in them. Anyway, fast forward a few years & I was at a friends house & he had the whole including this film & Home Alone 4 on DVD. When I began to watch the 3rd film, I was actually pleasantly surprised...The film sees 8-Year-Old Alex Pruitt home alone with the Chicken Pox. Elsewhere, a group of International Criminals have recently lost a bag with a Remote Controlled Car containing a Micro Chip stolen from a military Defence Contractor that Alex just so happens to have in his possession. The International Criminals then start to break into each house in Alex's Neighbourhood, but with his family & the police not believing him, it is up to Alex to put a stop to these said criminals & recover the Chip.I found the film to be actually really, really good, if not better than the first 2 films. That's, by the way, not to say the first 2 films suck, because they don't, they're epic classics, don't get me wrong. But this film had better traps, a better story & a less annoying kid this time around.I also like the fact that it's not set during Christmas which like the change in direction overall, with the new family & child lead actor, was pretty refreshing. It's not badly paced & is 92 minutes (1 hour & 32 minutes) long & is pretty entertaining if you give it a chance.The villains were great in this too & with a more serious tone given to them it worked well & the traps, were ace as & didn't disappoint at all & were more creative & brutal than the first 2 films. The lead actor playing Alex was good & less annoying I'd say & more of a sympathetic character as well as the family & his 2 siblings who while were obnoxious to begin with, were likable in the end.I will say the film gets a lot of hate & backlash because it doesn't feature the Mcallisters & of course, Kevin, Marv & Harry. It would've gotten pretty boring if it were the same cast & story. Those slagging this film off would've slagged it off & complained about it being cliche & a retread which the 2nd Home Alone film pretty much did.I think you can only retell the same story over & over before it becomes stale. Culkin was 16 when this was being filmed & would've been 17 on release, so if he were to be in this flick & it were to be the same as the first 2 films, it would'v been a flop, easily. At least this film, unlike the 4th, has John Hughes' magic in it & feels more Home Alone esque unlike the latter 3 films that followed.Overall, this is a very underrated sequel that gets hate simply because it's not the same as the previous 2 films, which I'll admit are classics. But, give this one a chance & enjoy it in its own merit & for what it is. You may or may not like it, but don't listen to those haters who will try & convince you this isn't even worth watching because it is. It's a great story with great traps, villains, family & leading kid.9/10.",

This movie should not have been called Home Alone or even associated with the franchise without the franchise actors. It just didn't work. Even from the beginning th magic is lost focusing on no-name villains that do nothing to captivate or interest the audience. Those toy cars have been around for decades, nothing novel there. All this movie did is detract from the legacy of the first two. If the intent was to reboot, it didn't work. National Lampoon would not have done a movie this bad. Suspect this was just a left over script from the 80s, not a true HA sequel. It barely mentioned Christmas and pandered to teenage pop. You get the impression the director didn't know where to go with the movie, which isn't fair to the actors.

They were comedic, they were humorous, and just made you really want to root for Culkin even more, which is what a good villain is suppose to do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. More on the corny side actually.Then we got the actual movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Memorable. Perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story, and care about the characters.

I think John McClane said it best in \"Die Hard 2\" (another repetitive, unnecessary deja vu sequel) in a great meta moment: \"How can the same s*** happen to the same guy twice?\". The worst part about \"Home Alone 2\" is it's actually a misnomer, for, as Marv states \"This ain't like the last time. This ain't his house\"...in other words, Kevin is only alone, NOT home. That's why I think this movie actually works BETTER as the sequel! You've got the same basic premise that worked so well in the original (a kid is left alone in his OWN home to defend it against invading bad guys with clever traps) but it's changed JUST enough to make the sequel its own movie, able to stand on its own (new cast; first kid is left home accidentally & second kid is home from school sick, new & improves traps- including a TV gag that's actually plausible, still winter but not Christmas). Based on many of the other comments here, the biggest problems the naysayers have are that it's a different family and the movie doesn't happen at Christmas.

Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants.When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment.Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson.

The story had no good plot, and acting sucked, unlike the first 2. A joke for a sequel to one of the best series made in Hollywood.",

He was truly a great comedian, especially in both Grumpy Old Men movies. But back to Home Alone 3. It was good, but from now on I'll call it Dennis the Menace 2. Rating 6/10. Why 6/10?

            "review_title": "The mask of failed laugh",
            "content": "The movie is called \"Home Alone 3\" but Home Alone resides only in the title. In fact, the Home Alone term shouldn't be used in the title anyway. It should be used to define the genre or the sub-genre or the sub-sub-genre of this movie. The only other similarity is the presence of producer John Hughes, who also produced the first two Home Alone movies.Other than these two little facts, \"Home Alone 3\" shares nothing with its predecessors. The lead character (and actor de facto) is different, the antagonists are different and the story is very different.Macaulay Culkin left his place to Alex D. Linz, who plays Alex (not too difficult, isn't it?), a small boy who lives in Chicago suburbia and has just caught chicken pox.The result is that he has to stay home while his brother and sister (who's played by young Scarlett Johansson) go to school and his parents go to work. His mother can't find a baby-sitter so Alex is left home alone (understood?).What you'd expect from that successful series effectively happens: a group of burglars (this time four, not two) are searching for a missing microchip and they attempt to find it in Alex's neighborhood.Alex calls police twice when he witnesses the burglars' actions but they escape each time, so Alex is accused of making prank calls. In order to clear his name (if I can say it this way), Alex intends to catch the burglars by himself and by booby-trapping his house (surprised?), which is supposed to be next house on the list because the burglars go house by house.Because this is the third movie of an already exhausted film series, the result is exactly what you'd expect. The movie is unoriginal, unfunny and cannot work.The actors are incredibly bad. Alex D. Linz doesn't deliver the job very well and all of the other actors act in a foreseeable way and look like typical movie stereotypes.The villains aren't exactly a disaster because they deliver fair laughs when they need to. I particularly liked Rya Kihlstedt whose portrayal of the nasty girl with black hair gives some gravity. Olek Krupa's performance as burglar chief Beaupre isn't so bad neither.The movie is so bad because it has absolutely everything it needs to be classed as a 'turn-your-brain-off' movie.The storyline is less than weak, the logic is totally absent and the conveyed humor is totally inappropriate. It is supposed to be a family movie but it has more gross-out humor than any other form of comedy, including the legendary slapstick, which makes that kind of film so funny.However, when the coveted slapstick moments finally happen, the movie becomes really funny. Unfortunately, these kind of comic pieces don't work so well in film and should be presented as a series of sketches. I can't understand how a eight-year old boy could set all this in a single night and how he could know the working of every tool he uses. I can't figure how his parents or his brother and sister don't wake up in the middle of the night because of the noises. But frankly, am I supposed to ask all of these questions? \"Home Alone 3\" is directed by Raja Gosnell, a film editor whose previous works include \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" and \"Pretty Woman\". I guess he got his first directing job because he also was the editor of the first two \"Home Alone\" movies and he frequently worked with director Chris Columbus. But Gosnell shows that he's not very good in directing and he would also prove us several times in the future with movies like \"Big Momma's House\" and \"Scooby-Doo\". His views of comedy don't work here, but he just seems to follow the logic that this movie will be a success only by the title name. In other words, another commercially-minded director. So sad.I would say that the only merit that this movie have is that it shows actors who shouldn't be cast in any other movie due to their low skills.So please, stop the series. We've got too much of it now.",

You can even tell that he was attempting to imitate Macaulay Culkin. The villians are completely unfunny, uninteresting and unappealing. Also, why were there four villians here? Twice as much of something bad doesn't make any of it good. Some film critics denounced the first two movies, and actually rated this one a little higher. Give me a break! What was their point? A movie that's boring and stupid is better than a movie that entertains you and makes you laugh? I've watched the first two movies a few times. I wish I'd never heard of part 3.",

As a stand alone there are definite wins for 3 for some of the best moments of the series.I like the storyline, it was more fleshed out and suited the cheesy 90s era, from music to presentation I liked that, whilst Harry and especially Marv are iconic I don't think they had much to work with. Here the 4 protagonists are a mixed bag, the leader plays the part well, the long haired guy was presented like marv was and the other guy for me was a bit redundant. However the lady playing Alice was excellent, from mannerisms to comedic timing I thought she made this movie.Family wise it felt more natural, the kids in the original aren't good at acting, the family scenes felt more real yet again the dad has minimal impact, does the writer have daddy issues? Whilst the family is hard to compare as neither did much, when I objectively thought about the two kids, I actually preferred Alex, he felt more of a real kid, although Kevin has a piece of my heart I just felt this was more akin to being a child. Whilst neither are superb actors, this felt more natural again.The pranks felt more realistic where Kevin's Would take hours to prepare, these were more brutal, creative and fun, I hate panning away and not seeing the impact but I guess it would not look great. Some of the ones in this were even better than the big 2.I'm unsure about the team behind the franchise and their motive, you read in 4 they reached out to marv who literally tore the film apart and then they just recast him but dressed him as Harry, the obsession with the older angry looking adult who always turns out nice, there's a lot of lazy writing and stale components.If this had have come out under a different name itd be sitting on a 7 atleast.",

But when I heard nobody from the first two are in it, I was really let down, but still looking forward to seeing it. I watched the previews for it and I thought they looked very bad. So I was planning on not seeing the movie....until I was convinced by Roger Ebert to see it. I always wondered why he hated the first two, and I was curious at to why he liked this one. So I went thinking it could be good...what was I thinking?? This is such an incredibly terrible movie. Not a single laugh in it, not one. I don't even think I can even consider this movie a sequel. It has no resemblance to the originals, it looks more like a wannabe. And it fails miserably when it comes to laughs and charms. This movie is easily forgettable and it's probably the worst comedy sequel of all time...probably even a candidate for worst sequel of all time. I can't even give this movie half a star it was so bad",

Exactly as first and second \"Home Alone\" main character - 8 years old Alex has to stop four criminals to complete their mission, but this time they are four instead 2. They are international criminals from very high rang. They have high tech equipment, they are very well trained and with huge experience. As you can see in some moments their work is perfect. They don't left any traces. They are not just some local idiots like in first two movies. The 8 years old Alex is not just forgotten from his family like first \"Home Alone\". He is left alone in the house, cuz he is sick.\nEntire story looks more real and authentic. This is entirely different story and as i mentioned i can't understand why they named that \"Home Alone\". First two movies are great, but this one is better and it shouldn't be compare with previous, cuz it is not like them. This is not sequel for first and second movie. This is new story, new movie. I knew that before i saw it and that's why i wasn't disappointed from this one. I liked it very much, even more than \"Home Alone\" 1 and 2.",

The villains are also a great part of the movie this time being sophisticated spies as opposed to street hoods and are played by fantastic actors. The part everyone wants to know about (the traps) certainly doesn't disappoint.Overall despite the fact it will never beat the first two films this is a great sequal, something I can't say for the following movies in the franchise.Unfortunately, I don't think we will ever see an end to home alone spin offs as the plot line is pretty timeless...kid beats up bad guys!",

They repeat many of the same pranks/traps as the first two, so it's unoriginal. Also, there are so many moments that are just too ridiculous to be believable. They're really stretching when they try to do something funny and it's just not working.",

            "content": "I've watched every Home Alone movie, and for me, the first two were the best, now they are creating new characters, and those characters are awful, mix that up a little, and you get Home Alone 3. Home Alone 3 sucked so bad that I can't believe I watched it. I do not recommend you to watch this movie, maybe you should rent it, but if you're 8 or higher, you will dislike this movie, I guarantee it. Here's why:I'M NOT GONNA GIVE AWAY ANY MAYOR SPOILERS SO I'M JUST GONNA BE QUICK,Alex Pruitt is an 8 year old boy who is shown as a genius, he is presented in the movie like he's smarter than any member of his family, and also he's smarter than the so called 'spies'. The four spies are easily fooled into traps that our legendary genius, Alex, built. Even an MIT student wouldn't know how to build traps that Alex built. I think our great hero Alex taught us many things, and mostly he taught us NOT to watch this movie. Alex certainly is smart...For those too lazy to read all of this, here's some pros and cons.PROS: --It's a kid's movie; Somewhat funny moments-- CONS: --Alex is a genius; Bad performance, presentation and film direction; The spies are idiots that are not capable of even shooting Alex.BOTTOM LINE: That's about it, it is a kids movie, so if you're a kid, maybe you'll like it, but I suggest that you don't watch it, or at least rent it.",

Please, disregard anyone who says they liked this movie, as they're either retarded or just trying to irritate people.Home Alone 1 & 2 had a few good laughs and at the very worst were tolerable. Bumbling, clumsy burglars is one thing, but *international spies*?? Puh-leeeze! Even the dumbest 00 would simply put a bullet in the brat's head and proceed as planned(\"Ya guys give up, or ya thirsty for-*POW!*\" heh-heh). Instead, these four idiots set themselves up for one painful and excruciating \"joke\" after another. Rent this and your VCR will projectile vomit pea soup.And what's this, a PARROT that says stupid things? How cute, it's not like all the other characters saying stupid things was bad enough or anything. This movie has plenty of great \"gags\" to it. Unfortunately, they'll all be coming from you as you're hunched over the toilet with the dry heaves from seeing this movie. It's a shame MST3K couldn't secure the rights to this cinematic lump of coal, just think of what Mike & the bots would've done to this movie!Overall rating: -4 stars (It's crap!)",
