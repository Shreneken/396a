            "content": "Rather than films like Citizen Kane (1941) and The Lady from Shanghai (1947), neither of which am I a big fan of, Touch of Evil evidences director/writer/star Orson Welles' capacity for cinematic genius. The story is engaging, suspenseful, tight and well paced; the cinematography is consistently beautiful, inventive and symbolic; the setting and overall tone of the film, including the performances, are captivating, yet slightly surreal and otherworldly; and there are many interesting subtexts. This all combines to create a complex artwork that will reward however far a viewer wishes to dig into the film.Based on a novel by Whit Masterson, Badge of Evil, Touch of Evil is a battle between two policemen--Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and Ramon Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston). Parallel to this is a kind of border battle between the United States, represented by Quinlan, and Mexico, represented by Vargas; the film is set in two border towns, frequently crossing over.As Touch of Evil opens, we see a bomb being placed in the trunk of a car in Mexico. A construction company owner, Mr. Linnekar, gets in with his girlfriend. Vargas and his new wife, Susan (Janet Leigh), manage to walk along next to the car--they're all crossing the border into the United States. Shortly after crossing, the bomb goes off. This brings the gruff Quinlan into the picture. His investigation of the bombing brings him into Mexico for suspects. Meanwhile, Vargas and his wife are being threatened by Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a Mexican mob boss, and his underlings. Both Quinlan and Vargas are well respected in their countries, and both are used to getting what they want. But the bombing investigation ends up putting them at loggerheads, and Quinlan gradually turns out to have more than a \"touch of evil\".As with many of his films, Orson Welles ended up having to battle the studio to realize his artistic vision. Usually, as here, the battle was unsuccessful for him. Despite his 58-page memo detailing various problems with Universal's non-director supervised reshoots (by Harry Keller) and re-edits, because they felt that Welles' final cut \"could use some improvement\", the film was released in a form that was not satisfactory to Welles. The fiasco has resulted in various versions of Touch of Evil appearing throughout the years. The 58-page memo was thought to have been lost, but a copy was discovered relatively recently in Charlton Heston's possession. The film was recut in 1998 based on Welles' memo. So make sure that you watch the 111-minute version first released by Universal on DVD in 2000.The opening scene of Touch of Evil is famous, and rightfully so. Beginning with the timer being set on the bomb, then the bomb being placed in Linnekar's trunk before he gets into the car, we follow both the car and the relative ebb and flow of Vargases as they roughly walk alongside the car, all in one very long tracking shot that covers a lot of ground and features a lot of unusual angles. Welles stages the scene so that there are all kinds of complex background and foreground elements interacting with the car and our protagonist pedestrians. The suspense built up in this scene is incredible--you just know that bomb is going to go off, but you don't know just when, or who it is going to hurt. Compositionally, the scene is simply beautiful. The film is worth watching for this opening alone, but the whole of Touch of Evil features similar, meticulously planned artistry, filled with suspense.Welles as an actor tends to have a very peculiar way of speaking that is full of affectations. Sometimes this can be a detriment to the film, as it was in The Lady from Shanghai. Here, though, the oddity works, and this despite the fact that, like Woody Allen, he seems to direct his whole cast to deliver their dialogue as if they were him. As a result, Touch of Evil has very peculiar, contrapuntal scenes where people frequently talk on top of one another, with odd phrasing. It works because of the particular kinds of personality conflicts that Welles set up in the script. These are people who frequently _would_ talk on top of each other and occasionally not pay attention to each other.But that's not the only odd thing about the film. Welles managed to find locations that, shot in this highly stylized and cinematographically complex film-noir manner, seem almost otherworldly. Except for a couple expansive desert shots, Touch of Evil feels eerily claustrophobic, even though most locations aren't exactly enclosed. The various modes and settings are all perfect for their dramatic material, which is mostly dark and moody. One change that Universal made was the excision of a lot of comic relief material featuring the Grandi family. Universal was right to cut it, and wisely, Welles agreed.The music in the film is also extremely effective but unusual. Most of it is incidental. Latin and rock 'n' roll emanates from radios, for example, and the climax intermittently has a repeating, contextually haunting theme from a pianola.But of course the story is just as important. Although Welles stated hyperbolically at various points that he was trying to \"infuriate\" the audience with a somewhat inscrutable plot, and it's true that the plot isn't exactly given in a straightforward manner, once you figure out the gist, it's relatively simple but extremely captivating. At the same time, it is full of symbolism and subtexts, including commentary on justice systems and perhaps some irony about the popular conceptions of the U.S. versus Mexico (made more complex by the fact that Quinlan spends just as much time south of the border and Vargas seems to spend a lot of time north). But as for being annoyed, you're more likely to become infuriated with Quinlan, who becomes more and more deliciously despicable as the film unfolds.",

            "review_title": "A Great Detective, A Lousy Cop, And Some Kind Of Man",
            "content": "That's a great epitaph Marlene Dietrich and Mort Mills put together for Orson Welles's character police captain Hank Quinlan. In a sense, since Welles directed himself in Touch of Evil he both created the character and the circumstances that bring him down.Two stories intersect in Touch of Evil. The first involves a particularly grisly murder in a Texas/Mexican border town of a man named Rudy Linnaker. The weapon was a car bomb, that went off just as Linnkaer and some chippie he was seeing crossed the border. Driving in the car just behind the late Mr. Linnaker was Charlton Heston as Mexican police detective Mike Vargas and his wife Janet Leigh. Heston is returning to Mexico City where in a few days he's taking the witness stand in the trial of a local drug kingpin. The kingpin's brother is Akim Tamiroff who's the local crime lord in that border town. Heston's case against Tamiroff's brother and Welles's investigation into the car bombing are completely unrelated, but do to some cleverly worked out plot machinations they get intertwined together.Charlton Heston has been quoted many times in saying that Orson Welles was the greatest director he ever worked for. He also rather modestly has stated that he did not give Welles his best screen performance. My own thought on it is that he really is not a terribly convincing latino. Maybe someone with Robert Mitchum's gift for dialect or a latino actor like Gilbert Roland might have been better. Still it's an earnest effort and Heston has nothing to be ashamed of.In fact Heston says and I agree that the story is really about Welles and his destruction. Welles has great instinct as a detective, but he's not really all that scrupulous about due process. That's what has Heston's back up and it forces Welles into an unthinkable alliance with Tamiroff. Janet Leigh gives us a sneak preview of what was in store for moviegoers in Psycho when she's trapped in that motel room with those punks that Tamiroff has sicced on her. One of the punks in fact was Mercedes McCambridge doing a little gender bending generations before Boys Don't Cry. At the motel Dennis Weaver has a marvelous bit part as the useless and feckless 'night man.'Welles put a lot of his favorites in small roles here. Ray Collins took time away from Perry Mason on television to play the District Attorney. Joseph Cotten has a small bit as a medical examiner, Harry Shannon was the state's attorney, it was a regular Citizen Kane reunion.Marlene Dietrich who was Welles's foil and partner in his magic act plays the owner of a border town dive and his mistress who loves him though she recognizes all his faults. This was a banner year for Dietrich because she also did her highly acclaimed role in Witness for the Prosecution. One part though that should have been up for an Academy Award was Joseph Calleia who was Welles's devoted subordinate who in the end ironically helps to bring him down. It's a great piece of acting and Charlton Heston said that Joseph Calleia never did anything better in his entire cinema career. I wouldn't argue the point.Now that the 'director's cut' is available we can now see Touch of Evil and realize what Welles's vision was for this film. Indifferently received when first out, it's grown to become a classic and probably one of the three or four films Welles the director gets the most acclaim for.And now it's probably better than when first seen by the public.",

            "content": "After crossing the border of Mexico to the United States of America, the bomb planted in the car of the wealthy businessman Rudy Linneker blows up in Los Robles. The Mexican Chief of Narcotics Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston) is spending honeymoon with his American wife Susan Vargas (Janet Leigh) in the border town and will testify in the case of the drug dealer Grandi that is arrested in Mexico City. The idolized ex-alcoholic American Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) is in charge of the investigation since the murder happened in the American side of the border, but Mike Vargas participates as observer since the Mexican citizen Sanchez (Victor Millan) is the prime suspect. Meanwhile, Uncle Joe Grandi (Akim Tamitoff) unsuccessfully presses Susie, trying to convince her husband to drop the case. When Hank plants two dynamites in the house of Sanchez in a shoe box that Vargas had seen empty ten minutes before, he confronts Hanks. Joe Grandi witnesses their argument and associates to Hank to discredit Vargas, dishonoring Susie.\"Touch of Evil\" is a masterpiece of malevolence and loss of humanity and one of my favorite movies ever. The long sequence in the beginning is in my opinion the best in cinema history, with a perfect timing. The black and white cinematography is amazing, with the perfect use of shadows and lighting. The story is fantastic and Orson Welles is awesome in the role of a despicable policeman that believes in his hunches, eternally grieves the loss of his wife and wishes to bring justice no matter the means and without any ethic. Janet Leigh performs a strong female character unusual in the 50's. Charlton Heston has also an unforgettable performance in the role of an ethical police office that is the opposite of Hank and prioritizes his work to his family, leaving his wife alone to seek the truth about his opponent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Marca da Maldade\" (\"The Mark of the Malevolence\")",

            "review_title": "Another touch of brilliance from Welles",
            "content": "Considered by many to be the last \"classic\" noir film ever made, and perhaps the last masterwork from child prodigy Orson Welles, who looks about sixty in this film, despite his 42 years. In TOUCH OF EVIL the \"noirish\" dark streets and shadows are darker than ever, practically swallowing up the soft tones like a murky swamp. The action takes place in a nondescript U.S./Mexico border town where the worst that both sides has to offer is most in evidence. The famous opening scene (a 3 1/2-minute continuous shot) where we witness a time bomb being placed in the trunk of a Cadillac is masterful. The camera pulls in and out of the city scene as it follows the motion of the vehicle winding its way through streets littered with pedestrians, thus effectively creating a level of anxiety that could not be duplicated with multiple edits. After the inevitable explosion, the drama dives into a seedy world of corrupt police justice and malevolent decrepitude, which is filmed with such a stylish flair, it is almost weirdly humorous and playful! Mike Vargas, the good guy, is played by Charlton Heston and seems more than a wee bit miscast as a Mexican narcotics officer with his face darkened by makeup. When U.S. Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) first meets him he remarks, \"He doesn't look Mexican.\" Quinlan is the ultimate repugnant cop gone bad and Welles has the camera looking up into his nostrils most of the time making his character look even more monstrous. But Quinlan is also pitifully sad. A man who once had the instincts of a cat and the intelligence of a fox has been reduced to an insignificant mass of tissue, who's \"instinct\" is having a knack for finding evidence that he himself has planted. And while he may be revered by the local officials in law enforcement, he's acutely aware that he is a fraud and petrified that Vargas, has seen him naked.",

            "content": "Orson Welles' \"Touch of Evil\" is a complex, ironic examination of the relationship between the law and justice... The film must stand beside the very best in detectives genre...Its enormous confused tracking shots, its low angles, its tormented lighting, its obscure intelligent photography, its great use of the wide-angle lens, its hard complexity and complete fictional night-city word, all represent a brilliant essay of pure cinema establishing Welles as an alarming genius, one of the greatest filmmakers with movies years ahead of their time...\"Touch of Evil\" is an outstanding achievement of a great cinematic mind, displaying a powerful range of Gothic expressionism... Welles' first appearance as a corrupt used-up Texas police captain (Hank Quinlan) is no less surprising...A police car comes to a stop to the scene of a murder and unexpectedly there is Welles, sitting in the back seat: gross, unshaven, sweaty, and with a cigar clenched between his teeth... He seems a repellent person, with \"intuition,\" manifesting that sensation of evil, as no crime movie has managed to do since, a suggestion of corruption that is the key to the fascinating and doubtful character he plays... Welles character will cheat, lie and murder in order to prevent the truth from emerging... One hates his toughness, yet one still understands him and feels pity for him than for his victims...Joseph Calleia, his slightly more presentable assistant, is like Dana Andrews in Otto Preminger's \"Where the Sidewalks Ends,\" a villain with unchanged methods: he waits, watches, leaves the police work to others, remains loyal to his profession and to his boss\u0097but could not exist without him, or in another environment...From that moment, we are caught between admiration of his brilliant directorial effects and fascination with his characterization of Quilan, a chief able to make a quick arrest by the simple expedient of framing the most likely suspects... He appears to have been using the techniques for years, but before this he has usually fitted the frame round the guilty party... It is a performance which frequently gives great energy to the screen...Stanley Kubrick once said that the first shot of a movie should be the most captivating... Definitely, Welles' legendary opening shot satisfies one of the key requirements of the movie mystery... Of course, Russ Metty deserves a lot of credit...The long traveling shot starts with a close-up of a time-bomb being placed in the trunk of a car by a shadowy figure, then, the richest man in town (Rudy Lanniker) and his mistress appearing from the background, getting into the car and driving away across the border from Mexico to the United States and through the border town... By this time the roving camera\u0097that seems never to come to a standstill, has offered to us long view of the surroundings (crumbling arches, peeling walls, poor hotels and night clubs and a lot of trash) which will enclose the plot...While the convertible stops at a crossroad, the camera descends swiftly to introduce a Mexican gentleman, an idealistic justice department lawyer Ramon Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his bride, the blonde American Susan (Janet Leigh) walking toward the frontier...The superlative camera tracks the couple for some time, catching again the car as both Vargas and the automobile meet at the U.S. Customs post... We see and hear a conversation between Vargas, his wife and the border guard as the vehicle moves out of the frame... We proceed with the couple about to cross the border until the bomb goes off and the car explodes... The killing is the start of the conflict between policemen from both sides of the border...\"Touch of Evil\" is great and memorable for the distinguished description of its scenes, its images, its acting and its sound track... Its importance lies entirely in how the event is told 'not' in the message or material...In addition to its wonderful opening, the film contains other outstanding sequences: The deplorable ambiance of a closed nightclub where Marlene Dietrich wisely advises Welles to \"lay off the candy bars.\" \"Honey, you're a mess\", she says when she finally recognizes Quinlan, and (at the end of the picture) when he asks \"Come on, read my future for me,\" she replies: \"You haven't got any. Your future is all used up. Why you don't go home.\"The single shot (in the murder suspect's apartment) where Welles handles his cast with great skill... There is much overlapping conversation as everyone talks at once, and half a dozen characters are brilliantly delineated...When the camera meets a group of three characters crossing the street across a hotel lobby and into a restricted elevator, and rides with them slowly up to the second floor until Vargas, who has left them in the lobby, reappears at the very moment the elevator door reopens...The horrifying siege of Leigh at the isolated Mirador Motel by a gang of young punks... Perhaps the finest things about \"Touch of Evil\" is the cold, strange and unsympathetic atmosphere of its night city (narcotics, gang-rape, racism, prostitution) an almost universal corruption...It's unlikely that there will ever be a more unpleasant or offensive or disgusting detective than Welles or a more fascinating one...Watch for Mercedes McCambridge in it... but look quickly, or it will be too late.",

            "content": "This suspense movie contains intrigue , thrills , plot twists and layered dialog prevail . A stark , perverse tale of murder , treason , kidnapping , and police corruption in a sleazy Mexican border town . As starring 'Mike' Vargas (Charlton Heston who cited not doing a Hispanic accent for his Mexican role as one of the biggest mistakes he ever made as an actor) has to interrupt his honeymoon along with his wife (Janet Leigh who initially rejected her participation in this film due to the low salary offered without even consulting the actress ) when an American building contractor is murdered . Idolized alcoholic Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and his Sergeant, Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), are in charge on the US side and Hank soon has a suspect . But things go wrong when Vargas discovers Quinlan puts fake evidences against the prime suspect . Quinlan joins forces with Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) , who seeks revenge against Mike , to impugn Vargas's proofs . This overwhelming masterpiece of the strangest vengeance ever planned is plenty of suspense and twisted intrigue from start to finish . Awesome opening , justifiable known , shot in stylistic way begins this over-the-top picture . \u00a8Touch of evil\u00a8 failed in the U.S. but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair , here director/player proved that he was still a filmmaking genius . Excellent acting by the great maestro Orson Welles playing the life of yet another ruthless character , he stars a corrupt inspector with a shady past and obscure present , planting evidences to detain suspects . Orson Welles was originally hired only to act in the film , but due to a misunderstanding, Charlton Heston thought that Welles was to be the director , to keep Heston happy, producer Albert Zugsmith allowed Welles to direct . Support cast is frankly magnificent , such as : Akim Tamiroff , Joseph Calliea , Dennis Weaver , Ray Collins , Joanna Moore , Marlene Dietrich , Zsa Zsa Gabor , among others . Oscar winner Mercedes McCambridge only appears in the film because she was having lunch with Orson Welles during filming and Welles convinced her to film a scene . Attractive and dazzlingly photographed in black and white by Russell Metty . The entire film was shot on real locations, apart from the infamous ten-minute take in the Mexican shoe store clerk's apartment, which is actually a set , Welles and Metty insisted on filming in a real city , settling for Venice, California, when he couldn't get his initial choice of Tijuana . Rousing jazzy musical score by the maestro composer Henry Mancini , including Latin rock sounds . Although much of the music used throughout the movie was from sound sources that pertained to the film: radio transmissions, jukeboxes, player piano . And being ulteriorly reconstructed according to Welles'notes in 1988 . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Orson Welles who shot predominantly at night in order to fend off meddlesome studio suits . Welles was a genius who had a large and problematic career . In 1938 he produced \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", famous for its broadcast version of \"The War of the Worlds\" . His first film to be seen by the public was Ciudadano Kane (1941), a commercial failure , but regarded by many as the best film ever made , along with his following movie , The magnificent Ambersons . He subsequently directed Shakespeare adaptation such as Macbeth , Othelo and Chimes at Midnight or Falstaff . Many of his next films were commercial flops and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948 . In 1956 he directed this great masterpiece Touch of evil (1958) but Orson was fired as director during post-production, and the film was recut contrary to his wishes ; before his death, he left instructions on how he wanted the film to be edited, and in 1998 a version was made the way he intended . In 1975, in spite of all his box-office flops , he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1984 the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor, the D.W. Griffith Award . His reputation as a film maker has climbed steadily ever since.",

            "content": "Here is a film that wouldn't be made today because nobody makes 'B' movies anymore; and this is the greatest 'B' movie in the history of cinema. Here is the perfect example of why Orson Welles should be considered a genius. He has made this film look so effortlessly easy that it could almost be considered film making by numbers. From the famous opening sequence to the closing titles, this is the film students' reference book. Welles portrayal of the bloated cop Hank Quinlan is only bettered by his Harry Lime in 'The Third Man'. He gets right inside the seedy, corrupt Quinlan; but still leaves room for just the lightest touch sympathy because we know that, after all, he's a fallible human like all of us. We almost feel sad at his fate especially when Marlene Dietrich gives her sad soliliquay about him.This is another film that can only exist in black and white, and begs the question, why can't directors work effectively in this medium today? Some have tried but none have have really suceeded. David Lynch's Eraserhead is probably the best modern example of a black and white only film. Woody Allen's Manhattan tries hard but ends up looking too much like a documentary. I don't think that directors today use this medium enough, too many rely on colour and the efffects that can only work in colour to get them out of trouble. So put A Touch Of Evil on your 'must see' list and enjoy a work of film making artistry.",

I choose to do the latter.When I first saw \"Touch of Evil,\" I was glued to the chair.  When I found out it was not Welles' definitive vision, I wondered how on earth it could have been made better.  And when I saw the re-released version, I wondered why the studio altered it.  The stunning black-and-white images, the intricate plot, and the powerful, engaging performances took a hold of my imagination.  At times, I imagined myself on the street with the characters, because the atmosphere was so thick I felt surrounded in it.The actors all did an outstanding job, especially Leigh and Heston (who, although not thoroughly convincing as a Mexican, soared above his usual powerful, furious presence).  This is Welles' picture, however, and whenever the camera catches his obese figure, you are fully aware of the man as a director and an actor.  His powerful vision drives the film, from the single-cut opening sequence to the cat-and-mouse finale.I suggest watching the 1998 restored version over the original theatrical release, but regardless of which version, \"Touch of Evil\" will have you stuck in your seat, questioning your views of morality until long after the last credit has rolled up the screen.",

Acting-wise also, Welles also gives one of his career's greatest performances as Hank Quinlin, possibly his career's most interesting character too because he is so corrupt and corpulent. The look of the film is wonderful and holds up so well with innovative camera work and brooding production values. The music is unusual but memorable and fitting, and the writing and characterisations are first rate as is the deeply disturbing story right from the opening sequence-one of the best opening sequences on film- to the grisly finale and while Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh are great in their roles I think it's Welles that makes Touch of Evil work so well.

The movie is not about the 5 or 8 or 10 minute opening shot. The movie is not even, god help us, about Welles' descent from the heights into \"slumming it\" in a \"Grade B\" flick.The movie is about two things : film-making, and character. Every shot worth remembering (and there are few that aren't) is an exercise in the possibilities of film, particularly black and white film. Woody Allen makes movies in black and white that are  all conversation. Welles made movies in black and white because that's where the colors of the characters, the location and ultimately the meaning of the movie are possible. Black and white film is about the infinite possibilities of shadow. Touch of Evil is about the infinite possibilities of human nature.Heston, for those of you who just can't see past a \"bad\" accent is about rigidity and short-sightedness. What kind of idiot would leave his wife in all those threatening situations? The kind of idiot who can't imagine that anyone would harm HIS wife, simply because she IS his wife! Akim Tamiroff's Grandi is about flexibility to the point of breakage. Always playing ALL ends against the middle he is the essence of \"harmless\" corruption, that ultimately harms everyone.And Welles' Hank Quinlan ... I just don't have the time or space to explain that Quinlan is about the true cost of police work when the humanity has gone out of it. Ultimately Quinlan would kill his best and only friend, the only one, as Dietrich has it, who really loves him. At one time, perhaps, Quinlan WAS the image that Pete  Menzies saw. But the man behind that image was eaten up long ago with alcohol and frustrated grief. It's all about winning and losing now, and things he would never do. Until he does them.There are so many other moments and characters that I'm afraid you'll just have to watch the film with your eyes and your mind open instead of shut to \"get it\". Pay attention to what's on the screen instead of the smart, cynical, hip comments you can make about an actual work of heart.Well, what the hell. Joan Didion said it best.

And, after the second time, I found I liked it a little more but still can't understand how it made it to the top 250 here on IMDb. Yes, it's a very good film,...but certainly not great.The plot has a lotta nice twists and the camera work is lovely and very Noir-ish, but the film also has a few flaws that can't be overlooked and should keep this in the \"good but not marvelous\" category. First, whose stupid idea was it to paint Charlton Heston's hair and have him play a Mexican?! While it's not as silly as John Wayne playing Genghis Khan, it is approaching that--especially since Heston has not a trace of an accent. Second, while some praised Orson Welles' performance, I did also find him menacing, but he looked so bloated and winded all the time, he looked like he was nearly ready to keel over at any minute. Both should have been replaced--great actors in the WRONG movie--then the film might have merited a 9 or 10.",

No one before (except Welles himself in `Othello') had mastered the dimensionality of place as extensively. The actors are merely anchors, references for the camera as it moves around, under and behind planes. Everything is volume, space. Every shot is an adventure in directed perception of depth.Reading about Heston's view of this film is a hoot. He has no idea what is happening and thinks it has something to do the devolution of Welles' character. Watch Heston in this film, vigorously chasing a greater awareness, and always being largely clueless. Welles used this against him without his knowledge. Same with Ms Leigh who was a manikin in character and `real' life.In some future, schools will teach kids to be visually articulate, just as they presumably now teach literary competence. And as with now, some will actually get it. Millions of seventh graders will be exposed to this, because it is the purest spatial film -- the one that reveals its 3-d intentions more than Kane, Shanghai, Othello. Millions of kids will note that the story is about `planting' and discovering things and either hallucinating about or recording them. Millions of small essays will be written using Welles' memo as source (some noting similarities with Vincent's letters), but most kids will come out of the experience like Heston did.",

            "content": "This should be a 5-6 but a sharper light shines on Orson Welles.At this point in his Career, Welles had abandoned any attempt at storytelling in favor of atmosphere and meaning via oblique camera angles. If you love Welles you'll see the brilliance in the camera work and defend the genius, vision, breadth, greatness; you'll criticize others for not \"getting\" it; you'll discuss the real meanings with other cognoscenti.Really though, it's an awful movie. I mean, just plain bad. The worst kind of Hollywood: a terrible jazz-like score; villains with all the cartoonish menace of Wild One, Rebel w/o Cause, or On the Waterfont (I kept waiting for Karl Malden to jump out in a priest outfit and punch someone); a meandering story that goes nowhere; and some of the worst acting imaginable. Acting so wincingly bad that it brings tears to your eyes.Weaver's performance is clownishly painful - something out of bad theatre for children. Welles, as always, pontificates and overacts ponderously. Heston, as always, alternates between woodenness and overacting - he was a master at reacting to the wrong things; Leigh overacts and almost jumps out of the screen in places; the list goes on. There isn't an understated performance in it.In case you haven't seen it: Heston plays a Mexican (no, I'm not kidding) DEA guy with no discernible ethnicity beyond some facepaint and a greased mustache.There's also the wonderful technique of having 2-3 characters talk at once so that you can't possibly follow what's going on. Much like real life where the salesman in your group interrupts before you can begin to get to your point.Dietrich is a fortune teller with heavy lines such as (to Welles) \"Your future is all used up\". This is often quoted as one of the important bits. Cotten is a coroner with his trademark simpering smile.What happens in the end: Welles drowns in the physical, moral and spiritual garbage that he created for himself. Or did the world create it for all of? Why for that matter are we here? Of course he finds time before he goes for a self-pitying speech that questions the meaning of his own life and - yes - all of our lives. Yup, just like Kane and Third Man.It's a shame about Welles really: he had some great ideas and some beautiful camera techniques. He just couldn't present anything without slamming it in your face over and over and over. He'd have been a good preacher or university professor where he could lecture without any questioning.",

It's a great six minute opening shot in search of a decent story. Just as Leigh kisses Heston and they are interrupted by an explosion, a rather tiresome movie begins. She is instantly carted off to the sidelines to sit around passing time in a pointless sidebar, that feature Mercedes McCambridge as either the first lesbian to take part in a rape on film, or the first time a woman is cast as a man to put one over on the audience. Seemingly every race but an actual Mexican will do here in portraying the Mexican roles, no matter how absurd the casting; uber-Caucasian Charlton Heston, or German Marlene Dietrich. None of this would matter if the movie were any good, but it's two inter-cut holding patterns that have no tension and nothing filmic going for them (except maybe composition) once that first shot is over. At the re-release of the respectfully recut version, people were just laughing at the over-dramatic, hoary script of the last half hour. I was more respectful but I could understand their reaction.Welles could fastidiously conceive and execute single set-pieces like no one else, but he just didn't didn't have much interest in making whole films after his first two (Kane & Ambersons). His Othello is also a terrible mess.Give me Torneur's \"Out of the Past\" over this. This is a whole lot of fuss (and technique) about nothing.",

            "content": "Charlton Hesston playing a Mexican. I must admit, I was highly skeptical at first. Sure, he's played roles ranging from Moses to a British tea planter to the last human in a world filled with vampires. But in all those movies, he was clearly white. And yet, in this movie, casting Hesston in the role of a Mexican narcotics agent actually works. But on reflection, how could it not, considering that Touch of Evil was made by Orson Welles himself.Welles is, after all, the man responsible for Citizen Cane. Hearing that he's connected with a project tends to raise expectations- especially when he both stars and directs. And Touch of Evil more than meets them. Here we have a web of lies and conspiracy that keeps you guessing, rapidly building tension in the second half, and two legendary actors giving some of the best performances of their careers.Hesston plays Vargas, who along with his American wife is celebrating his success on his last case. Their border vacation is cut short when the car ahead of them explodes in a massive fireball. Every law enforcement officer in the county is soon on the scene, including Captain Quinlen (Welles). He makes it clear from the start that he doesn't want some Mexican getting involved in his affairs, but the bomb was planted in Mexico, probably by a Mexican. Plus, Vargas may have more personal reasons for sticking around, possibly involving the local crime boss. It's clear that these two will butt heads and work at cross purposes all through the case. But when Vargas that Quinlen may be planting evidence, the film takes a whole new direction. Both men's reputations are at stake, and there will be no holds barred.I cannot fully express just how great Welles' screenplay is. Rarely, if ever, predictable, it keeps you guessing as to the characters' intentions, motivations, and connections to each other. Deals are made and loyalties shift, with the other characters- and the viewers- only gradually becoming aware of what's really happening. It also must be said that nothing, absolutely nothing happens that does not tie back in to the plot. There are no fillers here. And at the end, everything is explained, and all the loose ends tied up, without resorting to any Deos ex Machina devices.Back to Charlton Hesston. If his name had not been in the opening credits, I would never have guessed that it was him. He looks nothing like himself; he looks Hispanic. This film must have had one hell of a head makeup artist. Of course, the fact that it's in black and white doesn't hurt. I doubt this would work nearly as well in color. And yet it's not just his appearance. He speaks Spanish like a native, and has the subtle hand gestures down pat. The only thing that leads one to suspect he's white is that he also speaks English like a native- that is to say without a noticeable accent. But as convincing in his portrayal as Hesston is, his is only the second-best performance in this picture.\nWarning! Major spoilers ahead!Besides providing excellent writing and direction, Welles also gives us one of the most loathsome characters in the history of cinema. Physically he's overweight, with a homely visage. His movements are slow and plodding, and his voice a low growl mixed with a smoker's cough. From the moment we first meet him, it's obvious that he's a racist and a bigot. It also becomes clear as the movie progresses that he is seriously corrupt, to the point that his career and the reputation he's built for himself are based on blatantly illegal acts, acts which have led to the deaths of possibly innocent people.\nFor Quinlen, his job isn't about seeing justice done OR following the letter of the law. It's only about clearing the books and seeing that someone is punished. And he will do anything, no matter how unspeakable to keep his sterling reputation intact. And it doesn't matter how long or how loyally you've served him, he only cares about himself.The final scene, with the wiretap, is an absolute masterpiece of high tension. At every second, the hero is threatened with discovery. Quinlen is a smart man, even drunk. The conversation between him and the sergeant can only go on so long before he realizes he's being set up. We know this, and the question becomes \"Can Vargas keep him in the dark long enough to get what he needs?\" When this question is answered, the final confrontation is masterfully handled. It is upstaged only by the coda, in which the original case is solved, and we discover just how needless all of Quinlen's schemes were.",

Charlton Heston gives a strong performance as an Hispanic narcotics officer in Mexico who butts heads with a distinctly crooked head of the police force, with new bride Janet Leigh caught in the middle. An atmospheric but not especially absorbing picture, this mainly due to Welles' indifferent handling of the material (he gets into the grit--but from a distance; this is a melodrama with a lukewarm temperature). Film was initially taken away from Welles in post-production but has now been restored to its original form. It features justifiably famous cinematography from Russell Metty, fine work from the underrated Leigh, and a terrifically seedy feel for decadent border towns. However, these sterling attributes cannot camouflage a screenplay without much spark, some miscasting and overacting in key supporting roles, and a final act with flare but not much punch. **1/2 from ****",

No need, either, to emphasise anew the mesmerism of an opening scene that rightly influenced everyone from Altman to Scorsese and even survived mangling by Paul Thomas Anderson and the ludicrously awful 'Boogie Nights'.Ludicrously awful, 'Touch of Evil' certainly ain't. But just as time was never kind to Orson Welles, neither has it been to this, allegedly \"the finest film noir ever made.\" Er no. It isn't. Because it's damn near unwatchable now, stuffed full of Wellesian parlor tricks that were great on their outing with 'Kane' -- hyper-stylised photography, well-nigh incessant cross-conversations between characters, eccentric lighting and even more eccentric sets -- but which here are, well. . . Theatrically jaded.And. . . bor-inng.Bearing in mind that I first watched 'Touch of Evil' not long after its initial release, I figured on a long overdue enjoyment half a century later: wow, that tracking shot, gosh, that elevator scene, oh boy, that border town desolation.Instead. . . I stopped the DVD half way through. Put it back in its mailer envelope. Life's too short.And the reason it's too short for stuff like this is because there were, are, and will continue to be, infinitely better movies than 'Touch of Evil'.Movies which don't seek to scream 'maestro' in every scene. Which don't cast so spectacularly badly (Charlton Heston, as a Mexican, turns in one of the cinema's all-time worst-ever performances; Welles, playing Welles, doesn't do much better). And which don't have some of the most Godawful dialog ever written (the initial encounter between Leigh and Grande is, well, excruciating).By 1958, we'd already celebrated Welles' facility with cross-conversations and noir camera work and sets of surreal quality. But we'd also celebrated great acting, great directing, and a great script -- all three of which are notable for their absence here (every 'memorable' scene is only a Wellesian re-tread anyway: superior to many another, but devoid of the brilliance of the original).So what you're left with is an over-hyped, over-valued 'B' movie that's some way behind the quality of work Alfred Hitchcock was turning in at this time, or that of Val Lewton, or Jacques Tourneur or John Huston or Fritz Lang.And, sadly, you're also left with the feeling that you're a heretic -- for to criticise 'Touch of Evil' for what it is -- a Touch of Mediocrity -- rather than what Welles worshippers would wish it to be, is surely iconoclasm of the very worst kind.In which case, guilty as charged.",

            "content": "The 1950's critics and audiences did injustice to some movies.  They dissed the dreamy, chilling VERTIGO, and spurned THE SEARCHERS for failing to present the usual Simon-pure hero.  In one case, though, I think the '50's generation was right and today's movie fans are wrong.  TOUCH OF EVIL should have remained in the oblivion to which its contemporaries consigned it.The storyline follows Mexican policeman Mike Vargas (played by Charlton Heston!!??) and his wife Susan (the ravishing Janet Leigh) as he investigates a car bombing and she gets threatened a lot by some gangsters against whom her husband is going to testify.  The story ends up dividing into two very tenuously connected plots, as Susan is isolated at a motel with an idiotic night man (shades of PSYCHO) while Mike at first tries to help, and then tries to thwart bigoted detective Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles).Welles wrote, directed and starred in this movie.  Yes, I said starred; Vargas may be the clean-cut hero, but everybody's eyes are on Quinlan. Welles makes a great heavy, in the literal as well as figurative sense, and he is scary as hell.  In the starring department, he's great; in the directing department he's madly inconsistent; and in the writing department, he stinks.Now I am sure to be burned at the stake for heresy in questioning Welles' direction in this movie.  Certainly, his use of the camera is extremely imaginative, as in the stupendously long opening shot; he cuts back and forth with superb timing in the suspenseful conclusion; he has some neat continuous shots in an apartment and an elevator; and he does a truly ghastly murder scene by flashing lights.  But there's more to directing than just camera work.  You have to handle your cast, and Welles doesn't. Allowing Heston to be cast as the lead was insane; even though Welles owed the directing job to Heston, he could have given him the role of Peter Menzies.  And where was Welles when Akim Tamiroff and Dennis Weaver were over-acting like the sky was about to fall?  Even if their absurd approaches to their roles were their own idea and not Welles' responsibility, Welles should at least have demanded re-takes of all their scenes, and told them to calm down or else he'd find some better actors.However, what really sinks the movie is the sheer absurdity of the script, which Welles himself adapted from a cheap novel.  A tiny explosive barely the size of a hand grenade, dropped in a trunk, blasts a car off the ground like the eruption of Mount Saint Helens.  A woman is then called in to \"identify\" the charred, burned and dismembered corpses.  Displeased with Vargas' investigation, a punk throws dark, sticky Movie Acid at him that sticks to a wall and burns through it like a hot knife through warm butter. Then Janet Leigh is driven by a friendly policeman to the Amazing Coincidence Motel, which just happens to be owned by the gangsters who've been threatening her.  They don't need to threaten her any more, since they have an incriminating photo to blackmail her with, but they do it anyway, and the photo is never mentioned again.  A dopehead whispers through her wall about the joys of mainlining (injecting) marijuana.  Then, as she shivers and cowers, unarmed goons slowly stalk into her apartment and she lets them assault her, even though she has a loaded gun in easy reach (this despite earlier scenes that established her as a fiery, combative woman). \nIn sum, TOUCH OF EVIL pays no more attention to detail and character consistency than any direct-to-video thriller of the present day.  This is bad in any movie, but worst in a mystery thriller, where even the most casual audience members are keeping an eye out for the little details that will catch the killers and unmask the frauds later on.If you thought that SNAKE EYES was genius, you should love TOUCH OF EVIL. But if you refuse to let slam-bang camera antics distract you from the absence of characterization, poor plotting (both depend heavily on deus ex machina devices), and uneven acting, you'd best avoid both of them.",

Adding in Marlene Dietrich, Charlton Heston, and a border town setting makes an even more unusual mix. The result is very intriguing, though somewhat uneven. It's quite a tense and entertaining movie, but it's hard not to notice some of the flaws.The most impressive part probably comes right at the beginning, with the lengthy single take that sets up the story. It's clearly a technical triumph, but it is more than that. It not only gets the story rolling, but establishes both the atmosphere and the setting very efficiently. It is also followed up well, setting up the entrance of Welles's character nicely.Welles himself does a fine job as the jaded but perceptive policeman. His character is believable and complex, too menacing to like but too pitiable to hate. Heston is oddly cast as Vargas, and through little fault of his own, the character is not fully convincing. Dietrich's role seems to have been tailored just for her, but it fits in reasonably well. Janet Leigh always seems right at home in even the weirdest of stories. Joseph Calleia also gets some good moments.The story is always interesting, and often peculiar, sometimes to the point of distraction, yet there's no denying that it holds your attention all the way through.

            "content": "Orson Welles' classic crime drama about corruption and betrayal features a colourful array of characters and some excellent performances from its very talented cast. Its fluid style is established right from the start with the incredibly accomplished long tracking sequence which opens the film. The use of some marvellous camera-work and Russell Metty's exceptional cinematography also produce a dark and sometimes oppressive atmosphere which is totally compatible with the story's sordid and pessimistic nature.Henry Mancini's musical score incorporates jazz and Latin American influences but the action is also effectively accompanied by a pianola and a variety of ambient sounds which also contribute solidly to the movie's atmosphere.When a bomb is planted in a car in a Mexican town and the vehicle subsequently blows up in U.S territory, the cross border cooperation which becomes necessary brings together Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) who is a newly married Mexican narcotics enforcement official. Quinlan, a detective who has a reputation for quick convictions, is openly hostile to Vargas' involvement and even makes racist remarks about him. Vargas is also involved in the prosecution of a case against a member of the Grandi gang and suspects them of planting the bomb which resulted in the death of a local man, Rudy Linnekar and the young lady who was travelling with him.Meanwhile, Vargas' wife Susan (Janet Leigh) is subjected to threats by \"Uncle\" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) who demands that Vargas should call off the prosecution of his brother on drugs charges. Susan is not intimidated but is nevertheless moved to a motel on the American side of the border for her own safety.Quinlan uses his intuition and identifies Manolo Sanchez (Victor Millan) (who is secretly married to Linnekar's daughter) as a suspect and when his colleague Sgt Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia) discovers two sticks of dynamite in a shoebox, this seems to confirm Sanchez's guilt. Vargas realises, however, that the evidence had been planted as he'd seen the shoebox empty shortly before Menzies made the discovery. Vargas informs Quinlan's superior officer about the evidence being planted and in retaliation Quinlan agrees to a suggestion from \"Uncle\" Joe Grandi that they work together to destroy Vargas' reputation. Shortly after, Susan is terrorised and drugged by Grandi's gang and moved back to his hotel on the Mexican side of the border. Quinlan then strangles Grandi and frames Susan for the murder.Vargas gets access to Quinlan's case files which confirm that after his wife had been murdered by a \"half-breed\", he hadn't been able to get the necessary evidence to get a conviction and he had since been using his intuition and planting evidence to secure convictions.When Vargas fails to contact his wife by telephone, he goes to the motel and finds her room in chaos and reeking of marijuana. Later, he discovers that she's been jailed on suspicion of using drugs and murdering Grandi.Sgt Pete Menzies had always hero worshipped Quinlan and had been tremendously loyal to him, not least because, in the past, Quinlan had taken a bullet for him and this had been the cause of his colleague's permanent limp. However, after Vargas tells him what he found in the case files, Menzies is convinced that the information is true and when he reveals that he found Quinlan's cane in the room where Susan was found, the detective's involvement becomes clear. The two men then team up and ultimately bring a permanent end to Quinlan's corrupt practices.Initially, Quinlan, a towering, obese and corrupt character with a history of alcoholism, seems totally unsympathetic but the revelations about the circumstances of his wife's murder put another complexion on his behaviour and point to the source of his racism. The fact that he took a bullet for a colleague is also indicative of a more noble side to his character and clearly the failure to bring his wife's murderer to justice tormented him cruelly and presumably led to his alcoholism. His dealings with ex-lover and fortune teller Tanya (Marlene Dietrich) also reveal greater warmth and humanity than are evident at first. Vargas is significantly younger than Quinlan and his integrity and idealism are still intact but interestingly, the way in which he loses control following his wife's abduction points clearly to the potential that exists for him to take the same route as Quinlan in the longer term.When Sgt Menzies became aware that he'd been regularly used to find the evidence that Quinlan had planted he felt betrayed and responded by betraying his old friend and colleague. Quinlan's methods were clearly corrupt, however, a revelation in the latter part of the movie suggests that his intuition was sound and the people who he'd previously arrested and convicted were, in all probability, guilty.\"Touch Of Evil\" is one of those films which make a profound impression overall but surprisingly its most haunting lines are delivered not by one of the leading characters but instead by Marlene Dietrich's Tanya.",

            "content": "Charlton Heston felt love, then hate, then love for TOUCH OF EVIL director Orson Welles, being that he's responsible for suggesting that Welles... initially cast as the literal heavy as crooked border police captain Hank Quinlan... also become the film's director for Universal Pictures...The same studio that would throw the legendary auteur off the lot upon seeing the first cut, deemed too dark and disturbing (commonplace now); after which, decades later, adhering to Welles's 58-page memo, provided a faithfully-restored version: particularly showcasing the opening 3 1/2 minute one-shot-take through an entire street, up and around buildings, trading-off various source music with overlapping dialogue, initially littered with opening credits...Strangely enough, some still prefer the original cut's eclectic and chaotic, offbeat cadence, which was actually bad editing to an otherwise brilliantly shot film noir where Orson's Quinlan butts heads with lead actor Charlton Heston, playing a Mexican cop, only infamously panned in retrospect...The extremely popular actor not only handles the part in a calm, subtle fashion but, without using a distracting fake accent, he doesn't rely on his signature overacting... this isn't a Biblical epic after all... plus he started out with another subdued performance in the b-crimer DARK CITY...Which, like many other film noirs, especially from the sparse 1950's with lower budgets than the more lavish, stylistic 1940's, pales to TOUCH OF EVIL, considered the last of its kind...Mostly because there's nothing else quite like it, since Orson went out with a bang with the help of cinematography-giant Russell Metty, turning a long, purposefully convoluted night that, within Universal's gritty studio-made border town combined with actual shots in Venice, California, feels like an ominous underworld where, par for the iconic director's course, shifting shadows are liken to characters all their own...And it's no surprise that, literally and symbolically, Welles cast the largest shadow, making for an anti-hero co-lead instead of the token bad guy: which is how Heston turned that rudimentary love to jealous-hate -- cured years later after realizing what a timeless and unique classic he was part of...Altered with body padding and face-plumpers to make Orson's then only somewhat portly build into the immense girth he'd become famous for later, his Quinlan... attempting to frame a Mexican local for murdering the powerful father of his live-in girlfriend... is a formidable presence of line-crossing villainy but with an equal amount of deliberately pathetic pathos: the viewer becomes more interested in what the bad cop can get away with than, like otherwise mainstream cop-crime flicks, how or when the good cop (Heston) will bust him...Meanwhile Charlton's busy Spanish cop named Mike Vargas is forced to neglect his honeymoon with sophisticated, glamorous, gorgeous yet down-to-earth American wife Janet Leigh: herself dealing with villain's villain Akim Tamiroff, as grotesquely vile a gangster as Welles is a crooked lawman...After being blackmailed by Akim and his wily nephews, she ironically gets stuck in a rural motel run by a crazy young man -- foreshadowing her peak in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO...Unfortunately... although filled with a stellar cast from CITIZEN KANE vets Ray Collins and Joseph Cotten (quick cameo) to Victor Milan and Joanna Moore (the accused and his mistress) to madame Zsa Zsa Gabor... Dennis Weaver is no Anthony Perkins as the GUNSMOKE actor is so completely overboard and wacky... supposedly a mix of sexual frustration and lonesome lunacy... he's better suited for a keystone comedy, and a bad one...Thankfully he's soon encroached by a gang of drug-addled beatniks, led by Mercedes McCambridge, hired by Tamiroff: whose own best scenes are shared with multi-collaborator Welles (from BLACK MAGIC to MR ARKADIN to THE TRIAL), who, at the end of his rope, seeks rock bottom honor amongst the lowest of thieves...Then there's Welles's faithfully adoring sidekick/partner, fighting to distrust the dark truths unfolding about his clue-planting mentor (spouted from both Heston and his own sycophant Mort Mills): providing underrated and unappreciated Joseph Calleia the purest, most likeable role...But only if you don't count medium Marlene Dietrich as Tanya (Quinlin's lover when he resembled Harry Lime), who... after Heston and Welles's spectacular cat and-mouse climax involving a mobile recording device (as intriguingly complicated to watch as it probably was to shoot)... utters the final line, summing up both Welles's fictional character and real life cinematic legacy: \"He was some kind of man.\"",

            "content": "Orson Welles was obviously a fan of the use of black and white film. It works very well here. First of all, there is the impression of both the border towns, with their bleak and depressing qualities. It didn't seem to make much difference which side of the border the action takes place; both places seem to be just as unwelcoming and unfriendly. During the opening scene where the bright white car moves through the streets, carrying the bomb, the people are anonymous and uninvolved, ducking this way and that (quite visible because of their lightness), interested only in their own affairs. Because we have been given knowledge of the timing mechanism, we begin to figure, in our heads, how long it will be, and which of the pedestrians will be affected. There is an actual choreography at work in this scene. Bright white food wrappers and garbage blow through the town, accentuating the heat. There also seems to be a caustic edginess to each scene with nothing to brighten up the proceedings (not that there is anything light or charming about this film). The young Mexican men can be seen in their white clothing, standing on street corners. The film choice places them in our visual realm. In other scenes an opposite effect is presented. This would be a sort of chiaroscuro effect, as in painting, where things blend together and become ambiguous. The threat in this film seems to come from everywhere, and this ambiguity of scene hides the danger. There are odd shadows and angles all through the film. Who knows what is lurking in the shadows? Welles's character, Quinlan, is a study in black and white himself. He dominates in every scene he appears. He is childish, touchy, and arbitrary. His light colored clothing and size allow him to fill the screen. He wears a white hat which he pulls over his eyes. Camera angles allow us to look up into those eyes. The dark shadow of the brim of his hat covers much of his face, but those piercing, almost reptilian eyes manage to peer out. Light is focused on those eyes, and they become even more threatening. The perspiration on his face is also accentuated by the use of black and white film. We can see the beads of sweat running down his face. His jowly cheeks and brow make him look like a rhinoceros, about to charge. They betray his insecurities to the camera. He is revered by those with whom he works, and he is able to hide his fears under his hat. He is menacing and lack of color helps with this.Other figures benefit as well. One of the ongoing criticisms of this film is that Charlton Heston is playing a Mexican. It is said frequently that even though they darkened his skin, he still had little to recommend him as Hispanic. In today's film world, it would be utterly laughable. Apparently, Welles had Charlton Heston forced on him by the studio and was really uncomfortable about it. Unfortunately, being a man of grandiose possibilities, his ambitious plans were often squelched by the moneymen. Nevertheless, black and white makes Heston a bit more believable if you don't think about it too much. Janet Leigh has that chiseled beauty with high cheekbones and an angular face. There are times when she is absolutely stunning and the contrasts of this medium really seem to work for her and camera. She is also very sensual in some scenes, particularly in the motel. When she is attacked by Grandi's men, their black leather jackets and almost glowing faces make their appearance overwhelming. They literally wash her out of the motel room with a rush of humanity. I was convinced by this scene that she was going to be raped, but apparently this didn't happen. One other character, a fortuneteller, played by Marlene Dieterich, gains tremendous screen presence by the use of dark makeup, accentuating her piercing eyes. She is made to look incredibly mysterious in black and white.",

            "content": "TOUCH OF EVIL is filled with the kind of shadowy noir photography and innovative long takes that indicate Welles was trying desperately to produce a film that his devoted fans would think as stunning cinematically as CITIZEN KANE and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. And he almost succeeds because it is the cinematic techniques he uses so well that provide most of the interest in this story of police corruption in a small Mexican border town. Good vs. evil is personified by Mexican narcotics agent Charlton Heston vs. corrupt police officer Orson Welles--with Janet Leigh as innocent victim and some interesting but brief supporting roles from Joseph Cotten, Marlene Dietrich, Mercedes McCambridge and Zsa Zsa Gabor (a bit role). Dennis Weaver is almost unrecognizable as a nervous night clerk at the sleazy, run-down motel where much of the action takes place. Akim Tamiroff creates an interesting thug who proposes a solution to Welles' problems with Heston that backfires. As Harry Quinlan, Welles seems to ooze the kind of oily evil implied by the title, his girth having assumed elephantine proportions by the time this movie was made. Cigar planted firmly in mouth, he looks as seedy and loathsome as the role demands. Marlene Dietrich offers the most astute line in the film when she utters calmly, \"You're a mess\" after he compliments her on her own sleek appearance, after which he admits to too many candy bars along with the hootch.He looms over everyone with his immense frame but delivers a thoroughly believable and consistent performance as the sloppy, massively overweight stateside detective Hank Quinlan who opposes the investigation of a Mexican narcotics agent (played by Heston in dark make-up and mustache) into the car bomb death of a millionaire and his blonde girlfriend that takes place within the first five minutes of the story. Welles is intent on framing a Mexican for the car bombing and almost gets away with it until Heston destroys his plans.Welles creates sympathy for his corrupt official only when he mentions the ugly incident in the past where his wife was strangled and he was unable to bring her murderer to justice. Ever since he has planted evidence to make sure those he believes are responsible pay for their crimes. But overall, his character is consumed by hatred and vengeance and, wisely, he never attempts to soften this aspect of his character.If TOUCH OF EVIL is any indication, Janet Leigh seems to be forever checking into the wrong motels--as she did with even more gruesome results in PSYCHO. Watching her check into this seedy motel gives the viewer a feeling of \"deja vu\". She gives a convincing performance as Heston's feisty American wife. Heston is not entirely believable as a Mexican but gives a strong performance nevertheless.A slight but intriguing tale that is a prime example of the overwhelming use of style over story substance--a device often favored by Welles.",

The opening tracking sequence is a sight to behold and really has a great bit of tension to it. All throughout the film the locations, sounds and lighting really give this film a feel tbat few if any other movies you watch will have. It is so film noir it hurts.Or maybe it is just the acting that hurts. Wells has a great visual sense but his control over his actors almost totally fails him. The perfomances are all flat- none of the actors is helped by a script that is poor. Heston is an unstable actor and here he's at his melodramtic worst. Wells' mumbling character is hard to understand and also overdrawn. Janet Leigh is totally off kilter and sounds just silly on almost every line. None of the other actors rises above the script they have and the night man at the motel gets special kudos for apparently having failed 8th grade drama.The plot here is also nothing special- corrupt cops doing bad things vs the good cop doing the right thing.A few semi-serious comments: Heston looks 100% silly as a Mexican since they use some sort of makeup to make him darker(one suspects in color he'd be orange) and his makeup looks so bad becuase none of the other \"Mexicans\" gets the same makeup treatment so his contrast is all the more striking. Throw in that the bad guy's gang member all sport the jeans, greased beack hair and white t-shirt and you'll think more Sha-Na-Na or West Side Story than menacing gang-bangers.",

            "content": "I have thought it convenient to see again \"Touch of Evil\", before daring to comment this main work in the history of cinema. I don't pretend to be original saying that this movie attains the highest levels of visual beauty, and not just in cinema, but in the whole art of the 20th century. The lights and shadows, the photography, the camera motions, the backgrounds... it's all too stunning to be described: pure work of genius. There is enough matter for a thousand Ph. D's in cinematographic techniques.\nThe part of the story concerned with Quinlan and his evil deeds is quite good. Quinlan is a very interesting character, superbly interpreted by Orson Welles. It should be noted that he is by far the nicest character in the movie, and it's almost impossible not to root for him: perhaps this is a precise artistic choice by the author Orson Welles.Now forgive me for criticizing the heavy improbabilities and flaws we find in the story of \"Touch of Evil\". The whole sub-plot about Vargas' wife Susan (Janet Leigh) is just nonsense from the very beginning. The celebrated Mexican policeman Vargas (Charlton Heston) neglects his spouse, in their very wedding day (!), to investigate a crime which by no means concerns him, and furthermore committed in the USA territory (I guess this is an unacceptable impropriety)... And then Susan is openly threatened and pursued by his mortal enemies, the Grandi's, and the cunning Vargas finds nothing better than leaving her alone at a deserted motel (owned by the Grandi's!)... By the way, also Susan looks incredibly stupid...  When, finally, Vargas remembers that he's a married man, runs to the motel in anxiety for his wife and searches her room, he neither looks in the bathroom to check if, say, Susan's corpse is not in the bath-tub, cut to pieces or something... Really a great job by a first-rate policeman! And the audience (even in 1958) could wonder why the Grandi's don't ACTUALLY rape and drug Susan, instead of just faking it. I realize that such stuff would have been too hot for the censorship of the 1950s: but then it would have been much better to delete the sub-plot with Susan. In the finale we find further absurdities, still regarding Vargas and spouse.I regret to say that these flaws of the plot seriously damage \"Touch of Evil\", a great masterpiece from any other point of view.",

            "content": "Touch of Evil showcases Welles' directorial talents with campy, B-film fluff (not a bad thing), and great character acting by a slew of familiar faces. Yes, yes... everyone talks about the opening shot, which is most definitely brilliant, but it isn't even 1/20th of what makes this film awesome. Once the beginning 5 min ends we are introduced to all the characters ranging from Heston's lack-of-mexican-Mexican D.A. Vargas and the filthy-pig sweating, cop-gone-bad Hank Quinlan played by the masterful Welles himself. The quick edits and wide-angle shots of the dirty alley streets show us we are in for a ride, as we see criminals and seedy characters chillin' in the background of the shadows wondering what their next moves will be. The film doesn't REALLY get cookin' until we see Quinlan confront the mob-boss Grandi in a scene of crazy escalation and groovy, GROOVY music (I swear I can still hear it!). This in particular reminded me of moments from Kubrick's The Killing only made two years prior, which in many ways I recall being similar to this.All-in-all it seems to me that Welles had fun with this one, as we are menaced with his presence while he is on screen and can barely recognize him covered in layers of make-up and prosthetics, and also how everyone brings to the screen a raw energy rarely achieved by an ensemble. Which brings me to... how it's almost comedic when we are watching scenes involving Dennis Weaver's character as the incredibly bizarre motel manager, and reading the trivia confirms it as we learn how Welles told Weaver to act. HILARIOUS. Perhaps it is the second-best performance in the film behind Joseph Calleia's Police Sargent Menzies.It seems weird that Heston's character leaves his wife in questionable scenarios but that is definitely intentional to the character, and Heston himself doesn't even try the Mexican accent, which I think is a minor issue. After all if Heston had attempted the accent we may have ended up with a competitor against Sterling Hayden's floundering Swedish accent in the campy B-film Terror in a Texas Town also released the same year as Touch of Evil.Anyway, kidding aside, I think Touch of Evil is a great film with great moments and talent (can't fail to mention Joseph Calleia was ROBBED of a Supporting Oscar for this one, seriously). Even with arguments of flaws going against it I think Welles and Co. had fun making it.",

The acting was poor, the screenplay was disjointed, and the storyline was illogical. Some examples: Charlton Heston is supposed to be a Mexican. They give him a Cisco Kid mustache but his accent is from Iowa. His new bride, Janet Leigh, and he are on their honeymoon in Tijuana. If you are taking Janet Leigh on a honeymoon, there are certainly much better places to take her than a scruffy border town. But catch more of this logic. Heston is a law officer in Mexico who is pursuing a drug gang. Right at the border, near where they are walking, a bomb blows up a convertible with two people inside. Heston is with his wife. Logic says that he would assume that this is a dangerous place, not only for him but his wife. But that does not stop him. He tells her to go by herself back to the fleabag hotel where they have chosen to spend their honeymoon. On the way, she is accosted by a bunch of toughs who say that they have a message for her husband. And she follows them! Later on, she is undressing in her hotel room, which has no shades and someone shines a flashlight on her from a window across the street. After she covers up, what does she do? Does she turn the light off in her room? Does she call the management? No, she climbs up and unscrews the hot light bulb in her room, (without a tinge of pain) and throws it across the street into the window where the light came from and she hits a bullseye. (Try throwing a light bulb once. It's like throwing a ping-pong ball.) Later Heston can't seem to find another hotel in the town so the takes her to a fleabag motel in the boondocks, where she is the only guest. (I half expected it to be the Bates Motel). She lounges around the room in a bustier, while a gang of toughs in hot cars arrive. She shows absolutely no fear or trepidation at this turn of events. Meanwhile, her husband still does not seem concerned over her safety, even though the motel is owned by the drug gang chief. At the point I turned it off, Heston was holding a meeting with a few American cops and takes them to his hotel room, which looked perfectly fine. Why then is she in the boondocks? Note that there are pointless cameos of Marlene Dietrich and Eva Gabor and even Dennis Weaver whose acting consists of looking back and forth nervously behind a set of overly large glasses.

            "content": "Touch of Evil (1958)Brilliant film-making really does compensate with a roar for that tiny voice saying \"who cares?\" through all the intensity and rollicking of Touch of Evil. In a way, Orson Welles gives us just a touch of evil, and doesn't go whole hog into true malignancy. But he goes all the way and then some into style. The hard, raw filming, the fast dialog and overlapping sounds, the simultaneous playing of events (either foreground and background, or on screen on in the soundtrack), and even the clash and translation of Spanish and English, Mexican and American, make every scene, every frame, something important.Important, that is, to the making of it, and to the film as an object, a technical wonder. Not that there are fatal flaws anywhere--the motel scene (when the gang is there) is horrifying even as it is exaggerated and slightly ludicrous, the double-crossing and hidden agendas are fascinating even as they are improbable (or ultimately too likely in a movie of this drama), and the Mexican stereotypes (alongside the American ones) are part of the grand illustration, not a slice of life reality.The plot, a familiar double-helix of crime and criminals, works just fine, and the characters all have life. Some have plausible real life, though Charlton Heston just barely, as the Mexican top dog. Some are bigger than life, including of course Welles as the corrupt American cop. He's so grand and grandiose he's a marvel and a joke, a wonder and a brilliant riot of connivance. He's his own conglomerate invention made of all the worst clich\u00e9s, but played with such dirty violence and panache (both, even at 300 plus pounds), he's utterly convincing, and one of the silver screen's most vivid caricatures.Then there are the small touches that have ended up being legendary, and influential. One is the breathtaking opening long take, visually and aurally, which of course led to many others, most notably the longer and not nearly as interesting opening to The Player by director Robert Altman. The other coup that needs mentioning is the presence, and a poignant one, of Marlene Dietrich. Welles even has us step back in time when we enter her lair, as if stepping into one of her films. And she gets one of the movie's great lines: \"You should lay off those candy bars.\" Which he does not, preferring her chili, which is not offered. It's like they are both saying, remember the good old days? To us, the movie devotees, we remember, and with real sadness at the final scene we see her walk away, turn for a final glance, and then truly she is gone. \"Adios.\" This rips me up, and it has nothing to do with the plot. It has to do with the movies, and that's where Touch of Evil is shake-your-head fabulous.What do we make of all this? Well, this is truly a Welles kind of product, not so different than Citizen Kane in the broad sweep of mid-20th Century movie-making, and closest of all to Lady of Shanghai in its characterizations and steamy, seamy plot structure. What a change in Welles the man, though, over one decade. Watch with eyes and ears open, and an open mind.",

            "content": "It is fascinating how, in black and white movies, nothing is either black or white, only realities exposed in different shades, some more obscure or enlightened than others. Ultimately, we see what we can see, but very often, what we can see is what we want to see.I read many rave critics of \"Touch of Evil\", but it's funny how they all center on the same subjects: the struggle of Orson Welles to complete the picture, to promote his personal cut, Charlton Heston playing a Mexican, the restored cut of 1998, and of course that long opening track shot. But they seldom tell you what makes the movie so great, which doesn't dismiss this possibility. Still, it sums up for me the case of \"Touch of Evil\", the enthusiasts will see stuff to love, and the skeptics the one to criticize, and the film isn't deprived from both.For instance, I didn't even realize that opening sequence was a long take, I was sure that between the moment you see the bomb being planted and the car driving near the US border, there was a cut, I had to rewind the film just to check. When I realized I was wrong, and we went from a close-up to an aerial view on the squalid Mexican town, the scene grabbed my interest. Welles could have made the shot consist on a simple view of the town and it would still be a technical feat, but he afforded the luxury to expose the main protagonist walking across the street and even to insert some dialogues before the inevitable explosion.Maybe this deliberate difficulty is meant to set the tone of the film, about the inevitability of things. Each character exposes his flaws in the first act like so many symbolic bombs planted on their egos, and waiting to explode later. This is just a personal interpretation and I'm not implying that Welles meant the bomb as symbolical, but I appreciate the fact that the most defining moment of the film consists on a bomb planted in Mexico and exploding after crossing the US border. \"Borders bring the worst of any country\" is one of these lines that carry a deep resonance, and it establishes the setting of \"Touch of Evil\" as the place where opposite entities or philosophies are confronted, where nothing or none is immune to that touch of evil when confronted to such ugliness, this is perhaps the reason why it is considered one of the last (and most emblematic) noir movies.Indeed, as a film-noir, \"Touch of Evil\" delivers some of the most stylist directing, so darkly brilliant it overshadows a rather complex story, which isn't a bad thing. But let's just establish it as the confrontation between a honest, but rather naive and shortsighted named Vargas, a Mexican law enforcer played by Charlton Heston and Chief Captain, Hank Quinlan, a morbidly obese and disgustingly sweating cop adored by his crew, but suspected of planting evidence to break cases faster. There is also Amin Tamiroff as a sleazy local crook named Joe Grandi and Janet Leigh is Mrs. Vargas, a beautiful American, hostage of a scheme that will put her in the hands of Grandi's gang in a sleazy Southern hotel. The night-man is played by a young Dennis Weaver and in such peculiar autistic-like manner it's like a foretaste of Norman Bates.There is also Marlene Dietrich as a madam who have some history with Quinlan, but she's symbolically keeping herself in the shadow. The only history known comes from Menzies (Joseph Calleias) who venerates Quinlan ever since he took a bullet from him, and it completes the rather complex portrait of Quinlan in the most confusing way. What we've got is a film, with corruption, narcotics, power, vengeance as backdrops, and a cat-and-mouse thriller mixed with a chess-game between two men, two visions of Justice, one who believes in his hunches and on who considers \"Police job is only easy in a Police state\". Still, what strikes in these characters is less their intelligence than their flaws, their actions drive the story less than their mistakes, it seems like Orson Welles, the director, let his story being governed by the human factor to enhance its capacity to surprise or shock the viewers. He goes a few times for cheap thrills but they're redeemed by the use of shadows and an original editing, sometimes, he overplays them, but we should be careful not to judge the film from our contemporary standpoint. When it was screened in 1958, it received multiple accolades and was a source of inspiration for New Wave directors. But like Welles' movies, the story of the making is even more fascinating than the making itself, his film was heavily edited without his permission and it's not until 1998 that we could have the closest version to his original idea. And I think it does justice to the vision of the artist. Now, are we overestimating the value of this film?Well, the film undoubtedly inspired Hitchock's \"Psycho\", featuring Mrs. Leigh is another dangerous motel, shot with the same low budget, and with the same B-movie feel. Yet \"Psycho\" is more unanimously appreciated, maybe because of its more linear and understandable narrative. Maybe Welles, like Quinlan's counterpart was too wrapped up by his own ambitions he failed to see it was severely compromising his work. And that Dietrich said he \"had no future\" sadly echoed the fact that this would be his last Hollywood film. But I don't want to fall in that trap, this is from Roger Ebert's review and I don't want to steal his lines. I might just conclude paraphrasing the words of Dietrich: \"this is just some kind of film, and what does it matter what people say\"",

The chief detective is Orson Welles, full of his splendid self, excessively corpulent, and sporting a hawkish putty nose. He eats candy. (\"It's either that or the booze,\" he rumbles in his commanding bass voice.) He dresses worse than Lieutenant Columbo. Oh, Heston may dash around a lot, seeking justice, and his wife may be threatened by pachucos and hypodermic-wielding lesbians, and there may be multiple uncredited cameos, and Dennis Weaver may turn in the performance of his life as an inn keeper with the animation of a jack-in-the-box but it's Welles' porcine presence that dominates in the film.It's hard to know what to make of it. It's inexpensively made and, according to Heston, Welles could simply not bring himself to edit and put an end to it. The cinematic conventions of the 1950s were being deep sixed. The Nouvelle Vague was establishing itself in France. Welles' film, too, discards many of the triter movie conventions -- good hero, bad villain, coherent plot -- but it doesn't belong to any school of film, or even any genre. It's Welles' own.There is a justifiably famous opening shot that shows us a bomb placed in car trunk. The camera then follows the car as it's driven around town, across the border, through crowded streets, until -- boom. The shot is a lengthy one and the camera rises up over rooftops and swoops slowly down for details.Heston's alien lawyer is mostly ineffective. The law is in Welles' hands and he's an ambiguous figure. He's straight enough, for a small-town cop, but given to planting evidence without a qualm, and not above strangling a gangster who threatens to expose him.Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" of seventeen years earlier was an undisputed masterpiece. How good is \"Touch of Evil\"? It's fascinating without being perfectly executed. It's the story of the downfall of a man who is gross and generally unpleasant, but whom we've come to know and even pity a little. It meanders all over the place and is often confusing as hell. Sometimes I didn't know which side of the border we were on. The dialog is functional but little of it is memorable. Welles grins slyly at Marlene Dietrich, an ex girl friend, and hints he might come back to \"sample some more of her chili\" sometime. (\"You a mess, honey,\" she tells him.) Welles tells a suspect that after the explosion, \"We found a shoe in the road. There was a foot in that shoe. We're going to make you pay for that, boy.\" If it had been made by someone else, a brand new director, it might have been hailed as an innovative first feature. Knowing it was made by Welles, who could add an enflourage to anything with his bag of tricks, it's a bit of a disappointment, despite its eccentricities and because of its longueurs.I always enjoy watching it when it shows up on cable TV but I wouldn't enjoy multiple viewings too often. Compared to \"Citizen Kane,\" which was prepared with infinite care, this looks like a pretty sloppy lash up. Maybe Orson Welles would have been better off if he hadn't made \"Citizen Kane.\" Everything that came afterward seems a let down. And Welles, his apologists notwithstanding, didn't help matters much himself.",

            "content": "Another one of those grand re-discovered masterpieces that critics invent superlatives to describe, while the average film fans cannot figure out what all the hoopla is about. Orson Welles must lead the pack in the most overrated director category. His Citizen Kane is easily the most over-valued production in history \u2013 an emotionally glacial epic still gliding on the controversy of its day because it was thinly veiled inspiration of William Randolph Hearst's life. Years later, we get Touch of Evil, which is obviously meant to be a latter day homage to film noir, but lacks the depth or intelligence of any of the best examples of that genre.The film opens with an impressive tracking shot preceding a car explosion. Critics and film students will write entire dissertations about this opening shot and insist that one must view the film for it alone. This conveniently overlooks that literally nothing of worth happens after this and if you have no interest in elaborate tracking shots, then the film will hold no value to you. The storyline is an utter mess \u2013 a lurid illogical and tedious grade-B crime melodrama, which blends themes of drugs, corruption, gangs, and muted sexual sadism in a Mexican border town into an inscrutable mish-mash. Welles casts himself as a corrupt cop at the center of the intrigue and spends the majority of the film lumbering around in a semi-stupor, as if moving from point A to B was a feat too much to expect from a man of his girth. If his intent was to convince that evil is banal and boring, he has succeeded in spades because that is exactly how his performance comes off. Charlton Heston \u2013 never the greatest actor \u2013 is even less adequate here than usual, criminally miscast as a righteous Mexican lawman caught up in the action (and I use that term advisedly) while on his honeymoon with his nubile intellectually dim wife, Janet Leigh. Heston is apparently Mexican by way of Middle America and the make-up booth. If Welles spends the film lumbering, then Heston spends the film pontificating inane dialog while posturing in over-the-top displays of piety.Considering the accolades heaped on this film, it is incredible that so few of its fans notice its laughable lapses in logic. Heston is supposed to be an intelligent and sympathetic guy, yet he spends the entire film repeatedly abandoning his wife in a strange country, where violence seems to occur every few moments and barely gives a thought about it. At one point, he insists on moving her out of their more populated hotel to one in the backwoods that makes the domicile in Vacancy look like a Hilton. The film is positively schizophrenic about the Leigh character. Some scenes depict her as a tough no-nonsense lady, but then they are followed by scenes where she inexplicably devolves into a cowering victim who illogically keeps placing herself in danger \u2013 usually in a state of provocative undress. By the time that threatening bikers and their butch molls crash the hotel, it becomes surreal that Leigh is still strutting around in a google-eyed palsy wearing outfits that would make Madonna blush. And let's not even touch on Marlene Dietrich's glorified cameo as an enigmatic fortune teller, or a wild-eyed Dennis Weaver as the shifty hotel manager. Subplots come and then are abandoned without a thought \u2013 characters filter in and out of the film with little to no impact. But let us never forget, according to Welles fanatics, it is not the story or acting that count, it is those great camera shots! After all, camera shots make the movie.By the time the film limps to its uninspired, underwhelming and thoroughly unsurprising conclusion, precious few will give a damn about any of the people on screen. Dietrich's final line of dialog describing the Welles character is hilariously pointless, which perfectly sums up the film that we have just watched. As film noir goes, one can find infinitely better sources \u2013 ones that actually have coherent plots and characters that make some degree of sense. Unless one wants to endlessly tout the technical aspects, Touch of Evil only emphasizes Welles weaknesses as a director \u2013 much like an early day George Lucas, he is obsessed with the technical aspects of his film (lighting, camera work, etc.) but has no interest in the story or the people populating his landscape of light and shadow. As a result, many of his films \u2013 and Touch of Evil is no exception \u2013 have a tendency to be empty, emotionally joyless exercises geared only to film insiders who want to endlessly pontificate on infinitesimal technical minutiae and laborious camera tricks.",

            "content": "Touch of Evil (1958) directed by Orson Welles is a great film, in fact in my opinion it is one of the greatest film-noirs ever put to the silver screen.One of the obvious reasons for this is in the brilliant plot revolving around Mexico's chief narcotics officer, Mike Vargas, who is in a border town on a quick honeymoon with his American wife. Soon he must testify against Grandi, a drug lord whose brother and sons are tracking him, hoping to scare his wife and back him off the case. When a car bomb kills a rich U. S. developer, Vargas embroils himself in the investigation, putting his wife in harm's way. After Vargas catches local legendary U. S. cop, Hank Quinlan, planting evidence against a Mexican national suspected in the bombing, Quinlan joins forces with the Grandi family to impugn Vargas's character. Local political lackeys, a hard-edged whore, pachucos, and a nervous motel clerk also figure in the plot.Aside from the brilliant plot, Orson Welles' execution of his direction is none other than amazing. His camera work is astounding with gorgeous cinematography, a sparse and suspenseful score, and importantly the brilliant performances of Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh completes the experience.Highly recommended film-noir that still stands among other seminal film-noir masterpieces such as Sunset Blvd. (1950) and The Killing (1956).",

            "content": "TOUCH OF EVIL is my favorite thing that Orson Welles has ever done. Although quite obviously many critics and film scholars regard the genius' 1941 all-time classic CITIZEN KANE as the greatest film of all time (I might be inclined to agree with them), I still prefer TOUCH OF EVIL as my personal fave of his. TOUCH OF EVIL is in its own way just very influential and groundbreaking as KANE. It is has many genres working together in absolute perfect synergy: the detective story, film noir, the thriller, social commentary, and the character study.Set in a small town at the Texas-Mexico border, the film starts out with one of the great opening scenes in film: a long, uncut tracking shot beginning with someone (unknown to the viewer) putting a bomb in the trunk of the car of an individual we soon find out is a prominent businessman who has in his company a local prostitute that he is taking back to the American side of the border. During this tracking shot, we meet our hero Mike Vargas (well played by Charlton Heston), a Mexican government attorney and his American wife Susan(played by the always reliable Janet Leigh). Soon, they hear explosion, the car of the aforementioned businessman.Vargas begins to investigate and since it occurred on the American side of the border, the local Texas cops step in and take over. They are led by Capt. Hank Quinlan (played by the master director himself Orson Welles in my favorite performance of his). Quinlan is an aging, blustery, prejudiced alcoholic cop who is long past his prime and constantly mourns for his long dead wife, who was murdered some 30 years before in the only case in his career that he couldn't solve. This has haunted Quinlan his whole life, so he is a take-no-prisoners cop who will do ANYTHING to ensure the prosecution of criminals: plant evidence, blackmail, and even kill.Meanwhile, in addition to the current murder case, Vargas is trying to prosecute a Mexican drug lord named Grande, so his brother 'Uncle' Grande gets his nephews to help him stop Vargas by harassing Mrs. Vargas and thus getting Vargas to drop the case against his brother. Vargas is also trying to prove Quinlan to be a dirty cop, so that Grande and Quinlan have a common goal in discrediting and destroying Vargas.TOUCH OF EVIL is one of the most original films that you will ever see. It is visually stunning: set mostly at nighttime it perfectly captures the film noir look and feel. Most of the film is shot at those famed angles that Welles liked to use to add to the dramatic effect. You can constantly hear Mexican music playing in the background from the local Mexican gin joints and cathouses to add flavor to the action going on. There are also some very disturbing scenes and moments: a gang rape, various racial epithets, an attempt to burn someone with acid. It is a film very much before its time.Not only are the leads Welles, Heston, and Leigh great, but there is also a host memorable supporting characters, most notably Uncle Grande, Quinlan's assistant Sgt. Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), and the local Mexican madam played by the legendary Marlene Dietrich. She only has 2 or 3 scenes in the film and damn near steals it! TOUCH OF EVIL is an original, enjoyable, thrilling film experience. Welles' most entertaining film!",

            "content": "The story about Orson Welles picking the crummiest crime novel to film in return for getting paid to direct it may be apocryphal, as might so many Wellesian legends, and is certainly attractive, but of course in taking on a pulp fiction plot with so much of the pulp about it that it could have been a paper factory, of course being Orson, he had to incidentally make a film which feels like the last great B and W film noir, not including \"Psycho\", which is a different beast altogether.Speaking of which, here we also get to see Janet Leigh in a state of undress and distress at a small motel with villainous caretakers, although at least in this one she gets through her boarding period alive if far from unscathed. Leigh is the young newly-wed wife of her principled, Mexican-born husband, top-cop Charlton Heston, whose only concessions on-screen to his supposed birthplace are a sun-tan and Zapata moustache. Quite why he takes her to a town on the Mexican / American border for their honeymoon is anyone's guess and it's no surprise before the new Mr and Mrs Vargas in different ways are inveigled into a plot containing a double murder, police corruption, a kidnapping, gang rape and more murders, especially after the corpulent figure of Welles himself as chief of police Hank Quinlan, shows up, keen to pin the blame for the initial killings on a young Mexican boy.The plot is hardly important here as Welles flexes his muscles in serving up a suitably grimy and gritty drama with one superb set-up after another as the film makes its serpentine way to its bathetic conclusion. So we get low-angle shots, extreme close-ups, crowded frames, overlapping dialogue all topped and tailed by the magnificently staged introductory extended take and guest star Marlene Dietrich's valedictory closing lines on the demise of her old lover, Quinlan.Welles and Dietrich's sheer star power dominates the acting stakes but there are no real weak links in the cast here, even including Heston.I'm tempted to close by saying that if this is what Welles could do with a Grade Z script, you might wonder how he would make out with a Grade A screenplay, but of course he'd already been there and done that with \"Kane\" and \"Ambersons\".The man could have filmed the phone book and brought it to life.",

He was signed to play the corrupt cop Hank Quinlan in a routine Universal thriller, produced by Albert Zugsmith, who made a handful of memorable pictures in the 50s before going into a sleazy freefall.  Charlton Heston agreed to star only if Welles directed; Welles wrote the script in a couple of weeks.\"Citizen Kane\" frequently heads polls of the greatest pictures ever made, though some think \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" is as good or better.  But the weird and wonderful noir pulp thriller \"Touch of Evil\" is Welles' cult favourite.  From the elaborate opening sequence to the final exchange as Quinlan's body sinks into the garbage dump, it demonstrates the cinema's ability to make a melodramatic story plausible by creating a baroque expressionistic style of deep focus, high and low angles, heavy shadows, sweeping crane shots, fast tracking movements, garish hotel rooms, and sordid neon-lit streets, creating a mood that embodies the lives of the characters.  The tormented Quinlan, his wife murdered, himself crippled by a gangster's bullet, is a tragic figure, as complex as Charles Foster Kane, Macbeth, or Falstaff.  He is an evil man, yet he intuitively knows the guilty from the innocent, and he is destroyed by breaching his own twisted code.  The movie is populated by grotesques like \"Uncle Joe\" Grandi with his ill-fitting wig, the blind woman shopkeeper, and the deranged motel clerk. Vargas is perhaps the only normal, untainted character, and he's the voice of decency, though dull and unimaginative.",

            "content": "Orson Welles was undoubtedly one of the finest filmmakers of the twentieth century, and yet the entire span of his career carried with it an air of tragedy. Knowing exactly what he wanted in his films, Welles frequently stood on the toes of studio executives, usually unsuccessfully, and most of his pictures were eventually cut and re-cut into completely different entities. By the end of his career, studios were refusing to fund any of his films, numerous projects were abandoned and Welles' lingering cinematic genius went to waste. With the exception of 'The Magnificent Ambersons (1942),' 'Touch of Evil (1958)' is the director's most famous butchered masterpiece. Furious with the alterations that had been made to his work, Welles wrote a 58-page memo highlighting the changes he would like to see made. It was not until 1998 that a \"director's cut\" based upon Welles' wishes was edited and released, and this is the version that I have just enjoyed, considered definitive by most Wellsians. Additionally, I was lucky enough to experience the film in the cinema, in a classic double-bill with Carol Reed's 'The Third Man (1949).'Welcome to Los Robles, a small town on the border of Mexico and the United States. As by-the-book Mexican narcotics cop Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) explains, \"all border towns bring out the worst in a country.\" Drugs, alcohol and firearms do a steady trade; greed and corruption stretches to the very heights of law enforcement. Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) is the most respected American detective in the region, but he is as corrupt as the criminals whom he puts behind bars daily. Unshaven, obese, obsessed and arrogant, Quinlan boasts no redeeming qualities, a stupid and dangerous hunk of flesh. He is truly a formidable villain, and perhaps one of the finest that I have seen in a film: he's Harry Lime without the likable boyish charisma. However, and herein lies the dilemma, Quinlan is one helluva good detective, and his procedures, however dubious, often get the job done. But is it acceptable to convict even a guilty criminal based on fabricated evidence, or does this make Quinlan the worst criminal of all?After a home-made bomb tears apart the vehicle of a wealthy American businessman (via an astonishing uninterrupted three-minute crane tracking shot), Detective Vargas offers his aid in solving the crime. He is currently on a honeymoon with his newly-married American wife, Susie (Janet Leigh), but his job appears to be a priority to him, and he is often neglectful of the women he loves. Few are enthusiastic about having a Mexican's help in the case, and Vargas' involvement will later lead Quinlan to cross the line between dishonesty and pure evil. Filmed as a B-movie on a B-movie budget (Welles was paid meager $125,000 for his writing, acting and directorial duties, only to have his film butchered by the producers), 'Touch of Evil' exploits its low-budget roots for maximum shock value, inviting the audience into a highly-exaggerated, unrelentingly-sinister web of deceit, lies, betrayal and murder. Almost every supporting character \u0096 from the bulging Quinlan to the sleazy, slimy Mexican drug-lords of the Grandi family \u0096 have not a redeeming value to their characters.Commentaries on 'Touch of Evil,' even the overwhelmingly positive ones, find it obligatory to include a snide remark on Charlton Heston's unsuitability for the role. I had no such qualms. Having seen fewer Heston films than I'd like to admit, and so being unacquainted with his all-American image, I found him quite believable as the Mexican Mike Vargas, his unflinching moral determination often leading him to abandon his damsel-in-distress wife when she most needs him. Orson Welles, his already-wide girth complemented by large amounts of padding and low-angle cinematography, is a genuinely menacing antagonist, especially when one considers a distant past when Quinlan must have been an honest detective. The Police Captain's long-time partner and good friend, Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia) grovels admiringly at the feet of his superior, a somewhat pathetic devotee \u0096 forced to risk everything for the sake of his duty to the law \u0096 who ultimately lends an air of dignity to the parade of dark characters.Charlton Heston wasn't far off the mark when he described 'Touch of Evil' as \"the greatest B-movie ever made.\" The film does, indeed, descend into subject matter of such squalor and revulsion that it seems the work of a filmmaker outside the polished Hollywood studio system. Nevertheless, the film is also the work of a consummate professional, with outstanding camera-work that often employs smoothly-shot long-takes. It's this contrast that I find most interesting about the film: Welles is utilising stylish and classy artistry to capture an environment completely devoid of style or class, a retched and depraved community of low-lives and petty criminals, drugs and sex, murder and corruption. This raw pulpiness, momentarily realised in the open minutes of Aldrich's 'Kiss Me Deadly (1955),' is here brought to its apex. Welles' film, though completely overlooked at the 1959 Academy Awards, has since developed the status of a classic, and is perhaps his most celebrated film after his extraordinary 1941 debut, 'Citizen Kane.' It was also the last film that the director would complete in Hollywood.",

            "content": "In the history of movies 'Touch of Evil', the 1958 film 'noir' by Orson Welles played perhaps a more important role in European and especially French cinema than in American cinema. It is a story of gangsters that takes place in the border area between the USA and Mexico, a film that gathers in its cast some glorious names from at least three generations of actors, an entertainment film and that pursues commercial success, but is made with the means of master of cinema. Like many of Welles' other projects, 'Touch of Evil' had a turbulent history. If the legend is true, the young French filmmakers Truffaut and Godard may have seen the film several times more than Welles himself, who claimed to have seen it only once. In the years following the production, the two, who had awarded to 'Touch of Evil' the 'Cahiers du Cinema' award, were to direct their first films as independent directors and start what would be called the 'New French Wave'. They all viewed in fact a film version edited by the big studios that was not to Welles' liking. Today's viewers enjoy a version restored and re-edited in 1998 according to the director's notes kept by Charlton Heston, the lead actor, a version considered closer to Welles' intentions.\nThe story takes place in a small border town in Texas. Today, in the age of the walls between countries, it is difficult for us to imagine that six decades ago there were such cities divided by a border marked just by the booth of a customs officer or border guard. However, the problems seem to have been about the same as today, with street violence and gangs of drug traffickers controlling the day and night lives (with all the specific vices) of the inhabitants. The rather complicated story of Mexican police officer Vargas (Charlton Heston) confronting criminals and the corrupt police led by Captain Quinlan (Orson Welles), endangering his family and especially his new American wife (Janet Leigh) could be included with minor changes in the genre of films whose action takes place on both sides of the violent border between the United States and Mexico. It can be said in fact that 'Touch of Evil' inaugurated or was the first remarkable film in a series that continues to this day.\nThe cinematic qualities of the film are exceptional. We are dealing, as in many of Welles' films, with a copious portion of vertical takes, from close-ups filmed from the bottom up to car trails on the city streets that I can't imagine how they were filmed (on location, in Venice, CA, they say!) at a time when drones did not even exist in dreams. For the first time in a movie of the big studios, the handheld camera is used in street scenes. In the following years, French directors had to make consistent use of this device on the streets of Paris. The sound recorded directly in scenes that take place in cars is also, I believe, a technical premiere. All these cinematographic tricks serve the story that flows smoothly, the film has rhythm and humour. The acting performances are just right. Heston and Leigh are of course the protagonists, but Welles steals the show in a composition role in which he added about 20 years and 30 kilograms to his not very fragile body structure through make-up. Dennis Weaver creates an extremely interesting supporting role. Marlene Dietrich is magnificent in the five key scenes in which she appears. 'Touch of Evil' is one of those classic films that manages the performance of attracting and satisfying both film noir viewers and art film lovers even at over 60 years after its making.",

(It was the restored version according to the announcer). Over the weekend I watched it again, hoping that my faith in Orson Wells's talent would be renewed, and instead I was shocked to see how bad it really looked today. Totally overdone, over-stylized, over-dramatized, over-acted with a convoluted plot that was unconvincing. In addition, the casting of Charlton Heston as a Mexican was totally ludicrous (and almost at the level of slapstick). It was just bad all the way...unbelievably bad! Even Orson Welles's performance was excessive, cynical, downbeat, and unreal. I had to struggle to watch the entire two hours, as painful as it was.I went back to the book I have \"The Films of Orson Wells\" by James Howard, and renewed my knowledge of the production. The studio considered the final cut \"unmarketable and fragmented\", and took it out of Orson Welles's hands completely. Even though Orson offered to re-shoot certain scenes to their specifications, he was barred permanently from the lot.(\"Shades\" of the final results of \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" at the RKO studios!).A new director, Harry Keller, was brought in to re-shoot some of the scenes, and some cuts were made as well. Most people have probably only seen this version, rather than Welles's original version. (Which may explain why it has a better reputation than it deserves.)A lot of us sentimental fans of \"Citizen Kane\" keep hoping (against hope apparently), that age will redeem some of Orson Wells's other films, so that he will not be forever considered as having had \"beginner's luck\" with his first film (with an assist from a very good screenplay writer, Herman J. Mankiewicz -brilliant!, and interesting subject matters concerning William Randolph Hearst). Alas...it doesn't appear to ever be possible.

You can't like anyone in this movie. Sheriff Quinlan is a racist, a gourmand, corrupt through and through, and has no respect for the process of law. And yet he turns out to have been right about everything, and the script addresses this pointedly.Charlton Heston is the straight-shooting hero, yet Welles goes to great trouble to humiliate him ... making him powerless to protect his wife from the various lowlifes that threaten her, making him chase around Welles at the end with a short-distance radio transmitter which requires him to crawl through sewage to stay within range. Is it also intentional that Heston's Spanish is so poor? Is Welles afraid to let us like anyone?You can't doubt that Welles was a brilliant guy, but in my opinion he never made it as a creator of good filmed literature ... never became the Shakespeare of film ... because he had so little compassion for the human condition, and viewed everyone with an aloof and somewhat contemptuous eye.OK, Orson, you're technically and intellectually dazzling.

But I don't think the film is a masterpiece, as many say.",

            "content": "This film, which I believe surpasses Citizen Kane, sets off with a well-known three-minute unbroken tracking shot beginning on the Mexico side of the Mexico/US border with a man placing a bomb in a car and following the crossing of the car past the border. The shot ends the scene with Charlton Heston, curiously playing a Mexican, and Janet Leigh, in a bold performance as his newlywed, kissing. There is then a cut to the car, exploding along with its two passengers. It is the busy nature of so many scenes, the elaborate camera-work and blocking, the dialogue overlapping itself with characters speaking concurrently, characters leaving, returning, leaving, returning, that make this 1958 thriller so gripping.Heston, as a matter of fact, is a police official in the Mexican government. He takes in the consequences of a Mexican bomb blowing up on American soil and starts to probe the scene, on which the police chief and district attorney shortly arrive, as well as the police captain played by the 300+-pound but still spotlight-obsessed Orson Welles, who is tagged alongside by his loyal crony. Over the course of the movie, Heston finds that Welles may have been planting evidence to facilitate his intimidating long line of convictions. His suspicion grows when his wife Leigh is kidnapped and framed for a murder to ruin him.As always, Welles must telegraph across every frame that he is in that he is the center of its attention, and during every frame he is not in, he must announce that he is behind the camera capturing it. With Welles's earlier efforts, even the overwhelmed Citizen Kane, Welles made such an infatuated endeavor out of heralding his presence both on and off screen that story is of lesser consequence, overshadowed by his chief interest which was how he could make it more differently and originally than anyone before him. Touch of Evil, however, is driven by plot. Thus, the story, which just about ties itself in knots, is thick and complex enough to subordinate all of the surrounding elements. Because of this, Welles's energetic, attention-grabbing camera-work and editing devices become partaking characters in the action.It is things like this film's climax that reinforce my cynicism about information age cinema. In 1958, police recording a conversation had so much more raw potential for suspense. Now that everything's so convenient, what do we get? Live Free or Die Hard.",

Seems like his film making talents have gone backwards since that time. The plot is non-sensical. But maybe that's because the acting and directing were so distracting. The actors performs as if they were on stage and the audience is 20 yards away. In other words, extremely over-the-top. Charlten Heston managed to score probably the worst acting job I've seen. The storyline is told almost entirely through dialog - and bad dialog that is. Normally I would labor through an entire film, even if bad, just to see how the ending turns out. But watching ToE was just too painful. I stopped after about 30 minutes and couldn't care less how the ending turned out. Thank goodness movies aren't made like this anymore.

            "content": "In a crummy frontier town, Mexican-born lawyer Victor Vargas and his young American wife travel on their honeymoon to revisit Victor's origins, also allowing him rest from an important case against the criminal Grande family. This romantic trip is rudely interrupted by the grizzly assassination of an important American figure on the border. Enter Detective Hank Quinlan, a corrupt monster of a cop intent on pushing any boundaries to solve the case. His methods soon clash with those of the more idealist Vargas, who can not help but get involved, only to find vindicative Grande relatives in his path.As with all non-Shakespeare Welles films, this is pretty long to sum up. Yet Touch of Evil was based on a second-rate detective novel and Orson Welles's involvement was purely accidental. Requested to play Quinlan opposite Charlton Heston (Vargas) and Vivien Leigh (Vargas's wife), Heston soon convinced the studio to hire Welles to direct, admirable proof of fan devotion for sure.Welles made the screenplay almost impossible to relate to the source novel and borough priceless added value: his virtuoso visual style (beyond the incredible 5 minute opening shot, Touch of Evil is as visually stunning as anything by Welles), smooth direction and many of his old-time collaborators. Akim Tamiroff (as Joe Grande) and Joseph Cotten (as a US district attorney) are marvelous, as always. Leigh pulls her weight and Heston, though nobody's idea of a Mexican (looney Toons have given us more realistic depictions!) turns in a very decent and watchable performance. Welles steals the show (again) as Quinlan, enhancing his already impressive figure with pads and prosthetics, as if the character's moral corruption were showing physically, like a disease. He also makes Quinlan a dangerous psychotic who can often come across as quite sympathetic (or pathetic, at the very least...).So why call this film a display of Midas touch? Because what was destined to be forgettable pulp and has a byzantine plot with big holes and a greased and mustached Charlton Heston was taken by Welles, reshaped, and transformed into gold. Touch of Evil has flaws but has the wisdom to exploit the flaws as other eccentric elements of the odd noir world it creates. Touch of Evil is one of the finest crime films ever, and well worth your time.Intriguing and darkly enjoyable entertainment.",

            "content": "Orson Welles would never reach his Kane days again. Instead of focusing on what could have been we see that Welles wasn't a one trick pony. 'Touch of Evil' is by far the best film noir ever made. Visually it has moments that surpass even some of Kane's impressive sequences. I don't think there was a director who handled his camera better than Orson Welles.What is also extremely impressive is how Welles handles this story. The story is really the only problem this picture has going for it. Welles is given a basic dime story mystery and asked to make gold with it. I mean every character is nothing more than a cut out of countless mystery clich\u00e9s. Welles not only makes this story work but he makes it compelling as well.As an actor I think Welles gets the least respect. His Quinlan is an underrated performance. To see Quinlan is to see loneliness, self hate, and uncertainty. I don't think this picture becomes the classic it has become if Welles hadn't delivered such a fine performance as Quinlan. He is a towering figure that Welles plays without his signature baritone voice. It is raspier and sadder than some of his late interviews. We feel a sense of pity for Quinlan and we are meant to for the film. Quinlan truly doesn't see what he does as wrong, it's all about the endgame. He can't be the man everyone expects him to be. I love the fact that in the end he sacrificed everything and it was all for nothing. I can't help but grieve when he is told his \"future is all used up\" by Tanya, his Mexican fortune teller. Quinlan is arched after the Shakespearean tragic heroes that Welles loved so.Charlton Heston has been given an incredible bad rap with this film. He is shot down for his portrayal of a Mexican, Vargas. I think this is extremely unfair to Chuck and I actually think he does exactly what is needed here. He looks a little silly in the make-up but he portrays the character as moral, bright, and with an unwavering center. Maybe he is a little naive but we root for him. He is the policeman while Hank is the detective. I think Chuck Heston was one of the best choices for playing this strict good man.What makes 'Touch of Evil' extraordinary however is Welles cinematography and camera work. Welles has actually beaten the Billy Wilder film noir pictures in terms of technical achievement. Remembered most is the iconic opening sequence following the bomb placed in a car trunk. However I think what is even more impressive tension wise is the ending. Vargas following Quinlan and his partner under the bridge is as suspenseful as anything Hitchcock ever did.It's said that Film Noir ended around this time, but I think Welles really ended it. His 'Touch of Evil' is the best of this genre. The murky rooms, the blatant sexual undertones, the folly of man, and the femme fatale are all at their best here.",

A recent viewing proved to me that these aren't deficiencies, they actually enhance the film, and that it's every bit as influential and groundbreaking as Citizen Kane. Orson Welles is magnificently corrupt, proving that he wasn't just a good director, he was also a fine actor, capable of profound nuance with a glance or a muttered line, or a terrifying facial expression. I don't know anything about the process of filmmaking, but to direct and act in your own film must require a certain amount of skill, madness, or both. I had to laugh at what is at least the second time that Janet Leigh is stuck with a creepy innkeeper, and Dennis Weaver is ten times creepier than Anthony Perkins was in Psycho. The end scene is a case study in suspenseful filmmaking, and I have to wonder how long it took to film....everyone talks about the innovative opening shot, but the end scene is shot from so many angles that Welles must have exhausted every single vantage point in order to nail it down. I came away impressed this time around, and I think it's a great tragedy that Welles's career took him down some different roads in the years ahead, who knows what he could have accomplished if he had been just as committed to his artistry as he clearly was for this film.",

Throughout the story we are just given clues until the exciting conclusion of who's the good and who's the bad.Like I said, another brilliantly executed film by Orson Welles and a true classic that Hollywood is missing today. But I'm sure most agree with me that Heston's Spanish accent has to be the funniest accent in movie history!

View this movie without lying to yourself about its supposed brilliant director.I've read that the opening scene is supposed to be one of the greatest in the history of movies. It may have been tough to achieve from a technical standpoint, but as a viewer I was not impressed. It may excite some easy-to-please Hitchcock fans, but there was nothing thrilling about TOE to me. The scene: someone plants a bomb in a car, and then we wait for it to blow up. Big deal. That scene, as this entire movie, is just another example of the ludicrous overestimation of Orson Welles's talents. This \"divine\" director hasn't made a single great movie, yet the accolades that go along with his name just keep rolling off the tongues of various self-deluded film-critics. TOE is a typical Welles movie: the camera work is ahead of its time, but the story and dialogue are banal and even idiotic at times. Style over substance, as with that piece of crap \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", and that supposed classic \"Citizen Kane\" which might be, along with \"Casablanca\", the most overrated movie of all time. Besides, \"Citizen Kane\" was embraced by Hollywood for political reasons...First of all, Heston as a Mexican. You can paint him brown all you want - and then send him to 25 solariums - he does not look like one. Worse of all, he doesn't even talk like one. Heston and Leigh look like an all-American couple, from Mexico??Heston gets attacked with acid, his wife is practically abducted by a gang member with intent to intimidate her, and then Heston and Leigh are even followed by the gang leader - and what does Heston do in the face of all this danger? He leaves his wife in a remote motel in the middle of nowhere!! WHY?? Just so Welles can have his dumb plot twists?An honest, upright Mexican cop/lawyer/whatever and a totally corrupt, semi-insane American one? Talk about a reality reversal. But in Welles's confused, liberal mind that is how things are in real life: America the evil, and the rest of the world its victim; a viewpoint wholeheartedly supported by Hollywood's Leftists, i.e. 98% of Hollywood. (In fact, Welles's political affiliations had a LOT to do with his overblown reputation as a film-maker.)Welles's criminal cop character talks about how idealists ruin things in this world. Anyone familiar with Welles and Hollywood politics will know that he wasn't being general here at all, but was specifically referring to Communists or Socialists as the kind of \"idealists\" we should all admire and emulate. Ironically, I have to agree with the bad guy cop on this, even though I'm not supposed to...Welles's corrupt cop leaves his cane at the scene of the crime?? Isn't he supposed to be sly, cunning...? I am amazed that Welles couldn't even decide if he wanted to make a serious movie or not. TOE borders on comedy, parody even, most of the time, yet the plot is meant to be \"serious\". Some of the characters, such as the gang boss and the corrupt cop, are straight out of a comic-book - or a cheap dime-a-dozen noir B-movie; silly caricatures so typical of 50s celluloid baloney. The dialogue may verge on the amusing at times, but because this never becomes a comedy it ends up sounding merely silly, like in those dumb John Huston/Bogart detective films. And the highly annoying soundtrack doesn't exactly help. Henry Mancini or not, the music only lends extra goofiness to the movie.I had to also wonder why Welles gave himself a fake nose and the rest? Did he consider his oh-so noble facial features to be too divine to play a crook convincingly? I don't see what possible rational reason he could have had for this. Peter Sellers wasn't this funny with his fake schnoz in a Pink Panther movie.For some reason, Welles decides to leave one of the dumbest lines for the ending, when a ridiculous, movie-clich\u00e9-looking, Tarot-card-reading mystical \"gypsy\" Dietrich says rather pathetically: \"What can you say about anybody? He was some kind of a man.\" Yeah, obese and overrated...\"He was some kind of a man\". (That reminds me of a line at the end of Ed Wood's \"Plan 9\" movie.) Yeah, some kind of man... overrated and bloated.Sick of Bergman's pretentious drivel?

            "content": "It looks like me & Orson Welles' films are simply not meant to be compatible with each other. After all, Citizen Kane is hailed by viewers, critics & filmmakers alike as the greatest motion picture ever made but it didn't leave much of an impression on me apart from its technical inventions, not to mention that I was able to finish it in one go on my 7th attempt.And even though somehow I managed to sit through Orson Welles' Touch of Evil in my 1st attempt only, the end result is still a disappointment as the film feels badly patched together. There are, however, moments of absolute brilliance & it's technically very impressive but the story just didn't have enough meat on it to keep me invested in its premise.Set in a Mexican border town, Touch of Evil is a story of murder, kidnapping & police corruption and concerns a Mexican narcotics officer named Vargas who takes part in the investigation of a car bomb that exploded on the US side of the border. The plot covers his conflict with Police Captain Quinlan who's in charge on the US side as Vargas catches him planting evidence to implicate his suspect and tries to expose him as a corrupt officer.Directed by Orson Welles, the film opens with one of the finest long takes in cinema after which the main plot is introduced. And the camera continues to make excellent use of tracking shots & unusual angles throughout its runtime. Editing criss-crosses the sub-plots, music has a very eccentric presence and the performances by its entire cast, especially Welles himself, Charlton Heston, Joseph Calleia & Janet Leigh is top-notch.On an overall scale, despite liking the input of both its cast & crew, the whole picture remained a largely ineffective affair and in my opinion suffers from fractured narrative that felt incomplete to some extent, plethora of uninteresting characters I didn't care for & the slow pace which instead of immersing me into its premise did the exact opposite. The film remains one of Welles' most beloved work in cinema but for me, this was just another classic that didn't live up to its hype.",

Then a few minutes before the wrap, actors were called to their places and the amazing tracking shot, in the scene when the two missing sticks of dynamite are discovered, was made. Cut! Print! Two days ahead of schedule. Heston speculated that Welles did himself no good with this joke and, indeed, this picture, on a level with \"Citizen Kane\" and \"The Lady From Shanghai\" was to be the last studio directing assignment for Orson Welles. Many top Hollywood actors played small parts here. The conclusion of this picture was anticipated in the travelogue opening of \"The Third Man,\" in the shot of the Danube. And, in the end, Marlene Dietrich's remark, \"your future is all used up,\" is prescient.

            "content": "Orson Welles is often touted as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, so it's unfortunate that several of his movies suffered from studio interference and editing before they were released. One such film is Touch of Evil, Welles' 1958 film noir, which was cut and eventually released with additional or replacement scenes directed by Harry Keller. However, 1998, the film was re-edited in accordance with a memo written by Welles, and has become - in effect - the definitive version. And it is lives up to the Welles hype.\nTouch of Evil opens with a car bombing in a Mexican border town, drawing visiting Mexican drug enforcement officer Ramon Vargas into the investigation. He soon finds himself clashing with local Police Captain Hank Quinlan, who turns out to have an unsavoury habit of planting evidence to frame suspects and gradually turns out to be guilty of far worse. Vargas really starts to oppose Quinlan when he realises that Quinlan planted evidence to frame suspect Sanchez, although in an ironic twist that adds to the moral murkiness of the film, Sanchez eventually confesses, meaning that Quinlan didn't need to frame him and in so doing trigger the chain of events that leads to his own death.\nWelles' screenplay explores the dark depths of Quinlan's soul to impressive effect, as he responds to Vargas' challenge to his authority by making a deal with criminal Uncle Joe Grandi to terrorise, kidnap and frame Vargas' wife Susan, before double crossing and murdering Grandi and eventually shooting his once loyal partner Pete Menzies when Menzies betrays him to Vargas and justice. It's dark and gripping, and Welles - heavily made-up in prosthetics - gives one of his very best acting performances as Quinlan, growling and mumbling his way through the role to memorable effect. He is utterly convincing and contrasts well with Charlton Heston's moral, upstanding Vargas. A certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required to accept Heston as a Mexican, but otherwise he too gives one of his best film performances, especially when he's effectively battling Quinlan for Pete Menzies' soul.\nWelles gets superb performances out of all his actors, whom he reportedly encouraged to improvise. Janet Leigh looks convincingly terrified when the Mexican gang members take over the hotel and break into her room, and even more traumatised when she regains consciousness to find Grandi's corpse looking down on her. Dennis Weaver's performance as the weird Night Manager of the hotel is remarkable, whilst - despite being at risk of being overshadowed by a scene-stealing Welles and an impassioned Heston - Joseph Calleia is quietly impressive as Pete Menzies. Armenian-American actor Akim Tamiroff oozes menace as Mexican Uncle Joe Grandi, and Marlene Dietrich is memorable in her brief role as Tanya, mistress of a brothel, which she apparently appeared in purely because Welles invited her to appear in his film (similarly, Zsa Zsa Gabor crops up briefly, as does Joseph Cotton in a literal walk on).\nWhilst Welles impresses as an actor here (and in many of his own films, for that matter) he is most celebrated for his direction and Touch of Evil is a very effective demonstration of why that is. From the opening shot, the visual flair of the film impresses: cinematographer Russell Metty provides a famous three-and-a-bit minute tracking shot that sees the camera in almost constant motion and introduces Ramon Vargas and his wife Susan in the context of the Mexican border town they are visiting shortly after their wedding. When the car explodes, the camera pulls back, the actors running towards it to create a feeling of urgent chaos. There's an even longer tracking shot later in Sanchez's apartment, and notably there's a car conversation in which Welles places the camera on the car bonnet, allowing two actors to talk to each other on camera, in a real moving car, which was a first at the time.\nIn contrast to many films of the period, Welles shot most of Touch of Evil on location, which also contributes to the gritty realism of the piece, which is lit in typical film noir fashion. A notable example is during the attack on Susan in the hotel, when we get close-ups of the attackers' faces in shadow. Henry Mancini's alternately brooding and dramatic soundtrack provides the final flourish: the scene in which Quinlan strangles Grandi is almost psychedelic in the way it is shot, with Mancini's increasingly frenetic music rising to a crescendo. The climax, with Vargas secretly tailing Quinlan as the bug-carrying Menzies interrogates him, makes use of all manner of camera techniques to achieve a highly impressive sequence.\nIncredible as it now seems, not only was Touch of Evil tampered with by the studio against Welles' wishes before release, it was also released as a B-movie with the aforementioned Harry Keller's now largely forgotten The Female Animal as the A-movie. It deserved much better and the 1998 re-edit helped to redress that balance: this is one of Welles' best and movies and perhaps his most accessible.",

And it manages to utterly disgust you of everything else. As craft, it's so incredibly inventive and original and new that it defies belief and makes everything else look like slapdash and Z series. TOUCH \u0085 is not about decay, degradation, but about failure; the mythical Quinlan, we are led to believe, was never a honest and dedicated cop; he falsified his way through his professional life. Significantly, the movie's poetry comes mainly from the _plutonian and doomed couple: Quinlan/ Tana; they are the only deepened characters. ( They are more interesting and more human, not because they are morally objectionable, but because they have true human depth, human features, life, and they seem like real\u0097life characters, placed in a crime novel context in which Welles obviously did not believe so much.)Even if the script was quickly written, the fact in it point towards a coherent and meaningful whole. Being so rich and complex, the movie might conceal that it's action happens very rapidly\u0097in a day.TOUCH \u0085 is for me what CASABLANCA might be for other people. It is also an encouragement and a lesson about how should a movie look, feel and touch. It is the tale of a framing\u0097a local corrupt cop trying to frame a foreign cop who ,intrigued by the way of a police investigation, arrives to find out that the corrupt cop has the habit of planting evidences and setting up the suspects. The corrupt cop is portrayed not like a fallen hero, but more like a psychotic unafraid of resorting to the most extreme measures to protect and cover his deeds. Quinlan is fascinating for those who know him closely. The arrival of the foreign cop and the events that follow constitute an occasion for Quinlan to recapitulate, in short, his life, fragments of which we are given. Like with each other movie of his, Welles completely reinvents himself. Each of his movies takes its origin in a wholly innovative and groundbreaking thought. He reinvents the cinema with each of his movies. Welles' cinema is a school. Here the most imposing artistic thought dominated its matter;it is a question about art above everything else. Life can not be defined; creation is a fact of life. Yet, one can say that Welles was an architect, a creator of architectures, and a baroque master in a puritanical epoch. The rationality, the thought within his masterpieces is only apparently and unconvincingly masked by the fireworks. He brought meanings of art in a medium where no one else was playing by Welles' rules. (Within the American/ Hollywoodian context, Bazin thought though that he can discover elements for a typology.) What is new about Welles is that he brought an authentically artistic temperament, with genuinely artistic aims and intentions and ambitions, into a game that was about something else. I mean that Welles brought into movies more and else than was really needed\u0097genuinely artistic ambitions, etc.. They needed a craftsman, a director,not an artist.TOUCH \u0085 is enormously sexy; there are more promises of pleasure in this movie, than in a Brass movie.

It shines with glamor in the best sense of the word; because everything is glamor, and everything is art, meaningful craft. All is so new as if it will be made tomorrow. Was it ever a better cast?Only naming the actors is sheer joy\u0097Orson Welles, Charlton Heston (in maybe his finest role, despite the down\u0097talkers; enjoy the unexpected finesse, and the utter manliness of his performance), the once deservedly more\u0097famous Akim Tamiroff (who was thought to look Hispanic), Joseph Cotten in a remarkable cameo, and the most remarkable pair of actresses--Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich;a few scenes, entirely about sex and erotica, are a tribute to them. All the claims about Heston's inappropriateness are patently false.TOUCH \u0085 is a celebration of feminine beauty.Only talking about the two women would deserve an essay; Mrs. Marlene Dietrich is here of a quiet and,if I might say so,naked beauty. She adorns Welles' thriller with the supreme beauty of her movie career. If you are, as I am,a Dietrich fan, here is the place to rejoice!The intensely sexual Janet Leigh belongs to a class of distinctively attractive actresses. Deploring now her almost wasted career is obviously useless. She looked as hot as glamorous. (This is maybe what the cinema of the '40s\u0097'50s achieved, and that of the '60s ruined\u0097to have its actresses look not only glamorous\u0097but hot as well\u0097hot, at least, by our standards.)Our predecessor Weininger wrote\u0097'Art creates the sensory world, that is why the artist is erotic and sexual' (in a larger phrase where he contrasted the artist with the scientist).",

            "content": "Touch of Evil is considered the last film noir. I recently saw the (restored) extended cut on TCM based on notes director Orson Welles wrote down after Universal-International prevented him from delivering the final edit. Despite the impressive cinematography, nothing really could have helped this extremely overrated potboiler from ever coming close to its current stellar but undeserved reputation based on all the specious accolades heaped upon it since its initial release in 1958.The screenplay, based on a pulp mystery novel, was rewritten by Welles in a week after a TV writer unsuccessfully tried his hand at it first. The plot is a convoluted mess set in a seedy town on the US-Mexican border. Perhaps the worst thing about the film is the casting of Charlton Heston as Ramon Miguel Vargas, the Mexican head of the Pan-American Narcotics Commission. Heston doesn't even try to effect even a smidgen of a Spanish accent and seems completely out of place in the role. Nonetheless, without Heston, who was a big box-office star at the time, Touch of Evil would never have been made.Vargas is on a honeymoon with his wife Susan (Janet Leigh). One wonders immediately why Vargas would take his wife on a honeymoon to such a seedy and dangerous town on the US-Mexican border. Of course it makes no sense but obviously the town was chosen (actually filmed in Venice, CA), so that the noir atmosphere could be achieved and the setting would look cool.The film's opening is filmed nicely with tracking shots of a car that explodes after a time bomb is placed in it. The victims, a local construction magnate and his girlfriend, are killed and Vargas offers to help in the investigation, conducted by local sheriff Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), a surly racist who Vargas suspects has planted evidence to implicate a Mexican citizen, suspected of planting the bomb. Welles' character Quinlan proves to be the second reason why Touch of Evil is such a poor film.There is nothing likable, interesting or multi-dimensional about Quinlan. In good films, the bad guy (despite the obvious immorality) has some kind of interesting idiosyncrasies or even charm that keeps our interest. Quinlan is a one-note, over the top curmudgeon whom we instantly dislike. And there's no development of the character-he's the same throughout.A good deal of the far-fetched machinations involve Susan. Especially when she goes willingly with a bunch of toughs to see small time crime boss \"Uncle\" Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) in a sleazy hotel. Why is Susan so oblivious to all the danger signs surrounding her? Again it makes no sense. Grandi warns Susan that her husband needs to lay off his brother whom he is prosecuting for narcotics-related crimes. Susan even goes so far to call him a \"\"lop-sided Little Caesar.\"When Vargas finds out about Susan's encounter with Grandi, he puts her in a dump of a motel on the American side, without knowing it's owned by Grandi. There she's shot up with drugs by Grandi's gang of young hoodlums (and presumably raped-which is unclear) and then brought back to Grandi's hotel. There, nasty Quinlan murders Grandi and sets Susan up as the murder suspect while she's unconscious.If there are any twists here at all, it's when Quinlan's long-time partner, Pete Menzies (Joseph Callela), finally accepts the fact that Quinlan is no good and assists Vargas, wearing a wire, with Vargas tailing him and Quinlan with a tape recorder. I guess surveillance of this sort wasn't very developed in 1958 when the film was made and Heston kind of looks ridiculous traipsing around with a tape recorder in tow, trying to get the goods on his nemesis.No need to rehash the fate of the principals here. Virtually every character here is over the top and we end up not caring a lick for any of them. Even Marlene Dietrich as Tanya the Fortune Teller has little to do besides predicting Quinlan's demise. And may I be particularly critical of film noir expert Eddie Muller for claiming this is a classic. Shame on you Eddie!",

There ARE interesting technical things going on as far as camera angles, lighting and impressive long takes (e.g. the opening sequence). It also has a notable classic cast with Leigh thoroughly stunning, not to mention Joanna Moore, Marlene Dietrich, Joi Lansing and a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor on the female front.Yet I otherwise found the picture talky, nigh surreal and noticeably hokey with an unengrossing story and dubious acting, e.g. the hooligan Mexicans and the eye-rolling Shakespearean lunatic \"night man\" (Dennis Weaver). Seriously, viewing this film is like entering Welles' head on an acid trip.That said, the film offers quite a bit to digest and I could see it playing better on additional viewings, which explains its cult status, but I'm not interested. There are far more fascinating and compelling B&W dramas with noteworthy casts from that general era, like \"The Misfits\" (1963).I viewed the long reconstructed version, aka the \"director's cut,\" which runs about 110 minutes while the original studio-butchered version runs 93 minutes.

In the darkness, among the sounds of traffic and seedy strip clubs and gaudy hotels in the Mexican border town of Los Robles, the auto meanders across the border into the USA. We see crumbling arches and peeling walls. For more than three minutes we wonder what will happen. Tick \u0085 tick \u0085 tick \u0085 The Chrysler passes by mustached Charlton Heston (Mike Vargas) and stunning Janet Leigh (Susan Vargas). As Mike stops to kiss his new wife, we hear the explosion, and there is a cut to the burning vehicle. \"This could be very bad for us,\" utters Mike. Vargas, as a police investigator (and Chairman of the Pan-American Narcotics Commission), was returning to Mexico to testify against Vic Grandi's Mexican crime family. As the explosion occurred on the American side of the border, police chief Harry Quinlan (Orson Welles) is called in to investigate. Bloated, stubbly, puffy-faced Quinlan has a history of planting evidence to convict those whom he figures are guilty. Sweating, he oozes corruption from every pore. \"You're a mess,\" fortune-teller Tana (Marlene Dietrich) would later tell him. To Quinlan's displeasure, Vargas decides to hang around because of his concern that his native Mexico may be involved in an international incident. He tells Susan to return to the hotel. She gets intercepted by a gang who takes her to \"visit\" Uncle Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff). He warns her to tell her husband to desist from the Grandi trial, or else. The man who died in the car explosion was Rudolph Linnekar, a wealthy contractor; his girl was a blonde night club dancer. Mexican Manelo Sanchez, a shoe clerk, who had been dating Linnekar's daughter Marcia against her father's wishes, is visited by Quinlan. Now Sanchez does not really care for Marcia, but, as he freely admits, likes only her money. Quinlan, who maintains that Sanchez murdered Rudolph Linnekar because the latter disapproved of Sanchez's planned marriage to Marcia, places two sticks of dynamite in a box in Sanchez's bathroom. As Vargas knows that Quinlan planted evidence, he does not abide by the arrest. He decides to gather evidence against him, and begins working with honest assistant DA Schwartz. Meanwhile Susan Vargas is in danger as her husband \u2013 immersed in his work \u2013 had inconceivably left her alone. She moved to the Mirador Motel, which consists of a number of uninhabited cabins in the desert. Neither Mike Vargas nor she can imagine that the hotel is owned by Uncle Joe Grandi. She is the only customer, and he has plans for her, as his leather-jacketed gang of thugs often operates from there. Her only shield \u2013 and he really is not one \u2013 is neurotic Dennis Weaver, the night man. Since Quinlan is quickly onto Mike's intention, he is forced to work with Uncle Joe to frame wife Susan as a druggie. So Susan, besieged in her room, is easy prey for the gang. She is drugged and apparently gang-raped while lesbian leader Mercedes McCambridge watches. Then Susan is brought to a different hotel where she lies unconscious while surrounded by drug paraphernalia. Both Uncle Joe and Quinlan arrive there, but Quinlan turns against him and strangles Joe and leaves evidence to implicate Susan. But he inexplicably leaves his cane in the room, which his sergeant, Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia) later finds. Menzies has been Quinlan's stooge for years, and although he probably could not exist without Quinlan, soon decides to reverse his previous deeds. Before long, Menzies and Vargas are working together to tape record Quinlan's admission of his decadence among the pumping oil derricks and garbage heaps at a canal. Bullets will be fired, and only one of the three will walk away. And only in the end is it confirmed for certain who placed the bomb in the car trunk (although the culprit is obvious).Orson Welles was already a giant for his excellent portrayal in \"Citizen Kane\" (1942), considered by many critics as the greatest movie of all time. Those who feel that Charlton Heston was miscast should be aware that he portrayed various historical figures. They include Moses, Marc Antony, John the Baptist, El Cid, Michelangelo, both Henry VIII and Sir Thomas More (!), Cardinal Richelieu, Lt. William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame), Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abe Lincoln, Brigham Young, General \"Chinese\" Gordon, and Buffalo Bill Cody. Heston could conceivably pass as a Mexican of European heritage. Vivacious Janet Leigh was already famous; she had starred in \"Angels in the Outfield\" (1951), \"Scaramouche\" (1952), and \"The Naked Spur\" (1953). The last one is considered by Leonard Maltin to be one of the greatest westerns ever made. Psycho would follow in 1960 and Manchurian Candidate after that (1962). The greatness of the movie is not its message; in fact, one may even identify several peculiar picture settings. Those who hate the movie generally dislike the material. But the film's prominence is in HOW the story is told. It is like \"Citizen Kane,\" which has a rather thin plot, but a gripping revelation. Take the hotel room scene where Welles takes Janet Leigh's nylon stocking and wraps it around his fingers. He looks menacingly at Akim Tamiroff while the neon lights flash from outside. It is a hungry lion facing a trapped antelope. Uncle Joe is finished, and he knows it. \"Touch of Evil\" has high-level technical qualities of expressionist lighting and shadow, low camera angles, wide-angle lens, and dark, brooding photography. The movie has atmosphere in miles. Henry Mancini's dazzling sound track hits the spot (and works very well even in the truncated 95-minute version of the movie). As \"Touch of Evil\" is recognized by enthusiasts as one of the greatest movies made in world cinema history, it appears on many Top 100 Lists.",

Welles himself, is a hammy caricature of Harry Lime (somewhat after his time...). One could actually argue that the wooden Indian, Heston, playing the Mexican, gives the best performance.So not having any action, atmosphere, humor, or good characters to offset the flimsy plot, there must surely be some cinematographic eye candy to justify the film's high stature. Well, the opening sequence is interesting, perhaps a bit contrived, but very clever. The rest, - I honestly could have been watching the vampire sequences from Plan 9. Sometimes I wish that Hearst had just said - \"Hey Orson, good job - liked the rosebud reference, you sly devil...\" and maybe we would have been spared the cult of the martyred wunderkind.

The music in some of the scenes is absolutely horrible, the average death metal song sounds a lot better.The characters are without an exception paper-thin with the exception of Welles' character which is given some depth, but apparently the only reason that he went \"bad\" is that his wife died FOURTY YEARS ago. Several members of the supporting cast can't their way out of a paper bag, and all of the characters seemed to behave very unnaturally to me.In terms of story, we have a very obvious murder mystery, but for some reason Welles' cop thinks it's necessary to frame the suspect anyway, probably just out of habit. I'm willing to accept that the actual murder is just of secondary importance, but in that case the main theme should have been worked out a lot better.

Therefore he is to serve a life sentence of making movies that shall never turn a profit. The defendant being so informed, may now return to the set of TOUCH OF EVIL. Be sure to make your reports from Mexico in a timely manner.\"Well, there are two stories about how Welles ended up writing and directing for TOUCH OF EVIL. The first is Orson was only supposed to act in this film, but Charlton Heston was more interested in adding to his resume' a film directed by Orson Welles. The other story is that Albert Zugsmith, known as the \"King of The 'Bs' \", who had worked earlier with Welles, offered him a pile of scripts. He asked Zugsmith which one was the worst, to prove he could make a great film out of even a bad script. So it ends up he took BADGE OF EVIL, based upon a novel by Whit Masterson, and did a rewrite before taking it into production.Welles called up a couple of his pals from the old Mercury Theater, Joseph Cotton and Ray Collins, to come on down and get in on the fun. He got in touch with Marlene Dietrich, Janet Leigh, Dennis Weaver, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joseph Calleia, and many of the cast members agreed to work for lower wages just for the privilege of making a film with Welles. He rehearsed for two weeks prior to shooting, and let the actors give input as to how the dialogue lines for their characters might be tweaked and improved. The cooperation and participation of all the players became a mounting kind of synergy that made everybody feel as though they were inventing something wonderful as the cast and crew went along.So somewhere down the line, Welles decided to have one of his actors put a time bomb in the trunk of a car, so that Rudy Linnekar as played by Jeffrey Green and Zita as played by Joi Lansing, could be blown sky high crossing over the Mexican/American border. This turns out to be one of the longest tracking shots in the history of cinema, lasting three minutes and twenty seconds. TOUCH OF EVIL (1958), grows in renown over the decades to be recognized as one of the last great examples of classic Film Noir. Although released as a B-movie under Hedy Lamarr's A-movie, THE FEMALE ANIMAL (1958), and receiving little publicity build-up, Welles was amazed when his film received its European premiere at the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival and he won two top awards. This, despite Universal Pictures doing everything it could to prevent TOUCH OF EVIL from being selected as part of the Expo 58 World Fair.Welles' genius is different from Hitchcock's in that it seems to strike like lightning in the oddest of places, and is warmer generally than the coldly calculated Sherlockian 'jig-saw' puzzle method of the Master of Suspense. It's a magic trick here, a piece of memorable lighting there, and a roaring soliloquy or monologue or improvised bit of narration that somehow breaks the fourth wall and grabs you by the lapels just like in the good ol' days back at the Mercury Theater.But you don't have to take my word for it. Here are a few parting comments from Harry Lime himself:\"I think it's very harmful to see movies for movie makers, because you either imitate them or worry about not imitating them, and you should do movies innocently, and I lost my innocence. Every time i see a picture i lose something, i don't gain. I never understand what directors mean when they compliment me and say they've learned from my pictures, because i don't believe in learning from other people's pictures. You should learn from your own interior vision, and discover innocently as though there had never been D.W. Griffith, or Sergei M. Eisenstein, or John Ford, or Jean Renoir, or anybody.\"-- Orson Welles",

All of this centering around police Captain Quinlan (Orson Welles) who will stop at nothing to find the guilty and Mexican detective Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) who finds himself in the mix after his wife (Janet Leigh) is brought up on charges.TOUCH OF EVIL is a legendary film in the genre but it's also yet another troubled production for director Orson Welles. Today everyone knows the story but this was yet another film that Welles turned in only to have the studio step in and make countless edits to it. Thankfully most of the original footage was saved and was able to be put together years after Welles' death. This 112-minute director's cut is certainly a masterpiece in the genre and it's just amazing to look at the picture today and think that there was a need to chop it up back on its original release. Thankfully Welles got a lot of praise before his death and thankfully for fans some of his work has been completed since then.It's easy to see what a genius Welles was just by watching this movie because there are some marvelous and technically magically moments here. Everyone knows about the opening sequence and it really doesn't matter how many times you see it, you can't help but have your breathe taken away by its beauty. This entire sequence is something that you'd expect to see in an Alfred Hitchcock movie but the technical marvel is something that I don't think even that legend could have pulled off. Another marvelous sequence is the one where Leigh is in a motel room being terrorized by a Mexican gang. This sequence is full of suspense and the cinematography is flawless as we imagine a lot worse happening to her than what we're really seeing. Then, the ending, is just brilliantly played out. I certainly won't ruin it but it's a blast.Then there are the performances. For my money this here is the greatest acting performance that Welles ever gave. He plays a beaten down, dirty cop and the actor certainly went all out for the role. He wore a fake nose, didn't shave and added a fake gut to help him look the part and his transformation is right on the level of that of Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER. Welles really gives an incredibly strong performance and makes you believe that you're really watching something who finds everything around them cracking. Leigh is good in her part, although there's no doubt that she's mainly used here for her sexuality. As far as Heston goes, yes, it wasn't too smart for him to be playing a Mexican but I've always thought his performance was fine. I liked the laid back, more mature performance and it honestly strikes me as a Charlie Chan type of character. A foreigner having to stand back to the American's while out smarting them. Then you've got Marlene Dietrich giving another remarkable performance.On a technical level TOUCH OF EVIL is virtually flawless. The music score, how it's used and the cinematography just perfectly capture the darkness of the story and there's no doubt that Welles sets a certain mood and atmosphere that's hard to match. The film's story is one that easily draws you in and makes you keep guessing right up to the very end. TOUCH OF EVIL is certainly the work of a genius.",

The first shot perfectly sums up the feast to come - startlingly well designed, breathtaking in its command of camera and staging, marked by a strong sense of place and mood and with dialogue that crackles while revealing character at every turn. Maybe in that respect there's more of a rote quality about Heston and Leigh's characters once you assimilate the mixed race theme - Welles seems most inspired by the fading glories of the older characters. The scenes in the motel are superbly handled, but also inevitably dated because of their passe notion of decadence, and Weaver's character is a bit much (strange pre-echo of Psycho). Quibbles aside, the movie is a superb feat of the imagination. It's now as clear and pristine as a bell, brilliantly lucid, a dazzling mesh of criss-crossing characters and motives, over-shadowed by a compelling sense of melodramatic grandeur and decay. It's crusading and progressive in its comfort with racial issues (and acknowledgment of racism), with a sharp edge of sex and degradation and an eye for eccentricity. One of the best cases for Welles' artistry, and probably THE best for his facility as an entertainer.",

Mexican drug police officer Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his wife Susan (Janet Leigh) witnesses the explosion. Mike realizes the implication of a bomb coming from Mexico and killing an American in the US. He gets involved in the investigation headed by Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles). Susan is lured to meet Uncle Joe Grandi whose family is under investigation by Mike. Quinlan settles on Mexican Sanchez who is secretly married to the victim's daughter but Mike disagrees.The opening sequence is beautifully shot by Orson Welles. It's a nice continuous shot that is accentuated by the explosion. It is a great sequence. However Charlton Heston as a Mexican just doesn't do it for me especially with that silly mustache. I hate to mark down a movie for that but I hate that mustache. It's like he's a white guy pretending to be a Mexican stereotype on Halloween. I would be a lot happier if he's just a white guy from Mexico. This is a compelling film noir but his mustache grates on me every time.",

            "content": "Orson Welles did have a \"magic touch\" (no pun intended), although it didn't always translate into commercial success. Which of course had to do with the studios being reluctant giving him the free reign he had on his Citizen Kane classic. There are quite a few versions out there of this movie and we got treated to one of them (close to what Welles imagined at the time as biographer told us) at the Berlin International Festival.When I say close, it does mean that it's as close to what Welles would have wanted in the movie (from the footage that was shot), especially concerning the audio in the beginning. He had a vision in his head and the studio bosses wouldn't always agree with him. Another problem might have been that he himself wasn't always satisfied and would change things. So while the version I saw, was close to a memo he send to the studio (suggesting cuts and especially the audio change in the beginning), he might have changed all that at a later time, if he had the chance (at least he might have written another memo after watching it the way, he wanted it to be).Having said and written all that, the movie has a powerful performance by Charlton Heston as well. Characters reactions to some things might feel dated or clich\u00e9, but that is just because we have seen other films copying some of the working formula that is being used here. B&W it might be, but it still has quite a punch to it ... morally and otherwise",

As soon as he stepped out of the car with his face all curled up, I knew I was in for a good time. I found the way that Quinlan talked other people very interesting, he initially comes off as a gruff cranky man but after hearing a couple sentences, he is clearly much more intelligent and calculating than he appears to be. There was excellent use of lighting in this movie, making it much more suspenseful. The suspense was my favorite aspect of the movie, there was an enormous level of unpredictability throughout the entire film. It was also interesting to see the difference between the 2 countries and how they handled such close proximity, yet have completely different jurisdictions that don't necessarily respect each other. I also noticed the appearance of Mike Vargas became more and more disheveled throughout the movie. In the first scene, he is portrayed as a classy man who seems to have it all, a pretty girlfriend, an important position in his government, and some amount of professional respect outside of his jurisdiction. As the movie goes on, he clearly begins to lose his composure and patience. The very first scene was also quite interesting, it ran for a very long time without cutting to a different clip. It was and still is very impressive how well planned and timed out everything was for those first couple minutes. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of well designed suspense.",

            "content": "I've only seen a few of Orson Welles' pictures, the ones that count presumably - \"Citizen Kane\" and \"The Stranger\". Without question, his presence in \"Touch of Evil\" earns him my esteem as one of the all time great actors. His presence literally fills the screen every time he appears, in part due to his considerable girth, but more so I think because of the intense characterization he imbues his portrayal with of police captain Hank Quinlan. Quinlan embodies the personification of the movie's title, and one would be hard pressed to think of another actor who could have done the job better. Fans of noir films may be surprised to see the cinema form elevated a considerable notch above it's traditional 'B' movie platform here. From the intense cinematography to the expansive story straddling the Mexican American border, the picture reveals one sordid surprise after another as it rages across the screen. Yet at the same time, one must suspend a good measure of disbelief at some of the less credible elements that are offered in support of Mike Vargas' (Charlton Heston) mission to solve a murder mystery. Virtually neglecting his wife (Janet Leigh) on their honeymoon to help investigate a case in which he has no jurisdiction is just the beginning. The way the new Mrs. Vargas handles herself in a handful of precarious situations simply defy anyone's definition of acting rationally in extreme circumstances. I just can't picture a real life scenario where a woman would openly challenge the supremacy of a mob boss on his home turf and expect to get away with it.All of which creates a unique dichotomy. One wants to consider that this could be one of the all time great mystery thrillers, but there are just too many significant distractions in the way. Yet it all falls into place by the time Quinlan is called upon to face the consequences of his own corruption. Which owes partly to the redemption of his partner Menzies (Joseph Calleia), even as Menzies himself is brought down by events of the story.As for the role of Charlton Heston portraying a Mexican - I thought it worked once you get beyond the celebrity of the man himself and see him as police detective Vargas. Janet Leigh has the almost thankless task of the put upon newlywed who seems to be just a bit too understanding given the circumstances. I thought Marlene Dietrich brought a larger presence to the events in the story than her minimal screen time might have hinted at. However I was left scratching my head as to why Zsa Zsa Gabor was called upon to appear as a strip club owner if she was only going to be on screen for a literal blink of an eye.In summation, \"Touch of Evil\" is an oddly curious film, and depending on the frame of mind of the viewer, might be considered one of the best or one of the worst ever. For all it's flaws, I come down on the plus side for now, realizing that I really need to see this one again a few more times before I can say I'm a true fan. I'll just have to wait and see.",

            "review_title": "58 Pages Decries That The Term, Bastardization Is A Masterpiece of Understatement!",
            "content": "Whenever a film attempts to break ground on the rancor of emotions which proliferate in the citadel for political graft and corruption, it literally becomes a crap shoot. Like films such as \"Chinatown\" and \"The Killing\", the laborious depiction of a fervent human intensity catches the attention of copious movie critics. Aware of the prevailing rigmarole for judging powerfully unprecedented productions, such as \"Touch of Evil\", (Based on the spellbinding novel by Whit Masterson, \"Badge of Evil\")this criteria became the determining factor which made world renown intellectual director, Orson Welles, so intrepid with regards to his directorial modus operandi! The procurement of this picture had to garner a professional gratification in order for Welles' aesthetic resolve to be auspiciously saturated! As a result, Welles became incredibly hair trigger while in the process of consummating the production of this film. The acute assessment to the revised version of \"Touch of Evil\" addressed the alterations of the rudimentary framework of the picture. While some modifications of Orson Welles merely suggested a pragmatic restructuring to many scenes in \"Touch of Evil\", Welles' overall intention was to emphasize the agitated feelings, as well as the vitriolic intransigence which were crucial to his version of this film. Orson Welles' major bone of contention with the new version of his film was that a great deal of the scenes had become too derivative. Now enters a 58 page memoir submitted by Welles which served as a scathing diatribe to the final cut of the picture. Orson Welles admonished the production companies for homogenizing the detailed upheaval with this movie, and, in so doing, the production conglomerate purported an ambiguously glamorized and stilted insanity to the direction of this film. Such a callous generalization of the apathetic and contemptuous feelings in which Orson Welles worked so painstakingly hard on to expedite properly, eventually fell prey to mundane Hollywood theatrics. It was Welles' intention that \"Touch of Evil\" be nurtured, not hacked out! In these 58 pages of disapproving notations in which Orson Welles comprised, he used some very poignant and caricatured expletives to evoke a confident acrimony about all of this film's dubiously resurrected agenda. Amidst the myriad of ersatz techniques which the film company implemented was that many scenes wound up seeming \"inconclusive\" instead of \"curious\"! Welles elaborates on the misuse of climax with the edited version of \"Touch of Evil\". The essential lamentations about detached intimacy with Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, gave way for the film to desecrate the credible motivation with these two in their roles as husband and wife! Orson Welles expounds on the fact that the timing to the emotional isolation in this picture was undauntedly compromised as well. It was Orson Welles' vehemently innovative proclivities which spurred on a lengthy specification as to what he thought was a hindrance to this film! These perceived bastardizations are what made Orson Welles so forthright and vociferous. The creative ambitions with which a film aficionado such as Orson Welles covets and orchestrates, became a key ingredient to establishing cinematic excellence in the paramount world of Hollywood film making. Eventually, the necessary commiseration between Orson Welles and the producers later surfaced itself by way of a revised version which came out in 1998. Despite all of these ideological complications, \"Touch of Evil\" is a fabulous major motion picture! This movie exacts a frightful cogency regarding the protracted misery that all of the main characters in the film are afflicted with. Orson Welles carries off an intentional temerity with his role, he does this to underline exactly how utterly despicable his character is suppose to be. Janet Leigh and Charlton Heston became the targets for sabotage, and their increased awareness of the catastrophic and prevalent conditions became their personal undoing! Perrenial spawns of an upper middle class tedium as a married couple, they must now jump head on into the deadliest of snake pits and combat these circumstances with a vigilante crusade! The infuriating corruption which excoriates all of humanity through the recklessness of some pork barrel politicians was a lethal characteristic to this film which was not commonly depicted with movies back in 1958. Terrorism, bribery and collusion were mesmerizing substances for the scruple less officials who possessed a tyrannical stranglehold on the very existence of a select handful of Mexican boarder towns. The destruction that these scoundrels for the law engaged in was ameliorated with a disdainful self-righteousness! The pitfall of avaricious greed, and indignant megalomania, is so repugnant with this film, that you as the movie viewer hope and pray that there is a foreseeable after life for our world's culture to fall back on! Seemingly, tenacious perdition is the only rational alternative for the aggregate vindication of human behavior, this pertains to the abhorrent human behavior that a film like \"Touch of Evil\" so vividly portrays!. This website ranks \"Touch of Evil: 124th out of the top 250 films ever made! The acting, the directing and the camera angles to \"Touch of Evil\" are all prescient trend setters in the volatile paradigm for movies. The list of actors and actresses is amazing in this picture: Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joe Calleia, Dennis Weaver, Ray Collins, Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor and many others. I highly recommend this major motion picture. The music by Henry Mancini is spectacular in this movie, the Latin incorporation to this music accommodates the kind of progressive jazz which was very indicative of the 1950's. Whatever the demeanor to a film may be, the severity with regards to conveying the intended attitudes and effective spontaneity to a movie are what separate a specific motion picture from the general fray, and, establish it as an absolutely stunning and creative masterpiece. These notations were most assuredly worth Welles' effort in order for him to ascertain a charismatic enmity to the unique dynamic of the film. I wholeheartedly endorse this entirely superb production as being one of the most successfully esoteric within the realm of the movie industry!",

            "content": "After going 10 years without making a studio picture, Orson Welles came back and knocked it out of the park with Touch Of Evil.I suppose the first thing to mention when you discuss Touch Of Evil is the,possibly best, opening shot. Unfortunately, it has been examined ad nauseam but if there is one thing a filmmaker could learn-it is how to start a film.\nA pair of hands holding a bomb, which is placed into the trunk of a car. Seconds later a couple appear, get in the car and start driving. The camera follows the car which stops at a border checkpoint where Mike and Susan appear-they walk past the car,embrace, when the deafening explosion of the car is heard.Notice how first we see a bomb placed in a trunk(this starts the suspense) then people get in the car(building the tension) the main characters are introduced and the bomb still hasn't gone off(building more tension). The car drives off camera and Mike and Susan start talking(for a second we drop our guard) and WHAM, we're hit with the explosion.\nOrson brilliantly adds suspense and shock to a scene while using brilliant cinematography.Of course Touch Of Evil doesn't begin and end with one scene and there are many more exceptional moments in the film.\nWhen the police go to the bomb suspect's residence there is an exchange between half a dozen people on different subjects and yet it all plays out coherently.\nWhen Mike knocks over the shoebox it seems like a trivial action,later we'll watch it turn out to be the key to the rest of the film !\nOrson's magnificent style shines through out with his clever usages of angles,shots and lighting. At point Vargas is talking with Sanchez and Quinlan's voice is heard of screen.Sanchez slowly starts walking towards him bringing Quinlan into frame.The movie also has an extremely dark and violent feel for it's time which is especially noticeable in two scenes.\nThe first is when Susan is assaulted at the motel by the Grandi Boys-Janet Leigh has nothing but bad experiences at motels.\nAnd the second is when Quinlan murders Joe. The camera close in their faces as the massive Quinlan corrals his terrified victim and violently garrotes him.This isn't Orson's first time playing a villain but Quinlan is very different than the charismatic Harry Lime or even the more well mannered Franz Kindler and I was surprised at how vicious and brutal he was as Hank Quinlan.\nNonetheless, Quinlan also has a pitiful side. At some points the audience is just as duped as Quinlan into believing he is a principled man,exploited by the world. He certainly was some kind of man.This was Orson Welles' return to Hollywood in a sense, and the movie feels the most like it was made by 'the man who made Citizen Kane'. Not to take away anything from them,some are very good films.\nPerhaps it was purposeful and was Welles' best attempt at recapturing the American audience once more. Or maybe it was because he finally made a picture with a decent budget.Unlike some of his other films,this is one Orson Welles film that isn't strictly for his devotees It's a dark,suspenseful,intellectual thriller with a touch of genius.",

What lacks in dialog in this somewhat confusing story is made up in the superb acting throughout the versatile cast. Background music is very important in setting the mood and even at times is a distraction. Still this movie is entitled to rub shoulders with the classics.A car explodes on the Mexican border and leads to investigating murder, kidnapping and manipulation in carrying out the law. Unforgettable are the close up scenes of Orson Welles as Cpt. Hank Quinlan, a corrupt Texas police chief that is infamous for his inventing evidence to convict certain intended law breakers. This drunken, slobbish run down policeman is hard to forget and easy to dislike. Ramon 'Mike' Vargas(Charlton Heston)is a Mexican narcotics agent that interrupts his wedding day to get involved in this tangled story of corruption. In spite of a very bad make up job, Heston is straight forward and at his best in this role. The newlywed bride is Janet Leigh. Keep her in a skin tight sweater/ blouse and her actions come secondary. The lovely Leigh is often too under rated. She just doesn't seem to have a whole lot to do in this movie but to be frightened. And that she does well.Of course the supportive cast is very important in this jumbled bit of storytelling. Dennis Weaver is almost obnoxious as the moronic Motel Night Manager. Ray Collins is a flawless, near stoic DA. Akim Tamiroff and Valentin de Vargas are essential to the evil element. Marlene Dietrich is effortless in her small earthy role. Also of note are contributions from easy to look at Joanna Moore and Joi Lansing. Also look for cameos from Joseph Cotton, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Mercedes McCambridge.

Interesting that someone from Mexico would say that about the US, no?  (Perhaps it's true!)2.  The border between Mexico and the US is described as \"1400 miles without so much as one machine gun,\" a reference to the Berlin Wall, no doubt.  What a difference 40 years makes!  Now our border with Mexico is of the most fortified in the world.3.  The ironic and prophetic lines Heston's character says about his gun. When he gets to the US motel his wife was taken to and she is missing, he's upset, but what REALLY gets to him is that his GUN IS MISSING!  Same thing near the end of the movie, he gets his gun back first before his wife is returned to him from jail!

In an American/Mexican border town a car bomb sets into motion a series of violence and crime, endangering Mexican Lawman Vargas (Heston) and newly Bride Susan (Janet Leigh)Touch of Evil is all about the direction as Welles is able to show off his directional talents and then some. From the maybe most talked about opening, a bravura 3 minute tracking shot following a car with a bomb planted in the trunk, down a seedy town down to the border patrol to the very last intricate shots set through wastelands to a canal that were in no way logical to the plot but were visually pleasing very much showboating. The plot is somewhat complex and maybe can't be grasped with just the one viewing given everything that is going on a technically as well. It reverses stereotypes, Vargas a high ranking Mexican narcotics detective and upstanding citizen with morals and an American wife. Hank Quinlan (Welles) who's power and high status in law enforcement has corrupted his mind, out for justice whether justified or not willing to plant evidence to get his target.The acting is terrific Heston although he doesn't resemble a Mexican it doesn't matter, I believe it to be one of his best roles. Janet Leigh is stunning to look a real beauty of the screen who holds her own. Welles is a powerhouse not only his performance but also physically, his screen presence is something to marvel.From that opening scene which sets the atmosphere and dark tone for the rest of the 90 minute or so running time, a couple of really tense scenes (A small room interrogation which also boasts Welles prowess) and at one point something horrifying ( There is an implied Gang rape that for me was pretty unsettling and for the year 1958 was a very brave thing to include in a mainstream movie, although afterwards its not to clear what happens) This will always be held as a classic and one of the best Film Noirs around ( A genre I'm just getting into) I've seen it twice now and feel with each viewing there will be something different to notice and concentrate on.

Charlton Heston playing a confused Mexican who lapses in and out of bad English and ignorance of all things American one minute and being a savvy lawyer the next, sworn to protect his wife yet leaving her alone in a strange land he knows she's terrified of, with no idea of where she is, Janet Leigh who is constantly in peril allowing herself to be put in more and more jeopardy when she is supposed to be terrified...(Seeing her in a sweater in profiles in all her black and white glory was the only...pardon me for saying it...high point...of the film.)

I have seen the 1976 version so often that I can't say the new version has entered my emotional bloodstream just yet, but, if anything, the film as it stands is an even richer experience.While all the scenes are intact and familiar, the narrative movement is clearer.  While this means the film loses much of its proto-Godardian fuzz, the thematic complexity is allowed to breathe.  Take the famous opening one-take sequence.  Previously, Mancini's Latin samba blared over it, creating an emotional frenzy in the action, and a similar response in the viewer.  When the bomb finally goes off, it is orgasmic, sublimating Mike and Susan's (who have so obviously more than ice-cream on their minds) interrupted kiss.  The viewer is swept away, without much room to think, and the patterning of the sequence is so complex, that there is a lot to think about.In the new version, though visually intact, the scene seems more considered; instead of the pounding score, we have a music which seems to come from a distant car radio.  The atmosphere seems slower, more oneiric.  The viewer response in the first is visceral; the new version creeps up on the mind. This is more appropriate, as the film can now be more clearly seen as metaphysical anguish, about the corruption of the soul - about how, to use a simplistic phrase, fascism creates fear in the mind - rather than just literal police corruption (although that's still a major theme).  For instance, very little actual physical harm comes to Susan, yet by the end, through her agonies in this border hothouse, she is a defeated, spiritless, gibbering wreck.Touch Of Evil is one of the great films, the equal of Kane and Ambersons, those pinnacles of the art.  So much has been written about it I won't repeat here.  Suffice to say that it follows Welles' obsession with corrupt authority in the shape of an 'author' (like Kane and Harry Lime, Quinlan shapes the events of the film, he is their author, and yet he destroys meaning, rather than creating it; this is an observation which has had disturbing resonance for artists in the second half of this century); it cleverly uses the figure of the detective (both Quinlan and Vargas), normally the arbiter of truth and order, to disrupt such notions - the two men equally show how the corruption of the soul leads to fascism, and later darkness, confusion and terror (the scene where Vargas goes to the Hotel Mirador to find Susan is the most frightening and bleak in all cinema); the pessimistic, parodic, macho-deflating use of Western and bullfighting motifs (there is no escaping West here in this soul-prison).When Tanya says 'what's it matter what you say about a man', most critics have taken this to be some kind of a tribute to Quinlan; I think it refers to the absolute betrayal of truth in this world (our world), where lies can become institutionalised, defended by our public representatives (Quinlan's blustery sulk bluff to keep his job seems terrifyingly plausible).  Human testimony has no worth - the 'good' guy must sneakily use technology to somehow capture the 'truth', yet even this is unreliable and distorted. Not even Welles the auteur's truth is vindicated; despite his reported, moralistic intentions, the film rattles with ambiguities, and his seemingly obvious use of doubling is always, playfully, subverted, a la Nabokov. Vargas, the viewer's guide towards the truth, ends as a skulking rat; he's the detective tainted with a touch of evil.The new version does not hide the fact that the film is a grotesque black comedy, a mocking Absurd tragedy, an unidentifiably sympathetic portrait of a monster (unlike Humbert, say, Quinlan has no redeemable features, and yet his downfall seems tragic and romantic) and an improbably joyous vindication of cinema.  (Two points - there is not evidence that Quinlan was right about Linneker's murder: Sanchez probably had his confession beaten out of him like all the rest; was it Quinlan who strangled his wife?)",

            "content": "Universal-International wanted to adapt Whit Masterson's novel Badge of Evil and hired Charlton Heston as the star, Albert Zugsmith as the producer and Paul Monash as the writer.Heston asked that Orson Welles direct the movie. He joined the project and rewrote the script, appears in the movie and directed the film. He also asked that the actors be part of the process, with Janet Leigh saying, \"We rewrote most of the dialogue, all of us, which was also unusual, and Mr. Welles always wanted our input. It was a collective effort, and there was such a surge of participation, of creativity, of energy. You could feel the pulse growing as we rehearsed. You felt you were inventing something as you went along. Mr. Welles wanted to seize every moment. He didn't want one bland moment. He made you feel you were involved in a wonderful event that was happening before your eyes.\"Leigh's agent initially rejected the low salary offered without even consulting the actress. Welles sent her a personal letter about how much he looked forward to working together. Leigh told her agent that being part of a movie directed by Welles was more important than any money.Welles also added the racism in the storyline -- Americans racist toward Mexicans, which as you can assume wasn't popular -- and shift in the narrative point of view. He also was very involved in the editing of the movie, working with Edward Curtiss until creative differences caused the editor to be replaced by Virgil Vogel. The film was finished by Aaron Stell with Universal locking Welles out, at which point he left to make Don Quixote. Welles was so shocked by the new cut that he wrote a memo explaining how he would edit the film.Universal cut fifteen more minutes and ordered reshoots that would be directed by Harry Keller. Heston and Leigh were contractually obligated to be in these new scenes, including one that had a stand-in play Welles' character. Heston said, \"I have done worse work in the movies than this day's retakes, but I don't remember feeling worse.\"After eeing a second cut of his film, with scenes he never shot, Welles tried one more time to save the movie with a 58-page note where he outlined how he saw the film working. The studio demanded that Welles attend a dialogue re-record. He refused.The film that was released was not the film Welles wanted. It really wasn't the movie anyone wanted. In 1976, UCLA film studies professor Robert Epstein discovered the preview cut in the Universal archives. This 108-minute edit of the film was as close to Welles vision as had ever been seen by the public. The film was re-edited in 1998 using Welles' 58-page memo.What emerged with the re-edits was a movie that was way better than past contemporary reviews would suggest. That said, even the original version won the top two awards at the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival, an event Universal didn't even want to screen the film at. The judges at that event were Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who made Breathless and The 400 Blows shortly after.The movie begins with a time bomb killing Rudy Linnekar and his girlfriend Zita (Joi Lansing), a crime investigated by Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas (Heston), who is on a honeymoon with his American wife Susie (Leigh). He's soon joined by Captain Hank Quinlan (Welles) and Sergeant Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia), who interrogate -- and plant evidence -- on a man named Sanchez. Vargas suspects that the older policemen have done this before and starts looking into their past.This puts the two lawmen against one another, with the stress of the battle finding Quinlan starting to drink after more than a decade sober and using the very criminal he's been investigating, Uncle Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), to not only assault Susie but to make it look like she's using drugs and killed the crime lord.Welles pushed each actor to doing things beyond what they did before, such as having Dennis Weaver be the opposite of his Gunsmoke character, as well as bringing in friends for small parts, including Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Cotton and Mercedes McCambridge, who has the movie's most terrifying line, as the gang surrounds the helpless Susie: \"I wanna watch.\"Touch of Evil may have taken years to be recognized -- Welles originally hated the film's title but eventually liked it -- but now it's a known classic.",

Yes, it's difficult to follow - the dialogue overlaps, there is some awkward structuring, and the self-censored non-rape scene now looks totally implausible. But these can easily be forgiven because there is so much skill, profundity and compelling detail to outweigh the shortcomings. Full marks to Murch and co. for their reconstruction (and the opening sequence does work a bit better now). Russell Metty deserves cinematic sainthood. Definitely in my top ten.",

The thing to note about its context in the grand scheme of things is that it's a sort of swan song to what started as the most promising career of any Hollywood director in Orson Wells and stands as a testament of what Welles could do with a story when his vision remained uncluttered by studio compromises.Touch of Evil also shows how people don't give enough credit to Orson Welles, the actor, for his brilliant performance here. The story which delves into everything from drugs, police corruption, and racist politics, is so well-constructed it feels as it is of Shakesperean proportions (Wells was influenced by Othello to some degree), and the dialogue, especially the lines by Marlene Dietrich, are so profound (i.e. \"Aren't you gonna read my future?\" \"You haven't got one.\") There are also great little touches: The Henry Mancini score and the setting of the Mexican-American border really makes the story that much more invigorating and every frame of the film is so beautifully shot.",

'There's no way that so many people can be wrong!' I thought. Well, I'm learning more and more every time I see films universally regarded as great by IMDbers that the majority can be wrong. This is the case with 'Touch of Evil'. What I saw here was wonderful camera work, especially with the beginning 4-minute continuous shot of the dynamite being placed and the introduction of Heston and Leigh....MASTERFUL work there. Another high point, IMO is Welles' performance. Not particularly ground-breaking, but it was a pretty good transformation by Welles, and his Capt. Quinlan was the only person on-screen that seemed genuine. After that, there wasn't anything that grabbed me. The story was a bit unbelievable...moreso by the stupidity of the main characters. The acting of ALL the other actors were just terrible IMO. Heston as a Mexican is just laughable...most people know that he is melodrama at its WORST. Talk about over-acting! You're a big-time narcotics officer... yet you just let your wife wander about with a bunch of strangers?? How stupid/neglectful can you be?? It's been a while since I've seen a character as naive and STUPID as Janet Leigh's character (Heston's wife).... she just wanted to get into trouble. Her character was a little too loose for me; she was all too willing to talk to these strange people and get into trouble....she made no sense. The Mexicans, as they were portrayed here, as well as the other policemen were all clowns, riddled with just HORRIBLE accents and clich\u00e9d stereotypes. They all just seemed happy to be in a movie and were as annoying and pathetic as they could possibly look. Welles, aside from his camera work and acting, couldn't do anything to save this 'illegible' mystery/thriller. The acting was below-average, and the story was nothing we haven't seen before; no kind of twist whatsoever. If the acting was first-rate, maybe the bare-bones plot wouldn't have hindered Touch of Evil as much....but hard luck there, the wooden acting did nothing to help. I can't see how this is rated so high here to be on the Top 250. Technical-wise this is impressive, but overall Touch of Evil is nothing special. *1/2 out of **** stars.",

            "content": "Touch of Evil is an interesting variant on the moral, \"The end justifies the means\". Detective-captain Hank Quinlan has the iron-clad reputation of never having failed on a case; - a reputation he has achieved partly through the exercise of a native intuition, partly through the fruits of a long experience, \"thirty years on the force\"; a reputation he has clinched by planting evidence to ensure the conviction of the guilty. Although Quinlan's motive (criminals strangled his wife) is not entirely worthy, the end would justify the means provided Quinlan can guarantee the infallibility of his judgment. Fortunately, this infallibility can be guaranteed here; - the conclusion resolves any doubts we might have as to Quinlan's ability.Quinlan is a dedicated man. Since (and because of) the loss of his wife, he has devoted his life to tracking down the evil-doer and ensuring his punishment.\nRamon Miguel Vargas, special narcotics investigator for the Mexican Ministry of Justice, is an idealist; - one of those thoroughly unlikable goodie-goodies, who yearn for truth in fact but not in principle; who affirm the time-worn philosophy of \"Charity begins anywhere but at home\". In short, a man whose very virtue makes him a greater menace to society than the criminals he is hunting.It is Vargas who questions Quinlan's ability. At the conclusion, Vargas has in effect, murdered three men. Yet their deaths are not on his conscience. His aura of virtue is so self-centered, so impregnable, that he feels no remorse. For, to his twisted mind, justice has been done.The scene is a dingy Mexican border town: from out of its shadows slips a hired thug to place a time bomb in the boot of a sleek American convertible. The owner of the car and his \"girl-friend\" approach, get in, and drive away. In a single take, the camera shoots up over the roof of an intervening building and down again to light in front of the car as it turns around the corner, then tracks back in front of the car as it drives down the street. The camera gradually swings around to the side until the car passes Vargas and his wife. The car moves out of the frame and the camera tracks with the two pedestrians. Arriving at the border, the camera catches up with the car which again drives out of the frame and explodes off-screen during a dialogue exchange between Vargas and wife.Touch of Evil was the first film Orson Welles directed in Hollywood since The Lady from Shanghai. After this bravura opening, Welles's direction becomes more restrained (some might say more mature) than usual (even discounting at least one flatly composed dialogue duet between Heston and Leigh that was added by the studio after Welles had left). Even Jack Arnold could have directed some of the scenes. Wellesian admirers, however, will find it sufficiently inventive, though somewhat less so than The Lady from Shanghai. Certainly the screenplay is not used merely as a frame for directorial wizardry. In Touch of Evil, as in Citizen Kane, Welles has something to say; - and he says it well.He is greatly assisted by Russell Metty's fine photography and Henry Mancini's percussive score. And unlike his performance in The Long Hot Summer, Welles brings more than his magnetic presence to the role of Hank Quinlan. He gambles successfully with audience sympathies. For though the obese Quinlan is a gross, slovenly character, he is nonetheless human (his obesity was an alternative to alcohol, slovenliness is the license of the loveless) and thus sympathetic. Welles's performance is never less than absorbing, and fully simulates the tragic undertones of the part.Usually relegated to stereotyped hamistry, Joseph Calleia gives his finest performance ever as Pete Menzies, Quinlan's loyal (finally wavering) sergeant. He conveys a rich sense of concentration, stillness, and disillusion.\nAkim Tamiroff as an oozing little border racketeer, servile and vicious, makes a superb study of seedy malevolence.Marlene Dietrich (beautifully photographed by Russell Metty) giftedly evokes the resigned cynicism of autumned love.Charlton Heston plays Vargas with an appropriately arch stuffiness. Janet Leigh is content to display her figure.To sum up: Brilliant.",

He was taking momentuous filmmaking steps decades forward into the art of film. Arguably this guy innovated and populaized film noir, and Touch of Evil is only one of his later film projects, so I can only imagine how crazy it must've been when folks in the 40s saw Citizen Kane-although I am clueless to what that film is actually like, I'm just assuming. The acting, dialogue and interactions between characters were as well, very much influential in terms of realism being conveyed more popularly in film. Bout to point out some issues with a classic, so pardon me, but this movie could've been a lot more investing if I cared about the characters or situations involved within the overarching scenario. A bundle of moments, just, kind of, played out, and that was the end of it, you know? You don't regularly get a apt amount of downtime or relaxation to learn more about your presented characters since this film is always moving expesititiously. You can also assume that scenes have been cut out or at least seem missing, and that could obviously be due to the fact of possible \"creative differences.\" Moving all of that bebop aside, Touch of Evil is a 1958 classic that defines revolutionary directorial technique-ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE DECLAMATORY CAMERA WORK-and sincerely set record-breaking bars with how masterful films can be with a singular-or doubular(?)-mastermind behind the camera. Its obscurely uncommon-notably during it's time in cinema-and I've got raving respect for that. So far, to my recent knowledge, Welles is an unimaginably distinct filmmaker. (Verdict: A-)",

The investigation on the US side is picked up by Captain Quinlan, an old style racist cop who goes by instinct and gets the proof later.  He is forced to work with drug prosecuting hero, Ramon Vargas, a Mexican cop on honeymoon with his white wife.  The investigation, and Quinlan's lack of legal procedure places him and Vargas in a direct confrontation.The story here is not so much about a murder as a story of atmosphere and two men squaring off at each other.  In fact the murder solution is barely mentioned and by the time it's solved it's not longer an issue in the story. The atmosphere makes the story and adds tension to the film by being set mostly in a Kafka-esque nightscape, with long shadows and fast movement. The story builds well, although I could have done with a little less of Vargas' wife's predicament in the motel and more of the two men.It's interesting (but not vital) to note that there are two versions of this film.  When Welles first shot the film the studio decided to make some changes and shoot some extra material.  When Welles found how he wrote a 50-odd page memo begging for the studio's changes to be taken back.  In the mid-90's a version was made that restored the film as close as possible to Welles' vision as laid out in the memo.  Both versions are as good as each other in my opinion \u0096 with the Welles version being a tad more cruel and dark, but really the only benefit of seeing both is to get bragging rights in the pub!Welles the director is great, but Welles the actor is even better.  He is a monstrous character \u0096 racist, corrupt and ruthless, however he manages this without feeling like a cartoon bad guy.  He is a much more interesting character than his alter ego Vargas.  In fairness, Heston is good \u0096 but he's lumbered with a pretty simple moralistic character, and to make it worse he's looks slightly blacked up to be able to play a Mexican.  However he works best when he's fencing with Welles \u0096 the two together bring sparks to the film.Overall this is a lesson in atmosphere \u0096 a good thriller story is taken to another level by excellent central performances and a great atmosphere by a great director.",

The maestro himself is unrecognizeable and seems to delight in coming on like a giant toad squatting on a soiled lily pad in the centre of a swamp.

If you liked it, I'd recommend his \"MacBeth\" from 1948 \u0097 although it's not quite the same narrative style, it does reshape Shakespeare's play into something like \"MacBeth the Barbarian\".\"Touch of Evil\" is visually stunning, but also full of social commentary. This was in the 1950's after all, with segregation mostly still in place \u0097 Rosa Parks had refused to give up her bus seat to a white person only three years ago. In those times, the US-Mexican border was widely perceived as the dividing line between civilization and Darwinian wilderness. Welles deliberately turned established ideology on its head when he cast Charlton Heston as the Mexican \"hero\" of law and order with a blonde American wife, whose American views ultimately get her into trouble \u0097 she feels she'll be much safer about anywhere in the US than in Mexico City, which turns out to be a fatal error of \"common sense\". If anything, Wells sets out to expose the reality behind every facade \u0097 that's why Mexican soothsayer Tanja (Marlene Dietrich) has the final, enigmatic line: \"Who cares what is said about people, anyway?\"This is a film noir in the true sense \u0097 it is dark and shockingly explicit for its time. But the fault lines between world views and reality, generalizations and intuition run both ways \u0097 Welles is too good a storyteller to make a narrow-minded \"good vs. evil\" tale. Heston, our \"good guy\", merely serves as the stick that stirs up a wasp's nest. Welles' character, the bloated \"monster\" of a US border police chief, is undoubtedly evil, but he is also shown to be right in the end. The planting of evidence to nail a criminal that you can't get to otherwise is morally despicable, but it also \"works\", in this case it brings on pressure to extract a confession. Like all like-minded individuals have claimed, \"It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it\", most recently in the form of the ticking time-bomb scenario, or \"Wouldn't you torture a terrorist who threatens to blow up the world?\"To some, the prospect of being right where it counts outweigh the times you could be wrong. The question rather becomes, where to draw the line? Welles' police chief oversteps his own line when he teams up with criminals to abduct and maltreat Heston's wife, in order to frame the Mexican and undermine his credibility. But his actions are a direct result of the need to cover up his regular misdoings.Others have already raved enough about the cinematography \u0097 it's certainly among the best Black & White films ever made. And it has suffered least from the degrading cuts and re-edits most of Welles' films were subjected to after \"Citizen Kane\". To get a comprehensive overview of Welles' films, I recommend the documentary \"Arena: The Films of Orson Welles\", which features many movie bits and a long interview with the maestro.",

After all, if you are a fan of one's work, you need to see the bad along with the good.Although the film was somewhat improved by the recent discovery of Welles' 58-page memo on the preferred editing of the piece, it suffers horribly from miscasting, bad acting, and an even worse script.At times the scripted dialog coupled with bad accents (whether ethnic or simply \"colorful\") is so grating that it causes one to laugh. The uninteresting, overly stereotyped characters are only emphasized by the unemotional acting. In some films this could be seen as satire, as a witty commentary. In this film it's just plain pap.About the only plus side is Welles' fantastic use of lighting, something that is greatly improved in the restored and re-edited cut of the film. The little border town feels much like it is portrayed: an empty, dark enigma, with something hidden in every shadow.However, surrounding the whole film is a story that just simply isn't very interesting. A few of the surrounding sub-plots aren't too bad, but as the film fails to generate any interest in the characters themselves one quickly loses interest in the simple plot.",

And yet, although the scene sets up the story it is a very slim one and as we progress from major set up to intimate groupings it becomes evident that the look is the thing. The ragged story drops away to be replaced by a focus on the fantastical figure of the corrupt cop played in unbelievably unpleasantly, decrepit and ugly manner by Orson Welles himself, a most diabolical creation. The seeming side issue of sex and drugs adds an unpleasant taste as the terrible tale of corruption of power and power of corruption teeters towards an inevitable conclusion. It is unfortunate that Welles seemed to have less an eye on those actors other than himself and as Janet Leigh struggles and Charlton Heston insists he is in his own little film this B-movie is held together brilliantly but unnecessarily by that, albeit brilliant, look alone.",

The casting of Charlton Heston as a Mexican is just plain ridiculous, there's no way around it. There are a couple of bits that just don't convince. The climax while spectacular and unforgettable isn't realistic if you think about it too much, and Janet Leigh's character goes through some heavy stuff then suddenly it's all glossed over. But you know what? It just doesn't matter. I can't see anybody watching it thinking these few flaws spoiled it. Welles' direction is astonishing, subtle and yet flamboyant if that makes any sense. His acting is also first rate. He's virtually unrecognizable as Quinlan and gives one of the best performances of his career. Leigh is very good, as is Joseph Calleia who plays Quinlan's loyal sidekick. I also really enjoyed Dennis Weaver's bit as a jumpy motel clerk and Marlene Dietrich as an enigmatic gypsy. I think it takes three or four viewings of 'Touch Of Evil' to really start to appreciate it as it's full of interesting moments that might pass you by at first. 'Citizen Kane' is universally regarded as Welles' masterpiece but 'Touch Of Evil' is the Welles I watch the most. It's an utterly brilliant movie that is still extremely underrated.

Basically on the border between the United States of America and Mexico a time bomb is planted in the boot of a car, and it is drives to cross the border, and a couple of times newlyweds Ramon Miguel 'Mike' Vargas (Charlton Heston) and Susan 'Susie' (Janet Leigh) pass the vehicle before it crosses, and after doing so it blows up and kills the passengers. Mike works for the Mexican government as a drug enforcement official, and knowing the implications of bombs from Mexico to America exploding he decides to join in any investigation he can, and also looking into it are police Chief Gould (Harry Shannon) and District Attorney Adair (Ray Collins), but also the peculiar Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and his long time partner Police Sergeant Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia). Young Mexican man Manelo Sanchez (Victor Millan) is the prime suspect for Quinlan and Menzies, as he was secretly married to the daughter of one of the victims in the explosion, Mike is there during the interrogation, he accidentally knocks over an empty shoebox, and in moments this same box two sticks of dynamite are in it, so Mike suspects Quinlan has been planting evidence to help with his convictions over the years. Although Quinlan denies this Vargas still wants to see his public case records, so Al Schwartz (Mort Mills), the District Attorney's assistant lets him study them, and Gould and Adair are shown the findings as well, but Quinlan himself comes in and threatens resignation in anger over their discussion. There is a risk of the brother of a man Mike was investigating, 'Uncle' Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) trying to expose things, so Susie moves from their Mexican hotel to a motel in America, one that Menzies recommended, staffed by mentally challenged Night Manager (Duel's Dennis Weaver) and with no other guests staying, but family members of Grandi take over the motel. Mike becomes worried when he tries telephoning Susie and she does not answer, in fact Quinlan has arrangement with Grandi that his gang will kidnap her, inject her with drugs and taken to another motel out of town, and indeed this happens, Quinlan murders Grandi and Susie is framed for the murder to give her husband a bad name. Mike goes to have a word with Menzies about the history of the cases he and Quinlan investigating and \"found\" evidence in, he dismisses any conspiracy he has, and then he goes looking for his wife at the motel but she and her gun have gone, so he goes to the other motel that Grandi owns and confronts his gang, they refuse to answer questions so he beats them up. Schwartz tells him that Susie was arrested for murder, but when he finds her she is barely conscious, and then Menzies comes to tell him that Quinlan's cane was found at the scene of Grandi's murder, so Mike fits him with a wire so he can go to see his partner and hear a conversation between them. At an oil field is where Quinlan and Menzies meet to discuss their activities while Mike records everything, the traitor cop admits he planted evidence on people to make them guiltier than they already were, but the tapping is uncovered by the sound of static. Quinlan knows that Mike is there watching and listening, and in the heat of the moment he shoots Menzies with Vargas's gun, but before he can shoot Mike dead Menzies gets up and shoots Quinlan, Menzies dies and eventually so does Quinlan, Sanchez is revealed to have admitted to the crime of planting the car bomb, and Mike leaves town with a recovered Susie. Also starring Joanna Moore as Marcia Linnekar , Valentin De Vargas as Pancho, Lalo Rios as Risto , Marlene Dietrich as Tanya, Zsa Zsa Gabor as Strip-Club Owner, The Third Man's Joseph Cotten as Coroner and The Exorcist's Mercedes McCambridge as Gang Leader. Heston gives a good performance as the man determined to get to the truth of the matter, Leigh gets her moments as the wife pulled into the situations, but obviously Welles is best part of this film as the treacherous cop with the villainous dark side, and his direction is well paced as well, some supporting cast members, especially Dietrich, are terrific as well. The film opens with one of the most famous long shots in cinema which is played out so well with clever tracking, and the film is filled with interesting material about conspiracy, double-crossing, murder and melodrama, it is one of the last true film noir style pictures, I admit I lost track of plot on occasions, but overall it is a watchable classic crime thriller.

            "content": "A bedeviled masterwork from Orson Welles, 1958's \"Touch of Evil\" is as stylish a piece of film noir cinema as I have ever seen, all the more arresting for the fact that the plot is pure dime-store pulp fiction same as his earlier classic \"The Lady from Shanghai\". This time, he plays Hank Quinlan, the central character, a grossly obese, corrupt police captain in a Mexican border town named Los Robles, evidently once an idealistic law enforcer who let his ego take control toward a Machiavellian sense of power over the town. For instance, when he thinks he's right about a suspect, Quinlan will manufacture evidence than uncover real facts to expedite his cases. While Quinlan's bloated physical state is an obvious metaphor for his moral decline, it is painful to watch Welles embody the character so literally knowing how his own career was in decline at the time. Yet, he is as masterful as he was in \"Citizen Kane\", evoking the increasing isolation of a man obsessed by power.As a director, he remains peerless when it comes to heightening the pictorial aspects of film. No one composed shots more dramatically than Welles, and he used deep shadows to enhance the seediness of the plot. The expert cinematography is by Russell Metty. His famously lengthy opening tracking shot through the streets and over buildings is still a marvel of seamless exposition, and he did an even longer, more subtle single shot in the apartment where the incriminating dynamite is placed. Welles audaciously cast several name actors in pivotal roles starting with the leads. In between his massive Biblical epics \"The Ten Commandments\" and \"Ben-Hur\", Charlton Heston actually gives what I think is his career-best performance as Mexican narcotics officer Mike Vargas, the moral opposite of Quinlan who gets caught in the captain's web as he is honeymooning with his American wife Susan. She is portrayed by Janet Leigh, who for once, comes across as effortlessly sexy here before she is dragged through the corruption herself. Their characters are entangled in the car explosion murder of a rich contractor and his girlfriend and the labyrinth of frame-ups instigated by Quinlan to uphold his standing.The inhabitants of Los Robles are a rogue's gallery of eccentric characters filled with some surprising star cameos. Welles provides legend Marlene Dietrich with one of her best roles as Tanya, a cynical Gypsy fortune teller who still has some residue feeling for Quinlan. Zsa Zsa Gabor stops by for about twenty seconds in a non-speaking part as a strip joint owner, just enough not to ruin the movie. Dennis Weaver, on the other hand, overplays the nervous, sex-crazed motel manager as almost a precursor to Norman Bates from \"Psycho\", a parallel made ironic by the presence of Leigh in a similarly abandoned motel. His character seems pitched somewhere between Anthony Perkins and Don Knotts. Russian-born character actor Akim Tamiroff is effectively greasy as Uncle Joe Grandi, a sweaty drug dealer with a terrible toupee, constantly looking like a pig facing slaughter. Joseph Calleia is excellent as Pete Menzies, Quinlan's longtime partner who has grown weary of being his pigeon. Mercedes McCambridge has a slimy bit as a leather-jacketed dyke. There are also a blind shopkeeper, a drug smuggler, a terrorizing gang of juvenile delinquents who instigate a rape, and ancillary parts played by \"Citizen Kane\" alumni, Joseph Cotten and Ray Collins.The story behind the 1998 re-edit presented here is fascinating, as it reflects a 58-page memo from Welles to Universal Studios chief Ed Muhl after the filmmaker saw the bastardized cut. Master film editor Walter Murch followed Welles' instructions and reinserted scenes deleted from the original release. Much of this is chronicled in Michael Ondaatje's insightful 2002 interview book, \"The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film\". The text of the memo and the film trailer are the only real extras in the DVD. Even with its flaws and the story's inherent tawdriness, this is essential viewing of work by a master who could never maintain the momentum of his genius in Hollywood.",

He has no idea what is happening and thinks it has something to do the devolution of Welles' [sic] character.\"  Well, guess what: it is.Spoilers ahead...The comments I was going to write now seem beside the point.  I was going to challenge the popular assumption that Hank Quinlan only framed people who were in fact guilty.  We're TOLD this, but only by a character who's scarcely in a better position to know than we are; in point of fact, the fact that Quinlan's last subject has confessed to his alleged crime doesn't even conclusively establish HIS guilt, given the tactics Quinlan's underlings are likely to employ and the nature of the world in which they work.  There's no doubt that Quinlan is a far more skilled detective than Vargas and has a nose for guilt and innocence.  But he's not supernaturally acute.  He's bound to make the occasional mistake - and what's more, his powers are decaying. ...But the first thing I read when I look at earlier comments is that the film isn't about Quinlan at all, nor even Vargas; rather, it's a \"meditation on space\".  That's right: however much the film might SEEM to be about a policeman who has been corrupted by his own talent, its REAL subject matter is a geometrical abstraction.  I won't argue against this loony view; it's not as if the fellow who espouses it bothered to argue FOR it.  But I'll admit I'm flummoxed.  It makes the misconception I identified earlier seem like a small matter indeed.Another small matter: Hank Quinlan is purportedly a \"charismatic\" Welles villain, like Harry Lime.  Did I miss the point in finding him repellent?  I think not.  Quinlan is indeed like Lime: although each man charms those close to him - and we're permitted to see why - neither is meant to charm US.  We, being outsiders, can see them for what they are.  (Just as Vargas, being an outsider, sees Quinlan for what he is.)As you'll have gathered, this is a great film, even if it's not a particularly pleasant one.  The Tijuana locations (so integrated is the art direction that we have no way of working out what was shot on location, what wasn't, or whether or not the shooting location really was Tijuana or somewhere miles away) are as seedy as the story demands (\"border towns bring out the worst in a country,\" and Welles et al. make damned sure it really IS the worst), with Janet Leigh being the only ray of light.",

Vargas must prove that Quinlan isn't the hero that others make him out to be, but is actually corrupt and is railroading a Mexican youth (Victor Millan) into prison for the crime.This viewer can now see why film fans and scholars hold this production in high regard. That elegant, extended opening tracking shot is merely the beginning of an intense, stark, and atmospheric tale. Based on the novel \"Badge of Evil\" by Whit Masterson, it moves forward with incredible purpose. It forces its audience to stay on their toes and pay attention, with rapid fire dialogue and breathless delivery by many of the actors.

It didn't move me like it has so many others. In contrast Touch of Evil is a much smaller film in scope, but on the other hand I felt you could get a better grasp of it.Then again, even though Touch of Evil is well acted, directed and shot, it doesn't rise above its peers in any significant way.

Orson Welles, sitting in the director's chair, may have gone overboard in his quest to probe these depths, although post-production on the film wasn't exactly trouble-free and he was eventually ousted from that post en route to a studio-mandated final cut.

Go on, quit reading now!The movie opens with an amazing 3+ minute tracking shot where a well-dressed young man places a bomb activated by a timer set at 3 minutes, runs away, the eventual victims get into the car, we follow it through the streets of this Mexcian border town, into the USA, where it explodes and kills the occupants. Charleton Heston is the Mexican drug czar who witnesses the bombing, and Orson Welles is the American detective who has an amazing record of convictions, we suspect because he sometimes plants 'evidence' against the presumed guilty. he does it here, planting 2 sticks of dynamite in the room of the Mexican boyfriend of the dead man's daughter. Heston is witness that the box containing the evidence was empty just minutes earlier. The rest of the movie is the Mexican strongman threatening Heston's wife, Janet Leigh, then kidnapping and drugging her, and trying to pin on her the murder of the Mexican, actually strangled by Welles. In the end, using a remote recorder and microphone on Welles' right-hand man, gets Welles to confess, there is a shooting, then another, Welles falls dead into the water at night, meantime the accused Mexican confesses to the bombing, Welles' planted evidence was unnecessary, and it led to his downfall.

            "content": "Very slight possible spoiler, shouldn't ruin the film for you though...I think too many people believe that in order to be a movie aficionado, you have to believe everything Orson Welles every breathed on is a work of genius. You don't and it's not. Like most of Mr. Welles' work, this film is competent but overrated.I give this a five due to the very noteworthy photography, and Marlena Deitrich totally pulling the thing from the jaws of defeat. Her role is all too brief, but brilliantly portrayed. Charlton Heston is as annoying and silly as usual, but his remarkably uninteresting performance is well compensated for by a host of more capable cast members. Here's what nearly ruins the whole show: Janet Leigh portrays what must be the all time most absolute stupidest 1950's wife ever put on film, and this in an era when women were all too often portrayed as drooling idiots who always fall down and twist their ankle at the least opportune moment. In this odious performance, she is taken by her husband to a crappy motel in the desert, to escape the vengeance of the drug pushers who are out to get them (she's already spent a fair length of the film following them down dark alleys and meeting them in seedy dives that no one who valued their life would be caught dead in). Her husband leaves her there at the Motel Hell alone and goes back to the movie. She learns almost immediately that she has been unwittingly left alone at a motel that is in the control of the stereotypical 1950's hop-heads, there is no one there to help her, and she can't get a phone call out to her husband. What does she do? Does she try to slip away and hide in the desert? Make a run for it? Attempt to fashion some sort of weapon with which to defend herself? Flag a passing car? No. This imbecile spends the next two days (seems more like two weeks) lounging around in flimsy negligees, looking either annoyed, concerned, or constipated, while she waits for the bad guys to bust in and menace her with their villainy. Dear Lord! Anybody THAT idiotic deserves to be raped and shot full of drugs. What a dunce.Overlooking this subplot (and what a steaming pile it is to overlook!) we are left with a not-too-shabby story of corrupted law enforcement officials and the struggle of those they have framed to extricate themselves from injustice. It's not awful, but it's a far cry from genius.",

            "content": "\"Listen, I'm no cop now. I'm a husband! What did you do with her? Where's my wife?\". These are the shouts of anger and frustration that seep out of Vargas' mouth as he frantically beats information out of thugs responsible for kidnapping his wife. This being only a miniature plot point in unraveling the mess Vargas has gotten himself into in proving the corruption and guilt of a famous American cop and a Mexican drug boss respectively. Orson Welles' film noir tutorial on how to make a cinematic masterpiece is an experience you will never forget. Shot beautifully in black and white, it vividly portrays how humans abuse their power once in possession of it and is a masterful character study. Welles' ahead-of-its-time approach to film making with his famous and stylish camera angles that paint symbolic pictures on their subjects is a wonder to look at, giving his films such realism and credibility even by today's standards, as compared to the films of the day (1958), this was one of the most realistic of all. In addition to this, Orson Welles is one of the great story tellers and this is arguably the most brilliant detective film of all time.In what is one of the longest single cut intros ever captured on celluloid, the film begins with an assassination of an American business tycoon on the American side of the Mexican/American border. A Mexican narcotics officer named Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his American wife Susan (Janet Leigh) witness the bombing on the Mexican side and Vargas heads over to help with crime scene investigations. It is only a matter of time before the famous intuition based Chief of Police on the American side Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) arrives at the scene to give his 'honest' opinion.The bomb was planted on the Mexican side, so Vargas decides to remain on the investigation. Following agreements and disagreements on jurisdiction, the cops on both sides of the border unite to investigate this horrible crime. However, on top of THIS investigation, Vargas has another problem. His involvement in the GRANDI narcotics cartel breakdown has him as an important witness in putting away the cartel's boss and therefore puts his wife in danger, as the boss's mafia, including his brother Joe Grandi attempt to threaten Vargis and scare him off the case, which could determine the boss' life or death verdict.Following little investigation on the bombing the previous night, with Vargas' wife safely brought to a remote motel in the desert to protect her from the Grandis, Vargas captures the hard edged corruption of Hank Quinlan in a red handed framing of a bombing suspect, who Quinlan claims is the guilty one according to his never failing intuition that was famous for bringing down previous criminals. Vargas' nosy, good-cop attitude to his work threatens Quinlan and it isn't long before he teams up with Joe Grandi in a conspiracy to frame Vargis - to prevent Vargis from putting both men away. What follows is deception, murder, abuse of power and greed and a complex character study that make this poignant film 'TOUCH OF EVIL' an unforgettable classic in its genre.Orson Welles created one of the darkest, most powerful film noirs ever assembled with 'Touch Of Evil'. Watching it, you feel like you are there the whole time with its rich Mexican atmosphere. Welles himself brings his fat hard-boiled corrupt, drunkard Police Chief Quinlan to life with such conviction that you hate him to death only 5 minutes into the film. It was the best, most effective corrupt cop portrayal I've ever seen. Charlton Heston's portrayal of a man in a dilemma in between doing his job as a good cop and being a husband was the most powerful aspect of the film. He plays a Mexican very well, and you easily forget it is Charlton Heston in the unusual role. Janet Leigh was perfect. Her beautiful and stand-strong exterior made her one hell of an actress and her performance was commanding and elegant. My favorite character however was Marlene Dietrich in her minor role as a tough mentally unbreakable prostitute 'Tanya'. Her attitude towards Quinlan, an old friend, is amusing and touching at the same time - her presence always accompanied by the film's only musical piece, rarely played throughout, that gives such a 'that's life' attitude to the film which is unforgettable. The tune will be playing in your head long after the film's conclusion. The cinematography is rough and crisp assisting the film's atmosphere impeccably. The rich black and white choice for filming is a feast for the eyes and Welles' film making techniques are modern and ahead of their time with powerful camera angles and smooth camera movements to move a complex story along.'Touch Of Evil' is the most patient, dark and captivating film noir of them all. The powerful imagery, the superb cast, the twisted plot and the haunting musical tune rarely played come together to formulate an almost dream-like experience. Film has rarely so vividly and masterfully painted corruption quiet like it. They don't make movies like this anymore. Orson Welles, one of the most respected directors in film history, made his definitive masterpiece with this entry. A divine character study and a milestone in the darkest of genres, Film Noir.",

The actors are all great, their dialogue delivered impeccably every second of the film. But then if you do start to look at this film more closely, it is enormously complex. I did see this film in a film class, and my professor pointed out many little things throughout the film. There are so many hidden things around this film, one has to look very closely. So watch this film dozens of times if need be. Every time is just as good. And I pray that Criterion will do a version of this movie, the same way they did the Third Man.

This didn't happen till 1996 and that's the version that's shown today. From the incredibly long tracking shot that opens the film you're mesmerized. It moves quickly with plenty of overlapping dialogue and some truly astonishing direction from Welles. The story is nothing new but the dialogue and the way Welles shoots the picture certainly is. The acting is good all around--especially by Heston and Welles. Only complaints--I was never a fan of Marlene Dietrich and this film doesn't change my mind.

            "content": "Okay - i was simply blown away by Touch of Evil. I think it was the most surprising Wellesian experience i've had since my initial viewing of Citizen Kane. Welles injects his brilliant visual sensibilities and gift for telling a story with a camera into a dark, exciting crime story. Quite simply - its the greatest film noir ever made - the best thriller i've ever seen, and certainly more suspenseful than anything Hitchcock ever did. I won't talk about any images or shots, because i think words can't do justice to them - but i will say that Touch of Evil is much more than just the opening shot: this opening shot, while incredible, is all anyone ever says about this movie. There are many other great moments in it. Just make sure you see the 1998 version, currently out on DVD under the phrase \"restored to Orson Welles' vision\" - the original theatrical release of 1958 was not edited to Welles' vision, and was released the way the studio wanted it. Welles' would have been happy with the 1998 restoration, which was edited how he wanted it done.The most surprising thing about Touch of Evil was Welles' performance - i'm a big fan of Welles' as a director, but i usually just enjoy his acting, though it often seems ungenuine (in Othello and Macbeth, for example). Recently i've been exposed to his great performance in Compulsion and his own cinematic opus \"Chimes at Midnight\" as Falstaff. Yet Hank Quinlan seemed to me the most true and genuine of the lot. Often, especially near the end, i got the feeling i do when watching Brando - that i'm really watching a character. When the character on screen is so convincing it starts to change your perception of the actor's personality! There were a few moments when he touched me to the quick with his acting - Quinlan's \"halo\" line, near the end, was one.Touch of evil is a thing to be beheld. Although his four surviving masterpieces are hard to pick between, i place it here:1. Citizen Kane 2. Touch of Evil 3. Chimes at Midnight 4. The TrialTo place it above Chimes at Midnight is high praise indeed - though Chimes perhaps has more stunning visual moments, especially for its lesser budget, i guess i could associate more with this noirish world than with the Shakespearean world of Chimes.Clifford.",

Almost like every noir fans wet dream, at least visually. Some of the scenes on the road were achingly beautiful.And you must have some balls to not really foreground the amazing score by Henry Mancini. Most people would have played it on and on and written scenes where it could have been played. But the terrific score was always in the background (I guess that's why its called background score) unlike in say The Third Man where that melancholic tune was in every single scene as if the director wanted to emphasize that this is a tragic-comic film.It was quite obvious that Tough of Evil wasn't really about the plot. It is one of the most stylish films ever made. I read some posts saying how its about corruption. But you just wanted to show off your prowess as a director, right Orson? The likes of Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma owes so much to you.It was pretty subversive for a pre-60s film, what with the lesbians and the references to reefers.Janet Leigh does have a lot of make up on at the beginning but she becomes gorgeous as the film progresses.

Trouble is there's a certain amount of tension created by this level of visual imagination: namely, that the camera risks competing with the storyline instead of complementing it. Fortunately for ToE, Welles complements his b&w tour-de-force with equally unreal grotesque characters (except Heston and Leigh). This part of the film succeeds, in spades. However, Welles also wants to track Quinlan's downfall in a semi-tragic way from good cop to bad. In that key respect-at least in my little book-Welles' style and grotesqueries overwhelm whatever pathos there may be in Quinlan's downfall. And as the last minutes show, this is indeed a major dramatic goal of Welles'.Overall, it appears that the movie is now overpraised. It may have undeservedly flopped upon release, but now in many quarters, it appears beyond criticism. Still, compare camera mastery here with that of a noir kingpin like Anthony Mann (Border Incident {1949}, Reign of Terror {1949}) for insight. Mann too has great visual imagination, but always to heighten the drama and not to flourish effects for their own sake. I get the feeling in ToE that Welles indulges his talent too often for its own sake and not as a dramatic component. The end result is thus more like a flashy surreal flourish than an affecting saga of Quinlan's downfall. In ToE, Welles may amount to a visual genius, but as a drama, ToE is of a lesser order. Nonetheless, The movie remains a rich slice of exotica not to be passed up.",

S. is enough to turn the most ardent viewer into a borderline alcoholic....and that's before we begin to unravel the intricacies of the story.Henry Mancini's exotic, stylish score, over the credits suggests we are about to experience something special, even volatile. Within moments there is the spectacle of an exploding limousine. The result of a crime committed in Mexico, but causing havoc across the border.Witnessed by honeymooning narcotics detective, Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his American wife (Janet Leigh), Heston is inevitably drawn into the ensuing murder case. He is soon introduced to the local police celebrity, in the shape of walking jumble sale, Orson Welles-not so much a plain clothes man as a shabby clothes man. Lumbering around in what seem to be the rejected duds from the Oxfam Shop, he makes Columbo look like Daniel Craig. Upon crossing into Mexico, Welles meets old acquaintance Marlene Dietrich, to whom he is unrecognizably grotesque and she could be excused for greeting him with, \"Who's eaten all the pies, then?\" As the investigation proceeds, Heston becomes increasingly appalled at Welles' corrupt methods, which include racist slurs and planting evidence.Meanwhile, an exhausted Janet Leigh has found 'sanctuary' at a motel, where she encounters show stealing Dennis Weaver, unforgettable as the highly strung, bundle of nerves, permanently freaked-out night man. Confined to her room and at the mercy of the not so grand Grandi boys, ('nephews' of tin pot drug baron, Akim Tamiroff, who spends half of his screen time losing his rag and the other half losing his rug.), Leigh is intimidated, drugged, kidnapped and ultimately framed for murder. The mind boggles at the review she would have written on Tripadvisor!Eventually catching up with the Grandi boys in a bar Charlton's athletic prowess comes to the fore as he conducts an uncontrolled explosion of his own, resulting in a demolished jukebox, just as the burgeoning rock 'n' roll culture was bringing the '45' to a wider audience.During a moment of introspective melancholy, Welles bemoans the fact that all he has to show for 30 years of police work is a turkey ranch and two acres. Using a deftly aimed boot, Heston would have gladly furnished him with another two achers of a more personal kind, but realizes that the crooked cop has to be brought down through stealth.Hijacked by the moguls at Universal, who shot extra scenes and carried out extensive re-editing, Touch of Evil remains perhaps the best late entry film noir, one of the most beguiling and intriguing movies of all time and arguably Welles' greatest achievement.In an alternative universe, The Mothers of Invention and The Velvet Underground sold almost as many records as The Beatles, whilst a decade earlier Dennis Weaver cruised to the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, leaving rival nominees floundering in his vapour trail.Complexities of the plot? There's a very simple message. Never leave yer car boot unlocked!",

For some reason it has taken me some time to be able to see this one, so expectations have been building up for some years now. I must say, I haven't been disappointed.The cinematography is, as always, beautiful, sometimes spectacular. The opening scene is especially daring. A tracking shot, from a crane, lasting several minutes, switching focus, back and forth, between a pedestrian couple and a moving car. It seems impossible, but it works beautifully.The cast is also very attractive. It stars the somewhat robust Charlton Heston and the attractive Janet Leigh. Heston is a young, idealistic law enforcer (Vargas), who is surrounded by characters of a more dubious nature. Welles' character, Hank Quinlan, being his counterpart. Joseph Cotten makes an appearance, as does Marlene Dietrich, in a great role. We follow Vargas in a struggle to maintain his righteousness and Quinlan as his mask drops, revealing a corrupt policeman.However, the excellent storyline learns that there's more to it than meets the eye. There's always a second, and then a third glance. We learn that Quinlan has good reason to work the way he has up to now. We learn that Vargas may not be able to uphold his clean status forever (\"I am not here as a policeman, but as a husband\" he proclaims towards the end of the movie, in a rage). In the middle of the movie, Vargas is in a grocery store, which is tended by a blind girl. The camera focuses repeatedly on a sign that reads: If you're mean enough to steal from the blind, help yourself. This, obviously, supposed to be something of a motto for the movie. Who are the blind? Lady Justice, for sure. Also the wrongfully accused (But are there really any in this story?) But in the final scene it may be Vargas who tries to 'steal' from the 'blinded' Quinlan...As in The Trial, Welles shows his skills as a storyteller, one being able to enrich his story with morality and careful study of human behavior. The whole thing reminded me of No Country for Old Men, because of the story, but also the excellent cinematography. Both movies cross the American-Mexican border now and then. Of course, in Welles movie there's never any comedy.All in all, I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to watch a movie more than ten years old. It's excellent.",

Town sheriff Quinlan (Welles) immediately shows up on the scene, and Vargas offers to help with the investigation. When Quinlan plants evidence at a suspect's house Vargas swears to bring him down, and what follows is a Film-Noir thriller.It is no doubt a good movie, but there are some pretty bad parts to it. For instance, Heston playing a Mexican. Charlton Heston is not, has not been, and will never be a Mexican, he is not believable at all in his role, but he does try. The acting is quite good, especially from Leigh, she does very well.The worst part of this film by far is Welles screen time. The film claims that Heston is the main character, but Welles soaks up as much screen time as he possibly can. A perfect example of this is the ending, when Heston leaves and we are given five minutes of Welles wandering about drunkenly. It just didn't work. He is a terrific actor and this is a great performance, but it would've been just as complete had Welles left a few of his scenes on the cutting room floor. I mean, remember Welles in \"The Third Man\", where he played another proud, ruthless villain. He gave an electrifying performance in that film, and left just as good an impression, but he only had one scene of dialogue!See, I don't think that a supporting character like Welles' should be the study of the film...supporting characters are meant to operate in the shadows.It is still a good movie though, with a few good surprises and a great atmosphere and theme. Though, I have to say, its spot on the IMDb Top 250 is completely undeserved.7.5/10.",

            "content": "With all the cop drama TV shows and films that have come out over the years and the corruption thrillers, revisiting an old noir thriller such as \"Touch of Evil\" about cops taking justice into their own hands can be unexciting. There's very little that those of a younger generation haven't seen before, so what separates \"Touch of Evil\" from the pack? Good film-making. In the long tracking shot that consumes the opening scene, you understand right away that Orson Welles is serious about his finest directorial effort, and that no matter how un-thrilling the story might be, that this what good movies look like.I watched the 1998 re-release featuring scenes that the studio cut that Welles wanted to keep in, always the best way to watch a classic in a time where this was even more common practice than it is today. Welles' style is reminiscent of Hitchcock, only choosing close-ups in critical scenes so that they have a big dramatic impact. I can only speculate, but I wouldn't be surprised if \"Touch of Evil\" got actress Janet Leigh her unforgettable role in \"Psycho\" two years later.\"Touch of Evil\" stars Charlton Heston fresh off the heels of \"The Ten Commandments\" as Mike Vargas, a (unconvincing) Mexican narcotics official that's wanted dead by a Mexican narcotics dealer gets caught playing a role in a murder investigation when a car explodes when he and his wife Susie (Leigh) are on Honeymoon in a Mexican border town. The infamous local police captain Hank Quinlan (an almost unrecognizably overweight Welles) suspects a Mexican national and soon Vargas is on to Quinlan, accusing him of planting evidence. Meanwhile, Susie is kidnapped by the dealer's nephews to be used as a bargaining chip.Not just directing and writing, but from an acting standpoint, this is Welles' film too. Not only does Quinlan take up much of the screen, but his old crooked persona makes him easily the most interesting character. He's a cop struggling between right and wrong, operating on a false sense of justice. It's not highly original, but Quinlan is our main draw to the story. It's certainly not Heston pretending to be Mexican.Quick pacing and suspenseful, shadowy direction is the real signature Welles leaves on the film. There's no particular emotional investment in the story or characters, just intrigue in knowing when everything is going to finally get nasty and dangerous instead of the continuous verbal accusations. Welles does deliver and brings the film to a thrilling climax that confirms our suspicions of what was really the most important part of his film. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",

The camera shots & angles Welles used directing this proved that he could direct as well as many yet he really only did them for this one film.

Heston plays Vargus, a Mexican policeman who begins to suspect something is wrong with the first murder in the film. Janet Leigh is his wife and becomes a victim in Welles efforts to mess up her husbands investigation.This films offers an excellent Henry Mancini musical score and good support from Dennis Weaver & Ray Collins among a strong cast in the film. This films restoration can be greatly appreciated by film fans as it was one of the earlier film restoration efforts which means not only is it as originally made but the film actually has more to it now than when it originally appeared in the theater.This is a film which to me measures up to Welles Citizen Kane and in some ways is even better technically than Kane.",

            "content": "(There are Spoilers) The movie \"Touch of Evil\" explodes in your face right at the opening scene when prominent Los Robles citizen and building magnet Rudy Linnekar and his date local stripper Zita are blown to pieces when their car detonates just as it crosses the Mexican/USA border. At the scene in Mexican are the two newlyweds Narcotics Agent Miguel \"Mike\" Vargas and his pretty American wife Susie who witnessed the entire horrifying event. Vargas is the star witness in a major drug trial in Mexico City involving drug kingpin \"Big Boss\" Grandi who's brother Joe lives, with a number of his nephews, in Los Robles and is suspected in the bombing. Being that the murder happened at the border it bring in local Los Robles US police Chief Capt. Hank Quinland who likes doing things \"His Way\" and resents Vargas, a Mexican, being on the case.Quinlan is somewhat of a legend in Los Robles being that he solved almost all the major crimes in the town over the last thirty years. what people don't know is that he solved them by planting and rigging evidence and then having scores of suspects, many of them innocent, sentenced to prison or even executed.Quinlan plants a number of dynamite sticks on Manelo Sanchez who was dating Rudy Linneker's daughter Marcia and who may have had a motive to kill Rudy since he was violently against his young and beautiful daughter marrying a Mexican. Mike Vargas being on the scene makes it possible and convenient for both Hank Quinlan and Joe Grandi to get together to frame him and his wife in a drug scam. This is to get Vargas out of the way of both their corrupt operations in and out of town; Quinlan's illegal police practices and Grandi's attempt to get his brother off from being convicted, in Mexico City where he standing trial. That only happen by making Vargas look guilty as a drug supplier for his drug addicted wife that would destroy him as a credible witness against his drug dealing brother. It's this evil alliance between Quinlan and Grandi that leads to the horror and murder that happens to Vargas his wife Susie and in the end Quinlan's partner in crime Grandi in the film and destroys their plan to frame the Vargas'. Orsen Wells, who was 42 at the time, looks at least 15 years older then he really is as the corrupt and murderous lowlife Hank Quinlan. Wells projects an evil just by his grotesque and unkempt appearance that makes you cringe in your seat just at the very sight of him. Constantly stuffing himself with candy bars and washing them down with either booze or coffee or both, while smoking a cigar, makes him look as if he hasn't slept or bathed in weeks and looking like someone that come out of your worst nightmare.Charlton Heston is both tough and touching as Mexican Norcotics Agent Miguel \"Mike\" Vargas a marked man who's both trying to find his kidnapped wife and at the same trying to avoid getting murdered by Grandi's boys and framed by Quinlan.Quinlan has Mrs. Vargas shot up with truth serum to made it look like illegal drugs and places her in Grandi's \"Ritz Hotel\" to later be found and arrested for drug use and drug possession. Quinlan then double-crosses the startled Grandi by brutally murdering him and leaving him there in the hotel room with the unconscious Mrs. Vargas. So that a murder rap, that he's planting on her, can be added on to her indictment.Vargas gets help from an unlikely source Los Robles Police Sergeant Pete Menzies who's Quinlan's second in command, and a life-long admirer of him, after he found Quinlan's cane at the murder scene and realizing that he was setting up and framing the Vargas for Joe Grandi's murder. Setting Quinlan up by having Menzies wire himself with a tape-recorder Varges gets the evidence that he needs to have Quinlan indited for his crimes and prove that he and his wife, Susie, were framed by the corrupt cop. But in the end it wasn't necessary since both Quinlan and Menzies ended up dead shooting each other. The irony in the whole story is that even though Quinlan framed Sanchez, for the bombing murder of Rudy Linnekar and his girlfriend Zita, it later turned out that for once that Quinlan was right as Sanchez himself confessed to the two murders at the end of the movie. Fascinating Film-Noir Classic about sleaze corruption and murder with an added surprise by having actress Marlene Dietrich as Quinlan's old flame and local fortune teller Tana who was romantically involved with him years ago; when he was a lot lighter sober and much more presentable and a lot less squalid.",

A good actor brought down by poor direction.Another waste of talent is Janet Leigh - at one time, cold and unresponsive, then suddenly overreacts to her situations. Her role cries 'women are helpless'.Charlton Heston is permitted to play with his usual intensity. Sure his accent is lacking, but it is a minor point for this genre and time.Lastly there is Welles' way over the top presentation of a degraded cop. Rather than being interesting or conflicted, all the viewer can feel over the whole movie is the need for relief from this shallow performance.The regular static shots of people's expressions lends to the dragging feeling of this boring movie. Even the scenes that should have been action scenes were ruined by people staring each other down.

Forget Heston as a Mexican (told to \"speak English already\" in the bar-room scene after Heston's ham-fisted attempts to string three Spanish words together). Janet Leigh plays the same type of 50s 'broad' as can be seen in nearly every B movie or TV show of the time. Both her and Heston's reactions to threats directed against them are so limp as to affect my own concern for them or build up any feeling of tension. A good example is when Leigh and Heston drive off with no thought at all about bombs in the trunk or worrying about the fact there's no roof. Another is shown in the scene after Grande is slapping around some hoodlum who threw acid at Heston. (Acid! And not a drop reached its target, despite the 'care' he took in trailing Heston). The young tough runs and backs into someone who just happens to have come out from nowhere- more style over substance. The cinematographic window-dressing throughout doesn't make an episode of Dragnet into a Third Man.

Also at his best is Charlton Heston as the Mexican drug enforcement official trying to solve the murder; Heston was truly more interesting in roles like these than in the epics.

            "content": "Touch of Evil is one of the last highly-regarded film noirs ever made, and perhaps the ultimate bent copper movie, and yet any discourse on it will general revolve around the fact that it was directed by Orson Welles. As Welles's approach generally pervaded over every aspect of his pictures, and his style bore only a loose relation to anything else going on in cinema at the time (facts not necessarily to the movie's credit, by the way) I am more or less compelled to do the same. I won't use as reference points details of how Welles came to direct this picture, what reasons he had for casting different actors and how it was re-cut by the studio against his wishes, simply because for every story regarding the production there is another one contradicting it, and it's impossible to guess what is fact and what fiction. All I can judge is the picture as it appears.Touch of Evil is, as Welles's pictures always were, an intensely rhythmic affair. This is something Welles is really good at. It's not just a case of taut editing \u2013 Touch of Evil actually contains a lot of long takes \u2013 it's a case of co-ordinating movement within a scene; of actors, camera and lighting. One of the more subtle examples is when Heston and his accomplice are surveying the carbomb wreckage, and the shadows of people rushing about flash over them, keeping up that high tempo and tense atmosphere even though camera and characters are still. More often though Welles is far from subtle, and the picture contains a dizzying display of whip-pans, low-angles and crane-shots. These techniques can be powerful if used sparingly like trump cards. They do not make a good general modus operandi.Perhaps the most obtrusive \"director-at-work\" business here is Welles's frequent working of commentary text into the image, such as the words \"Welcome Stranger\" on a billboard behind Heston. These just about work thanks to Welles's cheeky sense of humour, a fine example being the \"Have you forgotten something?\" sign when his own character leaves the murder scene. But is this humour sometimes misplaced? There's a shot towards the end of a stern-looking Welles just below a mounted bull's head pulling the same expression. Shots like that make me wonder just how seriously Welles took his villain.And then there's the cast. For all that Welles liked to think of himself as an actor's director, calling black-and-white the actor's friend, he didn't really oversee outstanding performances. There have been a few jokes about Heston being cast as a Mexican, but the biggest problem is really his stilted, uncertain vocal delivery. Welles himself was a massive ham, which seems odd given his admiration for realist cinema, but there you go. He was generally an entertaining ham though, and he's good fun to watch here, even if he is a bit caricatured. There are some neat little cameos to look out for too, but a lot of the acting in Touch of Evil is middling to dreadful. The Dennis Weaver character might be funny in the right picture, but here such an off-the-wall figure is a major wrong-note.So Touch of Evil has pretty much all the usual flaws that mar Orson Welles pictures \u2013 a needlessly showy visual style, a lack of good taste in when to exercise technique, and a handful of inappropriate comedy characters. But it also contains a fair share of what was good about Welles, especially that on-the-ball sense of rhythm, which here culminates in a suspenseful finale almost worthy of Hitchcock, and a surprisingly emotional pay-off. On balance, this is not at all a bad picture.",

Look at what happened to the Magnificent Ambersons. Anyway, luckily, Touch of Evil was later recut to fall more in line with Wells's original vision. In fact, on the DVD I own, you can read Wells's impassioned memo to the empty studio heads imploring them to at least respect the film's tapestry, flow of visual images that no one but Wells and possibly some of the great critics could probably even appreciate. Thank God for DVD! I say the film works and is an excellent visual experience, with strong story telling, striking imagery (check out Deitrich!), memorable characters (did someone actually complain about Dennis Weaver as the schizo motel clerk?) We even have a gang rape of Janet Leigh, in a '50s movie. Just remember, ultimately, Wells's career was only a shadow of what it could have been thanks to the fallout of Citizen Kane. Hence, Wells would end up fatter than his Touch of Evil character, and selling no wine before its time. In fact we are lucky to have Heston as the Mexican Vargas; it is better than having no one, and no Touch of Evil (which is what the studio wanted once they viewed the film, which was several years' ahead of what they knew about film-making).",

There is another story about a bomb going off that runs in the background and another storyline that sees Susie Vargas (Janet Leigh) entertained at the hands of the Grandi gang. Who will come out on top.....Vargas or Quinlan? I had to watch the film twice before I could make any sense of it. Charlton Heston is a Mexican who speaks like a normal American. It wasn't until about a third of the way through the film that my girlfriend noticed that he looked much more tanned than Janet Leigh when they were framed side by side. And he had a moustache - Oh I see! He's Mexican! It's a bit confusing at the beginning because they are constantly crossing from America to Mexico and back again and you are not sure which side of the border anyone is on and what nationality they are. I certainly didn't get that the very American Charlton Heston is a Mexican.There is also a completely pointless role that is given to Marlene Dietrich. She has no purpose at all in this film and Akim Tamiroff has a comedy role as leader of the Grandi family who loses his wig and gets slapstick scenes and comedy music. What a waste of talent. Janet Leigh reminds me of Grace Kelly and she is a little bit annoying in her righteousness and self-confidence - maybe she should have been raped. However, she gets a good horror moment when she wakes up from her drug experience.A confusing film but it has great music.",

            "content": "The thought of writing down the back story to Touch of Evil has me feeling like some redundant preacher to the converted, so I will not do it. Most cineastes know it and if not? The information is available at a million sources from the mere click of a mouse. Orson Welles' weirdly wonderful movie is widely regarded as one of the last examples of film noir from the classic era, in fact with its ending one can reasonably agree with some of the consensus that it stands as an epitaph as such. As a story that's loosely based on Whit Masterson's novel, Badge of Evil, Welles' film is a sweaty puzzler that deals high in corruption, moral ambiguities, betrayal and a whole host of less than honourable human traits, a border town murder mystery craftily cloaked in sleaze, grime and juddering grotesques.As art, film takes some beating, as Welles, aided by cinematographer Russell Metty, gleefully runs amok with low angles, edgy editing, jittery close ups, fluid character frames and of course deep focus compositions. While Henry Mancini's jazz/rock fusion musical score adds to the edgy tone laid out by the master director. Bookended by brilliance, where the mesmerising opening (preaching to the converted a little) sets the standard that the elegiac ending will follow, Touch of Evil is, however, as a whole not a masterpiece. A classic of course, but in spite of its star cast and reputation, it doesn't quite shake off its B movie origins. The cast around Welles (Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff, Dennis Weaver et al) are mixed, either by odd casting or over exaggeration of performance. While the plot isn't strong enough to last beyond the 90 minute mark. But do those minor quibbles stop myself and the many others returning to the film every year with devilish glee? Not on your life. Touch of Evil, a trippy and amazing cinematic experience. 9/10",

In combination with Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich and Charlton Heston figured it would be interesting at least.I saw the DVD version in which they purportedly put together a version based on a 58 page memo written by Welles after seeing what the studio execs had done to his film. I did not review in detail what changes were made over the theatrical release, maybe someday I'll get a chance to see that version for comparison. Charlton Heston is pretty much a joke of a man in the first place, but it was hilarious seeing this guy trying to portray a Mexican. In the beginning of the film there's a really funny line from Heston about how the bombing would affect \"us\", Janet Leigh questions \"us\" as if he meant them as a couple then he says \"us\" in terms of Mexicans. I died laughing and this set the tone for the rest of this horrible script. That both major Mexican characters are played by Heston and Tamiroff is a sad commentary on the racism of the times. Neither made for a believable character. I would hope Welles would not be a part of blatant racism but perhaps I simply don't know much about Welles in this respect. I expect it from a buffoon like Heston, but it surprised me with Welles. The other major disappointment with this film was the way they presented marijuana and heroin users; this was more along the lines of Reefer Madness than anything else. Again, I expected such from Heston but not Welles. Guess I'll have to do some Welles research here; I obviously thought better of the man than displayed here.The film was shot in an interesting fashion, and was visually stimulating.

            "content": "Imagine if Quentin Tarantino went back in time to 1958, put on an Orson Welles costume and acted in and directed the film, Touch of Evil (1958). I'm not really trying to compare the two directors, so much as, trying to convey to younger audiences a more recent, similar type of film. It is for reference for those, who haven't really been exposed to many of Welles' films yet. There are similarities between the two directors, that help to explain the style of this film, but that is mostly towards their respective eras, that each director comes from. Welles, like Tarantino, was a director, who was cutting edge, for his time. On top of that, he had a style, that utilized the huge array of cinematic tools, excellently, at his disposal. While they use the technical side of the craft to create beautifully composited shots, film noir-lighting and visually interesting images, they also pay homage to the history and craft of those filmmakers, who came before them. They also use a script, that pushes the limits, that most audiences aren't used to. They wanted to shock, exploit and create controversy, with interesting stories, that need that extra jolt to be successful and good.In the case of Welles and Touch of Evil (1958), it was an acting gig, that turned into a directing and acting gig, by the time cameras rolled for principal photography. Tarantino definitely appeared in his own films, so that is similar too. Welles plays Captain Hank Quinlan, the head detective, of the border town of Los Robles, right on the US/Mexico border. Charlton Heston plays Mike Vargas, the Mexican leader of the Pan-American Narcotics Commission. After a car explosion on the Mexican side of the border, Quinlan for the US side and Vargas for the Mexican side, are drawn into the investigation, complete with work ethic challenges, attacks from cartel gangs and police corruption. It is a place where it is tough to tell, who the good guy might be. With Vargas making some headway on the investigation, the Grandi narcotics ring, becomes nervous and threaten the life of Vargas' wife, Susan (Janet Leigh). That is the plot in a nutshell. It has a lot of twists, some surprises, some shock value, a film noir atmosphere and a grit to it, that energizes the black and white visuals.The casting is great in this film. The 1950s was a time when the foreign film industry had a boom. By 1955, theaters had plenty of films coming from other countries. The age of the foreign film grew from here. It also had its influence on the way, productions coming from Hollywood, would be done in the future. What also grew out of this was the need by audiences to have characters played by actors from those countries. It is something, that is more prevalent, accessible and acceptable, in today's view of casting Hollywood films. Even though it was 1958 and early on with this growing viewpoint, I think Welles saw the writing on the wall and figured out a way to make it work. I'm referring to Charlton Heston, playing a Mexican character, with obviously, some kind of darkened makeup on his face. In a humorous way of using foreshadowing (or trying to be a visionary), Welles pokes fun, by saying Vargas doesn't look or talk like a Mexican at all. Later on when he meets Vargas' American, blonde wife, Susan, he says, \"she doesn't look Mexican either\". He basically heads off the idea and the joke, that is also floating in our heads too. Being as it was the 1950s, casting was still evolving too. American actors did play foreign characters and Heston actually does a pretty good job. He is a tough dude in this film and his character is devoted to his wife.Speaking of Janet Leigh and the idea of foreshadowing things to come, Alfred Hitchcock must have seen this film. Dennis Weaver plays the night manager at the Mirador Motel. His character seems mentally confused, nervous and a little bit off. Some of her interactions with him totally reminds us of Psycho (1960), that would arrive in theaters, just two years after this film. Even the type of lighting and use of black spaces, that Welles frames for us, reminds us of the Bates Motel. Welles also harkens back to his directing days on Citizen Kane (1941), by shooting his cameras in an upward tilt, in order to increase the energy and scope of some of the characters and set pieces. He also channels some of the things he saw acting for others. His walk through the electrical towers at the end of the film, harkens back to the Ferris wheel, seen in director Carol Reed's, the Third Man (1949). This is another great one for film fans, film history buffs and definitely for fans of film-noir. It should be on the top five list of films for the essential Orson Welles film festival.8.7 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

This classic masterpiece would be worth seeing just for Orson Wells' spellbinding performance as the tremendously obese Hank Quinlan, who is a murderous corrupt bigoted police captain that frames a Mexican youth as part of an intricate criminal plot. Charlton Heston terrifically plays Ramon Vargas, an honorable Mexican-born narcotics investigator who agrees to investigate the car bombing murder of a rich American and his young girlfriend at the border crossing and in doing so incurs the wrath of the monstrous Quinlan. Vargas discovers that the young Mexican has indeed been set-up for the car bombing murders and is out to prove the kid's innocence and Quinlan's guilt, but he is way ahead of Vargas and is already framing him as a drug addict along with his beautiful wife Susan, played wonderfully by Janet Leigh, to discredit him with his superiors. All this cat and mouse play will lead to an unforgettable and deadly finale between the straight incorruptible Vargas and the tainted and evil Quinlan. Flawless direction by Wells who creates a brilliant cinematic work of expressionistic genius. Fine supporting performances from the entire cast, with special kudos to the sultry Marlene Dietrich for her compelling turn as Tanya a gypsy madam who delivers the film's memorable closing words. But it is Wells' phenomenal, larger than life portrayal of Quinlan the bloated behemoth of a man with a cigar clenched between his teeth, an unshaven face, and small glassily eyes revealing a \"Touch of Evil\" who completely steals this motion picture. Extraordinary shadow-laden cinematography by Russell Metty, and a superlative original score by Henry Mancini. One of the all time great films period.",

But that should not be the primary basis for saying that it is one of the greatest pictures ever made.Yes, as far as film noir style, this picture has it all. The black and white cinematography is the real star of this film. The shadows and moods that are created are fantastic. The set design though is all wrong. I never once felt as though the \"border town\" was right. It felt like a back lot or California location, and felt nothing like Mexico.I didn't have a problem with Heston playing a Mexican and Janet Leigh (who looked delicious lying on the bed) as his wife. They were both very good, but in my opinion, there wasn't any real chemistry there.Welles, as expected, highlights all that is good and wrong with this film.

It's all of the highest quality but by saying all this I don't mean that the story itself is bad. Not at all really.In truth the story is perhaps being a bit simple and not always credible. Nevertheless it's the sort of story, about corruption and serious heavy crime at an American-Mexican border-town, that suits the genre and gives the actors in this plenty of room to shine. You could say that this movie is being a late film-noir and perhaps a bit of a throwback to the '40's. Perhaps this is also part of the reason why this movie didn't do to well at the box office at the time of its first initial release.But every film-lover should be able to appreciate this movie because of the very simple reason that it's an incredibly well made one. It's truly amazing how this movie got done and how it looks. The directing in this is phenomenal and absolutely nothing short of brilliant. There are some amazingly constructed scenes and build-ups, that makes this movie a masterclass in directing, for everybody who aspires such a career. Rarely have I ever seen such a well directed movie. Just like Orson Welles' best known movie and his absolute masterpiece \"Citizen Kane\", this movie is filled with creative and technically amazing shots and sequences. The very long opening sequences is the ultimate example of this. When a movie starts that well already you only can hope for it that the rest of the movie can life up to its opening as well. And yes, this movie delivers, from start to finish.The cinematography and lighting of this movie is also a definite highlight. It also definitely helps the movie and it's overall atmosphere and style that it's one that got entirely shot in black & white.It's kind of weird seeing Charlton Heston playing a Mexican in this though. He does a good job with his role but I certainly would had never cast him in such a role. But it simply turned out all well, so why should anybody still complain about this. The movie is filled with lots of big acting names from the past, with Janet Leigh as the female lead and Marlene Dietrich and Zsa Zsa Gabor in some bit parts. But the person that truly outshines about everybody in this is Orson Welles himself. He's an enormous presence in this movie, also really physically, as the corrupt and rotten American cop, with questionable methods of investigating.I just absolutely loved this movie because of how incredibly well it all got done and put together by Orson Welles.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "In the end, Lily Marlene gets the very last word, and that is what should remain with us long after the credits stop scrolling. As was the case with \"Judgement at Nuremburg\", our final impression of a very important film lies with her remarkable image. In that instance, she sits in silence as the call from Judge Dan Haywood goes unanswered, and there is a world of significance in that stillness. In this case, she observes the dead body of an old acquaintance floating in filth and declares, \"He was some kind of a man. What does it matter what you say about people?\" And then comes the final \"adios\" as she walks into the bleak darkness of her seedy Mexican border town.Although her role isn't big, and I, for one, would love to see much more of her, Dietrich's quiet, charismatic presence makes a huge impression. She is even accompanied by her own catchy, pianola theme song. It announces each one of her appearances. Although several IMDb reviewers did not appreciate them, the other cast members who stand out for me are Akim Tamiroff, the frustrated leader-by-default of the criminal Grandy Family, and Dennis Weaver, more commonly known as Matt Dillon's loyal sidekick in the iconic \"Gunsmoke\" television series, as one very wacky night manager in an isolated motel owned by the Grandys on the U. S. side of the border. Apparently, the influence of this \"Grande\" clan has infested both sides of a border that has been troubled and corrupt ever since it first came into existence.While I have appreciated Charlton Heston in much better film performances, I agree with other IMDb reviewers that he is seriously miscast here as Ramon Miguel Vargas, a Mexican law enforcement official. My opinion is not based upon what I would expect a Mexican to look like as I have known many Mexicans of European heritage who feature much lighter skin than Heston but rather on Heston's stilted, awkward delivery, as if he were carefully reciting lines as he thought a Mexican person should pronounce them. The thin mustache, which was obviously added to give him ethnic credibility, didn't help matters at all. If Riccardo Montalban, Anthony Quinn, or Jose Ferrer were unavailable for the role, there were Anglo actors who could have performed this role with far better results. One may triumph as Moses and Judah Ben-Hur but flop as Mike Vargas. Who knew?Although some reviewers went so far as to state that Joseph Calleia deserved an Oscar for his performance, I couldn't accept this fine actor as such a dim-witted, unobservant nebbisch who didn't see his corrupt, unethical boss, Chief Quinlan (Orson Welles), for the scoundrel that he was. While the predicaments experienced by Janet Leigh, as Vargas' new bride, sometimes stretch the imagination, Leigh does her best with the incredulous circumstances that were handed to her. In every film in which I have seen her, she always adds to the visual appeal and makes a positive dramatic contribution. This is no exception.Other reviewers have sufficiently covered the plot synopsis and the director's serious conflicts with the studio, and I will admit that I didn't always understand the action even after seeing this a few times. My mind wanders during some of the tedious dialogue. For me, the tension established at the very beginning of the film and the overall unsavory atmosphere of the US-Mexican border, as created so adeptly by Welles mostly through creative camera techniques and angles, maintained my interest to the end. While the film suffers from many flaws, including the miscasting of its lead, speeding like mad through the alleys of a Mexican border town without even hitting as much as a stray animal, far too many '56 Chrysler convertibles to believe in this setting, and some really bizarre, if not indecipherable, dialogue, its attributes somehow exceed its weaknesses.",

            "content": "Based on the 1956 novel \"Badge of Evil\" by Whit Masterson, this is an extremely intelligent and engrossing psychological thriller concerning corruption and deceit in a US-Mexico border town. The film is wonderfully written and directed by Orson Welles, who was able to maintain a high level of tension. It begins with a beautiful continuous shot which lasts about three and a half minutes. The black and white cinematography of Russell Metty is fantastic and the very effective use of shadow and light adds a great deal to the atmosphere. After Welles had shot the film, it was heavily re-edited and some scenes were reshot or added without his involvement. He was understandably angry and wrote a 58-page memo detailing pages which needed to be made to the re-edited version in order to make it workable. Most of them were ignored until 1998 when a restored version was created in line with Welles' wishes. I watched this version as the online consensus is that it is superior to the theatrical release.The film stars Welles in a first rate performance as Captain Hank Quinlan, an American police officer in the grim border town Los Robles. Quinlan is a thoroughly odious character, a disheveled, slovenly, bigoted, amoral reprobate whose \"future is all used up.\" His superiors and many of his colleagues consider him to be one of the greatest police officers in the US. Quinlan always gets his man and his hunches, many of which he attributes to a feeling in his \"game leg,\" always pay off. The reason that his hunches always pay off is because he has been planting evidence for decades. He attempts to justify his actions by claiming that he never planted evidence on suspects that he knew were guilty but his actions indicate otherwise. Quinlan's obsessive, unhealthy determination to bring criminals to justice means that he has forgotten the true meaning of the word, if he ever knew it at all. Psychologically speaking, his behaviour stems from the fact that his wife was strangled with a piece of string and her murderer went free. His description of said method being the most efficient manner of killing someone is rather creepy under the circumstances. The thought did occur to me that Quinlan may have killed his wife himself but I think that it is more interesting if he started out as a good man and became progressively more corrupt in the years after her death. Charlton Heston may not have been the most obvious casting choice for a Mexican but it is not a miscasting on the level of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror\" either. My first choice would have been the more talented, if less famous, Ricardo Montalban but I have always thought that Heston is a sorely underrated actor. On this occasion, he does a very good job as Quinlan's Mexican counterpart Miguel \"Mike\" Vargas, a thoroughly decent, honest and principled young drug enforcement official whose star is on the rise following his capture of a prominent drug smuggler named Grandi. After witnessing an explosion which killed the local bigwig Rudy Linnekar, Vargas becomes tangentially involved in the American investigation into the matter. He frequently comes into conflict with Quinlan, who sees him as a naive idealist who does not have the guts to do what he has to do. Heston is at his best in these scenes with Welles. It is Vargas who first notices Quinlan's propensity for planting evidence as he placed two sticks of dynamite in a suspect's home which Vargas could not have missed ten minutes earlier. Vargas is a far less interesting character than Quinlan but that's fine as he was intended to provide a stark contrast to him. In many ways, Vargas is the ideal law enforcement official while Quinlan is the exact opposite. Heston does not use a Mexican accent for the role but I found that far less distracting than the make-up that he wears to look like a Mexican.Janet Leigh is excellent as Vargas' wife Susie, who is abused by many characters in the film. Although she was hoping to have a nice honeymoon in her new husband's native country, she soon finds herself the victim of Quinlan's machinations and those of Grandi's brother Uncle Joe. Susie is subjected to various forms of psychological torment. At the motel / handful of cabins owned by the Grandis, unbeknownst to the Vargases, extremely loud music is played in the neighbouring room so as to deprive her of sleep. In the film's most disturbing scene, she is attacked by Grandi's numerous nephews and others in her room who seemingly intend to gang rape her. It is later revealed that they did not actually rape her as they wanted to scare her but this does nothing to detract from the power of the previous scene.The film has a very strong supporting cast such as Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Joe, Joseph Calleia as Quinlan's loyal (almost to a fault) partner and best friend Sgt. Pete Menzies, Ray Collins as the clueless District Attorney Adair, Mort Mills as the more insightful Al Schwartz, Harry Shannon as Police Chief Pete Gould and Val de Vargas as Pancho. Welles' close friend Marlene Dietrich has a great extended cameo as the madam Tanya. In several scenes that break the tension very well, Dennis Weaver is hilariously over the top as the jittery night manager who seems borderline insane at times. There are also nice small appearances from Welles' frequent collaborator Joseph Cotten as a detective and Zsa Zsa Gabor as the strip club owner.Overall, this is a marvelous thriller which is second only to \"Citizen Kane\" as my favourite Welles directed film so far. It is a shame that this was the final time that he directed a film for a major studio.",

I admit, I did not see the remastered version, and one can only hope that the new edit redresses some of the flaws and unevenness of the original version.The story is classic film noir: a sinister web of deceit and corruption into which the hero and heroine -- played by Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh -- become inextricably entangled. Welles' intent was to create a cinematic world of darkness, foreboding, and ambiguity, indelibly bearing the sinister stain of evil. If the details of lighting and direction carried more weight, Welles would have succeeded admirably. But sadly, plot, dialogue, and characterization all get in the way.Many of the characters are almost caricatures. In my opinion, none of the supporting cast is worthy of special mention. A couple are worthy of excoriation. Both Heston and Leigh put in good performances, although both should have asked more than a few times, \"What is my motivation?\" The result is that a number of scenes succumb to absurdity, thanks to the unbelievable behavior of the characters.Welles as dirty cop Hank Quinlan is the real stand-out performance in the film. He truly is the physical embodiment of the ugly, sordid, corrupt and conflicted world Welles attempted to craft in film. He is masterful -- but he isn't on the screen nearly enough! I wanted to see more of him, to have his dark and twisted soul explored more fully. Alas, it was not to be.Maybe I expected too much. I will probably view the remastered version given the opportunity, but I fear a re-edit cannot hope to save the hopelessly flawed plot and characterization.

The unseemly border town where this all goes down is so devoid of conscience and morals that you can't help but (almost) revel in its sleaziness. And this is personified by Orson Welles' performance as a drunk and disheveled corrupt cop, the kind of monster you don't take seriously at first, but you will. At odds with Welles is Charlton Heston playing a Mexican, which isn't as absurd as you'd think. The man has an undeniable confidence that really sells the part, and his is the honest character we grab onto while Welles pushes the despicable envelope.Both men are a thing to witness, but this movie has a killer mood that just seems to emanate from the screen.7/10",

Not only does it feel wrong from a, I suppose, political perspective (after all, it's only a couple of steps below full-blown blackface) but also from a story one, as it lessens the impact of the very real racial tension that's supposed to exist at the narrative's core. If you can look past this problem, though, you'll find an interesting and relatively in-depth crime-thriller centred around a bombing in a border town and the conflicting interests of the potentially corrupt cops who come to investigate it. It's engaging stuff, positing intriguing questions around the morality of evidence manipulation. It doesn't pick up properly until it stops pretending to be about the instigating crime itself and starts focusing on its central 'my word against his' conflict. When it does, it's entertaining and unexpected. Its crisp, black-and-white cinematography enhances its overall atmosphere, too. 7/10",

            "content": "Orson Welles' bastardized Film-Noir has only attained its quasi-full-fledged Wellesian treatment in 1998 (apropos of his 58-page memo to the head of Universal upon the film's chopped and re-shot original form), four decades after its release, credited to the meticulous re-editing endeavor led by American editor Walter Murch. This restored version (the closest thing we can label it as a director's cut), clocking in at 111 minutes, finally does justice to its maker's conception, it is as much a blistering moral parable of the seedy law-enforcement as a scrumptious testimonial of Welles' state-of-the-art modality of his cinematic wizardry. No review can circumnavigate TOUCH OF EVIL's nerve-racking opening three-and-a-half minutes, a part of the furniture among the most mesmeric long-shots ever, flaunting the imminent explosion in our face, but also cunningly opts for the minimum casualty in its aftermath, Welles and his DP Russell Metty do know how to conduct \"a moving camera\" like a terpsichorean virtuoso, dollying, craning, panning without one discernible hiccup. Truly, Welles' composition is never orthodox (Dutch angles, worm's eye-view shot are the staples), his shrewd perception and ambidextrous orchestration of chiaroscuro, perspective are blank unrivaled, to say nothing of that his camera can navigate on a dime in a poky apartment with his players (including himself) shoving and weaving with precision under his august coordination. The story, loosely based on Whit Masterson's novel, is a plain-sailing Manichaean conflict takes place in a Mexico-USA border-town, between an upstanding Mexican narcotic official Miguel Vargas (a mustachioed Heston, who seems to obliviously sport his natural American accent to play a Mexican, garlanded with a halo of rectitude and grit) and a peremptory American senior police captain Hank Quinlan (Welles himself, assisted by prosthetic and make-up, lording it over with an elephantine pall), whose evidence-planting modus operandi prompts Miguel to impugn his track records. Abetted by and colluded with a slimy criminal mind Joe Grandi (Tamiroff) to frame Miguel and his American wife Susie (a naively game Janet Leigh, who is again stranded in another off- season motel as a marked woman when a sinister plan is brewing to jolt the living daylights out of her), the newly-weds are on their way of their honeymoon in the beginning, Hank begins to descend further down to the point of no return (he has been dried out for 12 years before falling off the wagon), \"You have no future left\" utters Tanya (Dietrich, in her memorable cameo with a wacky wig and gypsy get-up), an old-flame who barely can recognize him at first glance, a death knell tolls when he clumsily leaves his cane in the murder scene where he intends to set up Susie for drug-abuse and homicide (how can anyone believe a girl like Susie can physically strangle a man to death under the doped influence?). Hank is not a brilliant schemer, nor is he an abjectly evil character, what ironic is that, apparently in most cases, his hunches are right, evidence-planting is his go-to shortcut to convict the guilty parties, but the Achilles heel is that his method is not fail-safe (swimming against the undertow of the deification of a human being), what leads to his unmaking is his hubris, obstinacy, lack of morality and a strong whiff of xenophobia. There is pathos and tension lurking in the climax when he has the chance to pull that trigger, but Welles is not a misanthropic cynic, Hank is a bumptious but tragic figure, mired in his own defects with no resort of alleviation, he is a soft touch too, all he needs is a nudge to execute the unspeakable transgressions, exemplifies an archetypal canker in the hierarchy, bestowed with power but innately prone to corruption. Strong supporting turns galore, Akim Tamiroff, shapeshifting between the boss and the stooge (depends on who he is facing); Joseph Calleia, who plays Pete Menzies, Hank's loyal partner, and inputs a rather complex inscape with diligence when the plot begins to turn the table; and Dennis Weaver as the craven night manager of the motel, a harbinger and possible prototype of Norman Bates who will terrorize the screen (and Ms. Leigh as well) two years later in Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960), which would usher in a new formal of psychological/moral dramatization and sign the valediction of the classic Noir-era for which TOUCH OF EVIL is its last hurrah.",

            "content": "\"Touch of Evil\" (1958), directed by Orson Welles, is a great, baroque film noir which marked Welles return to Hollywood after a decade of self-imposed artistic exile in Europe. The man who had transformed theatre, radio and cinema by the time he was 25, took a pulp thriller called \"Badge of Evil\" by \"Whit Masterson\" (a nom-de-plum for Robert Allison Wade and Robert Clatworthy) and produced a startling, daring masterwork.Welles translates the intensity of theatre into cinema with long, mobile takes: the opening three minute shot has become justifiably iconic, a testament to what cinema is capable of. A small film in and of itself, it traces the progress of the car which has a bomb planted in it, along the main street to the border post. This shot introduces us to Vargas and his wife, the geography of the town and establishes the crucial back story. It's the organic integration of the shot into the story which makes it extraordinary. Throughout the film, almost without the audience registering it, whole scenes are composed in one take, and it contributes to the picture's fluid, propulsive dynamism, Welles' formal devices are as exciting as the ostensible thriller elements. The deep focus cinematography Welles had helped to pioneer on \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) is further refined here by Russell Metty, underlining the visual and moral darkness of the town, a key aspect of the film.Despite making what was supposed to be a B-movie, Welles imbues his film with a Shakespearean concept of character, with his own character cutting a fascinating figure. Quinlan goes on intuition and plants evidence to get the murder; yet it's revealed that he did indeed get the right man, leading to a muddying of the initial good cop - bad cop dichotomy established between Vargas and Quinlan. In the Wellesian universe, there are no simple answers.Charlton Heston playing a Mexican is absurd but it does contribute further to the viewer's feeling of dislocation, that within the seedy environs of the border town, anything could happen. He seems to be the film's moral compass, but his error of judgement in abandoning his wife at a motel and later use of underhand methods to try and catch Quinlan leads to a far more complex, multi-faceted character.Welles called on many of his friends to act in the film as a favour, leading to a phenomenal cast of character actors: Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff, Ray Collins and even a cameo from Marlene Dietrich. It's an incredible gallery of faces, performances, leaving indelible marks on cinematic history.\"Touch of Evil\" proved to be one of the last of the classical noirs, but its impact still reverberates through cinema today. Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich summed it up simply as \"a masterpiece - a Goya-like vision of an infected universe\". No one else could have made it and it's one of the great artistic achievements of the 20th century.",

Among other things, you'll see Jane Leigh terrorized in a small roadside motel where she's the only lodger (a couple of years before she'll run into Norman Bates), this time by Mexican gangsters who've come over the border to harass her (and I wish it stopped at that).Orson Welles is absolutely brilliant as actor and director, and leads a great cast which also includes strong performances from Leigh and Charlton Heston (though I hate the fact that he was cast as a Mexican). There is a nice small part played by Marlene Dietrich and I really loved how she ended the film, as well a cameo from Zsa Zsa Gabor. However the biggest reason to watch the film is the way it's shot, which is gorgeous, and decades ahead of its time. The opening shot sequence alone, fluidly following the action through Mexican streets, is brilliant.I have to say it was a little hard to follow at times, with the actors talking over one another, which, while more realistic, makes it harder to hear the dialogue. I was also not wild about a young Dennis Weaver in the role of the kooky night manager. All in all, though, this is a film definitely worth watching, and definitely shows off Orson Welles' genius. I also loved this interchange:Heston: In any free country, the policeman is supposed to enforce the law, and the law protects the guilty. Welles: Our job is tough enough. Heston: It's supposed to be, it has to be. The policeman's job is only easy in a police state, that's the whole point, Captain. Who's the boss, the cop or the law?Indeed.",

For my part, I enjoyed Touch Of Evil enormously. It's a visual treat, and Welles' last movie for a major studio. Adapted from a pulp novel by Whit Masterson, it shows the director for the great showman he was. This is the Welles who first attracted attention on stage, and later radio; and basically it's the Welles who made the otherwise highly ambitious Citizen Kane. The director is obviously having a ball setting up his shots, and we enjoy the game along with him. His \"visual sense\" has never been more sure, and I only wish that the great man could have let himself \"go\" like this more often instead of tackling Shakespeare and Kafka. For all the talk about how Welles was ruined by the Hollywood system, I suspect that even if he's succeeded on a grand, Spielbergian scale, he's have soon tired of all the literary stuff he was doing and settled down and made movies like this one anyway. It's a great show, and not at all profound, full of wonderful supporting performances by, among others, Joe Calleia and Dennis Weaver, neither of whom has done better work than here. There's a dream-like atmosphere in this film at times, and a lot of surreal images and weird scenes, some of them humorous, others perhaps not. I can never tell with Welles, and really don't care. He had prodigious talent, but not, I sense, the depth of a great artist, the ability to hunker down and deal with the finer points of human behavior and life in general.

He was a hefty person even then, but that face and all made him grotesque! If you are not into cerebral movies, I would not recommend it, but if you are, I find it highly entertaining.

Her face is placed by Welles in the shadow of the car's windshield for most of the famous opening scene wherein she and Rudy Linaker stop at the border gate, and more of her voluptuous self is later revealed only for a second or two on a poster before it's startlingly splashed with acid. Still, her character did have lines - and a name. The catalytic role she played was that of the unfortunate stripper called \"Zita\", around whose murder (along with Linaker's) this Welles world classic revolves.

And so all of this leads to my enjoyment and appreciation of the noirs of the past increasing with each watch.The effective simplicity of a bomb planted in one country that explodes in another is brilliant, something echoed in modern neo-noir TV, and a great catalyst to see these two worlds smashed together. And Mancini's music drumming along like the ticking of the bomb in a more esoteric and musical way than Zimmer's use of a literal ticking clock in Dunkirk.The dialogue is layered and complex and exposition and politics plays amidst action, not unlike modern cinema, and so unlike a lot of film noirs, the film requires you to actually pay attention to the dialogue to get more out of characters that aren't paper-thin and don't have only single-minded goals. There's the use of sumptuous night shooting and outdoor location work and an unrecognisable Wells plays a tragic, disgusting bigot in a self-sabotaging downward spiral that's typically toe-curling to watch.So, not being, shall we say, equipped, to satisfactorily enjoy Touch of Evil upon the first few viewings, this time I was fully taken by it. Before, I couldn't understand why it got so much critical acclaim, but in a way it takes a pulpy, noir b-movie premise and loads it with character depth, and racial politics worth talking about, all overseen with a directorial bravado that in a lot of ways, at the close of the 1950's, almost brings a full-stop to the end of Film Noir itself.Given the current state of racial politics and The Americas, the unflinching attitudes towards terrorists, surveillance, the attraction to true crime, the sinister and unsettling tone and plot is dying for an HBO/David Simon TV remake, something that transposes the timeless elements to the modern day.

            "content": "This 1958 film noir is often hailed as Welles' greatest film after \"Citizen Kane.\" Personally, I disagree. The story is that Charlton Heston had been offered a screenplay based on a truly bad pulp crime novel, \"Badge of Evil\" by Whit Masterson; he agreed to do it only if Orson, who had not directed an American-made movie since \"Macbeth\" in 1948, was allowed to direct. The result was perhaps the prime example in Hollywood history of making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The whole thing plays like a black-and-white version of \"Traffic\" and calls to mind other exploitation features with a Tijuana setting, such as the Ann-Margaret vehicle \"Kitten With a Whip.\" It's easy to see that David Lynch got a lot of his imagery from this film, and Alfred Hitchcock borrowed liberally from it in \"Psycho.\" The over all effect is of a B-movie with A-list stars; everyone seems to be slumming. There's Charlton Heston with black hair and mustache as a Mexican narcotics agent; an uncredited Marlene Dietrich (also sporting a black dye job) as a curandera; Dennis Weaver as a nutty hotel clerk (shades of Norman Bates!); Akim Tamiroff as a Mexican drug lord; Zsa Zsa Gabor as a stripper; and Mercedes McCambridge as a biker chick. Janet Leigh gives a fine performance as Heston's wife, foreshadowing her later work in \"Psycho\" and \"The Manchurian Candidate\", and Welles veterans Everett Sloane and Ray Collins (Lieutenant Trask from TV's \"Perry Mason\") also put in an appearance. The whole effect is rather like a bad dream after overindulging on margaritas and tamales at a third-rate Mexican restaurant. It's one of those movies that has to be seen to believe; it's clear from Welles' performance as the racist American cop that he had already started down the same road that Marlon Brando and William Shatner would later take.",

Parts of the story, where Leigh is set up as blackmail material to keep a toothy Heston quiet, is surprisingly racy for the period, and the use of overlapping and mumbled dialogue could be out of a 70s Robert Altman picture. Visuals seem like a cross between Hitchcock and Scorsese, the gang of Mexican hoodlums could be out of a reefer madness flick, all in all making for a bizarre but brilliant movie showing Welles' genius for both innovation and the use of genre staples.

In many ways it reminded me of Hitchcock.The acting of Charlton Heston (almost unrecognizable in his Mexican make-up) is fine, as was that of Janet Leigh, although the most interesting part of her screen-time took place only in the first scenes of the movie, where she has a very outspoken role. Later-on, when she gets kidnapped, her character is unfortunately reduced to a frightened victim. Orson Welles himself plays the (literally) formidable police captain very convincingly, with overbearing and intimidating authority. Halfway through the movie there suddenly appears Marlene Dietrich, sucking-in her cheeks so hard that she more or less has to mumble her few lines. Her part is extremely small anyway and adds nothing to the story whatsoever, in spite of her famous last words at the end of the movie.But apart from the visuals and the actors there should also be so much as an involving story, and with that I was less impressed. It is supposed to be a thrilling and sinister film-noir about murder, corruption and racism, but to be honest, after the intriguing and promising start the whole thing developed into a bit of a bore.Everyone is constantly stepping to and fro over the US-Mexican border, with apparently all kinds of legal and political consequences, which in due course get rather confusing. Real action is scarce, there's lots of talking and the dynamics of Welles, true to the character he plays, is as slow and as heavy as that of a Marlon Brando in the Godfather, which doesn't help in speeding things up. Tamiroff is supposed to be boss of the local mob but he behaves like a whimp and his troupes seem to consist of some wannabe-cool teenagers that in their pivotal kidnapping of Leigh act more like a bunch of softies than like a fearsome gang.Anyway, all in all I was a bit disappointed.",

            "content": "Touch of Evil (1958), scripted and directed by Orson Welles, is deservedly one of IMDb's top 250 movies. The story of the movie as a movie is almost as dramatic as the plot of the film. Before the editing took place, Welles was removed from the project. He responded with a long, detailed memo about how the film should be edited. This memo was mostly ignored, and an inferior short version of Touch of Evil was released in theaters and later for the small screen. Fortunately, years later, with immense effort, most of the original footage was salvaged, and the film was reconstructed almost in the way Welles had envisioned it. This longer version was what we saw in the excellent--and newly refurbished-- Dryden Theatre at Eastman House in Rochester, NY.The film seems dated today, but it's still powerful and engrossing. Charlton Heston plays Mike Vargas, a high-ranking Mexican police official. He has just married an American, Susan, played by Janet Leigh. They become involved in a murder investigation because someone dies when dynamite is placed in a car in Mexico, but the explosion takes place across the border in the U.S.It's at this point that Vargas has to interact with Police Captain Hank Quinlan, played by Welles. Quinlan is an overweight, limping, unshaven bully. However, he has almost magical powers to detect criminals, who are then invariably convicted. The means he uses in his investigations are not found in a police manual. So, it's clear from the beginning that Vargas wears the white hat and Quinlan wears the black hat.Janet Leigh is wasted in her role as naive and gullible young wife. Heston does a good job as the straight arrow cop. Welles, of course, is perfect for the role of a (really) bad cop. Quinlan has built his whole career based on his larger-than-life personality, and no one in his town is going to try to change his techniques. Welles was born to play this role.Two supporting characters deserve mention: Dennis Weaver as the Mirador Motel Night Manager. He turns in a brilliant performance that combines stupidity, timidity, and rigidity in equal parts.Marlene Dietrich plays Tanya, a former flame of Quinlan's from the days when he was young and handsome. Dietrich--who looks sad, cynical, and very beautiful--delivers the best line of the film. Quinlan asks her to read his future in her Tarot cards. She tells him, \"You haven't got any. Your future is all used up.\"This is a movie worth seeking out and seeing. It will work better on a large screen. However, even in DVD, it's a must-see film.",

Janet Leigh was fine if a bit air-headed, while Tamiroff as the very plainly slavic looking 'mexican' drug-lord--did his usual Charles Laughton routine.Then you have a few gratuitous cameos-Joseph Cotton, Mercedes 'I wanna watch' McCambridge and Zsa Zsa (straight outta having Paris Hilton cameos now....). Kinda weird. And Marlene, while always a worthy presence up there on screen, isn't on long enough to do more than just commentate on candy bars.I did enjoy Joseph Calleia and Mort Mills the most, couple familiar faces who were always reliable, though usually playing baddies.Plotwise it meanders a little, I think the hotel siege stuff was drawn out too far-but I did enjoy what I saw for the most part.

            "content": "Touch Of Evil (1958) -This was the best performance I have ever seen from Orson Welles. Up until this point I had been very disappointed with 'Citizen Kane' (1941), 'The Lady From Shanghai' (1947), 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942) and 'The Third Man' (1949) and as such I could not for the life of me understand why he was so well regarded by the film industry and critics. For instance, all of those films mentioned were featured on Stephen Schneider's Top 1001 films list.Perhaps if the reverence for Mr. Welles was based on just this film and others that he might have done with a similarly fantastic performance I would understand, because Orson WAS very good in this one and really he lead the whole film for me. These are all things that I never thought that I would hear myself saying about the man, having not just disliked his other roles and films, but found them to be awful. Needless to say that I was a little bit surprised, but happily so.However, another actor that I have never been fond of, Charlton Heston, didn't improve my opinions of his abilities with his performance in this film, because he was as wooden as ever and didn't come across as Mexican in any way at all. It might have been better if he had at least had an accent, because it was harder to believe the dispute between them based on his ethnic background and thus the whole racial issue was much less clear due to it.I did think that Marlene Dietrich in her role of Tanya needed a bigger part though. I liked her character and thought that there was more to discover about her, almost as if she might be the focus of the next episode, if it had been a TV series and they were trying to spread out some of the mystery.And I did have to feel for poor Janet Leigh who never seems to have had a good time of it at roadside motels.The filming style was as if the Director didn't want to have the same shot for more than a few seconds at a time and was somewhat like a game of tennis to watch, backwards and forwards all the time from face to face, car to building, Etc. I got whiplash at some points.And there were some other odd touches that didn't seem to be necessary to the plot, but I supposed added colour.Their was a weird bit with a wig and then a blind woman in a shop and also a very small lift. I wasn't sure why they put them in. Maybe they were just trying to distract the audience from the rest of the mystery with extraneous information, but it just stuck out to me.I did feel that because the film appeared to be quite rushed that there were bits that weren't given their full time to sink in for the viewer, so there were points where I wasn't sure if I'd missed something, as other things progressed. As soon as one thing was revealed, another thing was uncovered and I was still thinking about the first thing, if you catch my drift.It was also quite brutal for it's time, the violence seemed more than the usual for a 1958 film and it was added to by the music, which was a bit loud and overwhelming. I supposed that was the point, because it made me anxious, corrupt police films always rile me up anyway. Where are the 'Serpico's' (1973) when you need them? Charlie tried to deliver something similar, but just couldn't pull it off.I was hugely impressed by this one, which was far from how I had imagined that it would turn out. I would go so far as to say that I enjoyed it. The mystery and intrigue was engaging, although I did think that a modern version could bring much more to it, without the cuts and restrictions of the studio executives and censorship of the 1950's. I'd like to see that too.640.15/1000.",

Editor, Walter Murch did his best in pasting together Welles' original cut after the studio did a butchered version of it. And it is a much stronger piece. What stands out as the creative force is Welles' character, Hank, a sleaze bucket who upstages those around him. In this film there is no one to cheer for, (not unless you give a damn about Heston and Leigh's characters) , but you are fascinated by Hank and the corruption that made him. This is all captured in stunning black and white photography, sometimes in long single effective takes. The last twenty minutes is riveting stuff.

            "content": "Orson Welles had long been considered a Hollywood outcast when he was cast in TOUCH OF EVIL. He was also wound up getting hired to write and direct thanks to the insistence of Charlton Heston, who just did THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and had enough clout to choose who he wanted for a director. Ever since THE THIRD MAN, Welles stayed on in European to continue his filmmaking away from Tinseltown's radar, fed up with executives re-editing his finished product against his wishes.Welles actually returned to New York in the mid-Fifties to act on television and radio before getting the call from Universal re: TOUCH OF EVIL. He wanted Janet Leigh to play Heston's wife and sent her a telegram thanking her for accepting.... before her agent had a chance to contact her! Welles pulled off some casting coups that Universal execs didn't see coming. He convinced old friend Marlene Dietrich to appear to appear as a Gypsy madam under near-heavy disguise, and during an advanced screening, the higher-ups were flabbergasted to see Dietrich up there. They had no idea she was in the cast. Welles also persuaded former members of his old Mercury Theatre -and CITIZEN KANE co-stars -Joseph Cotten and Ray Collins to join. (Cotten's was an uncredited cameo).Welles must have felt d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when filming ended because once again he butted heads with Universal. Unhappy with his final cut, they proceeded to edit TOUCH OF EVIL against wishes. Learning what was happening, an impassioned Welles sent a memo containing almost sixty pages of suggested revisions, all of which fell on deaf ears. When the film was released, it was written off as B-movie with an A-list pedigree.More than forty years later, Universal had to opportunity to right that wrong when Welles' memo was unearthed containing his suggestions. Using that memo as a guideline, famed editor Walter Murch was brought in to revise TOUCH OF EVIL's scenes according to Welles' wishes. The result was a masterpiece restored.The first five minutes of TOUCH OF EVIL is a glorious, unbroken tracking shot on the Mexican side of a border town in which a mysterious figure plants a time bomb in the trunk of a car. Getting into the vehicle is a prominent American and a lady of the evening, where they drive up the street to customs officials. Alongside them is Miguel \"Mike\" Vargas -played by the Caucasian Heston in a bit of casting that would raise eyebrows today- a Mexican narc on a honeymoon with his American wife Suzy (Janet Leigh).The tracking shot ends with the sound of an explosion as the car detonates, killing both occupants. Heading the investigation is police chief Hank Quinlan, a grotesquely overweight man whose mumbling makes Marlon Brando enunciate like Laurence Olivier.",

            "content": "****Good summary from stephen-357 (\"Another touch of brilliance from Welles\", stephen-357 from United States, 26 January 2005). Also, Brandt Sponseller (\"A beautiful, haunting and complex film noir\", Brandt Sponseller from New York City, 11 July 2005) has a good review.****\"Touch of Evil (Orson Welles, 1958)\" is baroque. Orson Welles adapted the novel (\"Badge of Evil\", by Whit Masterson); he also directs and stars. Reviewers are mixed on \"Touch of Evil\". While many regard it as Welles's best film, the holes in the story are too large for others. It sure is refreshing to see a movie that isn't remotely commercial. The cardinal rule in Welles's films is never, ever shoot a scene that resembles anything else ever made.The three and a half minute sequence at the start is justifiably famous. Without a cut, we see a bomb planted in the trunk of a car, the driver of the car unwittingly takes off, the camera backs up while climbing over a building, the car is again seen on a street, and on the sidewalk walking in the same direction as the doomed vehicle are Mike and Susan Vargas (Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh), presumably newlyweds very much in love. Henry Mancini's Latin score adds a very jazzy vibe. Set on the border between Mexico and the US, once the bomb goes off both countries are represented with the subsequent criminal investigation. Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Welles) assumes the leadership role. Vargas joins in despite technically being a Mexican narcotics officer. The pair could not be more different. While Vargas adheres to strict ethics, we eventually learn that Quinlan has spent decades sending suspects to the \"death house\" based on falsely planted evidence. When Vargas openly questions Quinlan's claimed discovery of dynamite in the home of a suspect in the car bombing, the two duel until one is victorious.It may surprise some with how grotesque and loathsome the director (Welles) makes the principal antagonist (i.e., Welles again) appear. Welles is only 43 when the film is released, but he looks twenty five years older. The physical transformation between the still nimble Orson Welles in \"The Third Man (1949),\" to the corpulent Quinlan, is difficult to believe. While Welles let himself go on the outside, he never lost his distinctly original visual flair. He often uses cranes for aerial shots, employs deep focus and keeps objects moving. Along with his famously deep and penetrating voice, the effect is larger than life. Still, one of the more legitimate complaints made by critics is that it is distracting when Quinlan interrupts other characters as they are speaking.Nevertheless, the talented cast thrives in the big man's shadow. In a small, uncredited role, look out for the great Joseph Cotten as the coroner. Another veteran of Welles's films is Ray Collins as the District Attorney. A comely Zsa Zsa Gabor portrays a strip-club owner. Mercedes McCambridge has a delicious role as a sadistic, lesbian gang leader. Dennis Weaver is a mentally challenged hotel clerk. Joseph Calleia is memorable as Pete Menzies, Quinlan's only friend. Also, Akim Tamiroff as the Mexican gangster Uncle Joe Grandi. Tamiroff is especially effective portraying a not particularly frightening, toup\u00e9e-adorned patriarch of a crime family. As Susan Vargas, Janet Leigh is an attractive, resilient woman stuck in an isolated motel room who is threatened with an invasion. (Two years later she has a similar predicament in Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho.\") Some critics of the story have trouble with Vargas stashing his exhausted wife away in a remote hotel when the Grandi family is lurking. However, there is no reason to fault Leigh's expression of terror when it is next door.Curiously, there are two Mexican roles played with little effort towards authenticity. Marlene Dietrich is Tana, the proprietor of a Mexican brothel. Speaking with a fatigued, world-weary voice and smoking cigars, Dietrich's observant character is one of the most admirable here, even if she is not trying to be Mexican. (BTW, what amazing cheekbones she has.) In addition, Charlton Heston's portrayal of Vargas is often derided, possibly unfairly. Early on, Quinlan himself declares that Vargas does not look Mexican. So it doesn't appear to have been terribly important to Welles that Vargas actually speak as if he has ever lived South of the border. However, controversy appears with the face paint and thin mustache that Heston is wearing. Vargas is still a heroic figure even if Heston's effort of portraying a Mexican is somewhat ludicrous.Quibbles aside, this is a memorable film made by legendary artist with enormous passion.",

You put Citizen Kane at one end, slip the Magnificent Ambersons in the middle and finish the line off with Touch of Evil. That's a short but very amazing collection and except for one error that just looks worse and worse as time goes on, Touch of Evil definitely deserves its place of honor.The story starts with a bomb going off in a town on the U.S./Mexico border, killing a prominent American and his stripteasing companion. The case is investigated by Captain Quinlan (Orson Welles), the local police legend, and Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston), a law enforcement official with the Mexican government who is in town with his beautiful American wife Suzy (Janet Leigh). Vargas is an upstanding straight arrow, preparing to testify in a case against the Grande crime family on drug charges in Mexico City. Quinlan is a fat, seedy, honking, hateful lump of a man, but one who demands respect for his tremendous record as a cop. Quinlan settles on a young Mexican for the bombing, believing his relationship with the victim's daughter is all the proof he needs. Vargas questions Quinlan's methods, especially after he suspects the cop of planting incriminating evidence against the young man. As Vargas and Quinlan face off, Suzy comes under the threat of the Grande crime family, who plan on using her in a scheme to either scare off or discredit Vargas before he can testify against them. But as Vargas' relentless investigation into Quinlan's actions pushes the fat man over the edge, no one's plans turn out anything like they hoped.The first thing about Touch of Evil is that it is one of the best looking movies you'll ever watch. It is in black and white and often dominated by shadow, but almost every single moment of the film is visually stunning. If you've only seen Citizen Kane, you might doubt that Welles could ever top it, but that is what he does with the images of Touch of Evil. Welles' use of extended tracking shots, especially at the beginning of the movie when the camera first follows the car with a bomb in it and then shifts to focus on Vargas and Suzy walking down the same street is still a marvel today. If you care at all about the way movies look, you have to see this film.The acting is also quite good, with one exception I'll get to in a bit. Janet Leigh does a great job early in the film as Suzy defiantly stands up to the Grande crime family, then shows Suzy later on as a woman being worn down by the extended tension and pressure of her situation. Joseph Calleia seems to be doing an ordinary job as Lieutenant Menses, Quinlan's adoring sidekick, but when Menses realizes the truth of his hero's nature, Calleia gives some real emotional depth to that disillusionment. And Welles creates one of the great unfinished characters in Quinlan. Not only does Welles let you see the changes going on in Quinlan while we're watching him, but he gives you a sense of all the changes that happened to Quinlan in the past to bring him to this point.The writing is also very strong. I'd guess most would rank it below Citizen Kane, and I suppose I would to. But while Kane was essentially a very simple story told in a complex fashion, Touch of Evil is a very complex story that Welles' is trying to tell in a very simple fashion. The script grapples with racism, primitive emotions, police corruption, border politics, Mexican cultural insecurity and the difference between simply bad and truly evil.For all its greatness, however, there's a huge, flashing neon sign of a problem with this movie. Charlton Heston plays a Mexican. The other actors playing Mexican roles are all either clearly of Hispanic heritage or speak with noticeable accents. Heston doesn't have the slightest trace of an accent and just looks like a white man who's been baked in the oven too long. He's glaringly ridiculous to the point where you just have to pretend his character isn't actually Mexican to keep enjoying the film.If you can make that sort of switch in your own head, Touch of Evil is one of those \"must see\" movies as the last genuinely great work from one of American cinema's true geniuses.",

For both Welles and film noir \"Touch of evil\" was a worthy swansong.The film is situated in a village on the US - Mexican border. The film begins with the assassination of a real estate contractor. The car bomb is placed in his car on the Mexican side of the border but explodes on the American side. This gives rise to a dispute about competence between Mike Vargas (Mexican police, played by Charlton Heston) and Hank Quinlan (American police, played by Orson Welles). The confrontation between these two men is central to the movie, with the decay and decadence of the border town (\"border towns bring out the worst in a country\") as a fitting background.Rivalry between cops is a recurring theme in films. Often (as in for example \"Mississippi burning\" (1988, Alan Parker)) the rivalry is between an old and experienced cop and a young and high educated one. The confrontation (rivalry would be an euphemism) between Vargas and Quinlan is different. Vargas beliefs in the rule of law. Someone is innocent until proven otherwise. Quinlan believes in his own intuition. If he can find no proof, he produces it himself. Quinlan is therefore a corrupt cop, but not for the purpose of self enrichment. He sees himself as a warrior against crime and over the years the end has come to justify the means. This makes Quinlan not only a corrupt but also a somewhat tragic figure.\"Touch of evil\" is however not primarily a film with a tense storyline or multi-layered characters, it is in the first place a film of stunning visuals. You can see that throughout the film (the imposing stature of Quinlan results not only from the fact that by 1958 Welles was not slim anymore but also by using unusual camara angles), but espacialy in the opening scene. In this scene a car is followed in a tracking shot of more then 3 minutes from the placement of the bomb till the explosion. To do more justice to this scene the opening titles were, at the request of Welles himself, in a later restoration shifted to the end of the film.",

Orson Welles playing the American police Captain and Dennis Weaver playing the Motel night manager did notable acting jobs. Heston and Leigh had marginal performances.

When you think about films in the 50s you think in light hearted musicals and harmless popcorn thrillers. Touch of Evil is everything but harmless. In fact, this is one of the reasons that makes it a very interesting film.However, Touch of Evil is kinda way too dark even for these days and age, unnecessarily if you ask me. Lots of gore in the ending conflict, deaths, and that famous strangling scene and it's aftermath is just way \"WTF\". Also, the whole ambient was already scary and creepy, no need to put even more scary things on it. I was in the edge of my seat when I saw the guy dead with his both eyes wide open laying over the bed. The film was so dark that I almost got convinced that the Mexican boys would indeed gang-rape Janet Leigh's character.Anyway, the cinematography is just fantastic. Insane camera work. Is a very modern film in that aspect. Charlton Heston was kinda dull, cause he didn't look like a Mexican at all, but he did a good job.Obviously Recommended.

This is a down and dirty, seedy noirish drama, appropriately filmed in glorious black and white, that could not have been as effective in Color.Charlton Heston plays Vargas, a Mexican narcotics cop on Honeymoon with his new American wife (Janet Leigh). They are just crossing the border from Mexico into the States when a car blows up right in front of them, having had a bomb just placed in its trunk. This cuts an abrupt ending to the newlyweds' celebration, as Vargas must investigate while his bride retreats to the \"safety\" of their hotel, only to find herself victimized at nearly every turn. Back and forth between two borders the action goes, with a story that seems all over the map, but yet we somehow retain interest simply by the wonderful camera-work and stylish shots scattered throughout. Heston appears somewhat miscast at first as the Mexican policeman, with little more than a mustache and dyed black hair to compensate for his lack of a foreign accent; however, his commanding presence draws us in eventually and we accept him in the role. The real joy of this film is none other than Orson Welles himself, who takes on the part of a corrupt sheriff, once glorified but now past his prime as an obese and slobbering mess. Marelene Dietrich has a small but memorable part as a mysterious gypsy who Welles is sweet on. The final concoction is enjoyable more for its look and feel rather than its execution, which I always feel could have been better. *** out of ****",

This movie however was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" as far as his relationship with the Hollywood studio system. It was likely too much in it's heavy handed use of all cinematic techniques which it used to create \"Hell on Earth\" as a tale of two border towns whose only link besides proximity was crime. When it was released Welles did not have the luxury of time being kind and it was both critically and popularly panned. Experts saw it as far too self-indulgent and moviegoers as odd beyond comprehension.So, this is fifty years later and it seems hard to understand now why this was so big of a failure. The cast is strong with Heston, Leigh, and Welles as principals, along with a great turn by one of pop culture's enigmatic icons, Marlene Dietrich. The elements of the angles, lighting, and editing of the camera work took what was praised in Citizen Cane and exponentially multiplied it bringing into never seen before territory. The sound was used to create a sort of nervousness that was at times harrowing and other times grating, like the camera work it grabs you and demands to be part of the unbridled darkness. I think the reason it missed the mark at the time of release is that it was simply too far ahead of the consumption curve of the late fifties movie-going public. A more straightforward crime story with less emphasis on the technical possibilities of film would have likely did well at the box office...But, it would have never warranted our attention half a century later as one of the finest examples of film noir. A singular one that though it had big stars and a prescient story was actually not about either, instead being about evil darkness coming through as strongly as possible from the camera to the screen. Seen as that it is a complete success that stands the test of time and as such must be considered a touchstone American film.",

He's leagues beyond me, and in the words of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \"When you come out of 'Touch of Evil' you feel less intelligent than before but gratified anyhow by the poetry and art.\"* Yet there are certain things I always know to look for, whether the film in question is \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), \"The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice\" (1952), \"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955) or \"F for Fake\" (1973): the narrative is going to be free-flowingly evasive and explorative, always interested not finding out the truth but rather becoming aware of all the layers of fabrication within the narrative; and the way he sees and lets us see the world will be breathtaking.And so it is. His way of moving the camera with absolute effortlessness astonishes each time, so does the lighting of the interiors and the way he shoots claustrophobic closed spaces. Heston and Welles play wonderfully together, and Welles' performance is among the highlights of his career.Dietrich's character refers to Von Sternberg's \"Der Blaue Engel\" (1930), a satire about a sexual free fall, a strong undersong in this film. The film's production history, as that of many other films by Welles, is closely linked to the film itself. As such, \"Touch of Evil\" is also rewarding as an artifact of film history. It's interesting to read Welles' 58-page memo (available online) and compare to any of the versions available. Watching them either chronologically or in reverse order is great fun. So is comparing the aspect ratios. The Region B Blu-ray released by the Masters of Cinema series is most certainly at the summit of the format and what can be done with it. On two Blu-rays there are the three existing versions of the film (the 1958 theatrical version, the 1958 preview version and the 1998 reconstructed version), the 1958 theatrical and the 1998 reconstruction presented in two aspect ratios. They are beautiful transfers, and host interesting and informative commentary tracks.I see myself revisiting this, and then revisiting it again.

The story was way too confusing, I could never tell which side of the border they were on, and Orson Welles' character was so oily it just turned me off. It happens to be a remarkable performance, one of many in both his career and in this particular film. Great cast includes a surprisingly subdued Charlton Heston, who's far more convincing than in his epic roles. Hitchcock must surely have seen Janet Leigh in what looks like a screen test for \"Psycho:\" exuding strength and vulnerability, and withstanding terror in a cheap motel. Marlene Dietrich, as always, steals every scene she's in. Watch out for a quick appearance by an unrecognizable Mercedes McCambridge having fun as an evil gang leader. The only cast member I find fault with is Dennis Weaver as the motel night clerk who hams it up mercilessly (Anthony Perkins would have been perfect). This is highly stylized filmmaking and sure- handed direction from Welles that's up to par with \"Citizen Kane,\" \"The Lady From Shanghai,\" and other lesser efforts that don't come off as well.

            "content": "I was about fourteen when I taped this movie from the BBC. I've waited a while to see it, because the description of it didn't quite interest me. So when I decided to to finally watch it....I was absolutely blown away! I've never seen anything quite like it. I had never heard of Orson Welles, let alone seen a picture by him. Since then there are a few films that has captivated me like this one, like The Trial. Even Citizen Kane hadn't that impact on me, but that was because I didn't understand it at first. Touch of evil ranked as my number one movie of all time for years to come.So, what is it than that makes this movie the way it is? First of all, the absolutely stunning photography: how everything shines (note the glimmering cars), the lightning of faces, walls with indicative advertising). It's simply the most beautifully shot film ever, period! Secondly, the use of sound. In the famous opening shot you can hear the bomb ticking and while the car with the bomb is driving away, you can hear all the different noises and music coming from different corners of the street. Also the overlapping dialogue add to the realism of the film. When I first saw the movie, it was the version with the Mancini score. It is quite catchy and very appropriate for the movie, but I think I'd prefer the restored version (the opening anyway) because of Welles' use of sound. It's magnificent. Third, the camera-work (dollyshots and the extreme and creative angles). Technically, it's a very complex film. Next to the opening scene you have the interrogation scene in Sanchez' apartment, which is one long take! Some say Welles is just showing of, but they can't be more wrong. Both long takes serve distinctive purposes: the long take of the opening scene greatly enhances the tension of the ticking bomb (when there were cuts in this scene, the audience would loose track of time and couldn't follow the three minutes to which the bomb is set to explode)and the long take in the apartment also greatly enhances the tension between Vargas and Quinlan (it is a crucial scene in the movie: we get to know the faul tactics and the style of intimidation of Quinlan and the righteousness of Vargas, which, by the way, gets under heavy pressure towards the end of the movie).What is it about? The basic story line is fairly simple: good cop meets bad cop and brings him down. The story is based upon the pulp novel \"Badge of evil\" by Whit Masterson. According to Welles himself, he didn't even read the novel but got immediately to work on rewriting the original screenplay he got from the studio. To be honest, this movie isn't about a revolving plot, but about rounding out characters, especially Captain Quinlan, played by Welles himself. He's got a \"touch of evil' ever since he let the murderer (a Mexican) of his wife go free, because of lack of evidence. We can understand the motives of Quinlan, but ultimately we don't approve of his methods, although he is usually (in this case anyway) right about the suspect. The fact that Vargas gets the evidence of Quinlan's corruption so easily (although he still has to get the evidence of the framing of Sanchez)is't very believable, but it still is possible. Orson Welles wrote a story about character, about good and evil and the ambiguity of it and above all...about prejudices and racism (Leigh's character's hidden racism: \"Lead on, Poncho!\").There is much criticism of the acting of Charlton Heston. I'm not a big fan of his acting, but I do think he certainly does a fine job here. He embodies the righteousness and stubbornness of the character beautifully. Yes, it isn't a great actor, but this is his best work by far. Janet leigh does a good job. She doesn't have much to work with, but she does it well. Orson as Quinlan steels the show. But I'd like to mention two other actors which are rarely mentioned in reviews of this film. Akim Tamiroff does a great job as the gangster boss Uncle Grandi. He is frightening and funny at the same time. But the most praise must go to Joseph Calleia, who, in my opinion does steel the show as a mislead friend of Quinlan. He is the most dramatic figure in the movie and plays it brilliantly.Finally, I'd like to point out, that this is not a film noir, despite of many, many references to it. I admit it has noir elements to it, but it lacks the most important ones: a hasn't got a weak protagonist, who is pudding in the, also missing here, femme fatale's hands. So, for the lack of these defining film noir ingredients, we'd better call it a German expressionistic film! But that doesn't do it also, because everything about the mise-en-scene in German expressionistic films relate to the inner beings of the characters, and in Touch of evil we don't see a mise-en-scene strictly build up of straight lines. I guess the best term to define Touch of evil is 'policefilm,' 'copfilm,' or perhaps a detective drama.\"Touch of evil is all about atmosphere and mood\" I've read a commentator write on this site. That's absolutely true. THis movie has to be seen to be believed: at points it is surreal, sometimes it's a bit comical, sometimes it is horrific and most of the time it's just plain beautiful. You have to see this film if you love the movies. It ranks among Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons as one of the most beautiful pictures ever made.

            "content": "This may be the second most pitiful downfall of a character from Welles we have seen. We are all familiar with the first one. Kane aged gradually, and the makeup followed put. Here, Quinlan is at his end of his days already, and surprisingly not so immediately obvious like some of his other appearances (one might imagine seeing him pop up in The Third Man for the first time without any warning or anticipation). He has a game leg and each line is wheezed and mumbled out from a man very much past his prime. This film is not about Vargas, or the vague cultural identity war across the border; it is about Quinlan, and how he dared dip his hands into the essence of evil himself, and over time become the very thing he hated and fought to erase. We learn this backstory of his wife being murdered and justice being left behind. Like any anti-hero he decides to get it his own way, and therefore become embroiled in a never-ending war against crime. The reveal of Sanchez's guilt is a vital component here; without it Quinlan is just another evil spot of darkness. But because we know this we see how he has become obsessed with chasing down the scum that are pervasive around him...even going to lengths that waver between ethical and moral boundaries. Vargas acts as the counterpoint; the meddling, straight-edged rationalists and moralists that have purer intentions, but seldom results. Early on Quinlan visits Tanya's brothel, yet we never even feel like this is a lustful pursuit. It is not portrayed as a den of filth and flashy degeneration as we might expect; Mancini's pianola hovers pleasantly in the background, and the camera peers into this almost cozy, domestic setting. The dialogue is merely secondary; Quinlan is transported back to a nostalgic time much before his wife's death, much before the many weary years of crime-fighting. The two both acknowledge this quiet moment without ever needing to say it out loud (and even then Quinlan's persona is barely shattered - it has accumulated too much skin over the years). Once he leaves those doorways he is back to being the touch of evil - corrupting as he once was corrupted. He knows, as he does in this state, that redemption is not possible. There is an incredible spar of sorts in the bar between him and Grandi. Shot glasses are set down on the table, and without even thinking about it, as a purely reactive moment, Quinlan takes a sip and ends a twelve year streak of sobriety. Grandi knows, and he too knows, that he has been played, and that one little restrained vestige of himself has been destroyed. Mancini's jaunty soundtrack is not unlike The Third Man, jarringly contrasting the hard-boiled narrative. But here it seems almost a deliberate attempt on Quinlan's part to retreat into his nostalgic past. But he is too far gone. He himself has morphed his initial intentions far beyond recognition. This has been called the best B-movie of all time because of all the little tics and unpolished moments. The rebuttal to that is the famous opening shot. What more can I say that has not already been said about this magnificent scene? We see a bomb, and the timer being set. This is Hitchcock's mastery of tension. If there is an unexplained explosion there is no tension. But present a bomb, and hover over it whilst the surroundings pay no attention of warning to its ticking, and the audience is tense throughout, waiting and bracing for the blast. If there is ever an example of the brilliance of the long take, this is the shot to demonstrate it. Real time in motion. We are counting the ticks along. A newlywed couple is embracing, but all we can do is scan the frame, anxiously clamouring: The bomb, the bomb! Where is the bomb?",

            "content": "If you believe one of the common legends about \"Touch of Evil\", Orson Welles asked for the worst script available to prove that he could make a great movie out of a bad script. While that might not be entirely true, I do think \"Touch of Evil\" has a script that, in the hands of a less ambitious director, would have resulted in a film that ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000, not the National Film Registry.\"Touch of Evil\"'s story is full of film clich\u00e9s - the evil gang leader, the headstrong corrupt cop who thinks he's doing the right thing by planting evidence, the juvenile delinquents, the honest cop good guy and his innocent newlywed wife/damsel in distress. It all unfolds rather predictably and since everyone is a clich\u00e9, there's no emotional depth, no characters to care too much about. This really is not a very good story.The direction though, the style, is what made this movie memorable. Everyone talks about the famous long shot and the shadows, so I'll talk about something the other reviewers seem to miss: the dialogue. Not the actual words, but the way Welles has people talking on top of each other, three conversations going at the same time, people telling each other to shut up, and so on. This is excellent realism, and perfectly in the spirit of film noir. Think about it, you have 7 cops and 2 criminals in a room, people don't politely take turns as if reading from a script - everyone is fighting to get a word in, shouting down other people, and so on. \"Touch of Evil\" really captures this and I felt most drawn into the movie during these convoluted train wrecks of scenes that felt really captured the grimy reality of the situation just like a film noir is supposed to.Anyone who tells you this is a great script probably hasn't seen a bad 1950s crime movie - because those usually have scripts just like this one. Luckily, this movie is worth it for the direction alone. And if nothing else, you get to see one of Hollywood's wackiest casting jobs ever as Charlton Heston plays a Mexican cop.",

            "content": "\"Touch of Evil\" is a garish nightmare, a twisted dreamscape. It's disturbing and unnerving, wretched and slimy like a dirty old barbecue joint. It goes beyond noir notions into a different world. One of the greatest artists of the cinema, Orson Welles, gave us a world of retribution, cynicism, death and destruction (both of the inner and more literal varieties in equal dosage.) Welles takes his recurring themes of self-destruction and resignation to a life of failure and broken dreams to a wholly new level. \"Touch of Evil\" isn't the kind of classic one would expect to show up on any AFI lists. It's a dark, twisted, brutal experience, featuring harrowing subjects penetrated deeper than any American works of its time. Its moral regression gives way to an unbridled formal expression, Welles creating a world of dusty, dead end streets, hopeless crooks and even more hopeless cops. The moral beacon of it all, played by Charlton Heston, becomes an afterthought in the presence of Welles' corrupt cop Quinlan, who's been failed by the world and recedes to a life of greed and burnt out desires. In several heartbreaking scenes, as Quinlan shows his burnout most vividly, one can draw parallels to Welles' own betrayal at the hands of the system that failed he, that of the Hollywood system.\"Touch of Evil\" is a haunting tone poem like no other. One reviewer called it an anti-classic, and the term fits perfectly. It doesn't force anything on the viewer, it simply pulls one in with the complete formal brilliance (Welles is at his least refined, freest) and creates a world of gritty, grungy expressionism. Take Welles' hand for a deep and dark walk on the wrong side of the tracks, and one can never shake the strange, bitter, beautiful experience.",

I really loved to hate his character like very few other characters. I love the title of the movie and it describes everything very well. The story line was a little clich\u00e9 and did not leave too much to the imagination, but that might also be because I am use to these kind of movies and having them spoofed on. One of my favorite things about an classic film like this is that one sees that there are certain movies that you need to see in black and white. There were some brilliant lighting and cinematography that can only be seen in this medium. The one scene where the shadow flicks across the wall during the acid attempt was brilliant and it made me sit up and wonder what was going to happen.

Much of the camera-work and cinematography, editing, use of sound, shadows, close-ups, etc., is incredible and some even brilliant. The long tracking scene in the beginning is perhaps the prime example of this and it is simply wonderful. This scene and others do a great job of building tension and atmosphere, and setting the mood, such as the shots of Vargas, Quinlan, and others looking around the town at night. Other scenes like the one where Joe Grandi is trying to intimidate Vargas's wife are also wonderful.The story certainly has many promising aspects such as the basic issue of Quinlan's nature, goals, and tactics, Vargas's attitude toward them,what this drives Quinlan to do, and the ultimate trouble this all creates. The exploration of Quinlan's character is a particularly interesting subject and Marlene Dietrich's line at the end is great.However, Dietrich's line rings hollow and comes across as both insincere and melodramatic because the film as a whole is not compelling or convincing. The film's the underlying plot and the screenplay itself are wanting, although some of this may be due to editing as well. Ultimately, the subject matter just fails to fully impress or convince. The story doesn't work and in the end one comes away not really being convinced or caring about any of it. The pieces don't all fit together and some of the elements seem jumbled. Some scenes, moreover, are inexplicable and seem added without apparent purpose to the story or without explanation as to their relevance. A good example is the scene with the two women joining the Grandi toughs at the motel. That was unexplained and went nowhere. What was the point of having it and who were the women? Other elements, such as the very ending itself, seem perfunctory. In addition, promising elements were not fully developed or explored and either only hinted at or left hanging.Ultimately, this film starts promisingly, has a subject with potential, and is very successful most of the time in creating the right mood and tension, and yet it becomes lost and jumbled, and fails to convince or fulfill its apparent goals.",

Where Hitchcock does a respectable documentary-like job that documents how established protocol can lead to being wrongly accused of crimes one has not committed; Welles does a nightmarish take on official corruption (as a means for serving justice) by wrongly accusing someone(s) of crimes they have not committed (same theme). In the Welles film, the villains are clearly drawn, but in Hitchcock's film the lines are softer ... however, both films revolve around the arrest of the wrong character. Welles focuses more on avenging the corrupt investigator's actions as an epic battle of good vs. evil.Welles succeeds further by peeling back the layers of the Heston character ever-so-slowly, so that when he does realize how closely to home the danger becomes (the Leigh character's arrest) the audience resents him (I did) for not being wiser and just enjoy his honeymoon. The 2nd lead investigator's arc is impressive: immoral, evidence-planting cop becomes symbol of good. The production values in this film, and Welles' script, are superb. It's easy to believe the Heston character's determinedness as played by an actor known for his strong moral screen presence (Planet of the Apes, Ben-Hur), and the supporting players are well-cast (especially Weaver's motel night-watchman character).",

This is an iconic movie moment and it actually sucks. The camera doesn't follow the car properly and the car doesn't travel enough distance to get an idea of suspense. Sure you can reward the crane operator if you want but this shot is completely over-hyped. The rest of this technically masterful but somewhat hollow noir follows suit. Touch Of Evil is not a bad film at all, but one of those classic films which doesn't quite deserve the hype. It's a very complicated story about police corruption and murder in a Mexico border town, with Charlton Heston and Orson Welles starring. TOE is very well acted and has some strong dialogue. It's also an interesting story in terms of morals, and the elements of police corruption give it a new dimension. Its refusal to rely purely on set pieces is admirable and it relies on characters and tension instead.TOE is in many ways a visual master class, and Orson Welles crafts every shot brilliantly. Orson Welles is a fine visual director, but his story lines often leave you cold. He may be a good director, but his constant insistence on showing off how good he is at filmmaking in every single frame of his movies is very off putting and the visuals detract from the story. TOE has an interesting plot but it feels somewhat hollow and since every single character is corrupt in some way and the plot is so confusing the film is difficult to engage with. Definitely a case of style over substance, although not a big one. TOE is a good film and I'll give it another shot in future as I was fairly tired when I watched it, but it's a bit too complicated and emotionally unaffecting to satisfy since the emphasis is so firmly on visuals.

While this is certainly a film noir, and maybe the \"noirest\" of all, it is different. It has more subtle characterizations, more nuances. Yet it is not my favorite film noir.It has some of Orson Welles's trademarks: filmed in black and white, unusual camera angles, scenes in which one character is close to the camera and another is much farther away, yet both are in focus. It has the \"noir\" aspect of being virtually entirely filmed at night. It's centered on the life of policemen, criminals, and the \"margins of society.\" It's more like a thriller or mystery novel in the complexity of the plot, which is not standard film noir. I watched it twice, two days apart. The first time I had trouble following the plot. There seemed to be too many policemen and DAs to keep track of. They would be referred to by name, and I couldn't remember who that was. It seemed again and again that certain characters would appear on the scene at oddly perfect times that just didn't seem real. But the second time I noticed small pieces of dialog or little clues that explained it.Many people have commented here on the acting. I agree that Welles was excellent. His makeup job was superb. He really looked and acted the part. It is a vivid portrayal. Marlene Dietrich was excellent in her small but crucial part, and so was Joseph Calleia. I think Charlton Heston was a good choice was Vargas, unlike others who have posted here. He played the \"straight man\" well. I think the gang of young toughs played their roles well and were convincing. I found Dennis Weaver's portrayal to be a bit much.The first big thing that I didn't like was that there were several large plot elements that just didn't make sense. First, the location of the motel that Susan Vargas stays at. It's completely in the middle of nowhere! Seems very odd, and odder still that Vargas would agree to putting her there. Next, in the motel, the loudspeaker in her room. What the heck is that? I've been to lots of older motels in my life and never seen anything like that. And it can't be easily switched off? Huh? Secondly, it just doesn't make sense that an experienced policemen (Vargas) would let his wife alone so much, in the strange motel and in earlier scenes. Thirdly, not to give away any spoilers, the last ten minutes seemed contrived.The biggest thing I didn't like was the lack of a strong female lead. Susan Vargas was just too passive. That is not typical of film noir. Thirdly, and this is quite personal, I just didn't find myself making any personal emotional connection to any of the characters. Vargas was too straight and too predictable. Hank Quinlan (Welles) was too old, too unattractive. I sympathized with him but did not identify with him. Some have compared this movie to \"The Big Sleep.\" I find them quite different. The pair of main characters there, played by Bogart and Bacall, is much more interesting, more easy to identify with. Bogart is, of course, Bogart. 'Nuff said. The plot is complex, true, as is that of Touch of Evil, but it is more engaging and compelling, maybe because it was written by the great Raymond Chandler. The ending is suspenseful and satisfying. Bacall is intriguing and dynamic. So, all in all, I find Touch of Evil to be excellent but somewhat lacking.henry",

            "content": "This B-movie film noir has many faults, but at the same time is a defining example of what makes a film-noir truly noir. The film captures the seedy, grimy aspects of human nature in a film with such brilliantly crafted \"shades-of-grey\" characters, blurring the line between good and evil.Welles puts in a brilliant performance, his monumental stomach adding to the dominating presence of his internally tortured, corrupt detective Hank Quinlan. Heston is great (I'll leave the arguments about a white American playing a Mexican out of this for now) as the idealistic law official determined to expose Quinlan. Star turns also from Janet Leigh, Akim Tamiroff and Marlene Dietrich help drive the shadowy, intricate plot forward. The film's opening scene is the stuff of legends, and rightly so, with a long, complex tracking shot which lasts 3 and half minutes minutes and introduces to us the some of the main players and kickstarts the film's plot. It's not just the opening shot that impresses - throughout the film, Welles' influence is felt behind the camera, with trademark POV shots and twisted camera angles. Mancini's score, while hitting a few \"elevator muzak\" moments, generally compliments the on-screen action adequately, and in a few key moments (the murder of Mexican gang boss Grandi) steps up to the level of perfection.On the negative side, B-movie production values sometimes creep to the foreground. Wobbly set design and a very awkward, weirdly overacted performance from Dennis Weaver as a mentally-challenged motel Night Man (see picture below), for my money hold the film back from its potential as a masterpiece. While there are also a few strange cuts and pacing decisions in the first third of the film, these may have been introduced when the studios infamously butchered the final edit. I watched the version which has been reconstructed based on Welles' furious memo to the studio execs, but it is likely there are still remnants of their interference in this cut.Overall it is testament to Welles' skill that a second-billing B-movie is as accomplished as this. A few weak moments and lapses in production values (no doubt budget-related) do not stop this being about as dark, grimy and intricate as film-noir gets and comes highly recommended.",

The opening sequence is probably one of the best pieces of cinematography I've ever seen.  We see a man skulking around in the shadows of a Mexican border town at night, carrying a sticks of dynamite wired up to a clock.  The camera pans away to a man and woman coming out of a nightclub, pulls up and back for a wide shot of the town, and swings over to the convertible car parked in a lot next to a run-down building just as the Skulker closes the trunk and slips away. The man and woman get in the car and drive off, the camera following them as they cross paths with Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh who are walking down the road. The car and Heston/Leigh are interposed in the camera frame as both groups make their way towards the border station. The whole sequence lasts 10 minutes and really draws you into the film.The good parts: the opening sequence, the closing sequence, the dialogue, the overall mood. Janet Leigh. Orson Welles.  Marlene Dietrich's dialogue. Charlton Heston in Ray-Ban sunglasses. Camera angles are fantastic. Brilliantly filmed. I can see why so many filmmakers copied the style.The bad parts: Charlton Heston as a Mexican law enforcement officer (his makeup is bad, he obviously can't speak Spanish, and he has no accent.  They should've ). Marlene Dietrich as a Mexican fortune-teller (I kept waiting for her to start singing \"Falling in love again..what am I to do...\").Look for Dennis Weaver (I won't tell you who he plays) and Zsa Zsa Gabor in minor roles (Dennis was an unknown at the time).This is a movie that's begging to be re-made with modern techniques, but preserving the camera angles.  If only the sound quality in the original version was better and they had hired Ricardo Montalban to play \"Vargas\" instead of Heston.And one last thought:  Look for Heston's line when he's in the hall of records; \"Think of all those people you put in the Death House.

Also, I find the scenes with Dietrich and Welles oddly arousing in their subtle nostalgic sexuality/gloom, where he says he wishes he were getting fat off her chilli instead of candy bars and she says the chilli is too hot for him.  Also, the Mexican/American tension is incredibly compelling, like in the scene where Quinlan is interrogating the guy, planning to frame him, and brutalizing him for speaking Spanish, while Vargas tries to be fair and speaks Spanish to him, sort of helplessly.  But then toward the end, Vargas has figured Quinlan out and when Quinlan tries to strut his authority, he says, \"You're in MY country now.\"  God, I love this movie.  The last line, by Dietrich, about Welles, is brilliant: \"He was some kind of man.  What does it matter what you say about people?\"  Welles has this way about making the most simple lines and words (re: \"rosebud\") resound in the most hypnotic fashion.",

Quite often I find the acting and stories great, and they more then make up for the few areas that are flawed (fake scenery, fake falls and deaths, etc, since technology was not around to make such things look real). The camera usage in Touch of Evil is far beyond any other movie I have seen from this period, but the acting and story is sadly very poor. Quite literally, this fells like Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which, like this film, has a rating far greater than I could ever give. If I didn't know any better, I'd say Sin City came about because they loved Touch of Evil, and felt the acting was good, thus decided to do the same in Sin City. Not sure how people find this acting good, I made it to 30 minutes in, and most of it was due to the neat camera angles.",

And to a certain extent, it's understandable that \"Touch of Evil\" might have been mistaken for a run-of-the-mill B-movie, because at first look it doesn't seem _too_ remarkable.  The routine plot bears a few twists but is essentially a straightforward story of crime and corruption in a sleazy town on the US Mexican border.  The production values are good, there are some great shots and trademark Orson moments (including _that_ tracking shot) but it doesn't necessarily leap out and grab you as an instant classic.  Dare I say it, but with Charlton Heston blacked up as a Mexican, and a whole host of \"Eh greeengo\" accents, it might even seem a little cheesy.However, Welles' genius, and the real power of the film - for me \u0096 comes out in the days, weeks and months after you have seen it, when you find yourself suddenly thinking of a scene, or a line, or a shot.  It comes to you from nowhere, in the middle of your day.  It haunts you.  The mechanics of the detective plot are secondary concerns next to the film's exposure of the deep and dark ironies of life, and the contrasting natures of the two central characters, both ostensibly men of the law.  Temptation, sin, love, friendship, justice, death, redemption \u0096 all the big themes are here; all the themes, in fact, which made \"Citizen Kane\" the official 'all-time best movie ever made.'  But \"Touch of Evil\" is more oblique than \"Kane\".  And more rewarding?  Maybe.Certainly, it may not be as quotable as \"The Big Sleep\", or as cool as \"Double Indemnity\", but this is film-noir with a real heart of darkness, that rare beast which appeals to both mind and soul, and a genuine tragedy in the classical sense.  Unmissable, unforgettable... On a par with \"The Third Man\".(10/10)",

When he witnesses an apparent murder at the U.S.-Mexico border, he becomes wrapped up in a case headed by grouchy American expert police detective Hank Quinlan (Welles). Vargas is a cop full of integrity, but Quinlan has a Machiavellian sense of justice. The two are at odds from the very start. Quinlan carries enough weight with the police force to influence their judgment, and Vargas gets suspicious.Meanwhile, Vargas's wife (Janet Leigh) keeps falling into the traps set for her by a gang of greasers from a Mexican mob family. Vargas sent the mob boss to jail and now the rest of the family aims to get even. Vargas makes the boneheaded mistake of leaving his vulnerable wife alone time after time.EVIL is a very well-crafted film. Orson Welles sure knew how to tell a story on film. Every line is important. Everything has a purpose.Many scenes have multiple layers. More than one thing going on. Something in the foreground and something else in the background, or overlapping lines of dialogue, or interesting juxtapositions of images. Welles, as usual, provides some interesting visuals, using mirrors and shadows and other auteur tricks.The film is also full of bits of humor. One-liners and small gags. Uncle Joe, the acting leader of the Grandi mob family, often reminded me of Boris Badenov (even though he was Mexican). As the movie goes on it becomes more serious and intense.There are no opening titles or credits, so I wasn't aware of who the major players were. Charlton Heston is done up to look Mexican, with darker skin and a moustache. All movie long I was going crazy trying to figure out who the actor was. I knew I knew him. Something about the teeth... I was kicking myself when the end credits popped up. I felt so stupid. I did recognize the lovely Janet Leigh as Heston's wife, but I missed a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor.An older, heavier Welles is fun to watch as the veteran police chief forced into a downward spiral. The rest of the actors do a good job and Henry Mancini's score is effective throughout.As a viewer, you never quite know what's really going on. Who's with whom, who did what. You have some ideas, but you're not sure. Was it a frame job? A cover-up? Was he in on the whole thing? Is the murder linked with the harassment of Mrs. Vargas? Are they gonna get away with it? What if *he* was really telling the truth? TOUCH OF EVIL is a great film noir presented with Orson Welles's signature flair.(It is worth noting that I saw the \"director's cut\" version of the film, which sought to better represent Welles's intended vision than the version originally released by the studio.)",

One thing I noticed was that one of the songs that plated on the car radio closely resembled the theme song to the original Casino Royale. There's off screen action in this movie and that's a thing I really like in movies. It gives you time to think in stead of having it thrown in your face all the time.

And the opening tracking shot now restored to its full glory (the removal of the opening credits and a Henry Mancini theme being the most obvious changes to the re-edit) is a sound-and-visual delight as well as a technical tour de force.

Unforgivably, it stars the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Charlton Heston as the Mexican policeman Ramon Miguel Vargas. You'll also see Dennis Weaver in a role that reminds me of any David Lynch movie, Marlene Dietrich in one of the few roles where she actually acted, and Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joseph Cotton, Mercedes McCambridge, and Keenan Wynn in small parts, too.The movie is pregnant for several reasons. It's opening shot was for a long time the longest uncut shot on film. Robert Altman did a longer shot in \"The Player.\" Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard were judges at the Belgian World Fair, where the film was shown, and they awarded \"Touch of Evil\" top prize. Both then made their first films, allegedly as a result of their inspiration from this one.This is a great movie. Welles not only directed but played the title role, the evil Hank Quinlan, racist redneck foil of Vargas. Welles's scenes with Dietrich are mesmerizing, shot from the low perspective Welles made famous in \"Citizen Kane.\" The heads of dead bulls hung on her wall in the background are menacing, ominous, and dead-on in their foreshadowing of Quinlan's fate. When Welles was good, no one was better. It's a tragedy he was so infrequently good.The plot is pretty much of no use to Welles other than as a device to hang the movie on. I won't recount it. Go watch \"Touch of Evil\" for the cinematography and Welles's direction and acting. He blows Heston off the screen in every scene they share. Watch it for the sound, where Welles uses only sources originating within the world shown in the film. Watch Dennis Weaver as you've never seen him before, a manic, motor-mouthed lunatic, the man you'd have expected to be manager of the Bates Motel, not the Mirador. Watch Dietrich for her loser face and dead eyes, her perfect flat affect as she talks to a dead man who doesn't yet know it.

The whole works smoothly and no matter how many times you watch this film, it will only get better with time.Get your hands on the 1998 version if you can, although the other cuts are almost equally incredible.",

            "content": "From the famous opening shot panning from a doomed car carrying a ticking bomb, Orson Welles begins building the suspense. Welles also uses this opening seen to introduce practically every character in the film so you immediately have a feel for the shady world you're about to enter. Aside from lending his directorial genius to Touch of Evil, Mr. Welles also contributes his performance as the grotesquely obese, crooked Police Captain Hank Quinlan, one of the great screen villains of all time! His prejudice is as complete as his corruption as he abuses his power as a police officer to enforce justice as he sees fit. Quinlan's method of operations comes into question when the honey-mooning Mike and Susan Vargas (Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, respectively) find themselves at the scene of an explosion. Vargas, an up-and-coming Mexican narcotics officer (yes, Heston plays a Mexican, but the film is very good despite this question of casting) is waiting to testify in a case against a Mexican narcotics ring. Vargas, begins to uncover the truth about Quinlan's investigations, and the two battle for position in this brilliant film noir. Vargas is played with Charlton Heston's signature pride and dignity, as he attempts to bring Quinlan's reign of terror to an end. Susan Vargas is trapped in the middle of the conflict between the two detectives. Susan Vargas is portrayed by the lovely Janet Leigh, who is every bit as beautiful as ever in this film. She isn't given many lines, but she delivers what lines she does have with passion and energy. Akim Tamiroff plays Joe Grandi, this film's representation of Mexico's underworld. There are also some interesting cameos in this film, including Marlene Dietrich as \"Tana,\" Zsa Zsa Gabor as a strip club owner, Mercedes McCambridge as a member of a gang, and Welles' long-time collaborator, Joseph Cotten as the coroner. This film contains enough gritty atmosphere, suspense, plot twists, and brilliant cinematography to keep you coming back over and over again for any number of reasons. It is a stunning example of everything a film noir should be; dark and mysterious, every shot tainted with a Touch of Evil!",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 125 Touch of Evil is one of the late film noirs: and it's a good one. By 1958, films could show more explicit content, and Touch of Evil benefits greatly from this. Violence and drugs that would have to be implied can be shown. This aids the dark atmosphere of the film, which is very \"hard-boiled\".After an explosion on the American side of the border, law enforcement from both sides try to figure it out. The main investigators are Vargas and Quinlan, played by Charlton Heston and Orson Welles, respectively. Also playing roles are Janet Leigh pre-Psycho as Vargas' wife, and the Grandi crime family who are connected, somehow. The tale twists and turns like a true noir, and like a noir the plot makes no sense for a while. But the plot makes especially little sense in Touch of Evil, which detriments the overall picture. While I could think for a while to comprehend the Big Sleep, I couldn't wrap my head around this. Information about characters never reached my head in some cases. After the opening scene I found myself tired and wanting the film to end, but after 40 minutes I was understanding more and could enjoy the film.Once I got over the bump at the beginning, the story of Touch of Evil is really great right to the end.Charlton Heston is a great actor, but a terrible Mexican. It's very distracting, trying to believe a man with dark make-up and a moustache but no accent is Mexican. On the flip side, Orson's character is the best. He's angry, fat and doesn't want to deal with a Mexican like Vargas.*Character spoilers for those who can't put two and two together* Quinlan is one of the best noir villains I can remember. He has the motivation (his wife, a fact I missed because of the complexity), and we get to know him. He's sinister, and I dare say one of the best villains ever.*End* Before I knew of the opening's fame, I was really impressed with it. A super long shot, following a doomed car, weaving in and out of traffic, coming close to a couple who are clearly significant, it's very tense. Also worth noting, there are no titles at all. You don't even see the title until the end.One of the last great noirs, Touch of Evil benefits from a dark plot and Orson Welles. If you can get around the absurd first act and poor racial casting, you will be rewarded with a great experience. 8.2/10",

            "content": "Though perhaps most famous for its glorious opening sequence, and, to an extent, equally notorious for featuring Charleton Heston as a Mexican who makes little effort in using an actual Mexican accent, what many people seem to forget is that with this film, Welles created perhaps the last great film-noir. He had wrestled with the genre before, in such films as \"The Lady from Shanghai\", but here, he gets a real hold of it, and wrestles it into submission.The story, as is often the case with film-noirs, is a little murky. Ironically, the crime that begins the film and sets the chain of events into motion isn't really that important at all. The film is less about the actual crime, and more about the resulting police work, the characters involved in the investigation, and an exploration of law and ethics.Heston, as is often the case, is pretty wooden, and it's true that his portrayal of a Mexican leaves a bit to be desired. But it's not a deal breaker. At least it wasn't for me. Welles gives a substantial and memorable performance as the films antagonist, easily one of the great villains of film-noir.Visually, Welles is as good as ever, displaying his usual mastery of camera dynamics and lighting. The music, too, while understated, succeeds in adding atmosphere.It's not a perfect movie. There are flaws in its logic, and a certain degree of incomprehensibility, but Welles managed to take what could've been a run-of-the-mill B-movie, and make it into a engaging, impactful film. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Welles, film-noir, or classic movies in general.As a final note, I saw the 2000 version, which was re-edited based on a memo Welles wrote upon viewing the original studio version. The idea is that this better represents what Welles was trying to do. There are two others versions, one of which is the actual original studio version. As I have not seen the other two versions, my review is based on the 2000 version.",

I had seen and enjoyed Citizen Kane and The Lady from Shanghai (especially that one) but after seeing Touch of Evil again the other day the problems seem obvious. It's as if Welles had his game plan carefully set down beforehand, a la Hitchcock, but more obviously; \"Every location shot has to be carefully and dramatically lit in the classic film noir manner; keep daylight action to a minimum to develop the film noir flavor; some characters are free to be over-the-top in the acting department; a natural, true to life feeling to the events is to be avoided.\" The result is something contrived and pretentious. Every frame and scene seems to present itself for film-buff appreciation. Watch the shot from behind of Heston and two other characters rushing towards the cell where Janet Leigh is confined. The figures interweave from side to side in an almost choreographed way to express, I suppose, urgency and concern. All this manipulation takes viewers' attention away from the events and story. And, let's face it, Heston is miscast. The facial hair was a big mistake, and emphasizes the wish to make him closer to a then-stereotypical Mexican. Some of the dialog is pure corn; Marlene's closing lines, \"He was some kind of a man\". Puuuhlease. The so-Latin music. Overdone. Here and there a tricky camera angle for variety, at the bridge for instance. It amazes me that this film is so highly regarded by some folks. What is really so great about the extended opening scene in the car? Check out the talking-while-walking on the street scene between Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. That is much more impressive and engaging. Finally, it's sobering to see the physical decline in Welles from the attractive seaman of Shanghai only ten years earlier. Not just make-up, people. Seems some of his magic touch declined with his physical well-being. Do I like anything in the movie? Mercedes McCambridge.",

Sleazy, unsettling, hypnotic and downright nasty - prerequisite ingredients to amass a huge cult following and to ensure its long-term survival.Writer/director Orson Welles, delivers this film with lots of dark edges and ambiguous nuances. At its time of release, 1958, nobody was really sure how to handle this movie. The studio executives freaked out completely and ordered a re-edit while the audiences either loved it or hated it. Orson Welles spat the dummy, took his bat and ball and left the field of play completely. It was only years later and under the written suggestions of Orson Welles himself did the definitive version get a release to the world at large.Mike Vargis (Charlton Heston) is a Mexican drug enforcement officer trying desperately to clean up a sinister border-town.When Mike and his wife, Susan (Janet Leigh) witness a car bombing, it sets in motion a drawn-out and treacherous chain of events. Mistaken identity, gangland terror, shady dealings and cover-ups all combine to interlace a string of sub-plots into a tightly woven narrative.Heading all investigations is the famous American cop Hank Quinlan, (Orson Welles) a perspiring, ominous and loathsome example of law enforcement at its menacing worst.Other cast members include Dennis Weaver, who plays a weirdo motel-clerk a little too well, Marlene Dietrich pops up as a world weary bar-keeper and Zsa Zsa Gabor lurks as a dance-hall madam. All excel brilliantly in bringing disturbing qualities to their tacky characters. After my first viewing of this movie, I had the sudden urge to be deloused while burning my clothes in a token gesture.'Touch Of Evil' is far from overt in its portrayal of violence and steaming sexuality. It relies upon innuendo and sordid intent that really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The rape of Janet Leigh's character is a classic example of what you don't see being far more powerful than what you do.Orson Welles has created a cream-of-the-crop showpiece in the genre of film noir. Low camera angles, sinister shadows, menacing back-lighting and seedy characterizations combine to deliver pulp fiction at its trashy best. It's unadulterated Orson Welles and unadulterated indulgence, which may in fact be the very same thing.It does hold up well after three or so decades but compared to the gritty material of today, it is a little tame. What it does have over contemporary films however is lashings of style and subtlety.Modern film-makers more often than not confuse hateful behavior with being menacing, and resolutely believe that gratuitous violence will convey evil intent. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Orson Welles proved with this powerful film, true evil is not what's on display for the world to see, but what lies safe and secure within your own imagination.",

I rank this movie as the greatest film noir ever made and one of the greatest movies ever made. It's that simple. I watch this movie at least 2-3 times a month. Orson's character, Hank Quinlan is the ultimate crooked, bigot cop. This character is like a monster that no one seems to know how to stop. That's the easy description, the true genius is in the script, mannerisms and camera angles. You could not make this film in color, it wouldn't work. One of my favorite aspects about this movie is the subtle use of sarcasm - especially Quinlan's Sargeant - that leads to the overall mood of arrogance spread out in this amazing movie. This movie requires multiple viewings if you really want to appreciate the stunning script and superlative camera shots/angles. Dennis Weaver's character is in my opinion, one of the most bizarre in movie history especially considering there was no development his hyper-manic oddball character. Truly bizarre - but so entertaining! The cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor is neat but the extended \"cameo\" by Marlene Dietrich is stunning. I bought this movie after 1 viewing - safe to say, you will too.

He hadn't worked in the US for ten years, so in 1958, when Universal Studios asked him to direct \"Touch of Evil\", he didn't hesitate.The movie takes place in a small village on the border between USA and Mexico. Special prosecutor Vargas (Charlton Heston) investigates who placed a bomb in a car on the city's main street, killing two innocent people. His American colleague, Captain Quinlan (Orson Welles), accuses a Mexican youth of the crime, but Vargas soon realizes that there may be darker motives behind Quinlan's actions.Before he started filming, Orson Welles completely rewrote the script. He didn't bother to read the book on which the movie was based, but worked directly from the screenplay previously commissioned by Universal. To prevent the company's spies from reporting on his activities, Welles then shot much of the film at night. Which, of course, helped lend the film its doom-laden mood.After principal shooting was done, Welles began editing the material. However, he had to take a short break to appear on \"The Steve Allen Show\" in New York. When he returned, a new editor had been assigned to complete the film. And now Welles wasn't even welcome to enter the editing room. Deeply disappointed, he sent a memorandum to the producer in which he in great detail described his own vision of \"Touch of Evil\".Orson Welles died in 1985, never having seen the movie he set out to make. 13 years later, however, Charlton Heston found a copy of Welles' memo in his attic. After he submitted the document to Universal, the film was recut according to Orson Welles' intentions. Ironically, \"Touch of Evil\" is now considered one of the most important works of the '50s.",

Then there is a couple who happens to be at the scene and are now somehow involved in a very big conspiracy which leads to the kidnapping. Also, we see an aging policeman trying to solve the case with his intuition (source of this intuition is a feeling he gets in his injured leg) but all he is doing is trying to prove his intuition right, even if it is not.It is fascinating to watch all three of these stories getting connected so beautifully. Touch of Evil is a must watch if your like film-noirs of 50s and 60s but I assure you that you will find it a little different from those movies. In my case, I found it very refreshing.",

            "content": "As one would expect, whenever Orson Welles' name is attached to a film, the expectations are immediately raised very highly, particularly since he directed, co-wrote, and starred in probably the greatest film of all time, Citizen Kane. Naturally, it's obvious that someone would go into this film expecting something incredible. Fortunately, that is what they get, because Welles perfected another brilliant film with this 1958 effort, and he managed to do it with a rather low budget.Touch Of Evil is a stupendous and very engaging film that earns itself a place as being one of the finest film noirs ever made. It's a gripping film has a tendency to maintain the audience's enthrallment throughout its length, with a story that manages to keep the viewers guessing as the tensions mount, and not to mention that it features some absolutely phenomenal acting from a superb cast. It also was proof that Welles didn't need a large budget to make a great film, since with his flare and expertise, he handled all elements with the utmost brilliance and perfection.The film is a story of murder and corruption. Charlton Heston plays Ramon Vargas, a lawyer who is on a vacation in a town along the American-Mexican border, with his American wife, Susan. However, the vacation ends quickly, when a car suddenly explodes and the occupants are killed. Before long, every police in the county arrive, including a Captain named Hank Quinlan, who has a stellar reputation among police. Almost immediately, Quinlan makes it obvious that he doesn't want Mexicans meddling with his affairs, despite that the bomb was planted in Mexican territory, and probably by a Mexican. Vargas also has some personal matters involved, particularly when his wife finds herself targeted by a local crime boss. Almost from the get go, it becomes clear that Vargas and Quinlan will be getting into more than a few spats in regards to the case, but everything takes a turn when the former discovers something about the latter's methods, which makes it more personal, as it places both of their reputations on the line.In addition to his superb directing, Welles perfects a story that is very easy to become invested in. During the course of the film's length, the story is full of elements that are unpredictable and can keep changing at any moment, such a shift of loyalties and certain deals being made, which causes the audience to become aware of what's unfolding at a gradual pace, one that is bound to keep them intrigued at what will happen next. It also features some suspenseful elements that feel like something Hitchcock would've come up with, which is buoyed by the camerawork. There's a scene where Charlton Heston is following Welles and his partner under a bridge as he tries to record them, and the aura of dread that occurs is something that wouldn't be out of place in a Hitchcock film. In fact, the film doesn't waste any time with the suspense, as right at the beginning, we see the time bomb being placed in the trunk of the car, and the camera primarily focuses on it, which can create another sense of dread, as we know what will happen, but where and when will it happen?Charlton Heston sometimes tends to receive criticism for his role in this film, but personally, I considered to be one of his best roles. He plays Ramon Vargas with a sense of morality and integrity that makes him a great character, one that viewers want to see succeed. Janet Leigh deserves recognition as well, as she's perfect as the wife of Heston, who becomes a victim when she's caught up in the crossfire. Susan Vargas is a very sympathetic character, and Leigh's portrayal makes her very easy to feel sorry for her. Joseph Calleia also is superb, playing a friend and partner to Quinlan, who initially starts out as loyal to him, but eventually finds himself assisting Heston. And in a smaller role, the always fabulous Marlene Dietrich captures the viewers attention as an ex-lover of Quinlan. As usual for an Orson Welles film, none of the actors falter in their roles, and likewise, all of the characters fit perfectly into the story, with none of them feeling out of place or unnecessary.Also, besides his excellent directing and writing, Welles portrays a loathsome character if there ever was one. Right away, with his low, growling voice and slow movements, one gets the sense that Hank Quinlan is a rather spiteful and bigoted individual. However, as the film moves forward, it also becomes obvious that he's very corrupt, and is not above resorting to planting and fabricating evidence to achieve success, which has probably resulted in the deaths of many innocent people. Basically, the only one he cares about is himself, as he's not interested in serving justice or following the law, all he cares about is seeing someone punished. And he'll resort to extremely wicked measures to keep his reputation from being tarnished. There's one particular scene where he gives Janet Leigh a major scare, which is something else that wouldn't have seen out of place in a Hitchcock film. I won't say what it is, but when you see it, it will probably frighten you.Some say that the film noir genre ended around the time this film was released. However, I say that Orson Welles ended it with this film, because it's one of the best of its kind, one that is definitely the work of a genius, so it truly was worthy of bring a close to the film-noir genre. Reiterating, Touch Of Evil is an excellent film that defines a genre, and marks another triumph for one of the greatest creative minds in the history of cinema.",

Wouldn't a macho guy like Heston aid his wife first and then confront the thugs? After all, this is 1958 when guys rolled cigarette packs into their t-shirt sleeves. That was a lame scene. One of the actors, Calleia, was the director; not Hitchcock. It would have been easy for Heston to have the script changed to a more likely scenario. Otherwise, I enjoyed the film; anytime one can see Janet Leigh, Charleton Heston, Orson Welles, Marlene Deitrich (dark-haired Mexican) and Dennis Weaver in the same film, it's a blast!",

            "review_title": "What's So Great About the 1998 Restoration?",
            "content": "[contains opening scene spoiler] Is there really any great difference between the original release version of \"Touch of Evil\" and the 1998 restoration? In my opinion, yes. The difference is subtle but very significant. In fact, while I'd say that while the former is an excellent movie by any standard, the latter is (in my opinion) one of the two or three greatest films ever made.The 1998 restoration took a quirky but fun film and revealed the unmitigated masterpiece beneath. Yes, in a sense the change was only one of subtle nuances, but that made all the difference in the film coming together as a coherent work of art.The standard blurb on \"Touch of Evil\" used to be that it was the \"greatest B-movie ever made,\" with critics taking perverse delight in seeing the \"grand master\" reduced to bad tv movies, commercials, embarrassing acting roles, and low-budget movies like \"Evil\" in the twilight of his career. (The fact is, though he did anything to finance his endeavors, some of his greatest work came at the end of his career, imo.) Then, with the new restoration, says this conventional wisdom, we can discern better the A-film awkwardly crying to be free, and we can then reflect on the B-movie alterations forced on the flick by the low-brow studio, etc.To my mind, this 'A' and 'B' stuff is pretty meaningless. A film is either good or bad, regardless of budget or caliber of stars. Writing, acting, and direction determine a film's true status. And this is exactly what comes to the fore with the '98 restoration: the direction suddenly makes sense, thereby illustrating the genius of the writing, and in turn bringing out the depths of the acting. (For example, the famous line at the end-- \"He was just a man...\"(etc.) is no longer just a cool-sounding, but essentially meaningless line to add atmosphere to the end of a b-flick; it becomes a final focal point through which the entire film's meaning can be pondered.)But without going on and on about it too long, I can sum up what the '98 restoration actually restores in one word: balance. The studio cut up the film to focus on the (I'll use the term again) B-movie male hero, the Charlton Heston character. He dominates long stretches of the film, and we soon get the sense that the plot follows a familiar formula: the one true good guy fights corruption in a sordid world. James Stewart could almost play the part.However, the restoration follows Welles' original editing plan, in which the story is evenly balanced between Ramon Vargas (Heston) and his wife Susan (Janet Leigh). The plot alternates evenly from a Ramon scene to a Susan scene to a Ramon scene, etc. (some Susan scenes were cut for the original release and restored in '98). What does this do for us? Well, the sense of balance, and the new juxtapositions of scenes, facilitate new depths of meaning in the film. In short, it is a film obsessed with binarisms: man vs. woman, Hispanic vs. Anglo, South vs. North, \"Third World\" vs. \"First World,\" poor vs. rich, police state vs. democracy, law upholders vs. law breakers, respectable society vs. the demi-monde, darkness vs. light (black hair vs. blonde, light streets vs. dark alleyways, neon vs. shadow, etc.), good vs. evil. The delicately balanced binary direction not only brings out these dichotomies in more vivid relief, but it begins to play with our expectations of what each opposition is about, surreptitiously asking us to rethink them, perhaps to seek some of what we thought was the \"other\" in the self, and most importantly, to recognize the self in the other. Suddenly the film's title and the closing line-- \"He was just a man, like any other\"-- take on a great deal of meaning.With this sense of opposition, every scene of the film deepens, as the control of details we're used to observing in, say, Citizen Kane, can now be seen here. The famous opening scene, with its long winding continuous shot, is amazing in either version. However, in the restored version, the credits are taken away so that you can actually see every aspect, and Mancini's blaring theme music is cut, so that you can actually hear the street scene. As a result, so much of the film's greater motifs can be seen to have their start here. As the Anglo-Hispanic couple weave their way through traffic toward the border, they come in and out of close proximity with a big American car, one that will explode once it crosses the border. They walk past Anglo tourists and Hispanic locals. As they pass cars and establishments, various types of music blare out, with U.S. and Mexican music alternating. They pass in and out of light and shadow, weaving now into the foreground, now into the background... until they cross the border with a bang. And from that moment on, every detail of the film stands up to scrutiny in a way that few if any other directors are capable of maintaining.",

But as soon as Leigh made her first inexplicable decision of the film and put herself into danger despite seeming to be very smart, I knew there were going to be some bizarre inconsistencies. I can recognize an interestingly-shot film when I see one, even if I'm not sure what's being done artistically. There's no question that the way it was shot - cool shadows and angles and all - adds miles to the film's watchability. But some of the acting and writing is just soooooooo bad. I didn't even care that Heston, playing a Mexican, had an American accent. That was the least of the film's issues. Why did Leigh, feisty at first, turn into a credible fool making stupid choices? Why did Welles - wonderfully outwardly disgusting as if to underline his morality - choose to mumble his lines incomprehensibly? Why was Welles' underling portrayed as not only gullible but also bumpkin-goofy? Dear heavens, what was up with Weaver's hotel clerk and his changing accents and sanity? What were the reasons behind these characters' inconsistency of - well - character? The eerie feeling the way the film was shot was completely lost to the bizarre choices made by both the actors and the people they portrayed. Welles' last scene was just embarrassing.

            "review_title": "How Orson Welles redefined 'Film Noir'",
            "content": "Welles was a masterful enigma. Shortly before his death, Wells confided to Peter Bogdanovich: \"boy, how everyone'll love me when I'm dead.\" Orson Welles spent a career doing it all \"his way\" and, as such, both infuriated and intimidated the studios. Welles sought sensationalism, and it showed in his craft, his demand for excellence, and his pursuit of not just utilizing modern film making methodology, but defining it. With Kane, Welles unleashed the full bore of his artistic potential and knew outright what he'd created. His fake \"News on the March\" created uniformity out of illusion. His drive for innovation was almost Goerbbels-like in his \"bigger the lie, the more people will believe it\" approach to cinematic sensationalism: News On The March replicated a historical/documentary \"past\", that never even existed! It was \"reality entertainment\" decades before the concept existed.Warping convention under the guise of \"mainstream appeal\" was Welles' signature. I thought about this while again watching his Touch of Evil (1958). It was through Touch of Evil, not Citizen Kane, which Welles redefined a genre \u2013Film Noir- and in doing so solidified his genius into the annals of cinematic history.Throughout his career Wells would manipulate even the most current and popular of film techniques and styles into his own Wellesian amalgamations. Deep focus for example, later became such a lush part of his career that by \"Touch of Evil\" Welles' style was awash with it, in almost Hitchcockian predictability.Widely known was the contempt Welles had for Hitchcock, and certainly once he began feeling settled in his craft, Welles trail-blazed ahead towards innovation, lest be aligned with his Hitchcockian contemporary.In Touch of Evil, mega-studio Paramount wanted a simple, straight-forward noir film, which Wells would deliver, but in his own way. The studio, of course balked, which is how the whole 'multiple versions' of Touch of Evil came about. Welles knew that the studios were clamoring for film noir. What infuriated Paramount was Welles notable sidestepping of convention to the studio system in which his film interpretations flipped noir upside-down to suit his needs, including: Welles doing away with the narrative voice over. Next, Welles did away with starting a film at the end and moving progressively backwards through the \"reveal.\" Finally, he did the unthinkable: He \"removed\" the femme fatal.I believe Welles did away with voice over in this noir classic because he trusted his audiences\u0085 Clearly more than he trusted the studios. In telling Touch of Evil on his terms, Welles knew that a spoken drone would steal from the lush visual imagery he was seeking to achieve. So adamant was Welles about anything pulling the viewer's focus, that one of the defining \"battles\" Welles and Paramount fought was over on-screen text over the opening car scene at the beginning of the movie. In Welles' version, the text scrolls separately, adding 4 extra minutes, which the studio was very vocal about stopping.Another point that Welles broke the standard film noir style in Touch of Evil was how his film does not \"begin at the end\", a classic \u2013if not defining- trait of standard film noir. As the expression goes, the end of one story begins another.Touch of Evil opens on the end result of whatever unseen story led to the doomed driver and passenger's demise in the car bombing. From there, the film text picks up the search for motive, for responsible parties, and a tapestry unfolds. Through the exploration into motive and culprits for the opening bombing, many things are revealed; most notably, Welles' ingenious use and insertion of the story within the story: the past dynamic between Welles character and Dietrich's, clearly a femme fatale dynamic, and thus, a missing key component of film noir definition.The (actually not) missing \"Femme Fatale\": Film Noir's coveted pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is -and has always been- the femme fatale. Just because the femme fatale dynamic is not the story Welles sought to tell in Touch of Evil that does not mean it was not employed; it was. She's there.To spin film noir in his own style, Welles \"reconstituted\" the dynamic \u2013and the placing- of the femme fatale in Touch of Evil. The femme fatale didn't just control men; she domineered them. In doing so, the femme fatale became a spring overflowing of sexual desire, of their obsessive fixation, of and ultimately their undoing. To Welles, such a character was far too lush to cast off, and in Touch of Evil, Welles had absolutely no desire to any such thing.The film does not maximize the traditional noir-defining femme fatale because -in this particular intended reading- the femme fatale was not the story Welles sought to tell. Instead, the femme fatale here is Marlene Dietrich, as a tarot-reading seductress who once -in their untold shared past history- had clearly bewitched Welles' flawed, corrupt character.Touch of Evil was a set-up of a film, that could have easily spawned a long line of \"addendum astories\", or \"sequesls\" as we know the term today.The film ends with Dietrich watching her former object of femme fatale fixation \u2013Welles- floating lifelessly down the river, and returning to the very disappointing life she'd lamented to Welles about earlier in the film.A set up for a 'traditional' femme fatale 'sequel' of sorts? It is, of course, entirely possible... But no, probably not. But the film does conclude in the same way it opened: a tragic event that is the culmination of events.Knowing the \"history\" of all the characters, I could see a film opening on Welles dead body in the water, in much the same way that Touch of Evil opened with its tragic car bombing.As one story ends... Another begins.So it was with Orson Welles: Iconic genius of entertainment",

Perhaps the movie's only flaw is Charlton (I love the NRA) Heston.  His acting is awful, and he's completely unconvincing as the Mexican cop.  Given the quality of the rest of the cast one can only conclude that Heston's presence was forced on Wells in order to secure the film's budget.

This is one of the few films that is better viewed in full screen rather than wide screen, actually. A great thing about this movie is the small details, particularly the cameos such as Zsa Zsa Gabor and Merceded Macaimbridge. Marlene Dietrich is fantastic as the saloon owner/fortune teller. It goes to prove that a small role can be elevated to greatness in the hands of a great actor. Even folks who don't particularly like the film will remember her performance. There are little details like the poster that gets splashed with acid is actually the woman who was in the car with Lenneker at the very beginning of the film. As well as the bullfighting posters in the saloon that correlate with the battle between Vargas and Quinlan. Orson Wells is Superb in his role as Hank Quinlan, possibly the best role of his acting career, drolling such lines like \"uh, I don't speak Mexican,let's keep it English, Vargas\" during the interrogation scene. or the classic \"ha, lawyers! all a lawyer cares about is the law!\" It took me about a half dozen viewings before I caught on that Quinlan's death was actually a tragedy. Just as Vargas demanded \"who makes the rules, the cops or the law?\" Quinlan sought to answer that very question, by bringing criminals to justice, swift justice without the hindrance of the law, allowing them to go free the way his wife's murderer did. Vargas wasn't much different from Quinlan in his method of exposing him. I have been with the majority it seems in regards to Heston's portrayal of a Mexican narcotics officer, he isn't all that convincing as a Mexican, but he is convincing as a indignant cop. Although, did anyone notice that when he found out his wife had been accosted and kidnapped from the hotel room, he was more upset by the fact that his GUN was missing than his wife?!? but he does wear those cool aviator shades..... But if you like the film for its story and acting, love it for its photography, there is of course the loooong crane shot in the beginning, unhindered in the final version by opening credits, but pay attention to the interrogation scene, there is a 10 or so minute scene, in a very busy room with lots of action, but its all one shot! and thats pretty amazing.

            "content": "Touch of Evil (1958) directed by Orson Welles is complex film that examines the basic struggle between good and evil through two parallel story lines. The movie questions whether the burden of the law lies in protecting the innocent or prosecuting the guilty, which becomes the central conflict between American detective Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and Mexican narcotics official Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) during the investigation of a cross-border car bombing. The story is spliced with the struggles of Vargas' new bride, Susan (Janet Leigh), as she is terrorized by the Grandi gang. Welles uses severely contrasted lighting to heighten the suspense as the story unfolds and low angle camera shots help to establish the dominance of the main characters. Even though the film is considered the last true film noir, it strays from a few fundamentals in his treatment of Quinlan, Touch of Evil's most complicated character.The movie follows the classic film noir lighting style with many scenes being shot with high contrast between dark and light areas. The lighting in the rooms that are central to Quinlan's storyline are darker and shadier, notably: the brothel his former mistress Tanya (Marlene Deitrich) runs, the bar he deals with 'Uncle Joe' Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) in and the hotel room where he ultimately kills Grandi. Vargas' dealings take him into areas that are more fully lit, such as his office and the department of records where he searches for incriminating patterns in Quinlan's past cases. This divergence visually cements the men in their roles as antagonist and protagonist. In many of the indoor shots, during night or daytime, the primary light source comes from outside with the light bleeding in through the blinds and windows, streaking the rooms with shadows. This helps to build up the suspense of the investigation and also gives the visual sense that there are more elements to the story waiting to come to light. One of the most effective uses of this lighting technique is seen when 'Uncle Joe' Grandi is killed. The room's light is extinguished and only ambient light seeps in from an unseen source, a pulsating sign outside the window. The room is intermittently cast in light and shadow and it gives an uncomfortable, edgy feeling as the murder takes place.Many different camera angles are used consistently to define the main characters. Welles relies heavily on a low angle to translate a sense of dominance. In Quinlan's first scene, his establishing shot is from a low angle, looking up at the large man as he hoists himself out of the car. The low angle also stresses the conflict between Qunilan and Vargas and its use symbolizes their equal standing. The view point switches from eye level to a low angle when Quinlan and Vargas clash for the first time, while everyone else is shot straight on. In contrast, when Susan is kidnapped later in the film, we see her shot from a high angle to accentuate her weakness, while her captors are shot from a low angle. Quinlan and Vargas are also continually framed on opposing sides of the screen when the film cuts between the two during dialogue, underlining the opposition between the two men.Welles deviates from the norms of the film noir genre in developing the character of Hank Quinlan. Instead of using the typical flashbacks and narrator voice-over, we learn of Quinlan's past as he, newly off-the-wagon, sits in a bar and drunkenly recounts his wife's murder. Using a flashback would've described the story as effectively but would've made the visitation of the memory more fleeting. Shooting the scene in real-time not only provided more personal insight into Hank's character, but represented a more definite regression into his dark past and foreshadowed the killing of Joe Grandi. The absence of a true femme fatale in this film also strays from the film noir framework. Hank's turmoil stems from the fact that his wife was murdered and the other sympathetic female in his life, Tanya, now barely recognizes him and refuses to fill her old role. His lack of relationships with women is then set against the traditional husband-wife dynamic between Vargas and his wife.Throughout Touch of Evil, Welles utilizes many cinematic elements to unfold its layered stories. The deliberate departure from typical film noir trappings provides us with a greater insight in to the emotions of the troubled Hank Quinlan. The lighting heightens the mystery of the story while the low camera angles institute a sense of power in the main characters, Quinlan and Vargas.",

Welles remains the supreme cinematic magician,  and in this movie he demonstrates the fabulous versatility and vision that characterised this charismatic genius.  To those that seek to denigrate this movie in comparison with his other triumphs, I would urge them to see the movie for what it is and in the context of the time it was made.  Just as critics now perhaps see the message of Citizen Kane through history's telescope, so will another generation perhaps see \"Touch of Evil\" for its uniquely cinematic vision of corruption and morality, and how this resonates in an era of disillusion and despair at the ability of our society to deliver moral solutions in an amoral world. Watch this movie, and compare it to any others you think comparable. Remember we are talking about the magic of cinema and not just other movies that seem to tell similar tales. Thank you Hollywood, first,  for allowing this truly strange movie to ever get to the screen:  and second, for it to be allowed to live for so long to become a \"classic\".  In the memories of one of those who first saw it as \"just another film\" in a darkened cinema long ago, it still enthralls and holds ones attention as few films do.",

            "content": "Orson Welles's film noir classic Touch of Evil (1958) explores themes of obsession, blame and corruption on both sides of the Us-Mexico border. Touch of Evil begins when a car crossing the border from Mexico explodes on the American side of the border. Thereby launching Miguel Vargas (Charlton Heston), a high ranking Mexican narcotics official on his honeymoon with his American wife, Susie (Janet Leigh), into the path of Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), a legendary American cop marred by candy bars and bigotry. Quinlan will stop at nothing to bring about justice where he believes justice is deserved, even when it means planting evidence. When Vargas catches him planting evidence, Quinlan sees the only way to quiet Vargas is to discredit him. Quinlan teams up with \"Uncle Joe\" Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), a local Mexican gangster who has his own reasons for hating Vargas.For content and visual appeal, Touch of Evil is an excellent film. The cinematography by Russell Metty is breathtaking. But the shots do not exist merely for cosmetic appeal. While the character of Quinlan is skillfully written and Welles gives a magnificent performance, the low and high angle shots are what really drive the audience to loathe him; displaying him in the most unflattering light possible. Accentuating the ever present sweat on his face and the thick layer of fat covering his entire being. The music and sounds are all very authentic and come from the actual surroundings that the characters are in. When a car drives by we can hear the radio but the music fades as the car distances itself from the camera. This is a nice effect and one that is rarely seen in films, no matter the genre or era.Touch of Evil showed up at the tail end of the film noir cycle. By 1953, the femme fatale character has disappeared, as had her detective lover. However, the characters retain many of the traditional film noir characteristics. Our two main characters, Vargas and Quinlan, are both morally ambiguous \u0096 Quinlan in particular. His action are evil but the motives behind his actions are difficult to classify as either good or bad. Although he isn't the quintessential detective, Vargas retains nearly all of the characteristcs of the film noir hero. He knows how to access places that tend to be locked up and restricted, and he has the street smarts and lives on the fringes of the dark and sleazy underworld, all the while being looked down upon by his American associates. Distortion techniques and low angle shots are heavily used to deglamorize the stars, Welles in particular. In nearly every shot of Quinlan, his colossal gut seems to take up a good chunk of the screen, even when it could be done without. Welles uses lighting heavily throughout the film to set the tone and keep the audience's attention. In the opening shot, rather than watch the man set the bomb, we follow his shadow as it skitters across the side of a building. Flashlights are used while Vargas searches for Susie at the motel, highlighting his struggle to make light of the situation. Welles also makes use of the dark urban setting surrounding the border with wet streets, steam rising from the street grates and garbage floating in the river.Touch of Evil is an excellent film technically speaking. It's a tale of morality that makes you think and the shooting style is smooth and great to watch. A film with an honest lesson that everyone should see.",

Charlton Heston as Burgess (or is it Vargas?) is the epitome of the Good Cop and Honest Citizen, his wife the idea of the American Woman (smart, but couldn't hold her own, really.) and of course there's the Antagonist- played with remarkable intensity and to glorious perfection by the director himself.What separates this work from the hundreds of Good Cop-Triumphs-Over- the-Corruption-in-the-Police-System films is Welles' fascinating character. Though overweight, physically disgusting and limping, his power is such that he needs to make very little effort to accomplish what he wants. The glint of his very eyes evokes grisly details and sordid worldliness. Despite all this, Welles does not make him out to be the Evil Enemy right on- he is respected by everyone, an over-the- hill prostitute holds fond memories of him, and he SEEMS to be wanting to REALLY solve crimes.A dynamite explodes in one of the cars passing by the land, so Welles' character- working for the Mexican government- teams up with Burgess to uncover the perpetrators. Burgess is convinced that Welles is planting the evidences- and the exposure of this work of \"evil\" drives the story forward.Don't you just long for the good ole days when the explosions seem to be so real and alive, when the actors get into their characters, when the action sequences are integral to the story, and when Charlton Heston was still lovable? (Gosh, did you see him in Michael Moore's `Bowling for Columbine').And most importantly- don't you just love it when an action film's every single frame is beautifully conceived?",

            "content": "When you think of the films made in 1958, Touch of Evil is a standout for originality of style, structure and, most of all, unconventional casting. Orson Welles' unwitting self- sabotage kept it from being released at the time as he had intended, but a careful restoration in 1998, using Welles' own post-production notes, reveals how innovative this late work was to have been.For innovative style, one can start with Henry Mancini's music. The only notes you hear are produced in the context of the action. The danger attending a double murder is evoked by brassy jazz laced with bongo percussion sounding from a car that is about to explode. A piano roll is the source of a leitmotif, which has an incredible hook that adds dimension to the anti-hero Quinlan's suggested past love life. Even with a single instrument playing mechanically, Welles is able to create a melancholy as fulsomely rich as a gallon of Arpege perfume. The breathtaking black and white photography makes this one of the best examples of film noir. It's a world seemingly without air or sky, even during the day, where around every corner is a lurid tableau: a young hood hurling acid in a bottle, a raving motel clerk with O.C.D. (Dennis Weaver); a hotel room vignette that includes a drugged Susie Vargas (Janet Leigh) with the grotesque body of Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff) slumped above her on the headboard of her brass bed. Such intensely bizarre images might have gone on to inspire Fellinini, perhaps even the photographer Diane Arbus.Welles' single most brilliant casting stroke was to see a latent Latin fire in the conventional acting style of Charlton Heston. Nothing in his previous performances could have guaranteed his excellence as Mike Vargas, an original take on the standard detective. Light-years from the canon set by Dana Andrews and Humphrey Bogart, Heston's Vargas is oily, dark, and brooding, with a seedy John Gilbert-inspired mustache. And yet Heston's Mexican makeover seems to have been as liberating as his Bible drag was confining. The result is a truly nuanced character with passion, honor and crass pragmatism all emerging unpredictably. It's hard to believe he shot Ben Hur after this role.When she was cast as Heston's new bride, Janet Leigh began a 3-film run of remarkable luck, culminating with her roles in Psycho and Manchurian Candidate. Here the pretty and sweet Hollywood blonde discovered by Norma Shearer steps out to play someone completely self-possessed, apparently unafraid of any man or danger. Welles puts her in situations that would have been unthinkable for most '50s starlets. Susie Vargas will not be rescued at the last minute by a Tab Hunter type. Instead, Leigh is totally left alone in her remote motel room, clad only in satin slip and bullet bra. Surprisingly, she seems never more than bemused, bored or irritated, even when her life is threatened. You only get a scream out of her when a local gang led by Mercedes McCambridge (uncredited) forces her to participate in what is implied to be a sex orgy, replete with marijuana and other drugs. The effect of her performance is remarkably modern. The production stills alone of Leigh must be amazing.Marlene has the best of it as Tana the fortune teller, which she performs with exquisite sang froid in a raven-colored coiffure and emphatic Gypsy makeup. Welles lavished her both with the most transfiguring look and the crunchiest lines in the movie. To the slightly rancid Quinlan: \"You're a mess, honey\" and \"I didn't recognize you...you should lay off the candy bars.\" Old-world cool never had so much charisma. Glamorous, even in reduced circumstances, she gets to deliver the last word on Quinlan's wasted life in a stunning black satin trench by Bill Thomas. All the while, the viewer is sure she has experienced far worse, and, for a woman of such enigmatic attraction, far more interesting men than Quinlan. Who is this lady and how did she get here are questions never answered in this masterpiece of ambiguity.",

While there where definitely parts that were distinctly Noir, several sequences, especially that beginning long shot, felt like they belonged in a James Bond movie or something. To be honest though, what I liked most about this movie was the music. The bongos especially stood out.

What changes they kept, or what changes they left in will never be known unless its possible to get a hold of the Wells first copy then compare the two. I love Film Noir, the Asphalt Jungle is my favorite and in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Im less than critical with any amateurish acting, economy sets, etc If the story of good I'll likely love the picture, Hammer films are the exception. The Touch of Evil was a disappointment my first thoughts were: This is the most disjointed mess I have ever seen with characters having complete reversals in their outlook and opinions, dialogue that makes no sense, scenes that don't contribute but take away from the plot. The deputy is the staunchest defender of his boss Wells, denying every word against the guy or planting evidence charges but then has a Saul of Taurses in the a desert moment becoming Paul, and becomes so concerned with how corrupt the Sheriff really is that he wears a wire to try and convict the man. Dennis Weaver the dim, very strange motel clerk goes off like a broken record when Vargus (Heston) comes by to look for his wife, however what he repeats ad nauseam is that \"he ain't gunna clean up that mess\" in the room Mrs Vargus was staying in, saying nothing regarding the obvious question Vargus asks, where is the woman! The whole border deal gets lost, you never know where they are and what the significance of the good guys/bad guys being on one side or the other means. Girl of Shanghi is looked at as Orson Wells worst, even given he forces his soon to be ex-wife and the star of the movie Rita Hayward to bleach her beautiful red hair, maybe as a control or last slap in the face gesture. I would place Touch of Evil In that spot. I don't know if the disjointed way the pictures flows has anything to do with the Wells vs the studio fight, it could have been a much better picture with some A List actors in Leigh, Wells, and Heston.",

Someone planted the bomb on the Mexican side of the border, and the car exploded after driving through customs, giving the murder international implications. In order to solve the mystery and avoid any diplomatic complications, Miguel must team up with the infamous Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), whose shady tactics, fiery temper, and disregard for the law make him a genuine force to be reckoned with.Quinlan is that rare cinematic presence who manages to be thoroughly despicable yet oddly sympathetic at the same precarious moment. You hate the guy \u0096 his cruelty, his racism, and his flagrant perversion of legality \u0096 yet every iota of contempt finds its match in sympathy. In pity, even. His slow surrender to alcoholism and the rawness of his past keep tugging away at our hear-strings, even as he establishes himself as the one character we most want destroyed. That the duplicity of his tactics eclipses the very mystery he's purportedly solving \u0096 who set off the bomb, and why \u0096 testifies even further to the uniqueness of his character, and his offbeat function in the narrative. In Quinlan's shoes, Welles commands every scene he's in, but gets plenty of help from Marlene Dietrich \u0096 gorgeous as a brunette \u0096 and from Joseph Calleia, whose portrayal of Quinlan's meek-mannered sidekick is both memorable and tragic.Touch of Evil deserves its status as a classic, but I'd feel more comfortable declaring it such were it not for Senior Heston and his supposed portrayal of a Mexican. The actor's refusal to even attempt an accent is more than a trifle annoying, and to make matters worse, the Mexican cast is excellent across the board. Any one of their number would have been a better choice for Vargas, but since they were all relative unknowns, and since Touch of Evil was a Heston movie before it was anything else, we're left with a protagonist we can never accept, an irksome intrusion on an otherwise perfect movie.",

It does have many solid features, nonetheless. Welles' direction is sharp. The opening scene shown without credits (TCM and DVD versions of the film run the scene in that way), where the camera provides a bird's eye view of an impending murder by explosives, is marvelously done. Welles' acting as the amoral and imminently corruptible police captain, Hank Quinlan, is fantastic. He is repulsive on nearly every level imaginable. The supporting cast is strong, with particularly good performances by Mort Mills as the DA's assistant, Al Schwartz, and by Jospeh Calleia as police sergeant Pete Menzies. Sgt. Menzies in particular goes from being Quinlan's lackey to trying hard to be his conscience. Calleia carries off that transformation brilliantly. Heston, however, is never very convincing as the incorruptible \"Mike\" Vargas, whose scrupulous attention to detail ultimately brings Quinlan down. Blackening Heston's hair and giving him a pencil mustache and a few lines in Spanish did not transform him into a believable Mexican official. Janet Leigh's character, Susie Vargas, was intriguing. She is very easily duped by the drug ring and becomes fearful of remaining in Mexico, yet her apparently racist insistence on staying north of the border only threw her directly into the hands of the drug ring she so feared. Moreover, she was indirectly at the mercy of police \"protection\" in the form of the loathsome Captain Quinlan.",

Not because the movie is bad, but it is sicking to the core that Quinlan and Vargas in fact should be the two main male characters in the world, as we know it:Either a blue-eyed or blind idealist with no idea at all about who the murderer might be, stupidly jeopardizing the life of his beloved, only following his own egocentric instincts that he now, somehow, has a feasible case hunting a man who is, at the time, not a murderer, but a policeman.Or the \"corrupt\" policeman, who has lost his innocence and faith in justice, violating every procedure rule to catch a person presumed by him to be the murderer and who may in fact be the murderer.If Sanchez is guilty or not is a matter of opinion. If he is innocent, which I doubt, the thematic contrast between Vargas and Quinlan is somehow dulled, Quinlan being altogether evil. If he is guilty, the philosophic theme of human relations is complete:Truth does not imply/lead to justice (Vargas: White Satan). Justice can sometimes only be brought through another violation (Quinlan: Dark God). When the law doesn't function, it's up to every man (Quinlan) to do what must be done. The theme is further dealt with by Sergio Leone in many a 1960'ies western.There is probably also a Freudian interpretation to the movie.Shortly explained, it deals with Vargas' relation to his own sexuality and his fear to be confronted with it. (The honeymoon theme, the explosion of the bomb when kissing, his forced  isolation of his wife, the kidnapping and sadistic treatment of his wife).In this respect, Vargas succeeds in the end, conquering his own dark passions (in the shape of Quinlan, his alter ego) and returning to his beloved.",

But I saw a much different film; a film with such amazing visuals that I would even dare to compare it to the \"Star Wars\" trio or \"Goodfellas.\"  But you know all that.  The film, at least this is the way I see it, is really about Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) and his sad fall from grace.  He's like Darth Vador---he doesn't want to be bad, but he cannot help himself, because life gave him a raw deal.  You can just say it's a film noir, but it's absolutely not...it's more of a portrait of a time and place...and Welles' career gone bad.  If you see it you'll understand what I mean.",

Quite an accomplishment to choreograph and organize everything to work how it is supposed to in that long of a shot things can go wrong and they usually require multiple takes. Another controversial point that Orson Wells brings to light in this film is the concept of interracial couples, with a Mexican husband and his new American wife.

            "content": "Only got one point to make here, about the supposed directors cut of the film released a couple of years ago : The one single change is the removal of the opening credits, pasted on top of the famous opening dolly shot, and relocating them to the end of the film. Supposedly this is the way Welles wanted it, backed up by studio memos and Welles even says as much in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich in the 60's or 70's. The only problem is what happens to the sound track. Sure, the space is filled in with plenty of appropriate background noise and the occasional burst of source music, but that opening shot lasts a long time, and there is a great chunk of it that is just empty. With the original opening music gone the sound track becomes dead, the screen becomes dead, and the poor viewer becomes deadly aware of the camera. Surely Welles would have disapproved ? The question is, if you can't do it to the exact specifications of the conveniently dead director, then isn't it better to just leave it alone ? And even if it is now exactly as Welles supposedly wanted it, it very obviously hurts the film. You can't do more damage to the audiences expectations than breaking the illusion of the story in the first 5 minutes. And as for welles insisting in the above mentioned interview that it was released all wrong, so what ? The guy had half his films taken away from him and turned into garbage by studio bosses, producers and hack-editors. Of course he's going to be on the defensive about every little thing. The truth is, re-editing the sound track for the opening shot weakens the film (getting rid of the credits is something else, Welles was right in that the opening shot does set up the whole story and we don't need to be distracted from it. However Welles himself admitted that the opening shot was a bit of a tour-de-force and the kind of thing that draws attention to it's self, which he said he was against. Killing the sound track does exactly that thing). I know it seems only a detail, but for people who like their moves to be movies and not displays of directorial masturbation, it's an important detail. Even the restorers introduction at the beginning of the film has that film-academic attitude about it. Okay, the real point of the argument is : Will studios please stop tampering with good movies just so they can get a re-release and make a buck. (a side note in response to someone who complained about the title of the film : It was supposed to be called Badge of Evil, which makes a bit more sense, but the studio decided they knew better ...Jesus Christ, i think this review means I'm a movie-anorak. Excuse me while i go slit my wrists in shame).",

The cinematography is simply fantastic including the iconic opening scene and the clever use of shadows and single-source lighting. This technique creates a very eerie and dangerous vibe about certain scenes and keeps Welles' character intimidating. However, the plot left me sort of disappointed, especially the inclusion of a love story, as almost all movies include. I feel as if Welles believed a love story needed to be included but Susie wound up being nothing more than a plot device to keep Vargas on the case. Yet at the same time I do appreciate that a love story didn't dominate a good cop vs bad cop drama. Considering how this film is a \"B\" movie, it is very impressive and worth the watch.

For example the opening scene where its dark and the guy has the bomb in his hand and you see his shadow scurry against the wall as he runs over and places it underneath the car. All the wide-shots were perfectly done and the acting was good too, especially the obese cop haha.

Weren't there any Mexicans available at a much cheaper rate? The plot was obvious and manipulative, making me think too many times, \"Why did he/she do that? It makes no sense.\" And the central conceit of the film, that intuition can be excused in the pursuit of justice, that an intuitive man (Welles) is always better than a rigid man (Heston) is despicable when those men have the legal power to kill. I can only suggest readers avoid this.The use of music is of the quality of an Elvis Presley film, being largely diegetic (emanating from within the world of the film) and crude. In one excruciating scene set in a hotel, the music which seems to be from an unseen radio eventually is made to seem so loud that it dominates the entire street outside. Another one has a pianolo in a fortune teller's shop, which for some reason she lets play on a repeating loop constantly, something that would in reality be maddening. Critics excuse these poor directorial choices by claiming the film is a fantasy, citing as evidence for this the by-then-stale tricks and tics from Welles like wide angle lenses.There are far better films from any era.

As for Touch of Evil:  it has interesting direction and camera work, and excellent set design, and a performance by Welles that is both subtle and hammy at the same time....  the rest of the film is a mixed bag.   Much of the supporting cast and cameo players do adequate or better jobs, but anyone who believes Heston (not a great actor in the best of his performances) as a Mexican must never have heard Spanish spoken before (or thinks Dubya is \"fluent\").  His command of the language is pathetic!  The story is B-movie tripe.  The ending makes little sense if we are to believe this bad cop was clever enough to frame people for years without getting caught.  My best explanation is that many \"geniuses\" do their best work early, and they seem to lose touch with the times in which they live.  They don't evolve in the same pace as society, but rather evolve within the world that was present at the time of their breakthroughs.  As an example, consider Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, which might have been shocking if released 30 years earlier, but seemed quite silly in a world where Will & Grace is everyday fare.",

It's referenced jokingly in the first 15 minutes of the movie twice by Quinlan when he says (paraphrasing) \"You don't sound like a Mexican\" at the scene of the flaming car, and \"She doesn't look Mexican either\" in reaction to seeing Susan for the first time. Welles is basically saying look, we all know Vargas is played by a gringo, so let's get the laughs about it out of the way and then accept it for the sake of the story.The black & white photography was beautiful. The scene with Susan, Grandhi, and Quinlan in the hotel room with the flashing neon light providing slow, intermittent illumination was way more memorable for me than the famous long take at the beginning.It's just a shame the movie as a whole isn't more unified, no doubt due to the editing and re-shooting done by the studio without Welles' consent or involvement. Still, the picture taken as a whole just works as a darker than dark suspense film thanks to the knock out acting and direction by Welles.",
