            "content": "It's a shame Charle Laughton, the distinguished actor, didn't direct more films. As he clearly indicates with \"The Night of the Hunter\", he had a rare gift for guiding a production into achieving greatness. This film, which didn't receive the attention it got when it was released, has turned out to be something discerning movie fans saw from the start, a classic.Charles Laughton was basically a man of the theater, then came the movies, but he was at heart someone who was equally at ease working on the stage, or performing in front of a camera. Mr. Laughton undertook to direct this screen play written by another distinguished American writer and critic, James Agee, based on the David Grubb's novel.The result is a magnificent film about to what extreme a man will go in order to steal from two young and innocent children something their father had left for them in trust. The evil character of Harry Powell, a charlatan preacher taking advantage of poor and unsophisticated country folk, is one of the best creations in the novel. Harry Powell doesn't care what he must do to get his hands in the money. He marries the children's mother, a widow who was hoping for some happiness in her life, only as part of his overall scheme of things.The film is a poetic account of the story with great emphasis on the kindness the children receive at the end from Rachel Cooper, a woman with a heart of gold who took John and Pearl into her home when they needed it.Robert Mitchum is the evil Harry Powell. It's without a doubt, one of Mr. Mitchum's best screen work. As guided by the director, the actor gives a performance that still surprises whoever watches the film for the first time. Shelley Winters plays Willa, the widow who can't sense the danger connected to the man she marries. Lillian Gish is another luminous presence in the film because she projects no-nonsense kindness and sweetness toward the children she takes into her home.The film also is enhanced by the brilliant black and white cinematography by Stanley Carter. The film still shows a pristine look fifty years after it was released. Also, the musical score of Walter Shumann adds another layer in the film's texture.\"The Night of the Hunter\" is ultimately a work of art that moves the viewer because of the tremendous work its director, Charles Laughton, gave to the movie.",

            "content": "'The Night Of The Hunter' is recognized by most critics and hard core film buffs as one of the most extraordinary movies ever made, but sadly it's still frequently overlooked by the many movie fans, probably because it's so difficult to categorize. Yes, it's a thriller but it's also a child's nightmare. A Noir but also a fable. Robert Mitchum gives one of his very best performances as Harry Powell, the charming but evil preacher with \"love\" tattooed on one hand, \"hate\" on the other. Powell is one of the most memorable screen villains of all time, and 'The Night Of The Hunter' is worth watching just for Mitchum, who is mesmerizing.  Shelley Winters is surprisingly effective as the widow Powell woos, Peter Graves has a small role at the beginning as her first husband, and Lillian Gish plays the saintly Ms. Cooper, guardian of unwanted children.  Because this movie isn't set in isn't the \"real world\" many viewers don't know exactly how to react to it. Charles Laughton's small town America is a stylized, dreamlike place, in some ways not unlike David Lynch's twisted world depicted in 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks'.  It also reminds me of Flannery O'Connor's Gothic South in her classic novels 'Wise Blood' and 'The Violent Bear It Away'. Some of the scenes involving Powell menacing Winters' children deliberately invoke James Whale's 'Frankenstein', and the sequence depicting the children's journey down the river is charming but blatantly artificial. While I'm a big fan of \"outsider\" film makers like Russ Meyer, Coffin Joe and Alejandro Jodorowsky, I also greatly admire those who work within the system but still manage to subvert Hollywood with doses of surrealism. I'm thinking of movies such as 'Kiss Me Deadly', 'Shock Corridor' and 'The Manchurian Candidate'. Each of these films are unique but they also remind me of each other and of 'The Night Of The Hunter'. I highly recommend them all and wish that there were a lot more movies like them today. 'The Night Of The Hunter' is essential viewing for anybody interested in American movies!",

I remember watching this as a child and being quite disturbed by how nasty people can be. I've watched it several times since and the most recent viewing left me thinking I'd just watched a promotion for a church or some such religious organisation, so intense was the in your face piety of the dialogue and direction - which didn't enhance the experience if I'm honest.",

            "content": "No subtlety here. Robert Mitchum plays a phony minister who has gotten wind of a stolen fortune from a condemned man in prison. The movie then launches into a obsessed assault on two children who know where the money is. He is one of the most complex villains in the history of the cinema. He is totally in control of every scene. Everyone buys into his gig and he uses religion to get what he wants. The young boy knows what the man is and protects his sister (a major task because she is totally clueless and innocent). When Mitchum kills the children's mother, slashing her throat shortly after their marriage, the kids take off down the river. The story is allegorical as the two try to find their way to freedom. Mitchum doesn't give up, but meets his match in Lillian Gish, who has taken the kids in. One of my favorite things about this movie is the strange screams that emanate from Mitchum when he is frustrated or in danger. He is so cocky and quirky that it's hard to imagine anyone falling for his hoo haw. See this for the incredible camera work especially. Some of the finest scenes in black and white cinematography are present here, particularly the use of shadows.",

            "content": "Just before John Harper's father is captured by police, he tells his son where he has hidden the money.  While in prison for his crime, he sleep talks and betrays himself to the religiously unhinged Rev Harry Powell. Powell leaves jail with Harper dead in his cell and sets out to infiltrate the family and get the money.  However, when he kills John's mother, he and his sister go on the run from him.One of these `hindsight is 20/20' films that gains a reputation with time, this film deserves the praise in gets in many areas and deserve to be very fondly remembered, or at least a lot more fondly than it was received by critics and audiences of the time.  The plot is basic but full of religious imagery that works very well, whether it's Powell's twisted preacher or the runs of scripture that many of the characters cling to.  The film presents itself with a very strong tone of foreboding and darkness that makes the material (and characters) feel more dangerous.Most of the credit for this belongs with Laughton as director, who uses shadow really well and frames the film with clever shots.  Some that come to mind is the shadow of Powell on his horse on the horizon, or the woman in the car underwater and so on.  It stills feels clever and inventive now so it must have been seen as very different in the fifties.  How he didn't win an Oscar, I'm not sure \u0096 wonder what else was up in this year.Mitchum is tremendous in the title role, his role is larger than life and was also slightly playing with fire in it's portrayal as a reverend as corrupt or evil.  Chapin is really wonderful as young John and has a much better character than some of the others in the cast.  Winters is good in her performance.  The only downside of the film is the 10 minutes at the end which feel like they are a happy ending that has just been tacked on and doesn't fit with the tone of the film.Other than that, this is a very strong film in terms of theme, plot, acting and cinematography.  It deserves more than it got at the time and I'm glad that modern audiences are finding this film all the time.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton had only one choice to pay the role of psycho-reverend- conman for his adaption of Night of the Hunter and it was Robert Mitchum. When he's on the screen Mitchum fills it with malevolence.It's an unusual part for Mitchum. Usually he's terse and laconic in films, but as Harry Powell he's just full of words. Of course he doesn't mean anything he says, but he's just a fountain of speech in Night of the Hunter. Mitchum as he did later on in Thunder Road drew from his hobohemian background of the open road to get his characterization of the Reverend Harry Powell.Powell who marries and murders women after robbing them blind has more than 25 to his credit in the backwoods of the Ohio river country in West Virginia and Kentucky during the Depression years. But he gets arrested for stealing a car and gets 30 days in jail. Mitchum gets thrown in the same cell as Peter Graves who robbed a bank and killed two people. Graves before he's caught gave the loot to his son Billy Chapin with a promise not even to tell their mother because she's not too swift. How right he's proved to be.After Graves is hung, Mitchum finishes his sentence with the intention of wooing and marrying widow Shelley Winters. She falls for his line as does her little girl Sally Jane Bruce. But young Billy spots Mitchum for a phony from the gitgo.The children are in for a lot of heartbreak and tragedy before the film concludes. One of the things I like best about Night is the Hunter is the way Laughton graphically demonstrates the life and poverty of rural America during the Depression. The film is all seen through the eyes of the children as they begin their Huck Finn like odyssey down the Ohio river, escaping from Mitchum. According to Lee Server's biography of Mitchum, Laughton while great with the adults had no patience at all with the kids. After a while he let Mitchum actually direct Chapin and Bruce in their scenes.Lillian Gish gives one of her great performances in the sound era of her career as the farm woman who eventually takes in the kids as she does for a few others. She's there to be a contrast to Mitchum. Her actions speak her faith a lot louder than Mitchum's phony ramblings.Another role I like in this is that of Evelyn Varden. She and husband Don Beddoe employ Shelley Winters at their drug store and she's all full of concern in a showy pharisee like way for the kids. She's totally taken with Mitchum, but when he's unmasked as a phony her rage is something to see on screen.Sad that Charles Laughton didn't do more behind the camera than this one film. He and Robert Mitchum formed a mutual admiration society that lasted until Laughton passed on inn 1962. Still Night of the Hunter is a testament to that mutual admiration.",

            "review_title": "Breathtaking Imagery",
            "content": "Extraordinary, unparalleled, breathtaking ... that's how I would appraise the film's visuals, from DP Stanley Cortez. The images are all in B&W, and many have a noir design straight out of German Expressionism. Sharp angles, high-contrast \"hard\" lighting, and deep shadows amplify form, or rather distort reality, and as such project human experience as an exaggeration of the emotional.Some of the images in \"The Night Of The Hunter\" are so enthralling that they will live on in the collective mind as long as cinema exists. Who can forget that famous underwater scene wherein a dead woman's body sits upright in a car with her hair flowing along the current like seaweed, accompanied by background music that is so dreamlike? One of my favorite images is the one wherein Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) lies in blissful repose on a bed as Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) stands by a window in an unadorned room with angular walls that slope upward, as if in a church.One of the most haunting, and famous, sequences has the two children, John and Pearl, in a rowboat, as they make a Homeric odyssey down a river, lorded over by giant spider webs, frogs, and rabbits. And then there's that electrifying scene with Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) in silhouette, sitting in a chair, holding a shotgun, as Harry Powell sings \"Leaning On The Everlasting Arms\". Cinematic brilliance extraordinaire!Consistent with its expressionistic visuals, the story is presented from the POV of a child's nightmare. John and Pearl symbolize innocence, and the bogeyman comes in the form of an adult, a godlike man who cons the gullible townsfolk including the children's mom. Our good reverend Powell is less interested in saving souls than he is in finding all that loot stashed away somewhere. Thus, the film's underlying theme is at least as relevant now as it was fifty years ago; the film has not aged one bit.Production design is sparse, true to the film's visual style and to the setting in Depression era West Virginia. The casting is perfect. Robert Mitchum has just the right look and voice for the part of Harry Powell. I like how he calls to John and Pearl ... \"chill-drenn?\" Lillian Gish is well-suited to represent ... reality.And those two kids likewise are ideally cast. Love the way Pearl, with her round face and those rag-a-muffin curls refers to herself, in that Southern drawl, as \"Pell\". And the film's horror combines with humor in many scenes, one of which has \"Pell\" sitting on the ground with scissors in hand nonchalantly cutting up paper currency into paper dolls.Acting is generally exaggerated, again consistent with what one would expect in a nightmare. Evelyn Varden, as Icey Spoon (love that name), hams it up in a gossipy, mother hen sort of way. And Shelley Winters effectively jitters her way through the film, ghostlike, her character lost in delusion.The film's original score is haunting and mournful, and could hardly set a more appropriate tone: \"Dream little one, dream; dream my little one, dream; oh the hunter in the night fills your childish heart with fright; fear is only a dream; so little one dream\".With its brilliant photography, its unpopular but deeply truthful theme, and its nightmarish story, Charles Laughton's \"The Night Of The Hunter\" is high up on my list of twenty best films of all time.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter sees Robert Mitchum play a corrupt preacher in a well-done atmospheric thriller that gets increasingly confused as it draws to its overdue conclusion.The first half is fantastic. It's shot brilliantly, the use of shadow and contrast very effective (although perhaps easy in a black and white film), and it is well acted for the most part. Mitchum plays his role brilliantly, and even the children play their parts well, but some of the older actors are guilty of over-eagerness and put in comically \"hammy\" performances. The score is guilty of being similarly over the top; as it announces Mitchum's entrance, there's no doubt that you really aren't supposed to like him. But it is unfair perhaps to criticize it for sticking to the styles of the times.The second half is a different matter, as the children run away to escape the evil preacher's clutches. From this point onwards it turns into a form of social commentary (\"Gee, look at the problems they had back then\"), complete with seasonal workers and a sort of orphanarium. On top of the theologizing such a message is a bit unnecessary and only serves to slow down the film's pace and delay it's inevitable conclusion. It even turns into a TV Christmas movie of sorts before announcing its end, and such an off-key conclusion spoils the great work put in in the first half.Overall, it's very good and is definitely worth watching, with some good performances and cinematography, but as it draws towards its slow end and Christmas scenes you'll be left wondering what might have been.",

            "content": "I still hear the lullaby singing sweetly in my head, like a hazy, haunting dream that won't go away.From the opening scene of the beautiful Lillian Gish and her children, watching over the world in a starry sky, this movie just sinks you into a mesmeric fairy tale land.  The camera takes us down in one sweeping move to a scene of children playing, a hot sunny day, and right to the feet of a murder victim.  And that sweet music turns on us like a twisted nightmare as the scene chases after a car speeding along a country road to find one of movies worst villains. Charles Laughton, in sadly his one and only stab at directing, created a masterpiece of horror with Night of the Hunter.   The moments of sugar coated sweetness only make this movie even more disturbing as you wonder how the two can inhabit the same world. Mitchum is terrifying.  More-so in a town full of simple folk ready to match him up with the local widow who needs a father for her lit'le n's. Its like he's walked into the middle of a Frank Capra movie and he's going to do what he wants to. This is not just a great horror movie,  but an artist achievement to rival Welles' Kane.  The river scene is one of many moments of pure visual splendor.  And that sound track just keeps drifting alone, as if trying to coax you into slumber, till the singing madman of your nightmares comes over the hill, relentless.  \"Chil-dren, Come along now\"You don't watch this movie, it watches you. ...Hush, Lit'le ones, Hush.",

I had previously caught a snatch of it while channel surfing cable TV, and saw enough in about 30 seconds to realise that this was worth watching through if I got the chance.I could barely speak at the end of the film. Pauline Kael called it one of the scariest movies ever made, and she was absolutely right. Robert Mitchum becomes the embodiment of evil, and his pursuit of the children is so relentless, and so menacing, that it becomes impossible to believe that they can escape. The images are brilliant; there's a depth to black and white that colour somehow lacks, and it is used superbly here to create a sense of brooding terror.I didn't mind the homily at the end. Like everything else in the film, it is done with utter conviction, and this makes it work. Charles Laughton saw it as the indispensable conclusion to the film, and the strength of his belief makes it indispensable.The images are so much part of the film that it must lose a great deal on the small screen, although my minimal exposure to it in that environment showed that it was still well worth watching, but if you get a chance to see it in a cinema, jump at it.",

Expressionism vs. naturalism, fable vs. social commentary, dream vs. reality, convention vs. experiment. Yet somehow these disparate elements not only hold together, they soar together, into film making heights. I'm almost tempted to say miraculously so, because on paper such opposing styles would seem to resist any kind of meaningful synthesis. Yet there it is, on the screen, an almost seamless work of movie-making art. After so many reviews - a testament to Hunter's mesmerizing effect - there is little left to say. Except to observe that if the film's brain is Director Laughton, and its eyes Stanley Cortez, then its heart (which is considerable) comes from screen writer James Agee. Literary conscience of the Great Depression, Agee makes of this modern day fairy tale a moving tribute to children of all times who have had to struggle against forces so much bigger and more knowing than themselves. Cast adrift in an alien world, they can only hope for the best, which amounts to trusting in the presence somewhere of a benevolent force to protect them. John and Pearl are lucky. Other children as Agee well knew are not so lucky. In an odd way, this is a conscionable movie about spiritual compassion that Hollywood too often turned into emotional mush, but not here. Too bad this neglected masterpiece was not so recognized during Laughton's lifetime.",

He manages to get home and gives the money to his children, John and Pearl. They hide it in Pearl's favourite rag doll and he tells them not to tell anybody else, including their mother, about it. Shortly afterwards he is arrested and sentenced to hang. In prison he tells his story to his cellmate, Harry Powell. Powell professes to be a preacher but he preys on women who he murders for their savings. After Ben is executed and Powell's short sentence ends he heads off to befriend Ben's widow, Willa. Everybody except John takes an immediate liking to Powell. It isn't long before Powell marries Willa and soon after that he starts pressuring John to find where the money is hidden. Things soon get very dangerous as Powell will go to any length to get the money.After over sixty years this film is still gripping and manages to provide some real surprises for the first time viewer. Robert Mitchum manages to be both plausible and genuinely menacing as the evil Powell. The innocent town where the Harpers live certainly isn't ready for a man like Powell. Shelley Winters is solid as Willa and Lillian Gish impresses as the woman who ultimately helps the children. Young Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce are also good in the roles of John and Pearl respectively. Director Charles Laughton did a fine job building the tension, creating the right atmosphere and providing some moments that are surprisingly disturbing for a film of this era. Overall I'd say that this is a must see for any fans of classic cinema in general and certainly for fans of film noir.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.One thing I am learning in my study of films: a film can be important and bad. By important I mean that films are largely about other films, with a few here and there establishing new elements of the visual grammar. That grammar - both in what is says and how it says it - has a profound influence on how we think about ourselves and life in general. This film is important in the sense that it establishes - or purely expresses - many elements of that visual grammar in a highly stylized manner. But in doing so, it is so exaggerated, so blunt, so studiously unnuanced that it any other context it would seem campy. The war between the hands already is camp, post-Strangelove.Watch this and marvel at the economy: the phallic train, the sledgehammer score, the use of song, the exploitation of the child's face, the monosyllabic sky.Every element is refined into an image and blared, save one: the Tuesday whoring of Ruby (casually forgiven).Incidentally, the anti-man theme is a little off-putting. Men are drunks (Steptoe), sexually obsessed (the blase townsboys), nitwits (Spoon), fatally mistaken (Harper), remote (Cooper's son) or just plain evil (Powell). Our relation to the film is intended to be just as the relationship of Pearl to the doll, exclusively maternal (and full of unfulfillable promise).I'm putting this on my `recommend' list, not because it is remotely enjoyable, but as an example of visual storytelling - albeit offensively banal.Kael, who judges films as if they were amusement park rides, calls this `noir,' which is to my mind a profound misunderstanding. A noir film is always set in a universe with a capricious fate, beyond the logic of religion (or anything else). This film is as far from that as one can get: the universe here is one run by simple biblical justice.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

I also liked this movie because of the plot which I found simply outstanding. In addition this I have to mention that the interpretation of Robert Mitchum who played as Harry Powell was very good and I believe that also the interpretation of Peter Graves who played as Ben Harper was equally good.Lastly I have to say that \"The Night of the Hunter\" is a great movie to watch because it makes you understand how people change when money is on the table. There you can see and observe their true faces and how they react on it. After watching this movie I believe that you will reconsider many things about money because this movie shows us that the most important thing in life is not the money but the human relationships and the people who we love and they love us back.",

            "content": "This film is way ahead of its time, not only in subject matter but also in cinematic style. The subject is a psychopathic preacher who believes that God is telling him to murder women, usually widowers, and take their money.From the opening two shots and the first few lines of the preacher, the characters history and intent is laid down. As quickly, the first few scenes with the children show the circumstances that will bring about the main premise. After that you are allowed to wallow in Robert Mitchums role as the over acting preacher. Laughton directs very well, with some visually rich scenes and wonderful shots. However, there are a couple of cheesy moments of dialogue, and a few, almost laughable, scenes. Despite this it's a very good movie with some stunning acting from Robert Mitchum.",

            "content": "Wonderful direction by Charles Laughton. The movie is based off the 1953 novel of the same name by Davis Grubb, tells the story about a corrupt reverend-turned-serial killer, Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who uses his charms to woo an unsuspecting widow, Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) and her two children, Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) & John (Billy Chaplin) in an attempt to steal a fortune hidden by the woman's dead husband. The novel and film draw on the true story of Harry Powers, hanged in 1932 for the murders of two widows and three children in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Loosely based on it, Davis Grubb add his own sinister turn to it, making Harry Powell into a more frightening character by making a priest out of him. He can be both smooth and charming, while misogynist, opportunist, and evil, all at the same time. Robert Mitchum is great as a roaming preacher with blood on his hands. The acting for the most part is pretty good. Still, it can go a little 'over the top'. I don't know why Mitchum hate working with Shelley Winters as I found her acting to be well-done. I have to give mad praise to Lillian Gish as Rachel Cooper, a tough old woman who looks after stray children. The stand-off between them were amazing. The war of wills between Mitchum and Gish is the heart of the film's final third, a masterful blend of horror and lyricism. Mitchum's character professes to be a preacher, he assumes the role of the spiritualist, acting as the literal \"wolf in sheep's (or shepherds) clothing\". Lillian Gish's character is the actual spiritualist, her spirituality is evident in her course of actions, rather than her words and appearance. Even the children actors were pretty good. It's hard not to break down crying when Powell yells at Pearl. She was so charming. Even, the actor that did John, had a few good scenes. The arresting scene is one of them. Still, the film lost its menacing premise, when a ten year old and old woman can outwit the wily psychopath. It might be a real stretch of the imagination. It's make worst when the Preacher is made out to be an idiot, some scenes. Even his scream about getting hurt is over the top cartoony. It's such a high-pitched whooping sound that you would hear from a Three Stooges short film, not a horror movie. Still, it's a well written, creepy-as-hell Appalachian Gothic with a lot of symbolism. I love the symbolism of the pocket knife suddenly springing out during a peep show. Excellent way of highlighting the pathological repression driving the character. Add the line, 'There are too many of them... I can't kill a world!' with his look of disinterest & disgust. The stylized dialogues are the best. There are too many quotes that worth remember about. Some great examples are the love and hate tattoo speech. You got movie magic with how it was written. Even the camera shot of the owl and rabbit scene had so much depth. The whole river dream sequence was so surreal shot by Stanley Cortez, the cinematographer. While, it did look cheap-looking, it was unbelievably magical, scary, poignant and, well, a little unreal. It's not even slightly \"realistic\", yet it's truthful in a way that all great art aspires. Laughton drew on the harsh, angular look of German expressionist films of the 1920s. The film was shot in black and white in the styles and motifs of German Expressionism, having bizarre shadows, distorted perspectives, surrealistic sets, odd camera angles to create a simplified and disturbing mood that reflects the sinister character of Powell, the nightmarish fears of the children, and the sweetness of their savior Rachel. Due to the film's visual style and themes, it is also often categorized as a film noir. You get that feeling of abandonment - of hope mixed with dread. It did captures it so very well. It moves me deeply every time I see it. The film's score, composed and arranged by Walter Schumann in close association with director Laughton, features a combination of nostalgic and expressionistic orchestral passages. Grimmification of known bible verses and children's songs were used to eerie effect. The film has two original songs by Schumann, \"Lullaby\" (sung by Kitty White) and \"Pretty Fly\" (originally sung by Sally Jane Bruce but later dubbed by Betty Benson). A recurring musical device involves the preacher making his presence was by singing the traditional hymn \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms.\" The movie really push against the Hays Codes are the time. There was a very convincing drowning murder scene that nearly got the movie, pulled. Another one is the treatment of children. Even The Hays Code insisted at the time, that the children on film must be all right at the end. Overlooked when it was first release, The Night of the Hunter is now regarded as a classic. Sadly, Director Laughton never did directed another film. The film was remade in 1991 as a TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain, but it's not as good as this version. In 1992, The Night of the Hunter was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress got preservation in its National Film Registry. The movie later influence directors such as David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, and others with their works. Not only that, but villains were based on Mitchum's performance as Powell, such as Kane from Poltergeist II: The Other Side and Caleb from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Even The Simpsons' Sideshow Bob gets in on the action in one episode. Also, the movie became the inspiration for music songs from The Clash 'Death or Glory', or Thirty Seconds to Mars song of the same name. Overall: This movie is a classic masterpiece of suspense, horror and thriller. A must watch for any horror fan.",

            "content": "Night of the Hunter, The (1955) **** (out of 4) Robert Mitchum gives one of his greatest performances as Harry Powell, one of cinemas greatest villains. In the film Powell is a crazed preacher who marries a woman (Shelley Winters) knowing that her kids know the whereabouts to some money that their now deceased father has hidden somewhere. The psychotic Powell will stop at nothing to find where the money is hidden and that includes murder. It's funny to think that critics hated this movie when originally released and that people didn't go to the theater to see it. Today this film is rightfully considered a classic and it certainly deserves that label because it's without question one of the greatest suspense films ever made. It's rather amazing that Laughton was a first time director here because he hits so many right notes that I'm sure his old boss, Alfred Hitchcock, would have been impressed. What works so well is that many thrillers have a very thick atmosphere but this one here instead has a very cold one. This is the type of film that your body will just get chills because of the coldness and all the situations and the bleak nature of the story. I think in a lot of ways this film is an attack on religion as a whole and the rather perverse look at it and Mitchum's character really makes the film a very cold one to watch. The film doesn't have items jumping out at you but instead it just builds up this coldness from start to finish and really delivers three extremely intense sequences as the story unfolds. The black and white cinematography is a character of its own as is the brilliant music score by Walter Schumann. Then we have Mitchum and his downright masterful performance, which one could argue as being one of the greatest in the history of motion pictures. Not only does he make Powell extremely creepy but he also does a great job in some of the black comedy that gets thrown in. Mitchum is downright chilling in scenes like the wedding night one but he can also be extremely powerful in ones like the \"Love/Hate\" one. Even if Mitchum isn't saying anything his character has so much energy that you can feel him breathing on your neck. Winters is also excellent in her small role as are Peter Graves, Billy Chain, Sally Jane Bruce and Evelyn Varden. A lot of credit should also go to Lillian Gish who has some rather silly dialogue to speak at times yet she makes it seem realistic and really makes it work. It's a real shame that this film was hated so badly at the time of release that Laughton would pretty much retire from directing movies. It's doubtful he'd ever make something as great as this but who knows what else he could have done.",

            "content": "The crickets are chirping amid the stillness of what must be a balmy summer night. Bathed in moonlight sits an old farmhouse, its high gabled roof and slatted walls shining brilliantly against the dark outline of a quaint picket fence. And there, in sharp silhouette is the slim figure of the Hunter perched on a tree stump facing the house, conveniently dappled in shadows from a nearby oak. He slowly begins to croon a smooth a cappella rendition of \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms,\" his baritone voice filling the night air with dread and premeditation. Also cloaked in shadows is old Rachel Cooper, sitting in her chair on the screened porch breathing silently, ever vigilant, staring towards the voice piercing the darkness, her shotgun laid ready across her lap. Perhaps they can see one another, perhaps not. As the Hunter once again sings the refrain, Rachel even joins him in canon, the blend of their voices beautiful but eerie, ancient foes locked in eternal conflict, watching and waiting. Suddenly, the night dissolves in an instant as the screen covering the porch clots with blazing reflected light--a child has innocently approached Rachel with a burning candle, not realizing the mortal significance of the stalemate she has disrupted. Rachel frantically blows out the flame, but it is too late: the Hunter has vanished from his perch, and surely lurks invisibly somewhere close in the darkness, anywhere, everywhere, waiting with a patience as old as time. Rachel gazes into the abyss and hears the echoed hoot of an owl. The owl too is perched on a tree, his snowy blank face like a mask, imperial and emotionless, floating disembodied in the night. He shakes his feathers and spies a lone young rabbit scurrying clumsily on the ground. When the rabbit screams, Rachel's expression falls in weary recognition, her large eyes sad, and she says to herself, \"it's a hard world for little things.\"In The Night of the Hunter, it is indeed a hard world for little things. To siblings John (Billy Chapin) and little Pearl Harper (Sally Jane Bruce), it must seem like an unending nightmare fraught with immense evil and unspeakable loss. That their world is so mesmerizing and beautiful for us should almost make us feel guilty if this was not the work of fiction that it is.John and Pearl seem like ordinary kids growing up somewhere in rural West Virginia along the Ohio River Valley during the depression. Their father, Ben (Peter Graves), robs a bank for ten thousand dollars, kills two people in the process, and before his children's eyes hides the money, is arrested, and is subsequently convicted. It so happens that his cell mate, Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), is a prolific but opportunistic serial killer of widows who is nabbed for stealing a car, the full extent of his crimes apparently unknown to authorities. Tattooed alternately along the knuckles of his hands are the words \"L-O-V-E\" and \"H-A-T-E\", and it is not a coincidence that the hand that holds his ever-present switchblade is labeled \"HATE\". He saves that hand for women in particular. He has adopted the nickname \"Preacher\", professing a religion he and the Almighty \"worked out betwixt us.\" Though Preacher wheedles and begs, Ben Harper takes the secret location of the ten thousand dollars he stole to his grave when he is swiftly executed by the state.Preacher is not a subtle character, but upon his equally swift release, he is somehow able to dupe just about everyone into believing that he is actually a former prison chaplain who bonded with the late Ben Harper before his execution. With a broad swagger, he ingratiates himself into the lives of not only his ex-cellmate's children, but prominent members of their gossipy tight-knit community, and even their mother Willa (Shelley Winters). His masquerade is so persuasive that in almost no time at all Willa accepts his hand in marriage (the one tattooed \"LOVE\", no doubt).Of course, the markings professed on his right hand are a lie: Preacher is not interested in love, or Willa, or anything except the ten thousand dollars Ben Harper hid somewhere. Willa doesn't know or care where the money is, and indeed, is only interested in love. At the conclusion of a marriage possibly even shorter than its courtship, Willa sits bolt upright tied up behind the wheel of her car at the bottom of the river, her hair flowing gloriously amongst the long river weeds, a deep, jagged slash across her throat.Preacher knows the newly orphaned children are the key to the money, but when they narrowly escape his clutches and sail down the river, the cat and mouse game really begins. Preacher becomes the titular Hunter, and his obsessive pursuit of young John and Pearl leads us through an odyssey of astonishing beauty and madness. Along the way, an elderly lady named Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) becomes their protector, proving herself an unlikely but ultimate adversary to Preacher, a woman who is as committed to goodness as he is boundless evil.Charles Laughton directed The Night of the Hunter at the height of his acting career. It was the first and only film he ever directed. Upon release, it was widely considered a failure, but today is often lauded as one of the best films ever made. Following a basic Southern Gothic formula, The Night of the Hunter is a savage antithesis to the preachy moralizing and sentimental pedagogy of To Kill a Mockingbird. The Preacher is no Atticus Finch, but the reverse is equally true.The Night of the Hunter has a special place in my heart due to its heightened characterizations and a visual aesthetic that has been charitably labeled \"expressionistic\" but is actually nothing but baroque exaggeration. Like the smooth voice of the preacher, this film is hypnotic, casting a spell of affection it may not entirely deserve. There is something profound and exhilarating watching The Night of the Hunter for the first time--the scenes where the children glide down a shimmering river fill me with thrill and mystery, and the silhouette of the preacher riding a lone horse along the glowing horizon singing his hymn with patient omniscience stills the very blood in my veins. Too canny to be classified an avant-grade experiment (a la Eraserhead) and too dreamy to totally suspend disbelief, The Night of the Hunter is a startlingly gorgeous work of art that challenges us to find good in the face of evil, beauty within ugliness, and light in the darkness.",

            "content": "To Roger Ebert, 'The Night of the Hunter' is one of the Great Movies. To Pauline Kael, it's \"one of the most frightening movies ever made.\" To me, well... it's neither. It definitely has its moments. Brilliant actor Charles Laughton's one and only directorial effort is a very offbeat, stylized film that takes a lot of chances. Unfortunately, not many of them work. The main problem I think is that the story it tries to tell is at odds with the presentation and performances. The latter suggest a kind of Twilight Zone-ish children's fable, dreamlike at times, not meant to resemble real life. And yet the story reminds one more of another film starring Robert Mitchum, 'Cape Fear;' gritty, realistic, even mean-spirited. The two just don't blend together into an effective whole. There is humor here and it is perhaps the most effective part of 'The Night of the Hunter.' Small town religion and Americana circa 1930 are spoofed throughout, sometimes pretty heavy-handedly, but it's hard not to laugh when Shelley Winters' character exclaims, \"I feel clean! My body's a-quiverin' with cleanliness.\" Winters herself looks like she can barely keep from laughing after delivering the line. Mitchum has his share of funny moments too. It's when he's supposed to be menacing that the movie comes up short. His Preacher Harry Powell can't touch 'Cape Fear's' Max Cady in terms of malevolent creepiness. Powell is a con-artist posing as a man of God who discovers that two young siblings, John and Pearl Harper, know where $10,000 is hidden. It was given them by their now-dead father who had them swear never to reveal its whereabouts to anyone, even their mother Willa (Winters). Powell marries Willa for the express purpose of getting his hands on the money. The lack of any graphically believable violence is, in this case, a fatal flaw. When Powell finally comes after the children, his manner is more like a boogeyman in an Abbott & Costello movie than a genuinely deranged killer, which he's supposed to be. Now I know all the art-film critics would call me a numbskull for not appreciating the 'poetic' approach Laughton and his cinematographer take, but again, it just doesn't work for this kind of material. After the children escape, there is a lovely, almost surreal scene where they drift down a river in a skiff and the setting becomes even more like one in a dream or fairy tale. The art direction is beautiful and for a few moments, it is a magical film. The story takes a different direction during the last part of the movie, as John and Pearl are taken in by elderly woman, Rachel, a sort of bible-quoting, occasionally shotgun-toting Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. She runs an orphanage of sorts and protects the brother and sister when Powell comes after them, though not through any particularly imaginative means. He is eventually arrested and sentenced to hang. There are a few more bizarre scenes, such as the townspeople rising up in anger to lynch Powell once they discover his true past. They tear up a drugstore and march down the street carrying torches (as if they were going after Frankenstein's Monster) and we expect a vicious hanging scene, then the police simply smuggle Powell out a back door and drive him away. So much for the lynch mob. Rachel and the kids celebrate Christmas while Rachel spouts more homely homilies (she's got a million of 'em.) The end. Like I said, I don't know, maybe I'm completely insensitive and unperceptive but the best I can say about 'The Night of the Hunter' is that it's a very mixed bag. Billy Chapin (I wonder whatever happened to him) gives a fine performance as the boy John, who really is the character that holds the movie together. I think lurking somewhere in the myriad of ideas that make up 'The Night of the Hunter' is a great movie, but Charles Laughton just couldn't find it.",

I'm sure they were just as shocked by THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , but where as DR NO led to the most successful film franchise in the history of cinema this movie was something of a critical and commercial flop on its release . As with CITIZEN KANE on its release there seems to be a large amount of snobbery involved . Unlike today when even someone like Ben Affleck can win an Oscar for doing outside his field ( And some might ask what the hell is Affleck's field ? ) actors in those days were only expected to turn up , say their lines and go home , they surely weren't expected to do something like point a camera or make a classic movie , least of all a British leftist like Charles Laughton. Knives out for British leftists I'd say which may possibly explain why this haunting beautiful movie didn't get a single Oscar nomination , not even for obvious nominations like cinematography or director . It should also be mentioned that this movie deals with false prophets and in mid 1950s ultra conservative America no one but no one ever questioned men of the cloth in those days in case they faced accusations of being a commie agitator . This explains to a modern day audience the naive attitude of the characters towards Harry Powell in relation to a 2003 audience , times have changed both in cinema and the real world in the last 50 years and it's impossible to remember when was the last time we saw a Hollywood movie that actually had a good preacher NIGHT OF THE HUNTER seems to be best remembered for the scene where the camera follows the fisherman's point of view on the boat to the lake below , but there's several more scenes that deserve to be remembered like the opening sequence of the children's faces across the starscape ,or Robert Mitchum howling like a cartoon character after being shot or the children floating down the river and rabbits and turtles watching them pass . This last scene is very obviously studio bound but that's not a criticism , this is a very highly stylised movie who's technical aspects must have been as jaw dropping back then as LORD OF THE RINGS technical aspects wowed audiences 50 years later . The bitter irony now is that this would have picked up several Oscars -Regardless of its strengths ala BRAVEHEART - if it were made today simply because it was directed by an acto",

Jailed for driving a stolen car, he learns from his cell mate about the large sum of money he had stolen & goes after his family once he's out of prison.Co-written & directed by Charles Laughton, The Night of the Hunter really benefits from the few elements it borrows from German expressionism of the silent era like eccentric camera angles, unconventional settings, surreal photography or silhouette figures but its inclusion of stylised dialogues & unrealistic acting in a Hollywood crime-drama is also unintentionally hilarious at times.Production design work is excellent, Cinematography makes terrific use of lighting, contrast & shadows, camera placement is inventive & every frame is captured in crisp detail. Editing is brilliant for the most part but its final act also feels overstretched, and performances are a mixed bag for the kids do a pretty good job in their given roles while Robert Mitchum's expressionist act borders on hamming.On an overall scale, The Night of the Hunter is experimental cinema at its finest for it tries to merge into film-noir what influenced the genre in the first place. From a technical standpoint, the film is influential in every manner, especially the way it uses its camera to set a disturbing mood or introduce its themes but its overstretched ending, excessively dramatic lead act & depicted stupidity (or innocence) of children never allowed me to take its premise seriously.",

A boat seen through a spiderweb as it glides down a river at night. The shadow of a trespasser looming over an isolated house in the fog.Most movies are so visually drab and unimaginative, I couldn't remember a single shot if my life depended on it. Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter - the tale of an evil stepfather chasing two kids in a Bradburyan rural America - is the opposite of that, its images burning indelible in the memory of moviegoers. A splendid American Gothic noir, it looks and feels like Orson Welles filming Flannery O'Connor: bold, creative, with magnificent composition and a great use of lights and shadows. It's right there with The Touch of Evil and The Third Man for me - shame this was Laughton's only effort behind the camera.Robert Mitchum plays the Bluebeard-like, serial killer/sociopath preacher Harry Powell. He is crazy awesome in this. In his public persona, Powell is oily and smugly righteous. When his mask falls, he becomes chilling. There is a moment right before a murder where he seems to forget his victim and examines a sun ray shining on his hand. It's unspeakably creepy. And the feral scream when the kids escape on the boat is like the cry of a thwarted predator.Although he plays a loathsome character, Mitchum gets to be darkly amusing too. After hiding the corpse of his wife he spreads the rumor she ran away, then bursts out weeping in fake self-pity and, when an acquaintance patronizingly reassures him she will return, he quips \"She'll not be back. I reckon I'm safe in promising you that.\"Best of all is the scene when he leans against a tree spying the house where the kids are hiding and sings with his basso voice an inappropriately pleasant religious hymn, which he turns into his own villainous theme throughout the movie (until the last scenes, when Gish's benevolent grandmotherly figure reclaims it for the good guys). When Powell is done with the hymn, he calls mockingly: \"CHIIL-DRENN? CHIIIIL-DREN!\". Words fail to convey the sound of that. It's like a wolf snickering as it pretends to sing a lullaby. While the set-up for the final siege is tremendous, its resolution feels anticlimactic and the very ending - later referenced/spoofed by the Coens in The Big Lebowski - a bit on the nose. Still, what a treat this is.9/10",

            "content": "Robert Mitchum only received one Oscar nomination in his long acting career (Best Supporting Actor in THE STORY OF G.I. JOE) and that's an injustice because he richly deserved an Oscar nomination for his fascinating preacher in this story of good vs. evil. If the film has a fault, perhaps it's the visual style that keeps reminding us this is an artfully photographed movie filmed on a low budget inside studio sets that are a bit disconcerting at times. Also, the performances of the two children are not quite successful enough--the little girl, in particular, never sounds like anything more than a child reading lines. The boy, more appealing, seems to be performing on cue.Nevertheless, the crisp B&W cinematography is skillful in setting the proper atmosphere for this kind of suspenseful tale in which two children have promised their father not to reveal the whereabouts of a cache of money. Peter Graves has a few good early moments as their father sharing a cell with fellow inmate Mitchum, as an evil preacher bent on discovering the hidden loot.  Shelley Winters does well as the children's mother, a God-fearing woman taken in by the preacher whose only aim is to get his hands on the money. Evelyn Varden adds some genuine comic relief as a nosy neighbor who fails to see through the preacher's hold on the widow and the two children.\nThe most artful photography occurs when the children escape down the river under a star-filled sky, the boat on gleaming water as the camera pans from above to catch a silver spider web and various night creatures on the banks of the river. But it here that we sense the self-consciously artful approach that director Charles Laughton has taken--using nightmarish but artful imagery accompanied by choral backgrounds of a preacher's song. Another memorable moment is when the camera reveals the underwater corpse with the hair flowing like seaweed, an enormously effective and very artistic shot.Despite its flaws, it manages to hold us in the grip of its story until the somewhat unbelievable moment when the little boy throws himself on the preacher's captured body because it triggers the memory of his own father's capture. This seems a jarringly false note since the child would obviously be relieved to have this evil man captured.Lillian Gish as an \"old woman who lived in a shoe\" with a brood of sad children, is also somewhat offsetting at times with her interpretation seeming more theatrical than real. This is not as much of a flaw as it should be, given that the film itself fails to stay within realistic bounds at many important moments and is stylized most of the time. (Other minor flaws: Mitchum's failed attempt to catch the children as they flee up the cellar stairs is unconvincing--as is his failure to catch them when they set the boat adrift from shore.)But the most wonderful thing about the movie is Robert Mitchum's flawless performance in a role in which he uses a great deal of expressions (rather than remaining deadpan as he so often does) -- which leads to a mystifying question. Where was all this talent when he played the deadpan doctor the same year in NOT AS A STRANGER??  A monotonous performance in that film's leading male role seriously hurt the quality of the whole piece. Here he is in fine creative form and gives an inspired performance in a demanding role.Well worth seeing despite the flaws--a little too artfully contrived for its own good but haunting and impressive, nevertheless.",

            "content": "A religious maniac marries an idiotic widow and mother of two children in the hope of finding out where the $10,000 is hidden that the now executed husband and father garnered from a robbery. Upon release back in 1955, the critics of the time kicked this first directorial effort from Charles Laughton to such a degree he never directed again. Watching the film now and observing the tide of praise for it as each year goes by, one can only hope that those critics were rounded up and sent to a faraway island to learn about how to view with open heart. The Night Of The Hunter is to me quite simply one of the greatest film's ever laid down on the screen. Firstly you have to ask yourself exactly what genre the film belongs to? That alone should lead you to find out that the film is something different, even unique, because it covers so many bases. Perhaps that is what the critics back then couldn't quite fathom? Is it Crime? Is it a Thriller? Horror, Drama, Noir, even a terrifying mother goose fairytale (that last one was Laughton's terming of his masterpiece), truth is, is that it's a multitude of earthly traits masquerading as a good versus evil parable. The work on the film is as good as it gets, the direction from Laughton is sublime, his visual style alone makes the film a feast for the sharp eye connoisseur. Observe some of the cutaway sets, take in the expressionist use of shadows, an underwater sequence that is gorgeous yet terrifying at the same time. I dare you to stop the hairs on your neck standing up on end as the silhouette of Mitchum's evil preacher Harry Powell looms large over the children at bedtime. The film is full of striking images that in themselves are telling the story, witness the pursuit of the children by Powell, the children's river journey is all dreamy and calm, rabbits, frogs and spiders all are prominent to give the feeling that the kids are safe, cut to Powell all in black, cloaked in evil, always one step away from his prey, perhaps a devil in priests attire? The acting is top draw, Mitchum (in a career making role) plays it perfect, evil personified mixed with gentle panto fusion at just the right times. Lilian Gish, in what surely has to be one of the great feminine roles of all time, is precious, quite simply precious, while the children are a believable delight because Laughton has got us viewing this uncertain world through such untainted eyes. Crowning it off is the cinematography from Stanley Cortez, I can only describe it as bleakly beautiful, it impacts on the eyes as much as the head as this truly majestic piece of work unfolds. If you don't see this as a masterpiece then I urge you to watch it every year until you do. Because when it hits you, that bit that you just didn't get, it's the point when you realise why you love cinema after all. 10/10 in every respect.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton's only film is on the level with all his very memorable performances in various classics as anything from Henry VIII, Rembrandt and Nero to the hunchback of Notre Dame and a busker of London. 'The Night of the Hunter' is about a sanctimonious preacher (Robert Mitchum) who plays with knives and kills wives and other innocents. His character of extreme double standards is a devastating blow to religiousness. He gets the scent of $10,000 hidden by an executed cellmate (Peter Graves as a young man and the father of two small children with gorgeous Shelley Winters for their mother) and so beleaguers and weds the mother with disastrous consequences for her, whereupon the children run away to Lillian Gish. That's part of the story.The amazing thing about the film is the highly qualified synchronization of the direction (Laughton), the photography (Stanley Cortez at his best) and the music (Walter Schumann). They worked together exchanging ideas and sentiments, and the result is one of the most magic films ever made. The photography of Cortez, who also worked with Orson Welkles, Fritz Lang and many others, is amazing throughout, especially since most of it is nocturnal. In a color film the effects would not have been as expressive and spellbinding.Another vital point is the masterful psychology. Laughton handles his actors with expert mastership and brings out the best of them, especially the children. Billy Chapin as John is especially noteworthy with his eyes expressing more than any dialogue. No director I know has managed to catch the soul language of the eyes better than Laughton, and he was a master actor with his eyes himself.The fantastic photography makes it vital though to watch it in as high quality as possibly, not to miss perhaps the most important element of the film. Blue Ray is recommended, if possible.",

They run and fall in with kind Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish).  But is she enough to stop Harry?A definite one-of-a-kind film.  Charles Laughton directed this film (his only time as a director) and it was a huge bomb in 1955.  It's easy to see why--this film was years ahead of its time and some of it is downright horrifying. The scenes of Mitchum after the kids are truly scary.  It looks incredible (courtesy of cinematographer Stanley Cortez), has some truly bizarre (but fun) dialogue and is never dull.Mitchum is just perfect as the preacher--you see the hatred and evil right below his calm surface--when he loses control it's not pretty.  Chapin and Bruce are good as the children--supposedly Laughton couldn't stand the kids and let Mitchum direct them--turned out very well.  Gish is just superb as Mrs. Cooper--strong and loving.Basically this is a combo horror movie and fairy tale---as I've said some of it is horrific--othertimes it's breath-takingingly beautiful.  This is one of the few times I've watched a film grinning because I'm enjoying the dialogue and images so much.

            "content": "Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a psychopath posing as a preacher, is released from prison and terrorizes two children (Billy Chapin, Sally Jane Bruce) in the hope of finding out where their father (Peter Graves), another criminal hanged for murder, has stashed $10K in used banknotes.That is the basic plot of Charles Laughton's quite brilliant thriller, a combination of brilliant photography, memorable images and superlative performances that endures in viewers' minds. The film demands repeated viewings in order to appreciate its subtleties.Set during the Great Depression, the film conjures up the repressed world of a small town miles from anywhere, where the center of activity is the local ice cream parlor run by Mr. and Mrs. Spoon (Evelyn Varden, Don Beddoe). With little or nothing else to disrupt the monotony of their lives, Harry's intrusion into their lives represents a welcome diversion, especially when he appears so pious in his sentiments. This is a world where Christianity is taken to extremes; the children's mother Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) willingly submits to numerous indignities in the belief that she will be \"saved\" as a result. We, the audience, know Harry's true purpose, but he is such a convincing dissembler that he has all the citizens held in his Tartuffe-like grasp.When his true motives are exposed, the citizens turn on him like a lynch-mob; it is something of a relief to him that he will be hanged in private, without the mob's attentions. Laughton shows the consequences of religious extremism; it can not only be manipulated for self-interested purposes but it can turn supposedly godly citizens into animals baying for revenge, the kind of thing that the Bible does not teach.While much of the action is filmed in location, Laughton includes numerous sequences which make great play of light and darkness; in one of them, the screen fades to black, except for a circle of light illuminating John's petrified face as he escapes once more from Harry's clutches. In another, set at night, the sight of Harry astride a horse resembles a Karagoz, or Turkish shadow-puppet walking slowly across an otherwise all-white horizon. We are not only reminded of his capacity for evil, but understand how universal that evil actually is, transcending time and space.Stanley Cortez's cinematography contains some memorable images - of the animals in the trees at night, of a rabbit eating happily, oblivious to the impending danger of attack by an owl, and the sight of birds perched on tree-branches watching the children rowing down the river in their father's skiff. The children might be at risk, but their plight is symptomatic of the natural order of things where the weak are always victims of the strong.In the end John and Pearl are redeemed - not through their own efforts, but through the intervention of a kindly old lady Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). She understands what religion actually represents; it is not just comprised of empty words, but true belief in God and ultimate salvation. The contrast between her view and that of Harry is emphasized in another memorable sequence where both of them sing the same song - with one important difference. Harry never mentions the name of Jesus. The film ends at Christmastime with the children giving Miss Cooper a present, and Miss Cooper addressing viewers direct to camera in close-up about the importance of childhood as a time of innocence and wonder. In a fallen world dominated by exploiters like Harry, such simple traits are largely forgotten.James Agee's script is brilliant, with an acute ear for local expressions. Mitchum has never been more sinister, or more powerful, while Gish exhibits the moral (if not the physical) strength to resist him. A truly memorable, if enduringly horrifying experience.",

            "content": "Ben Harper (Peter Graves) steals $10,000 and leaves the money in the keeping of his children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce), hoping they might one day find their way out of the economic trauma of the Depression-era South. John knows where the money is hidden, but Harper has sworn him to secrecy, a move John quickly resents when posing preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) comes to town. Powell shared a cell with Harper, who, immediately after hiding the money, was arrested for murder and armed robbery. Ben is executed, and the wicked Powell, released from jail, moves in on Willa (Shelly Winters), Harper's gullible widow, hoping to draw out the secret of the money's location. As tensions mount, it becomes progressively clear that the only hope for the children's salvation rests with regional matriarch and philanthropist Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) who always keeps her doors open for displaced youngsters.It's not often that I'm stumped by the question of why a classic is a classic, but thanks to Night of the Hunter, I know it's not unthinkable. Yes, the cinematography is amazing, even by the standards of film noir, but the pace is rushed, the plot is a walking disaster, and the characters \u0096 if we can call them that \u0096 more closely resemble flotsam.The movie opens with Gish's disembodied head floating on a backdrop of stars, the drifting heads of children listening with rapt attention to her formulaic Bible-talk. Even if we grasp the intended irony of the moment \u0096 a dreamy segue into a deadly nightmare \u0096 there's no escaping how God-blastedly cheesy the image looks, how it feels more like a presage to Sesame Street or an eighties sit-com than a purportedly moving work of horror. As an intro, it destroys any precedent for subtlety. We're less than a minute into the movie and it's already abundantly clear that our storytellers have absolutely no faith in our ability to figure anything out for ourselves.The trend continues with the introduction of Harry Powell. Eschewing what could have been a very creepy experience \u0096 encountering the dark side of Powell in a slow, subtle, and action-driven manner \u0096 Powell hits us over the head with a string of didactic monologues, our occasion for discovery smashed right at the outset. Ben Harper, by contrast, is dispensed with so quickly we're barely aware of his presence. He's a completely wasted opportunity, a perfunctory McGuffin for an even more perfunctory plot. The movie would have been much more powerful if John had gone through the story haunted by the memory of a loving father who died in a desperate act to provide for him. Instead, Harper's only function is to set the story in motion, and as soon as he does this, he disappears from view and from memory.Willa Harper is even more obnoxious. A pivotal factor in the story, Willa's fanatic devotion to Powell is the main instigation of everything else that follows, but because we never get a sense of who Willa was prior to Powell's arrival, her devotion feels unfounded, her behavior seems unreasonable, and, as a consequence, everything else in the story feels like it's balancing on thin air. Why is this woman so easily brainwashed? Why does Powell consistently come out on top? Every single plot-point is, at best, the product of characters acting mysteriously, and at worst, the product of characters behaving in a manner completely opposed to reason. How an entire town can get swept up in the patently obvious lies of a figure like Powell is beyond me, especially to the extent that they side against their own. There's nothing particularly strategic about Powell's methods, nor is he notably charismatic or even all that bright. He constantly loses his temper, performs actions so rash and brainless you'd expect immediate rejoinder, and holds among his many beliefs the bone-headed conviction that the best way to track down a fugitive is to ride through open country and sing at the top of his lungs. Yet Powell always gets way, because the rest of the universe is too stupid to stop him, and it's precisely this idiocy that drives the story forward, not the heroes, and certainly not the villain.Which brings me to the last point: acting, i.o.w. what the devil is everyone smoking? I respect Robert Mitchum a great deal, but his performance as Powell is woefully over-the-top, in-your-face, and not the least bit compelling. Gish is great, but the credits start rolling before she's even gotten her feet on the ground. Shelly Winters is a tremendous actress, and she does her best as Willa, but again, the character is so poorly written that she comes across feeling like a mariner who's been thrown off the edge of a ship, floundering for all she's worth, but no match for the dead-weight of the screenplay, which drags her to the bottom and feels no remorse. Worst of all is Chapin as John, suffering from prolifically delayed reaction time, always lagging at least a second-and-a-half behind whatever he's supposed to be responding to. Expressions of shock and anger seem to come out of nowhere, a clear indication of his being taught to look and act in a particular way at a particular moment without anyone telling him why. I'm not blaming the kid for this. I'm blaming Charles Laughton, who found children so dislikable he dumped them all on Mitchum, who did his best to direct them, but was clearly not up to the punch.All in all, I'm at a loss as to why this movie continues to garner such widespread acclaim, save the unfortunate reality that the herd mentality of movie criticism discourages any kind of dissension, so we continue trumpeting the virtues of fossils, long after they've outlived their usefulness.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter (1955)Make-believe, made believable and mythic.Why Charles Laughton diverged from his gifts as an actor to play the role, just this once in a lifetime, as movie director, I don't know. But I wish he had more often. Night of the Hunter is not only a well-directed, engrossing, moving film. It's utterly original. It isn't afraid to be tender and even sentimental, and it isn't afraid to have a very bad man doing bad bad things. It has a mythic river (the Ohio, not the Mississippi, but with the same aura of escape as Huck Finn's river) that creates a flow literal and metaphoric. And it has innocent children, who do, you see, abide. Laughton puts this together visually as if we are inside a children's storybook. It's all fake like the Wizard of Oz is fake, but unlike Dorothy and her friends, these are real people facing very real consequences. Boy is this a good movie to rock the boat of evangelism. Of course, Robert Mitchum as the evil preacher is a psycho, but why can no one see it but us? Even the children don't quite know it until he starts (very quickly) abusing them. The only one who does see, right away, is the other religious icon in the film, a truly angelic older woman helping orphans in the Depression. When she hears Mitchum start to go into an eloquent (and clumsy) parable, she practically rolls her eyes. Oh, do we all love that! At last, someone who will save the day.And she does, this woman played by none other than Lillian Gish, in a role very non-silent and very compelling. This story belongs to her, really--she starts the movie off as a storyteller, before it transitions to the preacher up to no good. Mitchum's voice is in full power here, big and yet caressing until it barks. Or it sings--what a voice! Even the other characters comment on it (and yes, it's really Mitchum singing). When Gish and Mitchum meet, and maybe most of all when they sing a perfect, ethereal duet, it's like a clash of many worlds--goodness and evil, piety and charlatanism, Silver Screen and Golden Age. By the last I mean that the kind of movies that Gish made decades earlier and the kind that Mitchum was making right then are implicitly face to face. Even the false and exaggerated stage sets and lighting are more 1920s German Expressionism than film noir, though the latter is unavoidable with this kind of theme and dark style in 1955. Remember that Laughton loved the stage, and cinematographer Stanley Cortez had a long career working on dramatic films, including The Magnificent Ambersons.There are people, those used to the increasingly realistic movies since the late 1960s, who can't abide by this style of moving making, with its deliberate artifice mixed with convincing characters. The trick is to let go of the expectation that the movie is trying to be naturalistic, just as you let go when you watch Citizen Kane. The moment when Mitchum is chasing the children through the brush to the boat on the shore is key. Mitchum is taking far too long to get through the brambles, and the kids are struggling forever to just get in the boat and push off. After all this suspended franticness, the mood shifts in one heartbeat to the dark water silently carrying the kids off to safety. The girls stretches out with her doll, and the boy puts his head down on his arm.The other thing this movie does, two decades after when it is set, is provide hope against even the worst of evil. Here is the idea that life is a beautiful illustration and we just need to see it that way to inhabit it safely. There really is a Lillian Gish out there, somewhere, there must be. We just have to close our eyes and follow the river.",

            "review_title": "An interesting failure (SPOILERS)",
            "content": "I'd heard so many great things about this movie that it was a major disappointment to finally watch it.Not that it isn't an interesting film. Mitchum portrays menace perhaps better than any other actor ever (his wedding night lecture to Winters made my skin crawl), the cinematography is fascinating (and oddly reminiscent of the 1930s), and Laughton certainly had a decent eye for the striking image; the expressionistic composition of the bedroom shot where Winters is rabbiting on about their marriage while Mitchum stands at the window preparing to kill her is terrific, and the underwater shot of Winters's body is justly famous (though marred by a poor edit as the shot jumps awkwardly between too-similar POVs). I'm even willing to forgive the over-the-top acting, since it fits in well with the 30s-style filmmaking.But too much of the movie is absurdly overdirected (the opening shot of Heads In Space is just plain silly, and what is with all those shots of animals during the trip downriver?), and Mitchum seems to have a real problem with the charm which the role requires; I never for a second believed he could con anyone into thinking he was anything but a stone killer. The kiddie songs on the soundtrack are annoying and distracting, especially the one that's supposed to be sung by Pearl, who apparently sings much more articulately than she talks (by the way: \"Pearl Harper\"? Please!). And Mitchum's \"failure\" to catch the kids, first in the basement and then in the river, is utterly unconvincing.I find the kids' behavior after they flee completely implausible. This smart kid never thinks to call the cops? And when Powell passes them as they hide in the barn, it never occurs to the kid to double back and head for home, thus *increasing* the distance between them and the guy who wants to kill them? And since he's obviously following the river, wouldn't it be a pretty obvious thought, even for a kid, to get away from the river, rather than continue down it? And I didn't even think about the fact (which another review reminded me of) that these kids were carrying thousands of dollars in cash. Geez, they could hire a cab to take them somewhere.And don't you think the kid might have considered telling the nice old lady who takes them in that they're being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac, especially when he shows up at the front door? And is it really plausible that Pearl should have forgotten that he tried to kill them and run to him with open arms? And after seeing the guy chase the boy around with a switchblade, the old lady just chases him off, but doesn't call the police, even though the guy announces that he'll be back? No, she waits around for him to come back, shoots him with a shotgun, *then* calls the police! Incidentally, the police ask her the same very good question, and I don't think they'd be satisfied with the smartass answer she tries to blow them off with. I know I'm not.And Mitchum's defeat is rather an anti-climax after all that buildup about what a big, bad guy he's supposed to be.The boy's reaction to Mitchum's arrest is, as others have said, completely implausible, given that we receive no indication that the boy ever felt anything warmer than intense suspicion for Mitchum's character. He certainly does not see him as a surrogate father, which is what we are required to believe in order for the scene to make sense. And there's no way a judge would allow the prosecutor to ask the boy \"if that is the man who killed your mother.\" The boy has no direct knowledge of the crime.And you know, there's a reason most directors outside of zany screwball comedy don't have their actors address the camera: it cuts the thin thread that suspends the audience's disbelief. Another reason is that it looks really, really stupid.And the denouement is, let's face it, just ridiculous.There is too much of interest here to rate this as merely mediocre, but it is too deeply flawed to be counted a success.6/10.",

Misunderstood in his time, I guess that's why he didn't get a second chance to direct. The film is very unusual, especially at the time because it can hardly be compared to anything else. The whole movie is scary, from start to finish, but not so much because of what we see because it doesn't contain some particularly scary scenes but because of the bad and awful events that happen, and the extra weight on the scales goes because of the two little kids experiencing it all. The main villain is very striking and convincing in his role as a preacher. What bothered me personally in the film happened in the last third, I just didn't like the ending, and the whole film was kind of sad and depressing to me.",

In prison, Mr. Mitchum is blessed with cell-mate Peter Graves, who has just been sentenced to hang, for robbery and murder. Mitchum learns Mr. Graves has stashed his $10,000 haul. Mitchum correctly deduces Graves' children know where the cash is hidden; so, he sets out to marry widow Shelley Winters (as Willa Harper) and make the step-children SQUEAL\u0085 \"And a child shall lead them,\" it's said, with Billy Chapin (as John) and Sally Jane Bruce (as Pearl) fine as the terrified children. Gloria Castillo (as Ruby) and Michael Chapin (brother of Lauren and Michael) stand out, as less innocent youngsters.In hindsight, it's difficult to justify this film's relative lack of recognition, at the time of release. It's criminal. Ms. Gish's performance should have easily earned her some \"Best Supporting Actress\" honors. Stanley Cortez' photography looks especially award-worthy; his depiction of the children's journey to Gish's refuge, enhanced by Walter Schumann's music (and Kitty White's lullaby), is extraordinary. And, certainly, Mitchum's daring portrayal, and Charles Laughton's stunning directorial debut, deserved more timely recognition.The story is not without flaws; for example, it's difficult to believe, after Ms. Winters' expiration, Mitchum can't swim after the rowing children. Yet, strengths overcome weaknesses in this ultimately spectacular night. ********* The Night of the Hunter (7/26/55) Charles Laughton ~ Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish, Peter Graves",

            "content": "This is really one great movie, that is being original with its approach and execution.I would say that this is what a children's thriller would look like. The movie is being told from the perspective of the movie its two main child-characters. It has a nightmare like feeling and atmosphere and some real evil characters. Basically the movie is being made like any other thriller, with dramatic elements in it, from the same time period with as a difference that it takes another approach and tells things from a different perspective. So don't mistake this for a children's movie though. It's like \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", that is also a heavy drama, with thriller elements in it but gets mostly told from the perspective of the two young children.It's directing approach almost makes this movie seem like a surreal one at times. Like it's a nightmarish fairy tale. It's like experiencing fear from a young child's mind and perspective, who also often tend to exaggerate things and let evil things look more even more evil and dark things even darker. It's not just a thriller but also a very visually orientated movie. I think this is because director Charles Laughton mostly drew his inspiration from silent movies. I can really see some D.W. Griffith like influences in this movie, which perhaps is also a reason why he cast Lillian Gish in this movie, who worked a lot with D.W. Griffith back in the silent era. He obviously must had admired D.W. Griffith work and used some of his stylish setups and techniques for his movie. It makes this a very moody movie with some great visual style.The movie is filled with some allegories and you can interpret things different ways in it. I think it's one of those movies in which you'll discover new things, every time you see it. In essence it's a story about good versus evil, in which the evil gets masterfully personified by Robert Mitchum, as a preacher on a killer mission in life.Let me tell you that Robert Mitchum in this movie is one of the best and most evil characters to ever hit the silver screen. He is simply sublime in his role as the money crazy religious fanatic, who kills and does basically everything to get his money, even by hunting down these two little children. His role is right up there with his \"Cape Fear\" one, in which he also played an evil, scary, psychotic, unpredictable killer.The movie does have some downsides. I don't always like were the movie is going with its story, especially toward the end, that could had been written differently I think, or perhaps less rushed, with a more effective build-up to it. The movie is only about 90 minutes short, so they easily could had made it about 30 minutes longer. But well, it obviously didn't ruined a lot of the movie for me. I still really loved watching it and appreciated its different and more daring style and approach of things. Really a great movie that I would love to see watch more often.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Charles's Laughton's only film, 'The Night of the Hunter', has much to commend it: many scenes are beautifully composed, and the overall construction of the film is both and ambitious and strong.  The use of music, and the close-ups of the natural world that predate Terrence Mallick's use of similar imagery by 20 years, are maybe not as successful but also bear witness to the director's singular vision.  Unfortunately, in close-up, the film shows every one of its fifty years - and this is not a criticism of the primitive special effects and sets, but rather a condemnation of rather more important aspects: characterisation, dialogue and acting, each of which fall far short of modern standards. \nIn his time, Robert Mitchum may have been a terrifying movie villain, but his performance here is so over-the-top it's almost camp; Evelyn Varden as his mother-in-law is simply laughable, Billy Chapin tries hard as a young hero (though when he is shocked his jaw literally drops, by about two inches) while Sally Jane Bruce, as his sister, is completely wooden throughout.  There are moments when the film is so flat and corny that it almost feels like a comedy, or at least a spoof of an old movie, though there isn't anything to actually make you laugh.  The ending is typical of this enigmatic film: a partial condemnation of lynch-mob justice is followed by an extended cringe-making homily, delivered by Lillian Gish (who was better in Robert Altman's 'A Wedding', in which she played a corpse and didn't have to speak).In depicting a serial killer, 'The Night of the Hunter' is also of note as an early entry in a subsequently common genre - Mitchum went on to make 'Cape Fear', in which he similarly plays a figure of pure evil.  The line continues through to Hannibal Lecter today.  Perhaps if you like this kind of movie you'll appreciate Laughton's work more.  For those seeking a subtle meditation on the complexities of the human condition, look elsewhere.",

The problem is that despite this, the film really bogs down when the plot centers only on the children or their rescuer (Lillian Gish). At times, Gish is GREAT as a spunky old woman determined to defeat the embodiment of evil in Mitchum, while at other times her role is just too syrupy and heavy-handed. It's as if there were two films (one great and one poor) grafted together. The moments of action and suspense are great while the moralistic and preachy dialog later in the film serves to reduce the film's impact.

            "content": "This is a Ding an Sich, a thing unto itself, the only movie directed by Charles Laughton and seeming to embody his flabby and ironic presence in every scene.Everything works -- the art direction, the cinematography, Walter Schumann's score, the direction, and the performances. There has never been another movie quite like it. Some have been as good, or even better, but given the obvious budget constraints, this is about as good as it gets.I won't carry on about the plot except to say that Mitchum in a preacher/serial killer who offs Shelly Winters and, failing to pry the secret to a ten thousand dollar stash out of her two children, pursues them across a stage-bound depression landscape that makes one long for the old days and the simple life.This is probably Mitchum's best performance. He's often accused of being a simple droopy-eyed mope having trouble twisting his tongue around words of more than two syllables. Not here. He displays the full range of his instrument. His eyes pop unexpectedly open. His voice hang-glides up and down around his rural accent. (The setting is apparently Ohio, nicely evoked in the very first shot of a meandering river through flat countryside.)This is Bible-belt country, folks, as the score continually and not inappropriately reminds us. A preacher has a lot of juice in 1930s Ohio. But -- Ohh, Lord -- there is E-vil abroad in the land! One can't trust one's cell-mates in prison, let alone one's stepfather or husband. Winters gets her throat slashed and is last seen sitting in a model T Ford at the bottom of the river in an unforgettable shot with her long blonde hair streaming along with the current and the river weeds. (It's a dummy.)The two kids -- the boy old enough to understand and the girl too young to know anything of depravity -- float down the river in their rowboat, followed on shore by Mitchum on a horse, still after that ten grand. (\"Don't he ever sleep?\") The kids' passage downriver is accompanied in the foreground by a frog (nature?), a rabbit (innocence?), and a spider (everything bad?).The kids wind up at the informal orphan's home run by a no-nonsense but understanding Lillian Gish who knows how to handle a shotgun. She ultimately blasts the evil preacher, and Mitchum then gives the most animated performance of his career, whooping and jumping, barricading himself in the barn. He's never done anything like it before or since. His performance and that of Lillian Gish is as good as it gets. And Shelly Winters too should be mentioned. Who else has ever groaned so believably with horniness? She didn't get married to have her soul saved! The kids, alas, are from central casting. Too bad, because they're central to the plot -- not that they do a bad job. Just that better casting -- in appearance and demeanor -- might have made a difference.\"Children? I'm losin' my patience with you.\" You're not likely to forget this movie.One question remains to be answered. How did Charles Laughton, an English homosexual, manage to capture so well the Ohio riverside of the 1930s? I don't know. I wish Laughton had had a chance to make more films but it's hard to imagine how they could have improved upon this one.",

            "content": "First and foremost, The Night of the Hunter contains the extremely famous \"love and hate\" clip that you've probably seen in a montage or reenacted in another movie. Robert Mitchum, normally remembered for his blas\u00e9, laid-back performances, gives a fantastically energetic performance-one that was famously snubbed by the Academy in the 1955 Oscar nominations. In 1955, countless heartbreaking performances were beaten out by Ernest Borgnine in Marty, including Robert Mitchum's two finest hours: The Night of the Hunter and Not as a Stranger. In this classic thriller, Peter Graves starts the movie by leaving a lasting impression with his two young children, Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce. He's robbed a bank and killed two people, but before he's arrested, he hides the stolen money in Sally's cloth doll. Robert Mitchum meets Peter in jail and learns about the stolen money. Then, Preacher Mitchum charms his way into Peter's family, hoping to find the hidden money. His pious religious front fools everyone, including Peter's widow Shelley Winters, but there's a very dark side hidden underneath. . .I could write pages about Bob's incredible performance, but instead I'll just wholeheartedly recommend you watch the movie for yourself. He's strong yet desperate, gentle yet frightening, seductive yet cold, and one of the most memorable villains in classic history. Shelley Winters is very convincing as the weak, meek widow, and evokes an enormous amount of sympathy from the audience. Billy Chapin is very engaging, and no doubt would have been cast as Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird if he were the right age. Lillian Gish rounds out the cast, playing a tough, protective, intelligent hero. It's great fun to watch her armed with a shotgun battling against the burly Bob!Not everyone is Clint Eastwood, and back in the day, it was pretty unusual for actors to cross over and direct a feature. Charles Laughton directed this noir classic and shows remarkable talent behind the camera. He doesn't just point and shoot; he's sensitive and highlights nuances, he draws remarkable performances from his actors, and is deliberate in his movements. There's so much to appreciate about The Night of the Hunter, and I suggest you rent it-I own a copy-and watch it on a dark, spooky evening.",

            "content": "Who knew!?! Charles Laughton, the distinguished if sometimes hammy veteran actor, directed but one film and this near-masterpiece was the almost unbelievable result. Coincidentally, I've just recently watched and reviewed Orson Welles' butchered-but-brilliant \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and now know that they were both shot by cameraman Stanley Cortez. He himself is believed to have once said he only worked with two directors who understood light, Welles and Laughton and it is clear from the outset and is sustained all the way through that he's working with a kindred spirit here.Some of the pictorial compositions are breathtakingly good - as well as the justly famous shot of Mitchum and his horse in silhouette travelling up and over a bridge in slow but sure pursuit of the two young children who are concealing the ill-gotten gains of their lately executed father (played by a young Peter Graves) there are memorable shots of Shelley Winters's doomed young widow returning to the house at night while Mitchum's evil preacher menaces her two children within and of course the scenes at the end when this situation is reversed and Mitchum is outside old Mother Goose Lilian Gish's house brazenly threatening intent as she devoutly out-sings him and reclaims God as being on her side in protecting her young charges.The story is as crazy as Preacher Harry Powell of course but helped by Laughton's sure direction, the viewer is held every step of the way. It's really just the grimmest, Grimm-est fairy tale brought to life with echoes of Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin and especially Hansel and Gretel as Powell pursues his relentless would-be slaughter of the innocents in his search for the missing $10000. Mitchum of course is brilliant as the bible-quoting, switch-blade toting psychopath, a role he was to play again just as effectively years later in \"Cape Fear\" although the duality of Powell's character and ability to charm all and sundry differs from Max Cady's single- minded mission in the latter film. I must also say I doubt I've seen better child acting than by the young pair here while the afore-mentioned Graves and Winters also come off well in their shall we say truncated parts.For a one-shot film directorial task it's almost amazing that Laughton came up with a dark thriller the equal of the best of Welles, Lang or Hitchcock and sad that he never got behind the camera ever again. Still, what a keepsake to leave behind, a remarkable, unforgettable film on so many levels.",

It's an unfortunate choice, as Mitchum is so effective in his portrayal of a psychopathic preacher that the audience doesn't need it spelled out for them.Once the movie moves out of its odd exposition phase it gets better and better. Mitchum is a fascinating monster, and watching him crush the spirit of weak-willed Shelly Winters and play cat and mouse with her son is fascinating.The downriver scenes are truly remarkable. Shot by Stanley Cortez, who should have won an Oscar he was inexplicably not even nominated for, they have a lyrical beauty that stays with you.Night of the Hunter is a rather oddly structured movie, episodic and loosely woven. Most of this works surprisingly well, although there are moments, as when the writer makes the wonderful Lillian Gish spout ponderous biblical quotes, that feel highly unnatural.It's a shame director Charles Laughton never directed another film, as the single one he made is a suspenseful classic with wonderful performances and brilliant cinematography.",

            "review_title": "An interesting failure",
            "content": "The Night of the Hunter (1955)This interesting failure was directed by Charles Laughton in his only directing foray and stars Shelly Winters and Robert Mitchum. You may also recognize Lillian Gish and Peter Graves. There's some dispute on how to characterize the film (film noir, horror, melodrama), and I will be so bold as to say that this is one of the flaws in Laughton's vision - he didn't get his vision clearly on the screen. The story is something like this. It's the Depression. Ben (Graves) is married to Willa (Winters), and they have two kids. Ben is involved in a robbery/murder and hides $10,000, telling only his two kids where the cash is. Ben is caught and sentenced to hang. His cellmate is Mitchum's character, Harry Powell. Powell knows the ten grand was never found; Ben mumbles enough in his sleep to tell Powell the kids know the location of the loot. Ben is hanged; Powell serves his time and hightails it to the widow's home.He marries Willa and starts working on the kids to tell him where the money is hidden. He murders Willa, and the two kids hop on their rowboat and float down the river with the reverend in hot pursuit. We follow the story to the end, Powell gets his just reward, the money is returned, and some people live more or less happily ever after in the Depression.What makes the movie both a failure and worth watching is Laughton's vision of the tale and Stanley Cortez's cinematography. I'm not sure who did the sets and the lighting, but I'll take those designs as my clues that Laughton was making a moral tale along the lines of Homer's \"Odyssey\" with German Expressionism very much in the forefront. In some scenes, Willa's bedroom is a normal room. In other scenes, the room becomes a cathedral and hell at the same time. The ceiling becomes highly arched with inset windows, and that part of the set is over lit, almost whited out. This is where Brother Powell holds forth on his sermon of hate and love, communing with his god. In the foreground of the set, Willa is in her bed set on total blackness; she's lighted but in and on a void. The former natural realism of the bedroom is totally gone, and we know we're in another universe where Powell is god, master of love and hate, life and death. And where Powell is master, there's not that much difference between love and hate, and not that great a gulf between life and death. The set shows us who's where in the grand scheme of things. *Spoilers below for those who haven't seen the movie, so don't look.But the problem is we just have a serious of beautifully composed and filmed scenes. Laughton had magnificent visions, but his storytelling lets us down. Nevertheless, \"The Night of the Hunter\" is worth watching for the same reasons as \"Metropolis\" and \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" -- Laughton was a genius in getting beautiful images on the screen.I'd say that those who think this is a film noir have missed the boat.Film noir (in my take on it) had more than darkly lit scenes to create the genre. The text of the film was cynicism shown by a bunch of losers who know they'll never win but have nothing to lose by going through whatever motions they can scare up a motive for. No one can be trusted, loss is inevitable, and all misdeeds will inevitably be punished.In \"The Night of the Hunter,\" Laughton goes more to Expressionism. The sets he uses are highly stylized: The transformation of Willa's bedroom, for example, where it becomes a cathedral and a void, heaven and hell. Powell's introduction to the family is by the casting of his silhouette on the wall of the children's bedroom. His constant song is \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms,\" and in one mesmerizing scene he sings it in round with Rachel (Gish), the devil counterpointed by a saint. The theme of \"The Night of the Hunter\" is more akin to madness than to cynical loss. Powell's pursuit of the children, again in my opinion, has less to do with horror than with his mad obsession with the money. His attempts to do them in are not based on his evilness but on his callous regard for money. In horror movies there is a monster who destroys simply because it's in the script. Here Powell destroys because he's insane, driven by his lust for money.Another key to the Expressionist bent of the movie is Mitchum's performance. Often his acting is completely believable and natural, but there are many scenes where Powell is off- kilter, the acting is strange. Powell has crossed from our reality into his, and we need to understand with his understanding, not ours. Mitchum's ability to swing from completely realistic acting to symbolism gave me new respect for his talent.*SPOILERS----------- Powell has HATE tattooed on the knuckles of his left hand and LOVE on the knuckles of his right. (Some will know the ancient word for left is sinister and for right is droit.) Powell also has a switchblade knife. And he hates sex and sexuality. We see him in a burlesque theater watching a woman do a sensual dance on stage. The camera drops from his face to his waist, and the steel blade pops out of his pocket. Is this phallic? You bet. This is our first symbolic hint of the reverend's proclivities. It turns out he hates all women; on his wedding night with Willa, he coldly refuses sex with her.In the scene where he murders her, the symbolism is running rampant, and you may notice that he stabs her with his blade held in the hand tattooed with LOVE. The reverend is a twisted man indeed.",

Robert Mitchum as the maniacal bogus clergyman stopping at nothing to find some money makes your blood freeze.\"The Night of the Hunter\" makes some of the most impressive use of black-and-white cinematography. The contrast truly serves to show the good and evil sides of human nature just as much as the words on the preacher's fingers do. This exercise in expressionism displays plenty of influence from 1920s German cinema. And it all adds up to one very well done movie. The acting, the score, the cinematography, everything. But most of all, Mitchum's performance as the fanatical, self-proclaimed preacher. Not even the warning of false prophets can prepare you for this man's pathological actions, based on his misogynistic views.This movie is easily one of the all-time classics. Wrongfully ignored upon its initial release, it has fortunately gained recognition over the years. You should definitely see it. Also starring Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish and Peter Graves.",

The direction by Charles Laughton (in his only directed feature film) is near-perfect, and the black-and-white photography still holds up well after all these years. All the other actors give nice supporting performances as well: Shelley Winters is very likeable as the gullible widow that marries Mitchum, and Lillian Gish gives a strong performance as the old lady that defends the two children. And I also liked in some parts Robert Mitchum's singing with his own voice, and I am probably in the minority that thinks that he had a great voice as a singer. However, but this didn't influenced me with the rating, the last 10 minutes of the movie were a bit of a letdown. BTW, if you can get past this, you'll find this movie impossible to NOT love.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is directed by Charles Laughton, his first and unfortunately sole film that he directed. The film is written by James Agee adapted from Davis Grubbs novel. It sees a fanatical murderous preacher Harry Powell (expertly played by Robert Mitchum), marry the widow of his former cellmate Ben Harper(Peter Graves), in an attempt to find the location of $10,000 that Harper had stolen in a robbery, prior to his arrest.This is one of the best films I've ever seen, and one of my all-time favourites, which is a phase I don't use lightly. The direction is near faultless. Despite many of the off-screen issues surrounding this film, It's amazing how well it congealed together. The framing and stylish noir set design gives this film an incredibly eerie atmosphere, which in turn adds a dreamlike sense of impending dread throughout the entire run-time. This is felt most notably in the scenes where the terrifying Harry Powell is hunting Harper's two children Ben(Billy Chapin) and Pearl(Sally Jane Bruce).Shelly Winters plays Willa Harper. After her husband dies in prison at the hands of Powell. She Is seduced, and taken in by Powell, and soon finds herself helpless, as the lingering omnipotent stature of Powell looms large over her and her children. Winters gives a terrific performance of someone that is both smitten and trapped at the same time.The standout of the film without a doubt is Robert Mitchum as the Preacher Harry Powell. Mitchum delivers one of the finest performances in cinematic history. He's able to effortlessly switch between being charming and charismatic to frightening and hateful on the turn of a dime. His performance is utterly compelling and as his character permeates through every scene of the film. His performance is matched pound for pound by Lillian Gish as Rachel Cooper. Gish plays a steadfast woman, who takes the children in when they are trying to evade Powell. She does a great job of being a warm and unshakeable saviour figure for the children, against Powell's menacing and unrelenting wrath.It's truly a shame that Laughton never got the chance to direct another film. The Night of the Hunter was so far ahead of it's time. There are moments in the film where the subject matter and imagery are still shocking and unrelenting even for today's audience. The film does have a couple of missteps. The child actors do tend to overact in some places, but it's not enough for it too become distracting. There are also a couple of pacing issues in the middle act which is quickly smoothed out when the film enters into the final act.The Night of the Hunter is a film beyond it's years, and still holds up as-well if not more-so today. It's an un-compromising thriller wrapped inside a noir, wrapped inside a Grimm fairy-tale, and it's a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Night of the Hunter filled me with the kind of feeling one gets when in the presence of a work of art made from the soul. I don't necessarily mean this in a religious sense, even though the film is perhaps *the* major film-noir of the 1950s to deal with morality, of the direct match of good versus evil and the innocents in-between. What I mean is that the film-making quality, everything in it from the staggering star presence and power of Robert Mitchum in perhaps is juiciest performance to Stanley Cortez's awesome cinematography, to the child actors who impress almost as much as the adults, to the chilling and beautiful musical score by Walter Schumann. But also the screenplay and direction, from James Agee and Charles Laughton (both of whom had this as their real major one-time breaks), who carefully craft a story where what's good in humankind is really good, and what's evil is so pitch-black you can feel the air thicken with the kind of horror that happens (as Christianity posits for someone to imagine and/or know) when Satan walks in the room.The story is like that of a fable, and what's impressive is how it's timeless and ahead of its time with its style. It's about two children, a boy and a girl, with a secret- their father robbed a bank and shot a couple of people and hid the money in his little girl's doll and was sentenced to death- and a Preacher who shared a prison cell with this man who told him in his sleep about money stashed away. The Preacher comes to town, impresses (but doesn't romance) a widow and married her, but the little boy knows what this \"Reverend\" is up to, and keeps dodging them every which way, only to finally have to run away with his sister after the death of their mother. From then on its a quasi-chase movie (quasi in that the children are sometimes on a river drifting along, other times seeing the Reverend just over the hill on his horse), leading up to a stay with a kind woman who has a few other orphaned children.If this sounds so dark that it goes past the usual parameters of a usual film-noir, that's part of the point, perhaps. This is kind of like a new-wave movie before the new wave hit Europe, and also in America. Watch the technique of how the story is told - for a first time director, Laughton (via DP Stanley Cortez) knew his stuff about pacing a story, but so well enough that he could mess with it, just enough to keep certain shots, framed like American Gothic paintings like in the bedrooms of the house or along the riverside, infinitely interesting. But even as certain shots do scream out \"LOOK AT ME!\", it doesn't distract from the flow of the story, or from certain scenes terrifying or wondrous impact. Seeing Mitchum enter a room is one thing, watching him work with these kids in a manner that is truly sinister (subtle but with that over-the-top edge one saw in Laughton's own performances) raises this up just a little more.But as Mitchum is so good here, so good in fact that you may not need to watch another film with him in it to know his worth (though you should), Lilian Gish stuns in her own way too. She plays a firm matriarch, imbued with the teachings of the Bible and a caring soul in direct juxtaposition with this Reverend who just uses his status to get what he wants, and roams the countryside on his horse like a Reaper. One such amazing scene showing the two of them is at night: Mitchum's come to Gish's house to get \"his lambs\" back, but she trusts the boy over his word, of course, and so she puts a shotgun on him to get her off his property. At night, however, he sits right outside her fence and sings his song \"Leaning, Leaning...\" as she sits on the porch, and unexpectedly she sings along with him in her own verse. The look of this scene- with its stark blacks and hark grays, the position of Reverend and Rachel Cooper- and how it fits in the point of this story, is extraordinary.The Night of the Hunter takes a serious look at what those words on Mitchum's knuckles mean: LOVE and HATE, and the wrestling the two have with each other. The technique of the picture is original to play upon the themes of the movie: we see shots and scenes that move with the cinema language of silent film, but a lot of moments and movements in the style go along like films of the future. It's hard to articulate how breathtaking the film really is in some senses. Like a poem it plays upon our knowledge of the world, and it understands what childhood is like and how fragile it can be without those to love or be loved. And like the most ancient and greatest of fairy tales it sets conventions in place only to play upon the notes we know so well. There's not much different between Mitchum and the Big Bad Wolf... well, maybe there's a slight variation in their taste in \"lambs\". A++",

However, Ben tells him about his family and a boy and girl he has in a certain town. After Ben is executed, Harry get released from prison and seeks out his family. Harry puts on a big show as a religious minister who is a God fearing man and marries Willa Harper, (Shelly Winters) in order to take control of the children and find out just where this money is hidden.

Robert Mitchum must have been playing it for laughs. Like a lot of people are saying, there is no way people with any brain cells would believe and be charmed by him. He comes across so slimy, rather than charming.The little boy I don't know what his direction was, but the camera would linger on him when he was supposed to be responding to something and he would just stand there staring in touter space for a full 20 seconds before he responded. For example,when he's in the barn and he hears Robert Mitchum singing in the background as he hunts the kids, this kid stares in the outer space for 30 seconds before he responds to get out of there.Anyway the whole movie was nonsensical. The second part was like a totally different movie with Lillian Gish. It was corny. And when he got shot, I couldn't believe how they played it, which was just basically him running away like a cartoon character.

However, in this particular film he was all over the place going from creepy, to charming, to comical. The few times he played \"creepy\" were when he was running after the Harper children...Particularly when they were hiding from him in the barn. The lullaby made him less scary, and at times (like when he called little pearl a \"worthless little wench\") he was so over-dramatic that it threw off the whole character. Then, by the end of the film, when we see Rev. Powell's own cowardice he becomes so laughable that you wonder why anyone feared him at all. He went from Max Cady to Lou Costello in a matter of minutes.Sadly, he was one of the Two best actors in this cheese-fest. The other, Lillian Gish, whose portrayal of a tough, strong matron who protects the Harper children stands out as the best (and only noteworthy) performance in this less-than-thrilling thriller.As good as her performance was, however, it was weighed down with trite lines and a monologue at the end that went on about 5 minutes too long.The script was horrible, and the supporting cast (especially Ruby and Pearl) made small-town community theater performers look like Oscar winners. The plot dragged out until the very end, when the children finally find safe haven with Gish. But then it all wraps up too neatly.

            "content": "Set in the rural landscapes of depression era West Virginia and based on the novel of the same name by Davis Grubb, \"The Night Of The Hunter\" is an absolute masterpiece which features one of the most evil villains in cinema history. Its highly stylised blend of film noir, horror and Gothic influences creates a disturbing atmosphere and its dream-like passages add a strangely surreal quality to the piece.Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is a travelling preacher who serves a short prison sentence during which he shares a cell with a convicted bank robber and killer named Ben Harper (Peter Graves). The preacher overhears some remarks that Harper makes in his sleep and these lead him to believe that the stolen money has been stashed away somewhere in Harper's home.After Harper has been executed and the preacher is released from prison, he befriends and then marries Harper's widow Willa (Shelley Winters) who (like the unsophisticated townsfolk in Cresap's Landing) is immediately taken in by Powell's well cultivated charm.Before Harper had been arrested he had told his son John (Billy Chapin) where the stolen money had been hidden and also impressed on John and his sister Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) just how important it is that they don't tell anyone what they know about the cash.John doesn't trust his new stepfather from the outset and when the preacher asks him and Pearl about the money, they don't give him the information that he wants. Willa discovers a short time later what her new husband's real objective is and this soon leads to him murdering her and disposing of her body in the nearby river.The children continue to be threatened by the preacher until they escape and head downriver in a small boat and are subsequently given shelter and protection by an old lady called Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) who regularly takes in orphans and abandoned children. The preacher continues his relentless pursuit of the children and this eventually leads him into a dramatic confrontation with the very determined Rachel.Robert Mitchum's portrayal of the psychopathic, switchblade wielding \"man of the cloth\" is astonishingly powerful. He's incredibly forceful and dominating throughout and adopts a deeper and more resonant tone of voice than he employs in his other movies. He depicts his character's intense greed and sexual repression very convincingly and also his threatening behaviour towards Willa and the children leave no doubt that he'd readily take all their lives without any concern in order to get his hands on the stolen money.The preacher had been a drifter and serial killer masquerading as a clergyman for some time before his spell in prison for stealing a car and was so deluded that he seemed to believe that his practice of murdering widows for their money was in some way carrying out \"the Lord's work\". When he is eventually resisted by the genuinely kind, generous and also deeply religious Rachel, their juxtaposition throws the differences between them into sharp focus. The dramatic emphasis that this provides is also seen elsewhere in the story which very effectively juxtaposes love and hate, good and evil and the vulnerability of innocent children and the seemingly unstoppable power of a corrupt and vicious adult. This is also reflected visually where the sharp difference between light and dark is seen in the sequences where chiaroscuro lighting is used.\"The Night Of The Hunter\" has a haunting quality and some of its images make a particularly strong impression. Examples of these are:- 1. the shot of Willa's dead body sat in a car in the river with her hair moving in the current.2. the children's journey on the river which is interestingly lit and features close ups of animals on the riverbank.3. the silhouette of the preacher riding a horse as he's seen following the children downriver.Remarkably, this movie failed to make a positive impression on the critics or the box offices when it was first released and for that reason became the only film which Charles Laughton directed in his entire career. To his great credit, it's also absolutely unique and unforgettable.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton's \"Night of the Hunter\" is simply too good not to be a classic, but maybe not enough to be the masterpiece many movie lovers claim it to be. The performance of Robert Mitchum as evil preacher Harry Powell is as haunting as the black-and-white cinematography, responsible for so many hypnotically scary shots, the story itself is compelling, gripping and original, but it's precisely because the film flirts so many times with cinematic perfection that it's difficult to overlook the little outbursts of cringe-worthy moments that infect it here and there.\u00a0Maybe it's a case of half-full or half-empty glass, but again, it's because I love the most of the film that I wanted to love the whole of it, and I think it had the potential to be one of the greatest American film-noir movies if it wasn't for two major flaws: the children's acting and the ending. \u00a0There is a moment where the Preacher, at his scariest, asks the boy, John, why he tattled on him, and since John was trying to distract him from the doll that contained the money, he wanted, he tried to look natural and smiled, but the smile had nothing natural at all, it was weird and over-the-top, it could only raise more suspicion in a real-life situation, but that's not all, when the preacher tells him that it doesn't matter, her mother will believe HIS words, John's mouth is agape and it doesn't really work. Once he smiles, two seconds later, he has this expression. Obviously these are two separate reactions' shots that didn't translate well in the final editing.\u00a0And this is not a blame on the child's capacities, the child actor proved to be able to have the right tone and right expression in many other scenes, so there's an obvious problem with the directing. It's one thing to make dazzling black-and-white shots and use many expressionist angles to increase the scary effect, but maybe the real challenge was to make the kids act accordingly to the emotions the story was meant to convey. There's nothing to criticize in the actors' performances, Shelley Winters is so haunting as the submissive Willa, that I wished she had more scenes to play, Evelyn Varden as Icey Spoon or James Gleason as Uncle Birdie played nice supporting parts. And Lillian Gish had that kind of scene-stealing aura that could have been worth an Oscar nod.\u00a0 So, all Laughton had to do was just try to direct the kids, especially little Pearl. She wasn't bad, I wouldn't dare to be that harsh toward a child actor, but she was so odd, and her behavior so inconsistent that it was really distracting from the good things the film had to offer. In a scene where Powell asks her to tell what he wants to know, she has like a sort of wicked witch-like voice, that is devoid of the tenderness she had just displayed, then when she's supposed to know how bad and mean he is, in a later scene wen he comes back to get them, she raises her arms as if she was glad to see him. The same inconsistency raises my attention when the adolescent girl named Ruby, seemed to be infatuated with the Reverend, a victim of his evil charisma, just like Willa. Fair enough, but then, why was she so scared when he came to take the kids?\u00a0Apart from the child acting which was more to blame on the director, there's so much originality in the film, such bold moments of sheer terror that the whole experience feels like a childhood nightmare, just hearing the gravely voice of Mitchum chanting the ominous \"Chiiiill\u0085 dren\" would indeed chill any child of any generation. The strangest thing is that the film has two layers that couldn't have been more opposite, it works like a sort of childhood tale; while set during the Great Depression, it has the same bucolic appeal as Tom Sawyer's adventures, with the boat journey into the river like a raft trip through Mississippi, much more the faun and flora in the foreground, and the towering shadow of Powell as a sort of Injun Joe figure.\u00a0But the film is also more adult and explicit than any other film of its era, and the interactions between Harry and Willa, made me wonder why this particular angle wasn't more developed, before Willa could contribute to one of the most iconic corpse's discoveries ever. In fact there was room for the two plots to coexist and maybe makes the Willa assassination closer to the ending, especially given how impacting the image is. Now, the old lady is integral to the story, but the film lost too much time on its aftermath and should have kept on the grittiness of the first frames.\u00a0Which leads me to the second flaw: the ending. Seriously, such a larger-then-life character as Harry Poweel needed a cinematically similar demise. It could have been an interesting artistic license to never see him after his arrest, but then the last shot featuring Harry thrown in the Police car was a bit anticlimactic. I'm not saying I would have liked a spectacular demise but either that or never see him at all, and leaves his death a sort of mystery. The ending was a bit of a letdown.\u00a0Many films reach an iconic status without being masterpieces, take a cult movie like\u00a0\"Mommie Dearest\", which has probably lasted more and is more known than many better movies of the same year, what is infuriating in\u00a0\"The Night of the Hunter'\u00a0is that the film had the 'masterpiece' material, and it just lacked the proper time to correct a few flaws. So paraphrasing Powell, I had my \"L-O-V-E\" mind all set for the film but sometimes, it seemed like a struggle with the \"H-A-T-E\" side, I guess the former won anyway, but it was a close call.",

The combination of drifter, criminal, and religious proselytizer in Powell is certainly an ambitious attempt to create an unforgettable character, and there are times when it works very well. There are just a few times when the character seems somewhat forced, just weird for the sake of being weird, like some of the villainous characters in movies of more recent years.The story is always interesting, and sometimes it gets pretty involved.

And that's not to mention the over the top cheesiness of it all.Mitchum chews more scenery in this than in all of his other films combined. His portrayal of a religion-twisted psychopath on the trail of stolen money is not a very good performance no matter what the reviews say. The script makes it far too easy for him to worm his way into the picture and there are more than a few moments in this where you wonder how his character could possibly be that obvious and stupid and still pull the wool over people's eyes. A condemnation of the stupidity of the misguided faithful I guess, but still, it never feels credible.Visually the film does have its fair share of nice touches, though it seems more like Charles Laughton was trying to be Murnau or Pabst to the point of straining himself. It's the story here, with its far too many flaws in logic and ridiculous characters that just doesn't cut the mustard. I'm sorry, film connoiseurs, but this is a bad movie. Another top 250 classic that has no business being there.",

            "content": "I saw Spike Lee talking about this film on TCM, heaping praise on it like so many reviewers here. It didn't impress me nearly so much. I find it odd that Lee didn't refer at all to the very strange, almost expressionistic elements. It starts with the opening scene, the old lady speaking into the camera and ends with a similar scene, this time the words being highly stylized and far from ordinary speech. As the murderous preacher waits at the fence of the old lady's house, he begins to sing a hymn; then, amazingly, the old lady, who is waiting with a shotgun to protect the children from him, sings along with him--completely unrealistic and done for some sort of \"artistic\" effect. The sets were sometimes highly stylized, as in the bedroom of the murder, or the scenes of the preacher riding on his stolen horse silhouetted against a flat white, very unrealistic sky- -that scene looked like a paper cut-out. The dialogue is sometimes unreal, often an awkward imitation of small-town simplicity, most noticeable in virtually all the speeches of Mr. Spoons. The acting is far from realistic, as with Shelley Winters in her religious sermon but especially with Robert Mitchum as the psychopathic preacher. Spike Lee and others love his acting. I don't know whether to blame him or the directing of Charles Laughton in his striving for stylization, but Mitchum's hypocrisy and lying is so insincere, so transparent, so obvious in its fakery, that it would fool no one, except that the other characters tend not to be real characters, more representative of a type, almost cardboard-like.This is not to say that the cinematography is not effective, the story doesn't have suspense, and all the other good things other reviewers are pointing out here. But I only give the movie 5 stars out of 10. And for me it is no surprise at all that on its first release it received poor reviews and did not do well at the box office. I think Charles Laughton was trying to do something very special with this film, but he was not quite up to the job.While Shelley gets billing as a \"star,\" her part is very small, and she speaks fewer lines, I think, than the old man on the boat.I don't understand why the boy wouldn't testify against the preacher.",

            "content": "I'm slightly shocked at my having not yet reviewed this movie, as I mark it among my fervent favorites. I will unabashedly defend this film from any and all detractors because, in my heart of hearts, I know of no reason why one could deny its greatness. Taking a page from Jonathan Lethem, I would likely lose friends and leave lovers rather than abide their unwillingness to see Night of the Hunter's genius. That last bits probably a slight exaggeration, but I do feel strongly about this movie in a way that is markedly different from the way I feel about many of my other favorite films and the way I feel about many films that I prefer to this one. Take, for instance, Repo Man, Rules of the Game, 2001, or Wicker Man. Were I to rank those movies, all, excluding the last film on that list, would appear above Night of the Hunter. However, were I to be sitting around with friends and acquaintances and were these friends and acquaintances to begin discussing movies and were one of these friends and acquaintances to state, with a firmness of purpose, that they hate The Rules of the Game or 2001, I would likely ask why but I would most certainly not call them an imbecile. Were someone to utter a disparaging word about The Night of the Hunter, I would not bite my tongue. Why? I suppose it's simply because I can understand how difficult some movies I enjoy are. I understand that my awe at seeing Keir Dullea's face painted with acid-trip technicolor and my love of witnessing yet again the skeletons dance in a French ch\u00e2teau are personal preferences. These images and stories are not shared by everyone. Night of the Hunter, though, is a movie that, though significantly more dense than most major American motion pictures made prior to the 1960s (and, for that matter, more dense than most international cinema of the time), one can enjoy as a simple story of good and evil. Sure, the European mise-en-scene, expressionistic lighting, and slightly surrealistic use of sound-stage shooting transform The Night of the Hunter into something I've never seen elsewhere. And sure, the acting of the adults is theatrical and their mannerisms slightly overwrought. Yet it works together perfectly. This was not a mistake, in my opinion. Charles Laughton and James Agee knew precisely what they were trying to achieve--a surreal, quasi-fantastic, and horrific fairy tale about a contemporary Hansel and Gretel. Sort of. Those aforementioned quirks--the lighting, acting, and mise-en-scene--help create a sense of unreality that befits a fairy tale or parable. This movie is not meant to attain naturalism in any way; the filmmakers' intent is to create a nightmarish world that taps into deeply embedded fears (the wolf in sheep's clothing, the loss of parents, being alone in the wilderness) and compounds these fears by disorienting viewers with unreal surroundings. A film, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which frightens by forcing its audience to confront fears of mindless madmen, is not nearly as terrifying as this film. Whereas Chainsaw takes place in a world in which the audience can find its bearings, The Night of the Hunter takes place in an alternate world which looks similar to our own but nevertheless seems somewhat false. The grass doesn't look quite right nor does the water. The trees look like cardboard and the houses two-dimensional. Of course, that occurs because our senses do not deceive us. The world of The Night of the Hunter is fake, filmed on a Hollywood soundstage. Watching this film, I yearn for the artificiality of the sets. There's something so amazing about looking at something you know to be fake and that appears fake but that the actors refuse to acknowledge as fake. This refusal gives films like The Night of the Hunter and The Wizard of Oz an unmistakable aura that, in my mind, makes them better. I will always prefer their artificiality to that of CGI armies. The evil apple trees of Wizard will always win in my mind over Tree Beard, or whatever his name is. I realize this is an awful review inasmuch as it completely refuses to address the plot of this film. The plot, to me, though essential, does not need description. Know simply that it's wonderful, pulpy stuff. Everything you need to know about Night of the Hunter is in the way that it looks and feels. It's a completely sensual experience that can be enjoyed on the basis of its narrative or the basis of its appearance. It's a magical movie and one you should watch immediately.",

            "content": "The Night Of The Hunter (1955) :\nBrief Review -Charles Laughton's Only Directorial Crime Noir makes a rare combo Spiritual touch and Innocence of Children. In the 50s Hollywood saw many Crime noirs made with different perspective, different plots and different thoughts but have we witnessed a Crime Noir having children playing the most important part in it? There might be one or two or some films and may be i am unaware of them except for The Night Of The Hunter. Well, the plot is simple and interesting, we have a religious fanatic con who marries a gullible widow whose young children are reluctant to tell him where their real daddy hid the money he'd stolen in a robbery. How children manages to keep him away and survive is all about it but with well Shaken mixture of spiritual propaganda and Noir touch. There is nothing to spoil here, we all know what happens in the end but how it happens is important. The director takes it through different path as we meet a kind-hearted woman in the final portion of the film who is religious but very smart and well known about all these tricks of cons and evil minded people. The way she explains everything was so thoughtful and generously shewd. Acting by children was natural and in some scenes they did better than matured ones. Robert Mitchum was decent, Shelle Winters and Lilian Gish were okay. Charles Laughton is known for his Great Acting skills but then he tried his hands in Direction and took a heavy and dark theme like Crime Noir but fortunately he survived. He did a very good job while handling this crime drama through sensitive characters. The only problem in the film is not having Twisted portion because you never see anything happening beyond your imagination. You could easily predict the next scene and even some dialogues before they speak. Otherwise in a desired limited house The Night Of The Hunter makes a Fine Crime Drama Noir.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

The central, dreamlike sequences as the rowing boat passes along the river is still rather magical but even this now looks far too overdone and sentimentalised with the close-ups of owl, rabbits and Disney like frog. Robert Mitchum is good but has his own moments of drift where he almost seems to leave his own character.

I have heard a book is being written on it; so much the better for all of us film fans.  Robert Mitchum is in his best performance (that I've seen) as the psychotic preacher/wife-killer.  Shelly Winters almost ruins the movie with her usual method inspired over-acting, but her character is supposed to be ridiculous, stupid, and annoying, so I guess it's pretty much perfect (unlike Lolita, a film she DOES manage to ruin, at least until she dies).  Maybe she and film husband Peter Graves met at the same \"Ham Actors Studio\". At any rate, every scene in this movie is excellent and memorable.  You know you're seeing a good movie when the first thing you see is Lillian Gish's face floating in outer space talking about false prophets.  I love the musical interlude with the animals and the theme of the river as a giver of life.  This is a profoundly human movie.  It is also an excellent thriller with biblical overtones. The scenes that are incredible are too many to name:  Winters' hair floating in the water, Mitchum's hands stretched out as he climbs the stairs after the kids, his arrival on horse as they sleep in a barn, and his pathetic scream of fear when faced with Lillian Gish, powerful woman with a gun.  this is a film to love and cherish.",

So I was looking forward to a classic suspense film that director Charles Laughton never truly got credit for, as the picture gained greater notoriety and critical acclaim in the decades after he died. However this one turned out to be one of those head scratchers where I couldn't quite match up it's reputation with my own reaction to it.It starts with Robert Mitchum. There's no doubt that he's one of film history's finest actors, but his introduction in this story seems to have gotten off on the wrong foot. Preacher Powell we come to learn, is a truly malevolent character, but it appears at times that he's balancing that menace with an undefined campiness. The scene in the basement where he chases the kids up the stairs is an example. With arms outstretched, it appears like he's imitating Frankenstein with that exaggerated gait. You can't convince me that a grown man couldn't have caught John and Pearl in that situation, or later in the woods, instead of getting all tangled up in the bushes. The kids managed to get to the skiff unimpeded, and he couldn't? What worked with Mitchum's portrayal had to do with the way he represented himself to the citizens of Cresap's Landing. Up front he was a refined and sophisticated gentleman and man of the cloth. It's believable that he could have fooled the town folk, but Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) should have seen through him like a window. I mean, every other sentence to the children was 'where's the money?' It didn't take much of an imagination to figure out why he was there.The truly inspired piece of filming that DID hook me was the underwater death scene. Forget for a second all the blood and gore you might have witnessed in countless films, the imagery presented in that sequence is one of the spookiest I've ever seen. But there again, the intensity of that moment is diminished when old Uncle Birdie discovers the submerged vehicle, quite plainly visible from his rowboat vantage point.I think what ultimately holds the picture together is the bravery of young John, dedicated to preserving his father's secret and protecting his sister Pearl. His presence seemed to be the only unambiguous element in the story, and the only character that didn't succumb to caricature. Level headed enough to realize that Preacher Powell was bad news right from the start, he takes it upon himself to maintain the honor and trust placed in him by his father. For that he succeeded admirably.Perhaps what I need to do is watch this film a second time. Maybe there's a nuance I'm missing to be so out of synch with most critics and fans.

I've seen surprisingly little of Mitchum's work, and yet the movies I've seen him in have been very good. As Powell, Mitchum offered a perfect portrayal of essentially a snake oil salesman. Powell uses his status as a \"preacher\" to convince young widows to marry him, then he kills them for their money. Put in prison for car theft, he encounters Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who killed two men while robbing a bank and hid the money before being caught and sentenced to death. Upon his release, Powell goes after Harper's widow and her two children. Powell is a good screen villain; one of the better and more effective I've seen, and the story has enough suspense to keep you riveted to the screen. There's even a bit of subtle and humorous sexual innuendo early on during a discussion about a wife's \"duties,\" - Icey Spoon (interesting name) saying that she thinks about canning while she lies there.It was all good until the end. Once Powell is arrested, the story seemed to fall apart. It moved far too rapidly through its closing scenes and ended with a domestic Christmas scene, as the two Harper children apparently celebrate having found safety in what is for all intents and purposes a new family environment. That's heartwarming but it just seemed too jarring when combined with the rest of the movie. Make no mistake about it - this is a very good movie, but the ending really pulled it down in my estimation. 6/10",

            "content": "In the theater \"expository\" is when the actor talks to the audience. It is sometimes necessary to further the play, but is generally thought to be a weakness of writing. In the case of film, it should be absolutely unnecessary. As a visual medium, any expository should be easily handled by the visuals. When it is used, it is a sure sign that the screenwriter (and by extension, the director) just couldn't find a way to express it any other way except having the actors talk to (or at) the audience.In the case of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" the Angels talk to the audience and it works, moving the story forward. In \"The Night of the Hunter\" it fails miserably. The morality tale should be carried by the story, not by bible verses directed to the audience.Another form of expository is when the camera is used to show the passage of time or distance, usually through montage. Hitchcock was a master of the visual montage. His technique is crisp and sharp. Other masters of the visual montage are Orson Welles, John Ford, Wes Anderson, and Steven Spielberg. Unfortunately Laughton's visual montages were slow and plodding, using animals in the foreground of the scene to show the passage of distance. It was a good thought, but it didn't work.Laughton was troubled that his first directorial attempt was a box office and critical failure, and he never directed again. That is a shame, because in spite of these weaknesses, most first time directors have failings and they get better over time. Laughton clearly had directorial chops. He just needed more experience.There are many directorial \"one-hit-wonders.\" First attempts are great, and everything after that fails. There have many many actors who turned director. Some failed, and some succeeded.Laughton showed so much potential as a director. There was so much to be proud of, that he could have overcome the weaknesses in later films, chalking it up to a learning experience.The camera work was, at times, exquisite. When the actors were not lined up across the screen (a directorial weakness), he moved them in and out of the foreground and frame (a strength) with the grace of a veteran. The lighting was masterful. Transition between night and day, and the use of light and shadow showed that Laughton had skill.The story that the script is based on is one of the films great strengths, but one of the great weaknesses was the script. Stilted and unnatural dialogue held the cast and director back. The expository, that I mentioned earlier, is something that is used with great effectiveness in a novel, where expository is how things get explained, talking in the third person directly to the reader. James Agee, the script writer, was a novelist. This explains why expository happened. Clearly they should have put the script in the hands of a seasoned screen writer, so the director and actors would have had better substance to work with.Now, let's really get positive. The characters in the story were strong, and the casting backed that up with strong, exceptional performances. Clearly Laughton could have been regarded as an actor's director. He knew what the actors needed from him. As an actor, he possessed natural skill, and was backed by directorial masters. He learned these lessons well, and directed his actors with the skill of a veteran.Mitchum, Winters, and particularly Gish turned in performances that absolutely saved the film and turned it into a film well worth watching. When the script didn't get in the way, the supporting cast was also very good.I am not a big fan of Robert Mitchum, but when he plays evil, it is truly evil. Between this performance and \"Cape Fear\" I could say that Mitchum (along with perhaps Lon Chaney and Lee Marvin) may be one of the most evil actors ever.Two time Oscar winner, Shelley Winters plays the weak and vulnerable mother. She is emotionally and (sometimes) physically beat down. You can see her try to maintain dignity when she is told she is unworthy. The conflict in her weighs heavily. She tries to hold her head high, but just cannot keep it up for very long. Winters masterfully delivers. She may be the most sympathetic character in the film.Lillian Gish. Ah, Miss Lillian. La Gish. Maybe the greatest actress we have ever had. From the time she comes on the screen, she dominates and the whole tone changes. Even Mitchum cannot keep up with her-it becomes her film. She has a strength and a softness that she brings to every role. If you ever get a chance to see \"Broken Blossoms,\" \"Orphans of the Storm,\" \"Way Down East,\" or \"The Wind\" take the time.Film acting is, in all cases, in the eyes. It is the eyes that project what is going on in the soul and the mind of the character. Gish is a master of using her eyes to convey what is inside. (There are a very few actors that effectively do this.) If Gish never smiled, never frowned or grimaced, never used her body to convey anything, it would be fine. She acts from her eyes. Her smiles and grimaces are delivered by her eyes. When she looks at someone, she really sees them. She looks inside them. There is an understanding that is conveyed by the way she sees. There is really no acting involved...she is being.This is really a film worth seeing. You should let go of the weaknesses, and focus in on the strengths. In spite of everything, you will not be disappointed. I gave it a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Wow, I just cannot say enough bad things about this film. The acting covers the complete spectrum from \"ham-fisted\" to \"wooden.\" Poor Shelly Winters is obviously misdirected to deliver her lines as though she were reading from a cue card. If you don't believe she can act, check out \"A Patch of Blue\" or \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\" She is certainly capable of better than this horrible performance which evokes no emotion whatsoever beyond disbelief. And Robert Mitchum! He certainly shows some chops, but my goodness, has there ever been a more ignorant and stupid character in film history? He'd fit right in with \"Dumb and Dumber!\" How could anyone in his position (who ostensibly had gotten away with murder and robbery on several occasions) NOT see that the money was hidden in the doll? He oozes menace in some scenes, but then is reduced to popping up like something in a carnival shooting gallery and whooping his way into a barn when Lillian Gish shoots him. Seriously, if you want subdued menace in a BELIEVABLE character, how about Tony Perkins in \"Psycho\" or Sterling Hayden in almost anything? The only actors who manage to pull off believable performances are Billy Chapin and a wonderful Peter Graves, who, in the few minutes he has on screen, out-acts old Bob handily. Think about it, you actually sympathize with a robber and murderer because Graves turns in an almost \"Fonda-esque\" performance. Oh, and I can't leave out the wonderful old James Gleason as Uncle Birdie. He's both likable and pitiful and has far too little screen time. In addition to lame dialogue and poor directing, the sound track is an evil entity of its own. Laughton uses it with the subtlety of a jackhammer to announce that \"Rev Powell is a bad guy\" or \"Rev Powell is on that train,\" etc. I'm all for overshadowing but these \"hints\" are more like headlines.Most of the remaining cast of characters are almost cartoons. Evelyn Varden does a particularly egregious bit of overacting as \"Icey Spoon\". In fact the film itself could be a parody of film noir! Come on, Lillian Gish actually SINGS A DUET with the menacing man sitting outside her house waiting to kill her! I have no idea why people feel compelled to rave about the greatness of this film. It doesn't hold a candle to REAL 1950's film classics like Kubrick's \"The Killing\" or \"Hatful of Rain\" or \"On the Waterfront,\" which has more feeling and menace and credibility in the cab scene than \"Night of the Hunter\" has in its entire fabric. Face it folks, there's a good reason why this was Charles Laughton's ONLY directorial offering.",

What I mean is that the image of the demented preacher in this movie was so well played that a lot of his later work is filtered through this role  in people's minds... we have to shed this image of him with effort in order to get adjusted to him in other roles. I remember seeing this movie on TV as a youngster, maybe 5-6 years of age and the image of Shelly Winters dead underwater in that old car haunted my dreams. Her long hair floating in the current along with the weeds, the barely visible rope which ties her to the carseat. If Robert Mitchum's character could charm his way into their lives kill these children's mother, was mine safe?   Ahhh...the stuff of a child's dreams and nightmares... The whole movie has an absurdist, dreamlike quality to it, from Robert Mitchum's often over-the-top portrayal (He plays it like a psychopath would have been remembered in the children's memory..) all the way to the sets that often look like secondary, minimal stagesets. To me, the idea was to throw things off-kilter in viewers expectations and to rewrite the rules, at least for this movie. It's not your usual suspense movie and it is a shame that Laughton didn't get a chance to see how great this film was, and to make more. This movie only really found it's \"audience\" on TV reruns.

With that powerhouse, and the promising storyline of two children being pursued down a river for money hidden in the little girl's doll (no, that's not a spoiler), a tense, suspenseful, adventurous movie should have resulted. It didn't. The boy is Billy Chapin, who at 12 was thankfully near the end of his acting career, exhibits the spontaneity of a manikin; and the girl, Sally Jane Bruce, 7, ended hers right here. As one who likes 50's movies and movies about kids, I can say this one was a significant disappointment.",

It is so eerie and ethereal. I would watch it again just to see the imagery. The story line is interesting because it requires thought, not just passive watching of the movie. Especially when it comes to the boy's reaction of the fugitive being taking away. One thing for me, that was strange, was the man being able to sit outside the house and the cops taking forever to get there. Maybe it was the times, but come on. He could have killed those kids.",

            "review_title": "Big Bad Wolf",
            "content": "What a bizarre film. Some brief thoughts...1. \"Night of the Hunter\" is best viewed as a children's fairy tale. Using heavy doses of German Expressionism, the film feels like something published by the Brothers Grimm.2. This is one of the few early Southern Gothic flicks to have aged well. \"The Story of Temple Drake\" and \"Intruder in the Dust\" were released a decade earlier, but those films now look pretty dated.3. \"Night of The hunter\" revolves around a psychotic Southern preacher called Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who terrorises two children in the hopes of learning the whereabouts of a loot of stolen money.4. The children are defended by Rachel Cooper, an elderly woman who runs a home for abandoned kids. The name Rachael conjures up Jacob's wife in the Bible. In the Old Testament Rachael experienced long periods of barrenness and believed God to have denied her children. Despite this she eventually became the \"mother\" of two of the twelve tribes of Israel.5. The film eventually becomes a battle between two Bible toting figures. Rachel Cooper, a widow and devout Christian who loves caring for children, battles Harry Powell, a false prophet who seeks to harm the kids.6. Aesthetically, the film's special. It takes place within a world of dark shadows, creepy cottages, giant spider webs and spooky full moons. First time director Charles Laughton draws heavily from German Expressionism, his sets stylised, relying on stark silhouettes and abstract shapes. It's all very nightmarish, evocative of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", \"Nosferatu\" and Fritz Lang's \"M\".7. The film's treatment of sexuality is bizarre. Mitchum's character is sexually repressed and hates women. During a burlesque stage performance he appears both mesmerised and repulsed by a stripper strutting about on stage. As he stares at her, the camera slowly pulls in on the word HATE tattooed to his left fist. Secretly aroused by the performance, Mitchum grabs a knife hidden within his pocket. In a moment of blatant phallic symbolism the switch blade shoots outward, elongated by his excitement. He then cuts open his pocket, enacting the only penetrative action his impotency will allow. 8. Later in the film, Mitchum refuses to have sex with his wife. It's a spooky scene, Mitchum using religion to shame his wife into abstinence.9. In one surprisingly graphic scene (for its time), Mitchum holds a child's head down and threatens to cut him with a knife. Mitchum would play a similarly creepy character in 1961's \"Cape Fear\".10. The film's treatment of men is oddly sexist. They're all criminals, sexual predators, drunks or dopes. Even weirder: the film seems to be about the need to reject sexuality before one grows up enough to be tempted. Consider this: two children flee the Frankenstein-like rampages of Mitchhum and land finally at the home of Rachael Cooper, an elderly woman who specialises in taking care of homeless children. Cooper's family is a family without a grown man and without the problems of sexuality and temptation. The family is threatened only when Mitchum arrives. And he arrives only after learning about Rachel's location whilst flirting with Ruby, the only sexually active girl in Rachel's care. 11. The film jumps from Mitchum to Rachel. He's Old Testament, morbidly anti sexual, self loathing and repressed, she's aloof, smug, faithful, calming even, in her abstinence.12. What's odd is that the film's negative perception of all things sexual actually endorses Harry Powell's proclamations. The only true innocents in the film are people who have not yet reached puberty (young kids) or those who are well passed the age where sexuality is a constant concern (old women/men). What \"The Night of the Hunter\" seems to be proposing is a kind of anti-promiscuity. An example of this is the revelation that Rachel's byproduct of her own sexual urges, her son, is ungrateful and no longer loves her, yet she receives great comfort in the caring of other people's kids. 13. Cinematographer Stanley Cortez would also work with Welles on \"The Magnificent Ambersons\".14. Robert Mitchum totally resembles the \"big bad wolf\" in the 1940 animated Disney film, \"Pinocchio\". The guy is sneaky.15. In one scene a boy looks at a turtle and remarks that though he'd like to make tasty turtle soup, he wouldn't know how to go about getting the turtle out of its shell. The boy's relationship with the turtle - the dangerous desires of others can be thwarted by a \"strong shell\" - mirrors several relationships in the film. For example, Powell wants the kids but can't get at them. Likewise, Powell's wife wants Powell sexually, but can't have him. The film thus seems to advocate the repression of instincts, be they violent, sexual, maternal etc, in favour for living within the protective, cocooned space of a personal shell. Tie this in with the fact that director Charles Laughten never had children and dodged homosexuality rumours throughout his life and you have some kind of odd meta-biography.8/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

There are some moments that seem a little silly or over the top, but I think that this is because it is supposed to be from a child's point of view. For example, in one scene, when the villain is chasing two kids up a stairs, he holds his arms straight out after them like he's Frankenstein. It looks goofy, but it fits for how the kids perceive the danger. These bits have never interfered with my enjoyment, though. I think this story is timeless, even when it gets a little hokey.It has an irony to it in a time when movies usually were very straightforward. This gives it a slightly modern feel, even as the settings and dialog set it firmly in the past. This is a movie I wish I could get everyone I know to watch. Chilllll-DREN!",

            "content": "Night of the Hunter is not the most conventional of movies. It's part thriller, part morality play, and part character study, with abundant symbolism and strong religious overtones. From the very beginning, as we see the faces of children against a backdrop of stars, and hear a woman reading to them from Scripture about the danger of false prophets, there's an eerie, disquieting feeling to it.The plot follows two young children, John and Pearl, whose father swore them never to tell where he'd hidden $10,000 from a brazen robbery. What the children don't know is that with their father gone their troubles have only begun. They're about to run afoul of one of the slimiest most menacing villains in the screen's history: \"Brother\" Harry Powell; played by George Mitchum in a truly spectacular performance.A self-serving conman, he preys on young ladies and widows, seducing them so that he can part them from their money and lives. What's more, he's clearly deranged. He not only uses his guise as an itinerant preacher to deceive his victims, he's deluded himself into believing that he is carrying out God's will, and that his actions are therefore righteous. And he has a misogynist streak a mile wide. He hates women's clothes, their curly hair, and the smell of their perfume- and he has convinced himself that so does God. Every time he appears on screen, the music and lighting become ominous. It's not long before even the slightest hint of him- his distant silhouette, his whistle, even the hymns he sings- become sinister in the minds of the audience.What's truly alarming is the ease in which he wins over, and then manipulates, those around him, especially the women. From the moment he introduces himself as a minister and spins his bogus tale about having been a prison chaplain, he gains the town's complete trust. From this point on, he barely has to make any effort at courting the children's mother; the townspeople do the work for him, telling her that she'll be lucky to find another man like him.Even when she begins to glimpse his dark side, she's too slow to realize the danger, and with her gone nothing stands between him and the money except the children.The chase downriver In some shots the children to be drifting through the sky or outer space rather than a river; with only their boat and a backdrop of twinkling stars visible. At other times the pass characters out of old children's stories, such as a tortoise and hare, or a spider spinning its web. The music, and Pearl's singing only add to the strangeness. And throughout their travels, we are constantly reminded that they are being pursued.Their journey- but not their adventure- comes to an end when they reach the farm of Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). Gish has unquestionably earned her reputation as a queen of the silver screen, from her early work for WEB Griffith to her later work on TV, and this is surely one of her best performances. Her character may be headstrong and sometimes judgmental, but she is a paragon of kindness, love, and good sense. She is Powell's opposite in every way. Where he sees the children only as a tool to be exploited, she views them as charges to care for and give a good upbringing to. He misquotes Scripture to justify his actions, and twists it to suit his purposes. Rachel uses it to give her strength, and to comfort her adopted family. And while he would have condemned Ruby, her eldest child, for having secretly dated the boys in town, and then used her shame to gain power over her, Rachel reassures her that although she has done wrong, she is still a good person, and will make a fine young woman someday. It is in her that Powell may have finally met his match.Night of the Hunter is a bit strange, but it succeeds at being both chilling and heartwarming, and contains two of cinema's greatest heroes and villains. This one is definitely worth checking out.",

So what does this say about the relationship between Mitchum and Laughton in this film? With Laughton steering the wheel, he crafts Harry Powell into a cartoonishly unhinged maniac dancing between extremes. It makes one wonder where Mitchum's unearthly whoops and hollers came from, his inflections, the cast of his eyes, his manipulative manner, did all of this come from Laughton or was it all Mitchum? Regardless, it is a mesmerizing performance, one of the few examples of an actor being so immersed in the role that you forget you're watching a film. Mitchum and Laughton made a remarkable team in this nightmarish fairy tale.Like a lot of other reviewers have said, I once disliked the ending of this film, but on a recent viewing I have come to understand what Laughton (and presumably the author of the book) were coming to: listen closely to Rachel's words, the story isn't about the kids, or about Harry Powell, it's about the endurance of humanity in the face of overwhelming evil. She has seen the face of it, and handled it like a pro with her huge shotgun, so she's reflecting on it after everything that has happened. It works.This is one of those films that I will watch every time it's on TV, even with traumatic memories of watching the underwater scene when I was little. This film is nearly perfect.",

This is a pity because, at first a disappointment at the box office, the film became a real classic over time.An iconic image out of the film are the two fists of main character Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum). On the knuckels of this fistst are tattooed the words \"love\" and \"hate\". By rubbing his fistst against each other pseudo preacher Powell symbolises the struggle between good and evil. A rather cynical deed because inside Harry Powell himself this struggle has ended in favor of evil a long time ago.There are more scenes in this film that are very beautifully shot. The scene in the bedroom of Harry Powell and his second wife Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) where the strange angels in the ceiling reminds very much of Germen expressionism. The scene with the body of Willa Harper in the river is cruel and dreamlike at the same time. Cinematographer Stanley Cortez had also worked with Orson Welles in \"The magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). His work for that movie however remained in the shadow of the credits that Gregg Toland received for \"Citizen Kane\" (1941, Orson Welles). With \"The night of the hunter\" Stanley Cortez in my opinion definitely proves that he is playing in the same league as Gregg Toland.The storyline is very much film noir. As mentioned above sometimes there is a hint of German expressionism in the images. There is however also a strong fanatasy influence. In the first place the story is told from the point of view of children, i.e. the stepchildren of Harry Powell, who therefore becomes not only a real life criminal but also a fairy tale like bogeyman. In the second place the river over which the children flee for this bogeyman is evidently a mythical river, with fairy tale like rabbits and frogs at the riverbank.",

Just terrible all-around.The performances were almost all awful, save Mitchum, who did the best he could with the horrid script he was dealing with.The laughable fact that the wife of the thief would marry the Preacher when she barely knew him. Oh, and let's not forgot how she hears him threatening her kids, but she does nothing but lay down in bed.The kids are floating down a river for more than a week, apparently with only a potato to eat along the way, with a psychopathic preacher following on horseback, and they never consider getting out of the boat on the OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER? What the hell?The fact that Rachel Cooper accepted some random kids (not to mention hits them) is a joke. I don't understand how anyone can take any of this crap seriously.Rachel Cooper sings a duet with the murderous Preacher who is right outside her house looking to kill her. What sense does that make?The pacing was horrible. Just talk talk talk randomly about religion, and whenever Mitchum showed up, suspense was blocked by hammy performances (towards the end when Rachel had a chance to shoot the preacher, she does nothing but tap him in the butt, despite him chasing the boy with a knife). Yeah, Okay.It ends with at Rachel looking straight at the camera and stating explicitly the \"moral\" of the film. Again, what the hell was that all about? I just hated this film. Never have I disliked a so-called \"classic\" film so much. The script for this film has to be among the worst ever written. I give it a 1/10. It has now dethroned Batman Begins for the title of the worst movie on IMDb's top 250.",

            "content": "To my knowledge the American Regionalist paintings of Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton influenced only one film, and that film is \"Night of the Hunter,\" based on Davis Grubb's 1953 novel. Grubb was a West Virginia writer, raised mostly in the penitentiary town of Moundsville, where he based much of his work. Grubb was obviously influenced by the writings of Sherwood Anderson (Winesburg, Ohio) and Edgar Lee Masters (Spoon River Anthology), and if his work suffered at all it was because too much of Masters' poetic lyricism crept into it. \"Night of the Hunter\" was no exception, but in this case Grubb's melodic sentimentality seemed to express the point of view of the children who are at the heart of the novel. When James Agee wrote the script and actor Charles Laughton made his directorial debut, they both captured the charm, the Regionalist perspective and the Gothic horror of the novel perfectly. Bob Mitchum is frightening as Harry Powell (based on a real West Virginia murderer from the 1930s named Harry Powers, who was hanged at the prison in Grubb's home town). He's as cold blooded as they come, as he searches for the missing money from a robbery. After marrying and then murdering the robber's widow by slashing her throat and then dumping her into the Ohio River (where in a creepy scene we see her hair and clothing weaving underwater like seaweed), Powell goes chasing after the children, who are hiding the money in a doll. Spouting Biblical nonsense and self righteousness, he charms the simple townspeople and convinces them that the mother (Shelly Winters, looking much thinner in those days) has run off to one of those downriver Sodoms of the Ohio like Parkersburg, which at one time was actually notorious for its whorehouses and saloons. Once the hunt is on, the film becomes dreamlike and misty. Buildings and shadows take on the distortions of a Benton painting of rural life. As the children are floating, asleep, downriver on a boat, the stars glitter softly above them like angels as we hear the soprano voice of Kitty White (the black jazz vocalist who made an appearance as a nightclub singer in \"Kiss Me Deadly\" and later dueted with Elvis Presley on the song \"Crawfish\" in \"King Creole\") moaning an otherworldly melody. The film later changes tone completely when the children are rescued by a kindly old lady (Lillian Gish) who has been rounding up the Depression's orphans like kittens. If there is any shortcoming with \"Night of the Hunter,\" it's only that Mitchum's character is too easily dispatched at the end of the film. Regardless, as time goes by, \"Night of the Hunter\" looks more and more like a masterpiece.",

We often come across the phrase 'not a film, but a poem' when it comes to Bergman, Eisenstein, Tarkovsky and their ilk, but NotH strikes me as the movie that most deserves this epithet - and more. It also seems to me that Laughton is putting in practice some of the things he must have picked up from his collaboration with Bertolt Brecht ten years before, on the set of Galileo - he opens with, and returns to, the epic theater practice of letting Lilian Gish address the camera, and the sets of this movie are always stylized and theatrical, except for a few of the long shots. The shot of the murdered Willa under water, her hair waving with the river weed, has haunted me for twenty years, along with the deep focus shots of creatures in the foreground as the kids pass down the river in the skiff. the kids are great actors, and I've never seen Mitchum better - balancing between the devil incarnate and a slapstick clown. I think this film is right up there with \"Citizen Kane\".",

            "content": "I'd heard only great things about this 1955 film, so I was eagerly looking forward to finally watching it. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I was astonished. I was appalled. I was embarrassed for Charles Laughton and Robert Mitchum.What can we learn from this film? Well, for one, could Laughton and the always overrated James Agee make their anti-Christian bias any more obvious? Okay, we get it- preachers are hypocritical and can sometimes be criminals. Do you have to hit the audience over the head with that for nearly two hours? I've never seen one theme pushed so relentlessly. I'm guessing Laughton and Agee weren't believers.The acting, as others have noted, is laughable. No, it's almost surrealistic; but awful in a way that can't be enjoyed, like a cheesy sci-film from the same era. I disagree with some of those who lambasted the performances in this film, but exempted Robert Mitchum. In my view, Mitchum's character was a more unbelievably heavy-handed villain than Snidely Whiplash. I winced when he informed new wife Shelley Winters that they would not be having sex. Ever. Who came up with this kind of impossibly unrealistic stuff? The Church of Satan? The dialogue is almost incomprehensibly bad. There is not a likable character in the film, nor a single light hearted moment. How about a bit of comic relief? Why not take five minutes off from the nonstop bashing of Christianity? The fact that this film is so well respected by critics reminds us once again about the importance of thinking for yourself, and not mindlessly following the advice of alleged experts.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton and producer Paul Gregory worked together on several theatrical projects, one of which was the highly successful \"John Brown's Body,\" which starred Tyrone Power, Judith Anderson and Raymond Massey. For \"Night of the Hunter,\" Laughton brings his considerable directing talent to the screen with astonishing success.The story centers around a misogynistic, phony fire and brimstone preacher named Harry Powell (Mitchum) who kills widows and takes their money. While in prison for an offense, he learns that his cellmate, Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who is about to be hanged for murder, has hidden the $10,000 he stole. Powell goes to the town where Ben lived and courts Harper's widow (Shelley Winters) and marries her. She and Ben had two children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce). Though Powell is told that Ben, filled with remorse, tied a rock around the money and sank it, Powell believes that John knows where the money is hidden. And he wants it.This is a towering film with a fine script, excellent performances, great direction and some of the most beautiful cinematography in film history. It's absolutely captivating. It takes one right into the nighttime silence of the country, and the figure of Powell in silhouette on his horse will fill you with fear, just as it does the children. Not to give anything away, but the shot of Shelley Winters -and you'll know it when you see it - is breathtaking.Laughton manages with \"Night of the Hunter\" to give the audience not only horror but love, warmth and peace as well. Much of this is provided by the beautiful performance of Lillian Gish, as a woman who takes in the children after they run away. Much of her dialogue is close to poetry; she's a no-nonsense but gentle presence who knows her mission on earth and intends to fulfill it. Originally the role was to be played by Jane Darwell, but Laughton replaced her with Gish at the last minute. In the scenes where Gish holds a shotgun, he wanted a more frail presence coming up against the power of the devil.Though I admit to finding Pearl a little bit annoying, Billy Chapin is wonderful. There's a stillness about his performance and a look in his eyes that says more than any action could, and his reaction in one of the final scenes, when the stillness finally breaks, is magnificent.As for Robert Mitchum, this was probably his greatest role. I liked him best with the family; I thought he seemed an obvious phony as a preacher, and I questioned why only Lillian Gish and Walt Spoon (Don Beddoe) realize it. Mitchum does a fabulous job of showing Powell's suppressed anger; he almost vibrates with it.\"Night of the Hunter\" can be classified as a horror film, but a) it's not a genre I like; and b) I was crying at the end. I found it very touching and satisfying. It's a drama with horror elements -- and images you will never forget.",

A man shows up at his home with 10,000$ in hand and gives it to his son and daughter, telling him to hide it and then to use it when he grows up. Briefly after that, the police show up and drag the father away to jail where he ultimately dies.In the jail however, his cell mate, a crook posing as a preacher (Robert Mitchum) learns of this hidden fortune. After getting out, he heads to the man's home town and manages to marry his cell mate's recently widowed wife. It is now that he turns up the pressure on the kids to yield the money.This is one amazing film. So many offbeat scenes make it an interesting watch. Robert Mitchum plays an excellent preacher/crook who seems to be sweet while deep inside is nothing but a common criminal. Due to their mother being virtually brainwashed by her newfound husband, the two kids are on their own against this frightening man. The boy, who is older, doesn't like his new father one bit but the girl, seems to have some affection for him. There isn't much strive for family friendliness in this film- everything comes at you cold and as it is. Somewhat frightening in a way.This is unfortunately Charles Laughton's last film and only the second one he made. Had he not been so let down by the awful box office results, he might have become one of the greatest directors of our time. What stands out the most in this film is the cinematography. There's amazing play with dark and light, the very cornerstone of film-noir. There are some grand aerial shots that seem way ahead of their time. And then there are just offbeat shots of animals, sometimes with them in the foreground and the main action in the background. Simply breathtaking.A must see film.",

            "content": "I sat down to watch this movie last night full of anticipation as it is regarded as one of the best films of all time. At the end I was left more than a little disappointed. Let's make it clear that I don't think it's a bad film, but, it isn't the classic I was led to think it was. Firstly it is full of plot holes, it is never explained as to why Birdie Steptoe didn't report finding Willa's body in the river, he says something about no one would believe him, but, why not? Is he supposed to have done something is his past that would make him think that? Besides, if the river was as clear as it was when he saw her body then it wouldn't take long for someone else to spot her. The fact that everyone took Harry's explanation for Willa's disappearance so blithely was ridiculous, that a woman so devoted to her kids would just go off with another man while leaving them in the care of their new step father, a man anyone barely knew. The biggest plot hole is when Pearl runs up to Harry when he comes to Miss Coopers's house and hugs him, why? Has that child got an incredibly short memory of what he did to her? I also felt the sequence of the children floating down the river and all the cutesie shots of bunnies and frogs was not artistic, but, just merely filling in time for an already short movie. Saying that Robert Mitchum was outstanding as Harry Powell, as was Lillian Gish, the other performances did leave something to be desired, but, I have seen far worse. Watch, but, don't expect a great movie.",

            "content": "This is a film like Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960). The subject matter is not something I naturally gravitate toward. I suppose that's why I saw this film later in life after the Walt Disney years. A friend of mine told me that in this film I would see a Robert Mitchum such as I had never seen before. He certainly hit the nail on the head about that, I thought to myself, as I watched what director Charles Laughton described as a 'perverse Mother Goose tale' play out.Robert Mitchum has always seemed to me like a character out of a Hemingway novel. While he eschewed method acting and actors who took their characters home with them, he was obviously a product of his own method. He was a gifted natural actor who yet and still, curiously enough, was a classical actor of understatement. This may be the reason why his British contemporaries suggested he ought to attempt and do Shakespearean roles. The interpretation that Mitchum gives of the misogynistic psychotic Harry Powell confirms the validity of their assertion. While still performing well within himself and his own concept of reserved manly authority, he ultimately extends himself in both comic and Gothic directions new even for him.Able to successfully barter on his considerable charisma, Mitchum as the good Reverend is a charming, walking, talking cult of personality charged by God with an unmentionable mission. I think that is why Lillian Gish as Rachel Cooper proves to be the perfect counterpoint to his sinister moralizing and diabolical sermonizing as he woos the townswomen with the virtue of his ersatz spirituality. She is as real and genuine and loving as he is the romantic hero of melodrama turned inside out as a pleasing facade masquerading over hate. Condemned murderer and family man, Peter Graves as Ben Harper, sees through that facade immediately as Powell's cell mate, as does his son, John Harper as played by Billy Chapin. But Shelley Winters as Willa Harper and Evelyn Varden as Icey Spoon, are all gaga over Reverend Powell and for one of them it will be too late when the illusion is finally dispelled.Director Laughton works light with echoes of German Expressionism to rival the labors of Welles, according to Cinematographer Stanley Cortez. The tale he weaves starts out a starry eyed bedtime story for kids. After that, it swoops down to chronicle a self styled angel avenging the wages of lust before moving through enough Gothic Horror to fuel a Frankenstein movie. But it does not stop there; gradually eddying out into the territory of Mark Twain where the reckoning of a moral resides. Here we find Rachel Cooper awaiting John Harper and Sally Jane Bruce as Pearl Harper who have barely escaped the clutches of the murderous Powell to sail off to a fate as yet unknown. She reveals herself as a community protector with enough moral authority to be immune to the wiles of this 'man of God', while he intones his hymn of malevolence into the summer night air.The music composed by Walter Schumann is at times harsh and strident. It stops just short of bathos and at other times teases itself out into a wading and wafting elegance that takes the viewer into an unexpected direction for the resolution of the film. At this point, the film ends much as it began; with the horror of the world revealed and recognized for what it is without the fey magic of childhood corrupted or shattered. This film is superlatively competent for a first time director, and it is regrettable that the lack of commercial and critical success for this project discouraged Charles Laughton from taking on anymore projects. For it now appears that the viewers as well as the critics were not fully aware of the hidden treasures within this childhood tale of the boogeyman that posterity appears to regard more and more with increasing kindness.",

            "content": "A lot of film scholars who have labeled THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER a true representative of its genre, a true 'film noir' highlight its atmospheric uniqueness and the impact of its visual feeling. Yet, when viewing the gloomy, psychologically tensed production, it is necessary to take into consideration its novel source, its screenwriter and the director who was deservedly noted at the time as the stage and screen actor. While the source novel by Davis Grubb is a 'well planned, strongly constructed story' (Bruce Crowther), the movie is 'a profoundly American film' (Margaret Atwood) which naturally takes liberties with its literary source and reveals much of the director Charles Laughton - the screenwriter James Agee's collaboration. What results from their individual visions?Actually, let me first consider CHARLES LAUGHTON who reveals much of himself through the creative imagination. Bruce Crowther nicely notices the innovation and rarity of his style. He says: \"There is much that is pure Laughton: his decision to include farcical moments (...); his vision is a powerful and unifying presence, which lifts the finished product far above the norm for the period in which it was made.\" Laughton's experience from viewing German Expressionist films of the 1920s is clearly haunting and affecting THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, the only film he directed. This Expressionist nature was one of the reasons why the film was not popular initially. The American vision along with the European one --- something ordinary viewers did not expect...Nevertheless, JAMES AGEE, the screenwriter, offers equally much from himself and his own experience of the Depression years in the USA. He highlights the aspects of poverty in society and its impact on family life, on the upbringing of kids and the notion of justice. The movie, though it is a thriller with rather clear representation of good and evil, addresses the most significant interpretations of human behaviors. Apart from the background facts, however, we can say that THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is still entertaining and appealing to many genre fans. What makes it so convincing are foremost......performances and THE PERFORMANCE by Robert Mitchum that make the film a highly recommended cinema production. Gordon Gow, in Films and Filming (1975), stated that Mitchum's portrayal of Preacher Harry Powell was 'arguably the best of his career to date.' Laughton recalled a very good cooperation with the actor noting Mitchum as the best actor he ever worked with. The role of a villain, a hunter whose night reigns, the incarnation of evil portrayed in a unique manner lacking any false clich\u00e9s or useless expressionist dialogs. Not psychological, do not look for much psychology in his portrayal. Yet, within his bravura performance, he manifests HATE over LOVE. What is this HATE? Hard to express with words...everyone must see it. And other performances...John and Pearl are portrayed by talented young actors Billie Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce whom we find entirely 'real' as characters. Shelley Winters incarnates naiveness as the doomed widow Willa Harper. The person who is always mentioned referring to THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is the silent movie star, Lillian Gish whom Charles Laughton and James Agee cast in the film having seen some D.W. Griffith's movies. Consequently, the value of the film is incredibly raised like of some other movies of the 1950s. Here, she incarnates goodness as Miss Cooper being a 'strong tree with branches for many birds.' She provides an important depiction of the film's morale, the film's beginning and end. Furthermore, she strongly contrasts with the hunter, Mitchum's character, which occurs worth considering in more details.While the preacher keeps talking about the Bible he knows perfectly, Miss Cooper keeps acting according to the Word of God. The same source yet different targets. Mr preacher vs Ms Cooper is like wolf vs lamb, hate vs love. That is symbolically presented in the scene when he sings 'leaning on the everlasting arms' and her words concentrate on 'lean on Jesus' - though it does not manifest the film noir characteristic of the movie, it seems very important to mention that aspect. But the character who manifests the sense of justice and mercy is John's - father and impostor...both he cannot see suffering. That goes with the conclusion about the little ones.Another of the film's merits is its haunting cinematography by Stanley Cortez and the atmospheric images of animals who supply children's bitter experience with tranquility. Truly 'dark' night...one of the darkest films you ever see but extremely effective. The scene when John and Pearl escape on a barge sailing down the river with the song about a fly and the animals, including rabbits, a frog, sheep and an owl observe them is AWESOME. Consider the use of the spiderweb's image focused by the camera. The light and shadow reach the climax of viewers' attention, the viewers are led into the world of the children where animals and nature are ever present in their simple, yet so important dreams. Among the great cinematography, the scenes that stand out are the shot of Willa's body in the water, Harry's shadow in the kids' room, the wedding night with the use of mirror reflection. Finally, a note must be made of Walter Schumann's score and a musical motif of Sibelius' s 'Valse Triste' in the scene of Willa's death.Seemingly a simple film about good and evil, about goodies and baddies and the victory of LOVE over HATE; yet it has so much to offer. A real noir picture with some complex psychology; a motion picture which appears to be the single voice with the children, their nights and the way they cope with them. Margaret Atwood nicely puts a rhetorical question: \"if it's the night of the hunter, what will it be the day of, once that morning sun comes up?\"a day of a giver and receiver leaning on each other's arms?",

Charles Laughton's film is not perfect. I suspect that it might even have taken away from the beauty of the movie if it was perfect. Like all Noir it leans toward melodrama, and like all Noir the acting can often seem overdone. But the cinematography in this film more than makes up for any flaws that might exist. In that sense it is perfect Film Noir. There is a dreamlike quality that seems to echo early German Expressionist film, in which the world that you're looking at doesn't quite seem real and you're left you with the feeling that you're in a kind of beautiful nightmare. There are images of children floating down the river on a skiff that has elements of Huckleberry Finn, yet with a more ghostlike surreal quality. We see Robert Mitchum's villainous preacher cast in impossible shadow as he rides a stolen horse and sings the same old hymn over and over again. That same hymn and that same impossible shadow laid over top of a clear image is used later on when Mitchum sits singing in the front yard of house while the protective old woman with a shotgun in her lap, played by Lillian Gish, rocks back and forth and sings along with the man she is in silent battle with. Images like these, or like that of Shelly Winters' body, with flowing hair in perfect sync with the surrounding seaweed, seen almost angel like at the bottom of the river are what make this movie a masterpiece. Yes, as I said, there are flaws. There are places where the film seems a little silly. But the overall effect is hauntingly beautiful and Night of the Hunter is a darkly wondrous painting that, if you haven't seen, you absolutely should see. You won't forget Night of the Hunter. You can't forget Night of the Hunter. That may not be the only thing to mark a great film. But it definitely should be one of them. And I think that makes Night of the Hunter more than worthy of the title of Film Noir Masterpiece.",

A great understanding about his characters feelings and temptations, Robert Mitchum shows us how it's done. Seemed as a man of belief and kindness, he shows us the nasty side of how humans really can be. The directing is out of the ordinary, too bad this movie wasn't to popular back then and slapped Charles Laughton across the face as he swore never to direct a film ever again, sadly enough since this is a masterpiece.

The only movie directed by one of my all-time favorite actors, Charles Laughton, it was the critical and financial failure of this film that so discouraged him that he never made another movie, and sadly would not live long enough to see this one recognized in retrospect as a true masterpiece of American cinema. The movie stars, as the utterly unforgettable villain Harry Powell, that king of film noir, Robert Mitchum, who gives both a terrifying performance and one like no other in his career before or since. As the mirror image and foil to his Godless evil, the movie also features my favorite silent-film actor, the incomparable Lillian Gish, and the musical score and bravely expressionist black & white cinematography are of particular note, as well. I'd also credit that great critic and author, James Agee, for adapting the screenplay, but his alcoholism was so close to ending his life by this time, the writing should also be attributed to Mr. Laughton. And while giving credit where due, Mitchum himself directed the two children to their performances. If you've never seen \"The Night of The Hunter,\" then you can't claim to have seen all great movies of the twentieth century. So you really ought to. See it!",

            "content": "\"Night of the Hunter\" has probably most noticeably left its legacy in \"Cape Fear\", where DeNiro has \"love\" and \"hate\" tattooed on his knuckles in the same as Robert Mitchum's character Rev. Harry Powell has here. This is however the better of the two.The story is fairly simple. Ben Harper is arrested after getting his young daughter, Pearl, to hide the money he just stole. Powell, in prison, gets Harper to tell him that there's money at his house and Powell goes to them and insinuates himself with Harper's wife, Willa, in a bid to find out where the money is. But the young son, John, refuses to buy into Powell's nice-guy act and from there things progress.The stand-out here is Robert Mitchum's portrayal of Powell. He steals the camera and the scenes he is in. There's an air of sheer power and will about him, that tells you he *will* get what he wants. The magic is that the character is a psychopath but one that is actually believable - no gibbering, axe-wielding maniac - but a cold, ruthless man. However the Harper kids credit themselves remarkably well - none of this smart-ass trite that Hollywood forces upon us today, but smart, resourceful, determined and yet still children who can be frightened and aren't sure of the way of things except their father telling them never to reveal the location of the money.The direction has been noted here and it works pretty well. There's some nice long lingering shots, particularly one of Powell on a horse in the distance, but also intense, claustrophobic shots as the kids hide out in the cellar. And yet we're also given nice, gentle settings in the later river scenes. This all helps effectively set the mood of the movie.\"Night of the Hunter\" has aged very well, because it still manages to induce fear in these times of blood-soaked gore. It's a credit to the team and the actors that Mitchum is one of the most memorable villains that I've seen on screen in a long time. Well worth watching - 8.3/10",

It's the story of a boy and his little sister whose father stole some money and hid it in the girl's doll, warning them never to tell. The father goes to prison where his cellmate, a preacher who also happens to be a serial killer, overhears him mumbling in his sleep about hiding the money. The preacher, played magnificently by Robert Mitchum, is released from prison and begins a quest to find the stolen loot. The children's' flight from Mitchum is one of the most magical sequences ever put on film. I struggled with how I was going to describe this very strange motion picture, and then it came to me: This film is basically about love and hate and how they intertwine in our hearts. Exactly!

During his incarceration his cell mate is talking about hidden money in his sleep, Mitchum discovers that his cell mate's kids know where the money is. Upon release from jail, he tracks down his wife and marries her so he can get to the kids. Mitchun is the ultimate boogie man in this movie. He plays the character that we were all afraid of when we were kids. This movie alternates between horror/thriller and fantasy. The legendary Lillian Gish is the guardian angel in the movie, she runs a boarding house for orphaned children. The black and white photography of this films works in its advantage because it gives the film a very mystic and surreal quality. It is very reminiscent of the German expressionistic films of the silent era. The sets in this film remind me of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and many F.W Murnau silent films.This was the only directorial effort by actor Charles Laughton due to its box office failure. 1950's audiences could not accept a psycho religious fanatic that stalked children.

            "content": "Judging from the most recent IMDb user reviews, this is a film that produces very strong reactions from viewers, both positive and negative, with very few in between.The film's success is the result of a combination of Mr. Laughton's brilliant direction, Stanley Cortez's remarkable cinematography, and some great acting by Robert Mitchum, Lillian Gish, and many of the supporting cast members, including James Gleason in a very unusual role and Evelyn Varden as the very disagreeable Icey Spoon. No subtlety lies in that name. As far as child actors go, Billy Chapin is very decent and even Sally Jane Bruce isn't as bad as I have seen, and, through the years, I have witnessed some terrible child acting.Mitchum's villain here is very different from that of Max Cady, the menacing scoundrel he portrays in the original \"Cape Fear\" (1962). The deranged, false minister, Harry Powell, is deliberately depicted as an incompetent buffoon rather than the cool, calculating Cady. I'll never understand the many negative comments here about Mitchum as an actor. I recently saw him in \"The Enemy Below\" and was once again very impressed by his performance. If I allowed the personal lives and opinions of actors to influence my views of their professional abilities, what movies would there be to watch? None!There are many unique, artistic touches by both the director and the cinematographer that should be mentioned, including the beautiful shots of the natural world which directly contradict the ugliness, evil and ignorance that often thrive in our \"civilized\" human world, the repeated use of dark shadows that ominously warn of Powell's impending presence even before he appears, and the haunting children's rhymes that are embedded within the distinctive and even idiosyncratic music of Walter Schumann.As in the case of \"Inherit the Wind\", this film does not attack true faith but rather the corruption and subversion of it. In this instance, the intense hatred, brutality, and perversion festering within Powell are starkly contrasted against the kindness, unselfishness, and internal fortitude of Rachel Cooper (Gish) with the innocence of impressionable children caught in between as they are forced to grapple with the two opposing forces of an unpredictable world. As Henry Drummond prevails at the end of \"Inherit the Wind\" with his quiet but genuine faith concealed from the public eye, Rachel is the one who prevails at the end, so all is well in the universe.Charles Laughton once described this film, unfortunately his one and only work as a director, as \"a nightmarish sort of Mother Goose tale.\" I couldn't possibly describe this extraordinary cinematic adventure any better.",

Lillian Gish also stars as Rachel Cooper.The movie was filmed in black and white in the styles and motifs of German Expressionism (bizarre shadows, stylized dialogue, distorted perspectives, surreal sets, odd camera angles) to create a simplified and disturbing mood that reflects the sinister character of Powell, the nightmarish fears of the children, and the sweetness of their savior Rachel.My love of German expressionism is strong, and this was indeed the first thing I noticed about \"Hunter\". While the angles were not as sharp as they could be, the colors (if you can call black and white \"colors\") are very stark, and the use of shadows adds to a menacing image. Mitchum is not the most terrifying actor, but filmed in such a way to inspire real fear... and his \"hate\" side vastly overpowers his \"love\" side.This film has influenced later directors such as David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Terrence Malick, Jim Jarmusch, the Coen brothers, and Spike Lee.

I love classic cinema, even the bad movies, they are sometimes more entertaining than the \"good\" ones. Every now and then I come across a film that wont leave my brain, it haunts me, and it rolls around and around in my head. I came in to the \"Night of the Hunter\" with very little expectations, and even at the end of it, I was not certain what I was thinking about it. I didn't start to realize the effect it had on me until I went to sleep.I was haunted by images of the Preacher in my dreams, \"Everlasting Arms\" played over and over in my head. I woke up multiple times terrified, only to fall back asleep to dreams that just felt really off. Based on that, I will never watch this film ever again. This movie stays with you the way the original \"Bad Seed\" should have, and the way the original \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" has stayed with me even to this day. Both of those films came after \"Night of the Hunter\", if anything, it is because of this film that they exist.I have seen very few films from the 1950's or prior, or later for that matter, with such taught and tight atmosphere. Certainly there are very few films from the period that deal with childhood trauma. The scene where the Preacher gets arrested in the same way the young boy's father father did at the beginning, and the boy throws the money at him the preacher, but trying to give it back to his dad, that is a flashback, he already had PTSD by that point, and it is quite possibly the most disturbing scene, at least for me, I cried.I don't really have much else to say, I feel anything else I say will 100% spoil the film for others. I cannot say for certain if anyone else will have near the after affects I did, in fact, I doubt they will. Either way, this is a beautifully filmed, well-acted, and well-scripted movie with a very unique sense of atmosphere, especially for the time of it's release, and it is very easy to see how it probably affected every single thriller released after it. It is either to sit there and say the characters are not fleshed out enough, but honestly, that is missing the point.God Bless ~Amy",

All of the women are depicted as fickle, easily-tricked idiots with no ability to tell right from wrong, good from evil.  The editing is clumsy, like most everything else.

On his release he hunts it down with his preacher-man charm, insinuating himself into the community and then the family.Very rich film that does all sorts of beautiful things and has a lot to say, but in the end I'd call it a dark fairytale. The opening scene with the old woman and the children is echoed at the end, the preacher is played in a cartoon way (some say hammy, but Mitchum is just a force of nature), and he bullies his way with ease through the stock characters of small town America.There's realism in the era's poverty among God fearing respectable folk, and a special sympathy for the plight of abandoned children. But it really kicks off with the slaying of a martyr, followed by a nightmare underwater scene and a starlight river-escape sequence, creating an eerie and peculiar menace.Many child performances, all good - especially the little girl, whose sweetness and gravity come across well. Pace is good too, even as the story shifts through different worlds - from depravity to dissoluteness to domestic bliss. There are implausible moments, and if there's any hamming it's in the over-emphatic ending - although at that stage I felt some foreshadowing of Blue Velvet. But there's no ducking how harsh life is, not a false note rung, and it gains strength from the irony that encrusts the hypocritical townsfolk.The stand out qualities are cinematography and music. The contrasts and silhouettes are gorgeous, but it's the music that really delivers the eeriness - at first through weird nursery rhymes, and then with Mitchum's chilling baritone hymn and the fairy-like wind instruments. That makes it a classic.Overall, fascinating movie.",

            "content": "\"The Night of the Hunter\" was a strange and resentful film around its time of release and it still is \u2013 and will forever remain \u2013 a strange and resentful film now. But at the same time this is also one of the most powerfully compelling, nightmarish and impeccably flawless masterpieces ever accomplished. Perhaps the world wasn't ready when it was first unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences in 1955, which sadly led to an abrupt ending of Charles Laughton's career as a director before it was even properly launched, but sixty years onwards it is now righteously regarded as a bona fide monument of cinema. \"The Night of the Hunter\" fundamentally is a simple and straightforward \"good-versus-evil\" tale, but the execution is unique and every tiniest touch, whether coming from the cast or the crew, contributes to the marvelous wholesome. The film was made in the fifties, but the story takes place during the depression era of the thirties. Practically all other contemporary films tried their best to look modern or even futuristic, and never before did any director attempt to make his film look as old-fashioned as possible! The stylish black & white photography is gloomy and sober, while the excessive use of moonlight shadows and odd interiors makes the film look almost expressionist (and reminiscent to many of the films in which director Charles Laughton delivered unforgettable acting performances). The intellectual but dangerously psychotic preacher Harry Powell roams through the land, with the words \"love\" and \"hate\" tattooed on his knuckles, and leaving a trace of savagely murdered widows behind him. He crosses the path of family man Ben Harper who, out of desperation, robbed a bank and killed two people. Harper is executed for his crimes, but the loot remains missing and only his two young children know where it's hidden. Powell relentless pursues the two children, first through marrying and terrorizing their poor widowed mother, and later through stalking the good-hearted Rachel Cooper who looks after orphaned children. \"The Night of the Hunter\" is incredibly suspenseful, much more so than any movie nowadays, due to the grim atmosphere, the mysterious dialogs, the unpredictable twists in the plot and the oddly inserted images of riverside wildlife! But most of all, \"The Night of the Hunter\" is unforgettably suspenseful thanks to the indescribable acting performances; most notably the one from Robert Mitchum as preacher Harry Powell. As depicted by Mitchell, Harry Powell inarguably is the most petrifying and loathsome, yet fascinating movie villain in history. Any actor would refuse to accept such a role, as it is a genuine career-killer, but for natural born Hollywood rebel Robert Mitchum it was the perfect choice, and probably the highlight of his life. Harry Powell is inspired by real-life serial killer Harry Powers, but it was Mitchum who turned the character into an immortal cinematic monster. He's Bluebeard, the Big Bad Wolf and the utmost disturbing religious freak all united into one charismatic preacher! I hate to mention the also stellar performances of legendary big-screen ladies Shelley Winters and Lilian Gish as mere footnotes, but Robert Mitchum entirely owns this movie.",

The premise is slightly interesting and felt like something Hitchcock could have done wonders with, but when it came to the characters I just couldn't have cared less. After about thirty minutes of trying and trying I realized that it was going to be this huge chore to get through the rest, and that's what it was. Robert Mitchum was such a drag, a performance I was really looking forward to but couldn't have been more flat to me. He wasn't intimidating or interesting at all.The second we meet him you know exactly who he is and exactly what he's going to be like. There was no sense of surprise or fear in the film at all. I didn't care about the kids and I wasn't frightened by Mitchum so the whole thing fell incredibly flat. There were some really nice images though, incredibly shot with great bits of symbolism throughout (in particular I liked the one shot when the kids were on the boat and we saw them through a spider web).The whole thing really wasn't working for me and then came the final act, which was just this disaster of out-of-character actions and dreadful attempts at comedy. It was this despicable fall of a bad film to a horrific one. All of this culminating in the gooey-sugar ending that made me feel like I was about to get diabetes.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton directed only one movie in his illustrious career.....but what a movie it was!! Try to visualize, if you can, a Mother Goose story adapted by Stephen King and filmed by David Lynch, and you'd got a pretty good idea of what to expect from THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Based on the novel by Davis Grubb, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER provides Robert Mitchum with his most memorable role, and he knocks it out of the ballpark.Laughton first learned of the book from his producer friend Paul Gregory, who convinced the great actor that this was the ideal project to make his directorial debut with. Although he directed many stage plays and a television version of \"The Caine Mutiny Court-martial\" -with Henry Fonda and a young James Garner- Laughton was nervous about sitting in the director's chair on a movie set.To adapt Grubb's novel, Laughton turned to James Agee, the great critic and occasional screenwriter. Toiling on what would be his final work, the alcoholic Agee churned out a script that was three times the length of what was expected. Laughton ended up rewriting it himself without any public recognition, giving the late Agee sole writing credit, probably out of respect for his memory.Playing a villainous man of God was a risky proposition for any actor in the 1950s, but Mitchum's existing persona was that of a good guy with a touch of bad boy about him. Plus, back in the late Forties, Mitchum served a short prison stretch for possession of marijuana, so if that didn't derail his career, then playing a murderous preacher shouldn't do too much damage.Preacher Harry Powell is the quintessential wolf in sheep's clothing, a Depression era Bluebeard who courts and marries widows, then murders them and confiscates whatever money they've got. Powell has an Old Testament repulsion towards of lust, accompanied by a pathological hatred for women who openly flaunt their sexuality. Arrested for car theft, Preacher Powell is sentenced to thirty days in prison, where during his stretch he will meet someone who could provide him with more ill-gotten gains.Ben Harper is a convicted father of two condemned to death for killing a pair of police officers during a bank robbery. Prior to his capture, Harper managed to conceal the $10,000 he stole, and it has never been recovered. Sitting on death row, his cellmate is none other than Harry Powell, who unsuccessfully tries to pry the loot's whereabouts from the condemned man.Following Ben Harper's execution, Harry Powell finishes serving his sentence, and immediately takes a train to Harper's town, where the dead man's next of kin are treated as lepers by the townsfolk. The scandal of their father's crime has affected the lives of his children, John and Pearl, who were forced to withdraw from school because of it.",

But, for its time, it must have sent some chills down the spines of its viewers. This is not a film directed toward the realist; it is an artistic film. Like \"Blade Runner\" its point is not to come up with a complicated plot or rapidly dazzling dialogue - it is meant to create moods and feeling. For its time, it does this effectively with hauntingly beautiful music (as when \"Pearl\" sings in the row boat as she and her brother run away from home) and images (as with the scene of the freshly killed mother sitting in her car at the bottom of the river with her hair flowing in the current). I also liked the image of the preacher dressed in black (including a hat) riding on a white horse, patiently riding down the riverside path after his prey, singing. Psycho!The film is perceptive. It opens with a Biblical prophecy admonishing folks to beware of false prophets who come as wolves dressed up in sheep's clothing. What could be a better fulfilment of this than someone within (rather than outside of) the church - a preacher, a psychotic one at that. Robert Mitchum plays this evil one stalking two children whose father left them with a large sum of money. A hauntingly beautiful film. 10/10",

            "content": "\"The Night of the Hunter\" is an American black-and-white movie from 1955, so this one is already almost 65 years old and this combines drama, crime and noir in its slightly over 1.5 hours. The director is Charles Laughton and this is one of only two filmmaking efforts from his career as he was a prolific, Oscar-winning actor most of all. The script is by the tragically short-lived James Agee, also an Oscar nominee and Pulitzer Prize winner and he adapted the novel by Davis Grubb, most likely Grubb's most notable. A bit surprisingly to me, this film went completely under the awards radar back then and all the attention it got came much later thanks to how well it aged. Also, the entire cast did not receive any kind of awards recognition. Mitchum totally would have deserved a lead actor nomination though. He is the movie. And during the lengthy sequence in the second half in which he is out of the picture for a while, the film really went south quality-wise until he reappeared. The ending is also rather forgettable because he is not in it. And there's more big names: Oscar winner (then still only nominee) Winters, Oscar nominee Gleason, silent film icon Lillian Gish, Golden Globe winner Peter Graves. By the way, Sally Jane Bruce is still alive today, the actress who plays the young girl. She did not have a prolific film career afterwards. Billy Chapin, who played her brother and really had a lot of screen time, is sadly dead already now and he acted a lot more than his on-screen sister, mostly on television, but his career also ended before adulthood, a highly prolific child actor.Okay, now for the story. It is fairly simple. A man gets executed and leaves behind not just his wife and 2 children, but also the secret where he hid a huge stack of money. A murderous con artist and widow killler (Mitchum) wants the money, so he approaches the criminal's widow and gets to marry her. But there is nothing else on his mind except the money and he would have killed the two kids instantly if they had not known the secret. Winters' character is not so lucky, however. And that was one of the aspects I liked. There is no unexpected sudden rescue for her. When the kids lead Mitchum's character in the cellar, he won't let them get away too easily. Admittedly, he does act a bit clumsy the longer he chases them with how he keeps stumbling and falling down. This happens when the kids get away on the river. This point is also a crucial break for me. Afterwards, like I already talked about earlier, the film does get a bit worse and the story of this old lady taking care of all these kids really did not make me curious whatsoever sadly. So I was also not impressed by her eventually managing to have the man arrested and I was just wondering myself why she did not call the cops earlier. I honestly would have preferred an unhappy ending here because it just would have been more realistic. Let's be honest here, we got a professional killer and he fails to get even with an old lady and some kids. This made hardly any sense in my opinion. Sure Mitchum's character is not a flawless murderer whatsoever, but this challenge should not have been too big for him. Actually, it would have worked even better with the owl-rabbit metaphor we see early on, but yeah maybe you can also see the police as the owl in this scenario and him as the rabbit. I don't know.Aside from that, there are a handful fairly funny moments too, some of them intended, others not so much. The unintentional comedy comes surely from the way men and women communicated in here. Boy, if a film like this had been made today, feminists and social justice warriors would be up in arms. But it is actually pretty refreshing to see a film like this not having to care at all about politcal correctness and same rights for everybody. Winters' character is the best example. Same about the young woman falling for the killer at the end. On a completely unrelated side note, it would be nice if the doll being the place where the money is hidden had not been mentioned here on imdb. Back to the comedy: The old lady who really wants to see Winters' character marry Mitchum's is pretty hilarious as well, but this time in an intentional comedic approach I am sure. Still, this is obviously not a comedy movie by any means. I have not read the book it is based on, but I am sure they included the last half hour the way it was depicted here, so I cannot really blame the director or screenwriter here. It just didn't do much for me. As for the old fisherman character, I am not sure I liked him. He was clearly one of the good guys, but he adds very little. He is a victim of circumstance entirely you could say. He finds the dead woman in the car and is scared he will be accused of the murder. Then he drinks himself to sleep and is unable to help the boy in a scene where you certainly had the idea that he might have been of great help, but the opposite was the case and I liked that approach, so I guess it is good they included the old alcoholic. By the way, alcohol is frequently used for comedy purposes here too just like it was common in the old days as we have several character take a sip in-between or mistake alcohol (intentionally) for the sweet in your coffee.That should be pretty much all. Mitchum's stellar performance makes this one worth seeing, even if it is never really a great watch or edge-of-seat material the way I hoped it could be. Still I am glad to have gotten the chance to see this one on the big screen. I can kinda see why so many people still like it so many years later. But sadly, it also has some weaknesses like the parts near the end about religion and, most of all, Christmas I found genuinely disappointing and they did not impress me on an emotional level whatsoever. So back to Mitchum. When we see him early on, he is fun enough already shamelessly whistling and singing about his cold-blooded murders. The reference about his hands and what was written on there was okay, but not really as impactful as it could have been story-wise. There are other moments that don't look bad per se, but would have needed a better or more frequent elaboration and inclusion because they really offered the possibility of something good, something great even, but it just felt too much for the sake of it without this proper elaboration I would have liked to see. So this film gets a thumbs-up from me, but not an enthusiastic one. The rating here on imdb seems to be a bit too high in my opinion because of the decline in quality during the second half. I still think you should give it a go unless you really dislike old black-and-white films.",

Mitchum doesn't have to rant and rave; he merely has to look in the camera (and the camerawork is outstanding in this film), and he can easily frighten the viewer with just one glance. Laughton, the director, sometimes uses a heavy hand (particularly with the music) in some scenes, but for the most part, the film is very well done.",

James Agee's script is a mediocre stage play with virtually NO appreciation for the difference in stage and screen.\"Night of the Hunter\" is so \"artfully\" self conscious that it stands no chance.Whew! Everybody's acting up a storm. From the disembodied opening (why on EARTH was that ever thought captivating?) to Lillian Gish's stagey last biblical lines about the children abiding (which she delivers, as always, with utterly honest conviction and simplicity)? Ridiculous ill-thought-out logic, lengthy boring \"artistic\" shots of the kids \"skiffing\" downriver accompanied by, one guesses, \"symbolic\" shots of riverbank frogs and nature-shots of night owls swooping down on little bunnies . . . on and on . . . endlessly \"symbolic\" of . . . nothing in particular.Lillian Gish is, as always, superlative in the role she's given. Robert Mitchum does Robert Mitchum doing Robert Mitchum. Mediocre actor. Lots of \"bad boy charisma\" carryover from his then-\"scandalous\" but really tepid private life. Arrogant monosyllabic jerk in interviews. The most boring interview in Dick Cavett's archive.Finally, who cares? If Mitchum thought so little of his profession and the films he made (except, apparently, for \"Ryan's Daughter\" at the end of his career), why are WE supposed to worship his work as anything but \"well-paid\" junk as he prefers? Truth? Robert Mitchum was right. He wasn't that good.\"Cape Fear?\" HELL yes!

            "content": "Oscar-winning actor Charles Laughton helmed only one film during his prestigious 34-year career, but \"The Night of the Hunter\" constituted a tour-de-force effort. Robert Mitchum heads a stellar cast as an insane religious psychopath named Harry Powell who cavorts about the countryside and preys on gullible widows. After a poor farmer Ben Harper (Peter Graves of \"The Five Man Army\") robs a bank, he convinces his son John (Billy Chapin of \"Tension at Table Rock\") to hide the loot. The State Troopers arrive not long afterward and arrest Ben. When they slam his father belly down on the ground to cuff him, John watches in horror and has a fit. Ben is sentenced to hang for his crimes; he robbed a man and shot him dead. While he waits to be hanged, Ben shares a cell with Powell. Powell has the words love and hate tattooed onto the knuckles of both hands, love on the right hand, and hate on the left. Powell likes to tell a Biblical story about the triumph of love over hate. Harry knows that Ben Harper stole $10-thousand so after Ben swings, he visits Ben's family. Initially, he romances Ben's widowed wife, Willa Harper (Shelley Winters of \"Cleopatra Jones\"), but discovers she knows nothing about what happened to the $10-thousand. Powell puts on airs like a wounded minister of God. Willa's friend and employer, Icey Spoon (Evelyn Varden of \"D\u00e9sir\u00e9e), goads her into accepting Harry's proposal of marriage. The honeymoon is a travesty. Harry rebukes Willa about the sins of the flesh and what God intended for a good woman to do. He moves into her house, and he embarks on a ruthless relationship with Willa's children. Eventually, he drowns Willa in the river. \"Since You Went Away\" lenser Stanley Cortez contributes some atmospheric black & white photography, especially the sight of Shelley Winters tied up in an old automobile at the bottom of the river with her hair streaming peacefully in the currents. James Gleason is effectively cast as an elderly river rat, Birdie Steptoe, who is John's only friend. Uncle Birdie has repaired John' s fishing boat, and John and he go out and fish. Birdie is fishing alone one day when he hooks something. When he peers over the side into the clear watery depths below, he grimaces at the horrible sight of Willa sitting tied-up in the Model T Ford. Meanwhile, young John suspects that Powell is up to no good from the get-go, and he doesn't tell him a thing. Unfortunately, John has to keep a lid on his loquacious little sister Pearl Harper (Sally Jane Bruce of \"Kids Will Be Kids\") who takes a liking to the evil Powell. You see John has stuffed the loot in his sister's baby doll Miss Jenny. After Powell has murdered their mother, John and Pearl set out in his john boat on the river, barely a step ahead of Powell. The action unfolds during the Great Depression, and our heroes wind up in the care of an older woman, Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish of \"The Birth of a Nation\"), who is mighty handy with a shotgun. Laughton shot most of \"The Night of the Hunter\" on a sound stage, and Hilyard M. Brown's art direction and Alfred E. Spencer's set decoration are nothing short of superb. Mitchum is simply unforgettable as the evil preacher who rides a white horse, singing a hymn \"Leaning On the Everlasting Arms,\" as he searches the countryside for John and Pearl who are on the run from him.",

If someone where to question how a black and white film can be aesthetically beautiful, have them watch this movie. Stylistically it looks very much like a Film-Noir. Low-key lighting is found throughout with high contrast characters. Key scenes of the film are done with one or both characters completely lost in shadows. It's amazing to think that such tension can be built visually with a film this old.Going into this film I didn't have any expectations, which usually helps, but walking out it was instantly a favorite of mine and I look forward to watching it again in order to grasp more of the symbolism that is found throughout. Reverend Harry Powell is one of the scariest villains I can recall and it's all in lighting and symbolism. Under less capable hands, Powell could have become a caricature of a villain, but Charles Laughton instead develops an intense albeit fairly one-dimensional villain that is able to overcome his lack of depth and still provide a very threatening character.It's of no surprise that this film has inspired countless directors in their films.

The story line drops us down to follow antagonist Preacher Harry Powell (loosely based on real serial killer Harry Powers) but we end up accompanying protagonists John Harper (Billy Chapin) and little sister Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce). The scenes get better and better as the movie rolls on, and by the time Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) makes her grand entrance well into the film, you'll probably have already grabbed your handkerchief or shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears, several times over. Back in the day, HUNTER had rarely been spoken of, when it comes to the description, \"classic.\" A powerful and emotionally disturbing film of children being tracked down, which made its debut in the 1950's, Charles Laughton took an emotional gamble, believing that people yearned for a gripping story on the silver screen. HUNTER was before its time; film goers didn't embrace its style. Perhaps audiences were more interested in the color films and widescreen presentations, which were the rage of the time. It's been over half a century since, and HUNTER is an opportunity for you to watch from a child's perspective as John and Pearl depend on each other to survive. **Mild Spoiler** Their classmates had already begun making fun at their expense. And the adults they had trusted, fall for \"Preacher\" Powell's stories, like love vs hate. **End Spoiler**The music and singing of the lullabies is absolutely ethereal. By the time Ms. Cooper appears, you simply want to embrace her, yourself. Ms. Gish's performance is as impeccable as Mr. Mitchum's. I watched HUNTER again in 2011, and felt some sadness for how Charles Laughton felt as his film was largely ignored. It's taken some decades, Mr. Laughton. But we love your film enough to have it listed as one of the top 250 films of all time. Congratulations.Director of Photography, Stanley Cortez, mastered his shots and lighting. In an era of extraordinary digital manipulation and CGI, watching some of the scenes (like during the chase) reveal how limited trick photography was at the time. Please, forgive that part of the film, try not to compare them to today's standards, and you'll surely enjoy this better. And if you still have a problem with HUNTER's old-time special effects, then feel free to also compare its rich, deep and moving cinematography with today's uninspiring scenes (i.e., over-the-shoulder shots - you won't see those in HUNTER). You'll also catch the moments of real human tenderness that subtly take place (which seem rare in filmmaking today). Night of the Hunter is a mesmerizing film.Mr. Laughton may have thought it would have been forgotten by the time it ended its theatrical run, but HUNTER has survived and endured.",

This then, is the picture to give you a monstrous case of the willies... Also examined is the notion that the 'power' a child lacks in authoritative terms is often more than made up for in perception. They can see that 'bad' will happen, but have a tough time persuading most of their seniors of it.Neither was the film slow in cottoning onto the whacked-out morality of true religious fundamentalists (sex is wrong, but 'avarice' is just dandy, thanks!) This is a document made in chilling accuracy for 1955; and the best thing about it is that it will hold up perfectly for as long as some folk still have a deep-seated mistrust of strangers, too!",

Maybe they liked the multiple zillion-candle-power lights hidden in the trees along the river, or was it the tiny sliver of the moon that lights the landscape like a searchlight? And for those who endorse the film as an allegory or morality play: Why am I supposed to be sympathetic to children who refuse to divulge the whereabouts of money stolen by their father who murdered two people to get it? The writing is horrible, the acting is awful (which means the directing was awful), the music is appallingly out-of-place. (What is that song that \"Puhhl\" sings as they float down the river?) There is no logic to anything that happens. The best line is from an old woman who says that sex is not something women want, and when she endures it, she just lies back and thinks about her canning.

This movie is WEIRD. OK, it's unlike anything that has ever been made. You just have to sit down and let it do its thing. Yes, the acting seems bad at first but you have to realize that the characters in this movie are more or less symbols and are simple representative colors of a particular human type. This is a pretty neat way of presenting the story. It's unique. Therefore, the delivery and acting is simplified. Why is Shelly Winters character played so idiotically and badly? Because her character is an idiot. OK. It's weird. Let the movie do its thing. The images are excruciating symbolic and there's a certain genius to that. It's so clear cut that perhaps it flies right over most people's heads. If you are not moved by the escape scene on the river with Pearl singing in an adult voice a song that is musically STILL ahead of its time, you're probably pretty jaded and need to let some psychedelic magic into your brain. I know most of you are aging hippies, c'mon let go! Here's some more of the things that bothered the people who hated the movie. Why are there animals on the riverbank while they are floating by? Duh. Take the two little bunnies (animals who are pretty defenseless) for example. Hello, two little kids on a boat? Defenseless animals, anyone? It's profound and beautiful in its simplicity. OK, why does Mitchum not swim after the kids when they are three feet away. Maybe he's afraid of water? Maybe he's just crazy as hell? Hello, he is! Anything he does is going to go against logic because his character is a psychopath! I mean we all love \"putting the lotion in the basket.\" That worked, didn't it? Of course the exposition in the film helped on that one. Well NOTH has no exposition. You shouldn't need it. Why does he say he'll be back after dark to get the kids from Lilian Gish giving her time to call the cops? Uh, he's a nut job. Why does he hoot and scream like a weirdo when he gets shot? 'Cause......he's a homicidal maniac!!!! It's weird and unexpected and makes you feel funny kind of like what a crazy person does.To all you Scrooges, why didn't Marty McFly just get in the Delorian and meet himself at the beginning of the movie and save us all the entertainment? Why didn't the good witch just tell Dorothy to click her heals at the beginning of the movie so we wouldn't have to be entranced by a talking scarecrow? And if Goofy's a dog, how can he own Pluto? I'm just angry that some of the people who dis this movie are the same people who complain about the physics in Star Wars. You probably told your little sister the Easter Bunny wasn't real and that it was just a pagan relic that has nothing to do with Christianity. And you'll probably critique my grammar too.

There are some creepy moments in this movie to be sure, and Robert Mitchum terrorizing two little kids will make you cringe or maybe have you urging them to run. The shot director Charles Laughton captures of Shelley Winters in the lake is excellent, and Mitchum's 'L-O-V-E' on the knuckles of one hand with 'H-A-T-E' on the knuckles of the other is iconic. Oh, and it was fantastic to see 62-year-old Lillian Gish, who turns in a suitably feisty performance.On the other hand, Laughton's direction is heavy-handed and clunky at times, and there are plot moments that just don't seem quite right. The acting ranges from poor to so-so, Mitchum included (though he certainly is a handsome fellow), and the soundtrack is too intrusive, annoyingly so in the jaunty bits. I hated the ending, which breaks out clich\u00e9s like a torch-wielding mob and overdone Biblical verse. The movie was disturbing to audiences in 1955, likely because of the cruelty and evil shown in a man of the cloth, which made it not well received and caused Laughton to never direct again.

That it failed both critically and commercially on its original release is somewhat of a testament to its distinctive visual style. Unfortunately Laughton never made another film as director, which is a great loss, for he brings an intensity to this story that would be lost on many of his contemporaries.The film on paper is a fairly basic cat-and-mouse story, with Mitchum's manic preacher on the trail of two young children who hold the key to the whereabouts of a stash of stolen money. But the film is saturated with religious fervour, and heavy symbolism. Sometimes its laid on with such thick strokes that it does veer into 'grand guignol' melodrama, but at times the imagery is sublime, creating some remarkable tableaux; the dead body on the riverbed, the children marching after Rachel like a mother goose leading her flock, and the incredible night journey down river, with grotesque creatures of the night at the forefront of the screen as the children float silently by. The influence of silent movies, and particularly German expressionism is omnipresent, with an overwrought use of light and shadow, silhouette, and sharp, geometric sets. There are some nods to 'Nosferatu' in Mitchum's performance, and the casting of Gish as the matriarch is surely no coincidence after her legendary performance as 'the mother' in Griffiths' 'Intolerance'. In fact, for the most part,and especially for the key moments, the film could work just as well as a silent, so rich are the pictures on screen.A film ahead of its time by decades, 'Night Of The Hunter' will be tough going for some who find it over-theatrical, and certainly preachy. For others however it is worthy of the 'masterpiece' tag.",

            "content": "Laughton, in his sole directorial effort, got flawless performances all around. Of course, Mitchum has the showiest part and is impossible to forget. But the real star of \"The Night of the Hunter\" is Billy Chapin as John Harper. John's twin moral dilemmas -- remaining loyal to his father, even though his father murdered a couple for $10,000, and his tug-of-war with his \"new\" father, are what drives the plot. Chapin, a busy child actor in the '50s who then left the business completely, is stalwart throughout and conveys the conflict in John very movingly. Study his face -- it's a great lesson in movie acting.The two most emotionally wrenching moments in the film are when the troopers apprehend John's father at the beginning, and then, near the end, when the scene is almost exactly replayed, only with Mitchum's preacher being apprehended. John's conflicts are right up front here: his agony watching his father being beaten and taken away, and then experiencing the same thing when his \"new\" father, who he's been running from, is apprehended in the same manner. In this scene, he see how the preacher, who is simultaneously scary and seductive (especially to women), has partially seduced even John -- so much so that the only way he can end the entire nightmare is to give up the money he'd promised his father he'd never tell about. Great acting, great film making.Interesting side note from last night's TCM presentation: According to Robert Osborne, Jane Darwell was originally cast as Rachel Cooper, but Laughton decided he wanted a smaller women, one who looked almost too small for the shotgun she aims at the preacher. He got that with Lilian Gish; indeed, it's visually striking when she brings her troupe of children into town, because she looks almost small enough to be one of them. Which forces us to ask what the film is getting at when Rachel talks about the abiding nature of children. Another fascinating layer to this wonderful film. (Although I suspect that Laughton, whose career went back to the silent era, was also taken with the idea of importing some of Gish's iconic power into the mix.)",

For examples here I cite the moment when the preacher runs up the stairs after the kids(it looked ridiculously contrived) and the entire climax(pathetically out of place).\"The Night of the Hunter\" for me is just another undeserving \"classic\".

He does not pretend to be God's tool, he knows he is. His sword of truth is his switch blade which he gladly uses on anyone he deems an enemy. He will gladly slit the throat of a ten-year-old in the name of the lord. He easily manipulates Willa Harper(Winters) with pious, honey-dipped platitudes. Willa Harper portrays a soul destitute of common sense. Her foolishness causes her demise and puts her two young children in the hands of a lunatic. Icey Spoon(Varden) represents the most common aspect associated with Christianity. She is worse than a gossiping busy-body singing hymns at a church picnic. Eventually we see a drunken ogre enthusiastically leading a blood-thirsty, lynch mob. Rachel Cooper(Gish) reveals, finally, Christian authenticity. She operates a home for orphans. No better illustration of her genuineness than when she discovers that Ruby had gone to town to be with boys. Her response: \"We all need love Ruby. You were just looking for it in the only way you knew how.\" Charles Laughton didn't direct much. He was certainly a great actor. This film reveals his genius.

Talk about a film that has it all, however watching this lush B&W feature a second time around it just didn't seem as magically brooding as the first encounter. Yeah I couldn't help but admire Robert Mitchum's whole-heartedly chilling chameleon performance that dominates, but my interested really did fade away after the children's stunning late-night boat ride under the glittering stars to get away from the reverend character. This is when Lillian Gish shows up, and while her performance is nothing but respectably good. There's something about this latter end of the story that I didn't find all that compelling or suited to what had gone before it. I think this is were it's ominous edge was starting to wail, to where it's dark dreamlike noir thriller qualities ended up as an metaphorical, morality fairytale that would finish in an all too obvious way.Nonetheless you could only praise the work of actor-turned director Charles Laughton's visionary guidance to wrap around such a strongly creative story of character arcs. His stylistic flourishes are irresistibly hypnotic blending true menace with pure innocence in some abstract, uncanny and haunting imagery. It was a collectively courageous effort to go beyond traditional techniques, and in doing so he enlivens it with it own unique, shadowy illustrative atmosphere helped by the imaginative cinematography and moody score. Billy Chapin and Sarah Jane Bruce were genuinely fitting as the kids. Shelly Winters holds a reasonable turn, but some of the other performances (like the eccentric Evelyn Varden) became overbearingly tainted.

His route to the cash lies through the two children. When he kills their mother (Shelley Winters), the children flee and embark on a strange odyssey, with Mitchum in relentless pursuit. They fall under the protective wing of Rachel Cooper, played by Lillian Gish in an angelic performance, and her battle against Mitchum becomes a mythic one of good vs. evil.This all sounds like it could be overheated and just too much to bear, but it's not. Laughton exhibits a nearly flawless knack for knowing just how to film scenes for maximum impact, and nothing about the film is treacly or sentimental. He gives the film a visual style steeped in German Expressionism, all deep shadows and cock-eyed angles.

            "content": "\"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955) was such a large financial and critical disaster that director Charles Laughton never made another film and stuck to acting (and what performances he gave us!). No single person is expected to be right every time, but the en mass ravaging by critics showed how many people missed the boat; the public too stayed away in droves and helped to stifle a directing career that may have been as remarkable as Orson Welles. For based on the evidence displayed here, the film is an expressionist masterpiece that gives us one of the most startling essays of evil in the shape of Robert Mitchum's Preacher Harry Powell.The script, by the famed film critic and historian James Agee, a man whose writing on film is eminently readable, even when he gets it wrong like with \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), is based on the slim novel by Davis Grubb and has all the child-like simplicity of a fairytale. In the nineteen-thirties, in West Virginia, along the Ohio River, Preacher Harry Powell discovers that the two children of an executed bank robber know where he hid $10,000. Powell marries the widow in a bid to get at the money and sets in motion this extraordinarily film. From Mitchum explaining why his knuckles have \"love\" and \"hate\" tattooed on them, to his crooning of the ominous \"CHILL-dren\" and his effortlessly sinister interpretation of the hymn \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\", we are in the presence of one of the all-time great portrayals of evil seen on the Silver Screen. The acting elsewhere, from Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish to the child actors Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce are all fantastic. Laughton too, inspired by German Expressionism directs brilliantly with more panache and genius than almost any director alive today. The cinematography by Stanley Cortez, who shot Welles's \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942) is gorgeous; in fact, in a 2007 listing of the 100 Most Beautiful Films, \"Cahiers du Cinema\" ranked The Night of the Hunter No. 2., and they're right too. The film also delivers a number of very frightening scenes: the run to the riverboat, the midnight vigil held by Lillian Gish and others. If only all Horror movies were inspired as this. Surfice to say, few other movies have exerted such an influence on other directors (David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Terrence Malick, Jim Jarmusch, the Coen brothers, and Spike Lee) and none have conjured a film quite like this masterpiece.",

Joining its sibling protagonists as their father arrives home with a gunshot wound and a handful of money which he demands they keep secret, the film sees the children attempt to evade the efforts of a suspect preacher to claim their fortune as he successfully ingratiates himself within their community. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of The Night of the Hunter is its titular character, and the thematic concerns addressed through him. Shown early in the film to be the cellmate of the children's father before his execution, Reverend Harry Powell is a villain of extraordinary depth. Quickly betrothing himself to the newly widowed mother, he is charming, charismatic, and utterly confident in his belief that he is an instrument of God. That his status as a preacher is not one he has simply adopted in order to attain his goals introduces to the film the theme of religion and the questions of the evil that can be created when faith is misdirected and dogma misinterpreted. In his own eyes, Powell is conducting the lord's work, the crimes he commits justified, even directly suggested, by the need to continue spreading his faith. It is this unabashed zealotry which endears him to Willa\u2014the children's mother\u2014and her employer Mrs Spoon, who is particularly insistent that Willa settle with a man of God in order to repent for her husband's sins. Powell is a terrifying antagonist, not for the ills he commits, but rather for his belief that they are righteous; that his implementation of such hideous violence is morally vindicated. The deep- seated fury inherent in the preacher is marvellously articulated in the performance of Robert Mitchum, bringing the various stages of the character to life, from benign guardianship to homicidal rage. Mitchum is, however, just one of the film's considerably many facets. Brimming with the visual hallmarks of film noir, the German Expressionist heritage on which the genre so heavily draws is here abundantly apparent. Distorted and surreal angles fill many of the darkly lit sets, their twisting contortions physical realisations of the more sinister side of the film. A particularly memorable sequence sees the children slowly floating down a river as they escape the Reverend, a miasma of natural beauty framing their slow journey in time to the orchestral score. Music, it should be noted, is of crucial importance to the film's effect, hymns used throughout. Powell's regular renditions lend a sombre sense of impending dread, his voice casting him as the omnipresent force of inescapable terror. A chorus of unseen children provides the antithesis to his haunting song, their innocent chanting endowing the film with the quality of an ethereal fantasy, providing an escape from the depths of darkness which fill the film so heavily.Part extraordinarily dark film noir, part childhood adventure fantasy, The Night of the Hunter raises important questions about the darker side of religious faith and the chilling ways in which people condone their actions through their belief. Expressing as much through its effulgent lighting as through its haunting themes, it is a film of incredible visual appeal.",

I was prepared for a noir masterpiece but what I got was a handful of great scenes lodged like diamonds in the rough in an otherwise forgettable picture. I'm glad that I watched the movie, though, because the good stuff is *really* good, even though the film, as a whole, is a disappointment.For one thing, some of the acting is below par. Particularly, the children were pretty poor actors, which is a constant irritation since they are prominently featured. I didn't think that Mitchum's performance was as great as others seem to suggest either. In my opinion the standout here is Lillian Gish, not Robert Mitchum.To me the plot is nothing special. Take away the biblical associations and it's basically noir hackwork. Talk all you want about allegory; to me the script isn't successful in making any such statements except in a superficial way.Ah, but then we have the good, nay, great elements of the film. Specifically, the visuals are incredible. The expressionistic style is bold and unforgettable. It's a pity that the other components of the film don't rise up to the same level.I plan to give this one another chance later on but for now I'm going to have to relegate it to the category of promising 'could have beens'.",

            "content": "I don't think we've seen this ever since it, was on local TV Movie, night time slot with all those commercial interruptions. At any rate, I couldn't have been more than 19 years old at the time, and although thought I was real grown up and sophisticated, an awful lot of it surely went over my little old sophomoric head.This evening, November 5, 2007, it was on Turner Classic Movies. We screened it here in our house. At now over 60 years of age and looking at film through more experienced eyes and heart, the whole story and its meaning on multi levels really had begun to make real sense.To begin with, we have a 1920's (?) setting. It appears to be set in the Upper or Mid South, like Kentucky, Tennessee or West Virginia, even. It is definitely small town America with all the trappings of being \"Bible Belt\".The story moves like lightening from the very first. Our rookie Director, Mr. Charles Laughton has made this, his first and only Directorial Job, in contrast to his prolific and outstandingly accomplished run on Stage and Before the Camera's Lense. It is truly a shame, Charles! Judging by this solo production, it surely leaves the Movie Going Public to wonder, what could have been? The sudden appearance of an itinerant Parson, Harry Powell (Mitchum) comes into town, on a mission to look up the Family of Recently Executed Con Ben Harper (Peter Graves). Meeting up with the Widow, Willa Harper (Shelly Winters) and the two Harper children, Pearl and John (Sally Jane Bruce & Billy Chapin).We quickly find out that the 'Good Parson' is in actuality a deranged, psychotic killer. His pose as a Preacher is not a shallow concoction, for in his warped, criminal mind, he believes that he really that he does talk directly to God, and receives instructions from The Almighty about killing the \"painted and perfumed women of the world. He has his weapon of choice in a convenient little old push-button knife, which he carries in his coat pocket.In the course of the story, we find out that the 'Parson' is after the $10,000.00 proceeds of the armed robbery committed by the kids' Father, in which he shot 2 people dead. The charismatic, but sociopathic fake Preacher manages to get a good standing in the community and marries the Widow Harper (Miss Winters) and soon after virtually mesmerizing her, rendering her a pitiful, guilt-ridden \"Sinner\", who he uses in his Prayer Meetings. He then kills her, telling the towns people that the Mother had run off, and saying that she had abandoned them.The bulk of the plot concerns the plight of the kids in trying to make the adults of the town believe in the danger that surrounded the kids. Then we follow the kids on their meandering odyssey down the river in the row boat, the 'Parson' still on their trail.Eventually the kids meet up with the kindly and truly Christian Rachel Cooper, who takes the ids in along with the other foundlings. Eventually the Law catches up with the Killer Parson who is tried and sent to Death Row, State Prison. THE END.When viewing this picture, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, we would do well to follow the story, carefully observe any potential symbolism, because damn, if it doesn't seem to be there! The film is usually classified as a murder mystery or something, but it's not at all so easy to put this in any pigeon hole.From the earliest parts of the film, the images we get of Mitchum's 'Parson' Character are the images of a Monster. That is a Monster in the classic Horror Movie tradition. And, he's really not so unlike Mr. Boris Karloff's rendering of the Frankenstein Monster. Observe his lumbering through the marshy river bank. Look at his lunging forward and walking at about a 15 Degree Angle, just as Karloff's monster did in the earliest scenes after his creation. In other scenes, the 'Parson' more resembles The Grim Reaper, in still others, The Headless Horseman. When winged by buck-shot from a less than accurate shot gun blast, he screams and hollers like a wounded animal. (The main difference is that no animal, other than some of our fellow Homo Sapiens Sapiens, would commit such heinous acts.) And Director Charles Laughton chooses to end the film much like he began it, with a sort of abstract scene of Prayer featuring Rachel Cooper (Miss Lillian Gish) with images of the children all about them. This last scene, coming at Christmas Time and praises the little children of the World and begs for better treatment of them all.All we can add is, AMEN, Mr. Charles Laughton, AMEN!UPDATE: (Dateline,Chicago,Illinois, December 22, 2007) We just finished watching NIGHT OF THE HUNTER again today on Turner Classic Movies. It seems that we forgot to mention the fine original score done by Walter Schumann. He is probably best known for another of his compositions; that being the Theme and Incidenta music for DRAGNET on Radio (1949-56), Television (1951-'59, '67-'70) and the Feature Film (Mark 7 Ltd./Warner Brothers, 1954).",

            "content": "Charles Laughton, better known as an actor, only ever directed one film in his life. That being The Night of the Hunter, where a small town husband commits a bank robbery, in the process killing two people. He gets caught, but before that he assists his children in hiding the money and swears them to secrecy. In the prison, awaiting hanging, he accidentally reveals to a corrupt preacher the fact that the kids are in the know. The man gets hanged, but the preacher is released, and he promptly sets out to woo the widow and squeeze the hiding place of the money from the children.Laughton was heavily influenced by the German expressionism style of film making and it shows. Heavy shadows, sharp silhouettes, Gothic imagery and stylized dialogue are the order of the day. The film even opens with the detached head of an old woman floating in space, quoting Bible to a bunch of children. Or rather their heads, also floating in space.And I have to be frank, it's more corny than impressive. You get the idea that Laughton likes this art style, but is not fully able to pull it off. The film is filled with artistic touches, but most of them cause the story to flow erratically. Granted, there are also some truly beautiful shots, especially when Laughton plays with silhouettes, but I was still pulled out of the story way too often.Full props to Robert Mitchum as the preacher Harry Powell. He has one of the best voices I've ever heard in cinema, and even though the character he plays is one of the more over the top men of cloth I've ever seen, he almost manages to pull it off, which is a small miracle in and on itself.All in all the film definitely has an identity. Personally I didn't much care for it, but I can see why some people hail this as a masterpiece. It dances just at that razor edge where it could be seen as something unique and daring, rather than presumptuous.",

            "content": "Not since The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari has a movie been so willing to shove the audience right into the face of darkness, while still making it magical and challenging. I only just saw Night of the Hunter for the first time, and I'm sad I waited so long--it resparked my love and admiration for cinema like I haven't felt for a long time.The movie is about the strength of childhood to adversity, and certainly makes a big point of it. Not very long into the film it becomes quite clear that no adults these kids are around are going to help them or listen to them, and as the story embellishes, their separation becomes more complete. As striking as a statement this movie makes, there's still something of a real understanding of human relationships in the ways in which the characters don't even bother to pay attention to the kids at all--the only person who does is the one who wants to kill them. Luckily they get Lillian Gish, and of course that's the thing about abusive systems: you need someone outside of them to bring you out of them.Of course, psychological horror is met with the haunting, demonic form of Robert Mitchum, being probably one of the most terrifying on-screen personalities known to film.And here's where we mention the lighting! Film noir lighting was generally developed as a way of expressing darkness while also hiding cheap sets, but here it's obvious the sets aren't so cheap. The expressive lighting is often on stagy sets (again, Caligari-like), but this time Laughton pulls back on the camera and shows just how estranged and shadowy a world these kids live in. It's not just a matter of cramped rooms, horror also exists beyond the horizon line.For all the darkness and despair that this movie creates, it's actually quite the enchanting narrative. I'm not too sure children would be too off-put by this movie themselves, and yet on the flip-side the happy ending is far from schmaltz, while somehow managing to make it's morality message quite serious.Finally, the shots and editing are superb, and the movie itself becomes far from predictable in its staging and set-ups. Full expressive use of camera is at play at every moment here, and so while it's good to say that \"every single frame is an amazing still photograph\", the movement and editing alike can be singled out for pure enjoyment.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Wayward expectations can certainly bring down a film. Charles Laughton's 'The Night of the Hunter (1955)' was a title in which I had been interested for a long time; I didn't really know much about it, but I was aware of its reputation, and I came into the film expecting a suspenseful, scarily-realistic adult thriller. What I actually watched struck me as less of an adult thriller and more of a children's adventure, with noticeable fairytale elements thrown into the mix. If there weren't quite so many moments of violence and murder, it seemed like the sort of film that a young teenage boy could enjoy most. The director, to me, appeared unsure of his target audience, and the whole affair \u0096 though certainly riddled with interesting scenes \u0096 seemed a bit muddled. In any case, this being Charles Laughton's only directorial effort {he was an actor best known for such films as 'Mutiny on the Bounty (1936)' and 'Witness for the Prosecution (1958)'}, I would be more than willing to forgive his apparent inexperience.From the moment he opens the film with a cheerful conversation with God, Robert Mitchum's character, the murderous \"Reverend\" Harry Powell, struck me as a caricature. He is a villain as seen through the simplistic eyes of a child, which certainly corresponds with the themes of the film, but then he never really instilled me with much fear. Of course, Mitchum has a few chilling moments (\"Chillll\u0085dren\"), but certainly nothing to compare with the slimy repulsiveness of his Max Cady in 'Cape Fear (1962).' The true acting surprise of the film is Lilian Gish as the kind-hearted but resilient Rachel Cooper, the film's sole pillar of feminine strength. What makes her performance even more remarkable is that, when I last saw her on screen (in D.W. Griffith's 'Broken Blossoms (1919)'), I described her as \"a perfect picture of beauty and helplessness.\" In this film, however, she immediately sees through Powell's sinister facade, and spends the night slowly rocking back and forth in her chair, shotgun clasped readily in her hands.Not being a religious person at all, perhaps it's only natural that this film, with its Biblical symbolism and allusions to Jesus and Moses, didn't appeal to me as much as I'd hoped. Stanley Cortez's shadowy cinematography, no doubt influenced by the German Expressionism style of the 1920s, is definitely the film's greatest highlight. One breathtaking sequence shows Shelley Winters sitting serenely at the bottom of a river, her throat slit, her loose hair swaying in the water like the weeds around her, her soul at complete peace with her surroundings. Though, after one viewing, I find myself slightly disappointed with 'The Night of the Hunter,' I think that a lot of it has to do with my preconceived expectations, rather than the quality of the film in itself. Perhaps, just like the critics and audiences who gave the film a poor reception on its release, subsequent viewings will succeed in swinging my opinion.",

There are gaping holes in the story and acting that are irrational--even ludicrous--at every turn. Critics sometimes look too deeply into an artistic work in a vain attempt to find something that's not there. There's almost nothing of merit in this work. There's a reason Laughton directed only one film: because he was completely inept at it. 1955 audiences laughed aloud at scenes Laughton meant to be terrifying; I found myself echoing those sentiments last night, including Mitchum's elongated Frankenstein-like chase of the children to the river's edge. Those who rate this movie highly do a great disservice to writers and directors who strive to create realism, consistency, character development and simple logic in their work, as well as to actors who strive to create memorable performances that future stage performers will seek to emulate.

            "content": "I was told from many sources that this was meant to be a really scary film, and seeing clips of the actor in possibly his most famous role I was certainly intrigued to watch it, and it is the only film actor Charles Laughton ever directed. Basically Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is the mad psychopathic self-appointed Reverend preacher serial killer who murders widowed women to get their money, he even goes so far as believing he is doing it for God, and he has the words \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" tattooed on his left and right hand fingers/knuckles. Ben Harper (Peter Graves) has been sentenced to death by hanging for his part in a robbery, but he managed to hide the $10,000 he stole in a secure place at his home before being caught, and he tells Powell about this in their cell. Powell does not get the location of where the loot is, but he does get a clue from Harper before he sent to be put to death, and he works out that he told one of his two children the secret. So he manages to get the attention of Harper's widow Willa (Shelley Winters) who is intrigued by his many memorised Bible quotations, as well as his sermons and hymns he performs, and eventually she agrees to marry him. The children, nine year old son John (Billy Chapin) and four year old daughter Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) obviously do not fully trust Powell, who says he and his new wife will not have sex at is a sin, and he does try to get the secret out of them, which Willa does spot. She realises the truth and discusses their marriage in bed, in the attic, and he leans over the slit her throat, dumping her body in the river, and when he finds out the location of the money, inside a toy doll, the children manage to escape with it in a boat down the river. They are looked after and hide with tough old Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish), but Powell tracks them down, but Rachel protects the children with a shotgun, and for some reason sings his hymns to frighten them in the night. There is a big protest by many people who believe the preacher is a good man and that any accusations of foul play are lies, but in the end Powell is arrested and sentenced to death for murdering Willa, and the children are safe and sound. Also starring Evelyn Varden as Icey Spoon and James Gleason as Birdie Steptoe. Mitchum gives a truly disturbing and menacing performance as the maniac who insanely thinks he is a force for good, and Winters does well also as the innocent woman he marries, I found it creepy rather than very scary, but it is certainly a great classic thriller. Robert Mitchum was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Reverand Harry Powell was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 99 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

            "content": "OK, I do appreciate the incredible cinematography--the bizarre world-within-a-world with the bakery \"Spoons,\" the narrow hallway where Mitchum accosts John, the frightening basement stairway with no handrail. And I loved the journey down the river with all the animals. The image of Shelley underwater was like \"What? That's no dummy--that's really Shelley!\" I loved the star-lit skies, and the way the moon moved across the night sky while the kids slept in the barn.I suppose I just can't get over all of the holes in the narrative. I write for a living, so I can't just watch something without looking at logic. Why did Uncle Bernie just assume no one would listen to his story? Why wouldn't they, when he and John already discussed how much they mistrusted Mitchum? When Lillian called the cops, why did she say \"I've got something in my barn\" instead of \"there's a crazed psychopath in there?\" If I got that call, I'd be like, \"Yeah, we'll be there tomorrow, after our company softball game.\" And then she just held Mitchum captive with a shotgun, yet was busy making coffee indoors.Why didn't anyone from Shelley's town suspect Mitchum first off? He's the logical suspect. I suppose it was meant to be an allegory.When the kids were drifting down the river and eating raw potatoes that rude woman shoved at him (great shot, BTW, seen from *behind* the woman instead of from the kid's POV) why didn't they just take at least one bill from the doll and buy a cow? Not to mention Mitchum's odd logic. Why did he waste the car when he could have just shoved Shelley into some woods? He might need a car later on.OK, I'm too much of a realist. I should be more of a dreamer. It's to the credit of the great cinematography that I watched it to the end.Oh, and the biggest question of all... What happened to the money at the end? The Christmas scene showed them still broke. I guess the evils of money were too low for them to cash in on.I am so disappointed!",

            "content": "Talk about polemic responses! Reading the user reviews here is like reading about two different films. I'm not going to try to recreate the story, which many others here have done very well - just comment on why I like it so much. I will never, ever forget the scenes in this extraordinary film, which I last watched in full at least fifteen years ago, and I like to think I have a mind of my own, unclouded by film establishment dictates.Laughton omits nothing, at all, in his wide-eyed, childlike gaze upon the land. But there's nothing childlike about the things that gaze takes in. His world encompasses everything and everyone, for good and for evil. It turns its eye upon small-town Depression America; upon greed and crime; upon real, human goodness; innocence; and not even the lowliest animals are neglected. The opening of the aperture, as it were, makes for startling and unsettling viewing: if you are shocked by murder, you are no less shocked by the tiny injustices of life. The innocence of the children is no more pitiable than the gullibility of the townsfolk; the inexorability of the preacher's hunting down of the children is no more horrifying than the inexorability of a girl's blind need for love, than the struggle of the waterside animals for life, the sun rising and setting, and the river flowing.The film is full of intentionally stylised, tableau-type images; haunting sounds, a puppet-like feel; such as the heartbreaking sight of two children alone, in a barn, looking out on a theatrically peaceful, rural scene that nonetheless holds no comfort for them. Laughton finds the cruelty and beauty in both good and evil as they wax and wane through this story. It's almost as if, in his innocence and strangeness, Laughton rewrote the rules for good and evil in cleaner, sharper lines: no man ever seemed more menacing than Robert Mitchum's manipulative preacher, relentlessly hunting down the children; no woman more completely pure than Lilian Gish, gently singing a lullaby in the twilight with a rifle on her lap. I would have LOVED to have seen more of what Charles Laughton's mind could produce. He straddles two worlds: that of European fairy tales, and European expressionist cinema (not forgetting a very moving, Wildean way of telling a story through a child's eyes), and that of Depression and post-depression era America with its great need for movement, and for extremes of good and evil to light the way. It's a classic American journey tale with a nasty bite; a morality tale where for much of the story the baddie is in the ascendant; it's a simple fairy tale, the children lost in the proverbial woods, the river becoming the path through the forest, bringing the promise of hope, and respite. If you haven't watched this unique film before because the idea of its being so constantly lauded by film critics bores you, forget what they say - find out for yourself whether you fall on the side of Love or Hate. But if you watch it expecting YOUR idea of a great film, don't blame the film itself when you're disappointed.",

Numerous other thrillers maintain their suspense, and are acted in a way still believable and gripping 50 years later. By contrast, acting here is horrific by all but one supporting actress (the orphan nanny), from the villain, to the two kids, to the murdered wife. The narrative structure spills the entire plot from the outset, allowing no surprises or twisting revelations as the story unwinds. There is no creepy stalking, and none of the expected psychological stealth that the video jacket suggests. The one creepy effect-- the villain singing hymns as he approaches or waits out the kids is not repeated or used effectively early on. The kid's response is to make a confident, satirical remark rather than to react with fear or horror that they haven't yet escaped the villain.",

Mitchum's character is greatly disturbing, one who bridges the gap between man and god who has gone rogue for his own lustful and greedy intentions.

Anytime I saw a Mitchum movie after this, I got the willies. I kept looking for those stupid tattoos on his knuckles or thought I heard his very eerie singing of, \"Shall we gather at the river\u0085\" The guys was amazing.

Well, the 1991 version is a waste and can remain where it is\u0085or\u0085maybe we should tie it up, and throw it to the bottom of the pond with Shelley.

I believe that one the most powerful scenes in the film occurred when the children were sleeping in the barn and in the distance, Harry could be seen riding a horse and whistling. It was interesting and terrifying to see how determined Harry was to get the money from the children at any cost. I believe this film is significant due to the fact that throughout the movie, the audience is on the edge of their seat eagerly anticipating what will happen to the children and the money. Also, the scene on the river made the film much more artistic due to the shots of various animals in the brightly lit night.",

            "content": "The Night Of The Hunter is highly-rated by many critics whom at first viewing back in the mid 1950s thought it was an appalling piece of work. This is a film that many couldn't appreciate until nearly a few decades after its initial release. Snubbed of all major awards, The Night Of The Hunter will always be remembered for two aspects: Robert Mitchum's ominous performance as Harry Powell, and the extraordinary cinematography.Mitchum's character is terrifying because he's religiously insane, and he hunts children to his advantage. The terror sequence at the basement in which two young kids are trapped by Powell in his quest to get what he wants - a large sum of stolen money, is at least unnerving. The photography work is top-notch, contributing to the film's dark, dream-like atmosphere through the use of shadows, obscure lighting, and clever silhouettes. Moreover, by capturing quick takes of night animals such as owls, the filmmakers are able to highlight the 'impending presence of a hunter' through such visual images.The problem of The Night Of The Hunter is that it doesn't shock enough. Charles Laughton (while he's good) is no Hitchcock. And Harry Powell isn't anywhere near creepy Norman Bates. There are too many happy moments, and the music accompaniment doesn't strike enough fear in viewers. The Night Of The Hunter promises to be a rich horror thriller, but it lets itself down in the final third when its sustainability is often called into question. No doubt Charles Laughton's only directorial effort is unusual and unique, but it's overrated in my opinion.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

Finally, Pontifikator (\"An interesting failure\", pontifikator from United States, 5 November 2009) offers his insights on the direction.****\"Night of the Hunter (1955, Charles Laughton\ufeff), Love and Hate tattooed across the knuckles\ufeff, is one of the most frightening films ever made. It also contains a slab of syrupy country Grandma charm. Often classified as Film Noir\ufeff, it shows us what is really terrifying in this life while making sure the audience leaves the theater well grounded Demonstrating real charisma and a credible singing voice, Robert Mitchum\ufeff is devastatingly good as the serial-killing preacher, Harry Powell. (The character is loosely-based on real-life serial killer Harry Powers, executed in 1932.) After being arrested for auto theft, the switch-blade wielding Powell shares his cell with Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who is shortly going to be hanged for killing two people during a bank robbery. Prior to being arrested, Harper hid the loot from the robbery, entrusting his two children, John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) with the secret of its location. As soon as he is released from prison, treasure-seeking Harry Powell pursues the just-widowed Willa (Shelly Winters). Young John, tasked by his (late) father to look after his younger sister and keep the secret, is the only one suspicious of the charismatic preacher. With the encouragement of one of her employers, Willa marries him. Eventually, John must contend with a much larger adult who wants to kill him (and Pearl). John's dilemma is still horrifying today. As a conniving preacher, Mitchum's uncanny charm and ability to immediately win over unsophisticated rural people works on many levels. (His knuckle-bearing demonstration of how Love conquers Hate speaks about the power of organized religion.) However, Powell's misogyny and righteous celibacy make for extremely creepy moments. To counteract all of Powell's raging hate, the screenwriters (James Agee and Charles Laughton) introduce an essential character towards the end of the film (representing Love), aging matriarch Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). She is a philanthropist and feminist hero who rescues and rears homeless children. She also is quite capable of using a shotgun to protect her flock. She is the first adult who sees through Harry Powell and can stand up to him.It is curious how Laughton, a renowned thespian in his own right, apparently wanted his actors and the story to reach the limits of believability. There are monologues early and late. There are Mitchum's exaggerated physical gestures when chasing after the children in the cellar. (Somehow, Powell can never get his adult frame to move faster than a fleeing child's.) Shelly Winters also portrays the partially mad widow very woodenly in places. While Billy Chapin as John Harper is convincing overall, another reviewer points out that he always delays reacting to every new piece of dialogue in a way that belies his character's age. Rachel Cooper is a challenging role for Lilian Gish because of how corny Rachel's lines can be. There is a fairy-tale side of \"Night of the Hunter\" that modern audiences, used to fantastic horrors appearing in the daily nightmare (i.e., news), may find a bit unnecessary.This is the only film that Charles Laughton ever directed. He uses shadows impressively, and his style recalls German Expressionism from the 1920s. I really like the two scenes with Peter Graves; they are both very memorable. There are also several images which rank among the best in movie history. The dead person in the lake is unforgettable. And, the sight of Harry Powell in silhouette at night time as he croons a children's hymnal while riding a horse is superb.Cinephiles who want to experience 1950s era Americana and a really horrifying story should saddle up their horse and head over to revival theater showing this.\"Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world, Ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl.

Agee did have a younger sister and his father died when he was six. He did live in boarding schools run by ministers of the Episcapalian church around Knoxville. Father Flye took Agee to Europe one summer when he was sixteen. The character of Harry Powell is evil. This must reflect Agee's experiences at boarding school.The children are at the center of the screenplay with Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce playing the now famous John and Pearl. Peter Graves is their dad who makes John promise to never tell where the stolen $10, 000 is and to take care of Pearl. Mitchum, as Powell, shares a cell with Graves before he is hung. He immediately finds Shelly Winters the mother of John and Pearl. He marries her. He doesn't want sex. He kills her.The children run and find Lilian Gish who takes them in. The children in the boat on the river with Mitchum following on a white horse are unforgettable. The singing adds another eerie dimension. Gish shooting a shotgun is great.

The acting, by Mitchum and the children, cannot be improved upon. And I suppose Shelley Winters, too, though she is so over-the-top you're never sure if it's part of the performance or her acting of it.Haunting horror. It terrified me as a boy the age of this boy with a little sister the age of this little girl when I saw it the first time. And it terrifies me today.

I would say yes, but only with healthy adult supervision to explain and emphasize the triumph at the end. Even for adults it may open some old wounds.There is hope for abused children. But it is an ugly and lonely journey and only the power of love, in human and divine form, can bring them through.This film is catharsis for those who have been chased by the devil and have found peace by the strength God gave them and the love they found along the way.",

Lillian Gish was wonderful, and no actor today could ever be as good as Robert Mitchum as the money-hungry, murdering \"preacher.\" Charles Laughton's direction of this film is equal to Alfred Hitchcock's direction of his suspense films.

            "content": "Not a good movie or a very good movie but a great one. The sole directorial effort of master thespian Charles Laughton based on the work of Davis Grubb about a wicked Bluebeard parading around as a preacher who preys and prays on the lonely women who use their sexuality to make Harry Powell(Robert Mitchum) mentally succumb to his desires but seemingly unable to do so physically. This pernicious wanderer has killed dozens and we have him introduced to the main tale at hand about a man who robbed ten thousand dollars safeguarding his loot with his two young children John and Pearl right before the strong arm of the law collects him and he is hanged for murder. Ben Harper(Peter Graves) has his son and daughter promise to never disclose the whereabouts of his ill-gotten treasure. Whilst in prison, his cellmate is none other than Harry Powell who vows to find that money no matter what by introducing himself to the new widow Harper(Shelley Winters).All this happens early on the film. As stories go, this one is really a straightforward thriller at its core, but with Laughton's deft and magical direction becomes something not like many films I have ever seen. Robert Mitchum gives one of his greatest performances as the somewhat affable and charming Harry(when he wants to be) to one of the most vile villains ever to \"grace\" the screen. Mitchum's singing of hymns contrasting with his murderous and villainous intents underscores many a scene. All of them remarkably powerful. But as good as he is...and make no mistake he is great...the film's main characters really are the two children - particularly John(played very capably by child star Billy Chapin).What we really have is a horrific bildungsroman of the growth and manhood of John being pressed on him by the execution of his father, the unfortunate mothering of a very simplistic woman with virtually no common sense, and the adult responsibilities of being a man taking care of his sister, keeping his father's secret, and later protecting his own life. Chapin really gives some dimension to this role. His sister Pearl is considerably younger and played with a naivete and innocence that enhances the events of good and evil and the grey that sometimes can exist between.In the last third of the film we are introduced to Mitchum's good counterpart played with such empathy as only Lillian Gish can. She is amazingly strong in her role and helps protect the children from this \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\"So what makes the film great? As I said you have first-rate acting all around. Even Shelley Winters in a bit of a throwaway role as the mother has her moments. Mitchum and Gish are powerhouses on the screen. The best aspect of the film though is the way Laughton directed it. It is surreal in many parts. the river scene with all the animals and the artificial stars looked liked something out of a dream or nightmare. Some of the scenes are shot with such exquisite beauty though their subject matter is disturbing. Two come to mind quickly. First, there is the murder scene of Shelley Winters. It is not shown explicitly, but look how Laughton framed the scene. The lighting almost suggest that these two characters are in church. The other is when James Gleason finds winter's body in a car below in the river with her hair waving like a mermaid...what a chilling shot to be sure!Night of the Hunter is to me required viewing for serious student of film. I pick up more with each viewing and always leave with the feeling that I just got off a scary rollercoaster. Mostly, I always reflect on what might have been if Laughton had had an opportunity to direct another film.",

            "review_title": "Hype of The Hunter",
            "content": "SPOILERS WARNINGDerided in its day in America but acclaimed by Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, `Night of The Hunter' has made the rounds again on UK television's Channel 4 - though not FilmFour, the channel's subscription service.On the face of it, the omission is surprising: received wisdom has it that this was Charles Laughton's directorial masterpiece, Mitchum's finest performance, Lillian Gish's finest hour, Pulitzer Prize-winner James Agee's most notable screenplay, and Stanley Cortez's most stunning photography. . . so how come 'Night of The Hunter' seems to be getting marginalized again after all these years?Answer: because it's not very good. No, worse than that: it's a mess.Yes, Laughton's directorial debut was passionate and promising, but this was not a debut on the Wellesian scale: in mood, structure and fundamental logic, 'Night of The Hunter' doesn't begin to hang together, lurching from the dramatic to the melodramatic, from the bathetic to the surreal like a drunk possessed of a vision he can't quite focus upon.In part it's because of the novel, a well-nigh unfilmable essay on religion, greed, poverty and innocence (no lack of ambition there then). But mainly it's to do with Laughton's fallibilities: compelled to be both director and screen writer- James Agee, though credited with the screenplay, actually churned out a 350-page epic even more unfilmable than the book and was too drunk to rewrite it  - the scale of the challenge was pretty obviously too much.(Though he and Mitchum developed a close friendship, Mitchum never entirely forgave him for all those `******* owls and pussycats' which the director introduced into post production processing.)But the incursion of frogs, bunny rabbits, lambs and owls is actually of lesser consequence in this film, for whilst its visual inconsistencies range from the irritating to the exhilarating, it is the collapse of the narrative underpinning which undermines all.Laughton is wrong-footed from the start: the opening scene, of children discovering a woman's body, looks like the start of the movie. Confusingly though, it isn't. It's back story, and quite redundant, because Mitchum is very soon thereafter established as a homicidal lunatic with a penchant for seducing / wedding vulnerable women and murdering them.Nor is Mitchum's performance here his greatest: 'subtle' isn't a word that comes to mind but then, the script doesn't call for it: characterisation is one-dimensional throughout (screamingly so, in the case of Icey Spoon, a character of such improbable construct that 'Night of The Hunter' becomes pantomimic every time she appears on screen.)Narratively, of course, the very notion of a madwoman persuading a recently bereaved widow into instantly marrying an obvious nutcase is pretty daft to begin with, yet if Laughton had allowed more time for this section of the movie and a lot less for the latter half, disbelief might more easily have been suspended.But no. Mitchum meets Winters and her children and almost immediately declares his hand (both of them, actually - the celebrated LOVE / HATE scene, though sadly, that comes over as pantomime, too). Thereafter, he kills her. There's no build-up, and precious little menace. Instead, the children go resignedly to their boat and embark on an odyssey in which Mark Twain collides with Walt Disney.This extended episode - and no, there's no `night' of the hunter: Mitchum actually tracks them for a week or more - is only possible thanks to the fact that Mitchum's victim is discovered by yet another of the film's gallery of half-wits, in this case a character whose justification for not ringing the police is made all the more incoherent by the manner in which the actor delivers his lines.And so, finally, finally, the children - neither terrified, nor grieving - wind up at the home of good-hearted Lillian Gish, a cinema legend who closes 'Night of The Hunter' with a piece to camera as excruciatingly embarrassing as anything ever committed to celluloid.Gish, of course, is also a half wit, and so instead of ringing the police when she and the children are first menaced, instead spends the night guarding her charges with a shotgun whilst Mitchum croons outside their window. That such an experience would have traumatised anyone, never mind a bunch of kids, seems not to have occurred to Laughton; dramatic credibility fails utterly when in the morning Gish does what she could quite easily have done the evening before: picks up the kitchen telephone and rings the police.It's this kind of failure which illustrates how bad 'Night of The Hunter' truly is: a collection of narrative devices and conceits that don't work, a piling up of improbabilities that ultimately weary. Calling it 'film noir' (it isn't anyway) cannot paper over the cracks.And that would be all that needs saying . . . except for the memories of those glimpses of visual genius that make 'Night of The Hunter' the bad-movie masterpiece it undoubtedly is.Nothing prepares one for the shock of seeing Shelley Winters' body in her underwater tomb; and very little in any other film, by any director, anywhere, comes remotely close to Cortez's shot of Mitchum riding his horse along the horizon at dawn (to get the perspective, Cortez used a midget riding a pony, though knowing that takes nothing away from the pure magic of this sequence.There's also something that if not a hark-back to Lang, is certainly a presager of Ridley Scott in the visual treatment of the city scene in which the children find themselves when on an outing with the good-hearted one-dimensional gibberish-spouting Gish.Thus, then, does `Night of the Hunter' endure: an ill-fitting mount for a worthless bauble of a script, yet the unexpected setting for some wholly unexpected 100% gems.Laughton was so depressed by the reaction to his directorial debut, he never made another film. Yet if with the experience gained he had teamed up with Cortez again, who knows what magic they would have wrought. ..VERDICT: Perversely, a must-see for all cinema lovers, if only to glimpse what all of us lost when Laughton gave up his own hunt for creative fulfilment.",

            "review_title": "Charles Laughton's Sole Directorial Effort Makes You Wish He Had Done More",
            "content": "After nearly thirty years in the business as an actor, and a major film star for more than twenty of those years, the great Charles Laughton decided to turn his hand to directing. For his debut picture he chose THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, from the novel by Davis Grubb.With a screenplay by James Agee (with Laughton contributing bits and pieces) and stark, eerie cinematography by Stanley Cortez that echoed the great German expressionist films of the Twenties, Laughton began with a gripping backdrop in front of which to place his players. And what players! I have always liked Robert Mitchum; solid, dependable, always believable, he was to my mind one of the great underrated actors of his day. In Laughton's film, he is given what is perhaps his greatest role: Harry Powell, a self-styled \"preacher\" whose ministerial trappings hide the fact that he is a dangerous psychopath who has done time in prison. With the word \"hate\" tattooed on his left hand and \"love\" on his right, he enthralls groups of people (especially women) with a rather incoherent tale of the struggle between the two which makes excellent use of Mitchum's physicality and sonorous voice.Powell is first seen in jail for auto theft; his cell mate, condemned killer Ben Harper (Peter Graves), reveals to Powell that he stole ten thousand dollars, but try as he might, Powell is unable to get out of Harper where the money is hidden. He does, however, discover that Harper has a wife and two children.In due course, Harper is executed, and Powell, released from prison, seeks out his widow Willa (Shelley Winters in one of the roles that would lead to her status as one of Hollywood's great character actresses) and his children John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce). He immediately begins courting Willa, and soon enough, she marries him, much to the dismay of her son, who distrusts this smooth-talking phony on sight, but who listens to a child? Unfortunately for Willa, her failure to pay attention to her son has fatal consequences. On their wedding night Harry delivers a rambling sermon and declares that unless she wants more children (to which she says no), their marriage will not include sex. Willa, either too simple or merely too overwhelmed by him to argue, goes along, and when he eventually takes out a knife and kills her, she lies quiescently as if it is not only her fate but her due.Powell disposes of the body in spectacular fashion: putting her in her car, he sinks the thing to the bottom of a nearby river, where she is observed in an unforgettable and shocking scene by a lone fisherman. Shocked beyond terror, the fisherman heads home and gets blind drunk.Meanwhile, Powell has made several attempts to get the children to reveal where the money is, but John stays mum and won't allow Pearl to get close to Powell even though at first she is drawn to him. After terrorizing them in their basement one night, the kids manage to outwit him and, locking him in, make off for the river where a skiff is moored. They just make it and sail off downstream.Powell is next seen riding a white horse; though not near the river, he is clearly pursuing the children.Eventually the children find their way to the home of Miss Rachel Cooper (the great Lillian Gish), a woman who already has several castoff children in her care, and who readily welcomes two more. Pearl is desperate for a mother's love, but John is by now suspicious of every adult in the world, and warming up to Rachel takes some time.So much happens in this film that it is impossible to lay it all out. Suffice it to say that the final half hour builds to an astonishing confrontation between Harry Powell and Rachel Cooper. The physically imposing Powell poses absolutely no threat to the birdlike but resolute Rachel, and is quickly disposed of and handed over to the police, and John finally shows Rachel that he trusts her.This is an eerie, poetic, scary, beautiful, and in many ways indescribable film. Harry Powell is one of the great screen villains, right up there with Harry Roat Jr and Hannibal Lecter. And Lillian Gish is, of course, sensational in a rare speaking role.Oddly enough, this film was a major flop in its initial release, and Laughton never directed another film again. But over time it has become a well-deserved classic, and it is a pity that Laughton didn't try again.",

Praise for Shelley Winters' haircut (okay, maybe not that, but you get the picture). So when I saw that it was going to play on Turner Classic Movies, I was understandably quite excited. I sat down and prepared to watch one of the most incredible movies ever made.So imagine my surprise to discover that Night of the Hunter was an incoherent mess. The characters acted seemingly without motive at times. The acting was tired, wooden, and contrived (Mitchum being the glowing exception). I know fifth graders who could write a better script.On the plus side, Robert Mitchum was one of the better actors of the mid-twentieth century. His performance as the film's primary villain, although nowhere near as menacing or threatening as Max Cady in Cape Fear, was still well acted. That the role didn't really do anything for me was not his fault, but rather that of Charles Laughton, who re-wrote the entire script from scratch and directed the film (except for the part where he abandoned the kids on set, forcing Mitchum to direct those scenes himself.)But that's about all the movie has going for it. Rev. Harry Powell had this gentle, fatherly persona to him, even when he was holding children at knife-point, that made it impossible for me to feel any sort of fear or revulsion towards his character.What else can I say about the movie? I never got the sense that the children were in any real danger. Perhaps that's why they continued to view the man who killed their mother and tried to steal their money as a paternal figure. The pace and focus of the movie changed so frequently, I could never really tell what was happening. Did I mention the children? I did? Well, did Imention that the children (Sally Jane Bruce more so than Billy Chapin)were annoying and lame? Were child actors really that hard to find in the 50's and 60's? (see my review of Cape Fear to see whatI mean.) This movie had so much potential, but didn't really use any of it. Only Robert Mitchum saved it from being total garbage.",

He does add an air of malevolence to the character of Harry Powell that one does not often see equaled. Considering this film was released in 1955 makes Mitchum's performace all the more remarkable. That said, I think the shortcomings of this film (of which there are many) ought to be pointed out. Shelley Winters, as usual, gives a very ham-handed performance as Willa Harper. The acting of the children frequently borders on atrocious. The film itself gets very bogged down once the children meet up with Lillian Gish's character. By the end of the film, the creepy atmosphere has been completely rejected in favor of sugar and spice...ugh! Also, Mitchum's feeble attempt to catch the children on the stairs left me shaking my head in disbelief. And what's with the reaction when the canning jars fall on his head? I thought I was watching a Three Stooges short!However, I was impressed by several pieces of camerawork, particularly the scene of Mitchum silhouetted on horseback in the morning and his first descent into the basement when he urges the children to come out of hiding. But if you want a creepy lead character whose singing unnerves you, check out Peter Lorre in \"M\". Lorre and Fritz Lang pulled this kind of device off earlier, and far more effectively. I'll take Lorre whistling \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" over Harry Powell any day.All said, I can't understand how this movie has gotten such a wonderful reputation. I give it a 4 out of 10. It might be worth watching if for no other reason than to impress your film buff friends, but proceed at your own risk.",

            "content": "This film is haunting in so many ways.To start, Robert Mitchum's performance as Harry Powell is genuinely frightening. Mitchum really brings a menacing demeanor to the character, which combined with his booming voice, really says nothing but \"villain.\" Being aware of his alignment and plans from the get-go, it's easy for an audience to want to shout \"No!\" and the like at the screen, as one would traditionally do in a horror movie. His intentions may be what people fear, but it's really Mitchum's performance that makes the movie such a thriller.The images themselves are haunting as well. The shot of Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) dead in her car, underwater, is scary and beautiful. The ethereal light and movement of Willa's hair that mimics the underwater plants directly contradicts the harrowing and frightening nature of the scene. Other scenes as well, such as one when John (Billy Chapin) is telling a story to his kid sister, and Powell's shadow suddenly looms over him on the wall, use plays of light and shadow to reach that surreal place where beauty and fear can meet.In addition, the fear John feels long after he is (what most would consider) safe, brings a level of realism to the movie that frightens in its own right. These children have now been conditioned to believe the world is unsafe, and struggling with life after that is a whole new battle entirely.This film is sure to strike a nerve with a parent or child. The collision of fantasy and very real fear is a difficult thing to play with in film, and The Night of the Hunter does this so well. On several different levels, this film certainly is a thriller, and an extremely well-made one at that.",

I felt that this film lacked a cohesive structure and wasn't sure what it was trying to be.  Was it \"Film Noir\"? Was it \"Suspense\"?  A \"Melodrama\"?  A \"Comedy\" even?  Entertaining yet not entirely satisfying.  Maybe it was a rushed production.  Maybe it was Charles Laughton's direction.  Whatever the problem was, it left the movie incomplete.  As far as acting is concerned, Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish are excellent.  Shelley Winters and the others were fine but had such awkward characters to work with.  Mitchum is unforgettable in the role of the scariest villain I've ever seen.  Anybody can play a psychotic preacher, but no one with more believability as he portrayed it.  It nearly typecasted him.  Only with his preacher character can you understand why so many people are using God's name in the way that they do (cults/hate groups).The dialogue does have some laughably bad moments but does not take away much from the better ones.  My real problem is with the pacing (a plus factor for some, yet another problem for me).  There was just not enough time spent on making sure the characters were developed into characters to be appreciated.  One hour and thirty minutes is just not enough time to involve the most important part of film... the audience. Maybe this was one of those films that defies classification or genre. Maybe it's supposed to be some kind of unique masterpiece.  What ever it is... For what it is it's untapped potential to me.",

The great shame is that Laughton did not have the self confidence to ignore the criticism at the time.*Maybe he only had the one truly 'original' movie in him?  Sadly we will never know.

It is the 'moments' from films that I treasure - fleeting, tiny details, that astonish or touch the soul.  This one film has more of these nuggets than most directors achieve in a lifetime's work.I will certainly never forget the angle of the preachers head in the bedroom scene moments before he kills the mother, or the sound of him singing the hymn at night as he tracks down the children.Great things don't have to make sense or be perfect in every detail.

Chillingly dark at times, but with some of the most exquisite photography ever lensed. Robert Mitchum plays his best heavy, blowing away what he would later do in Cape Fear. Surprisingly loose, considering the 'morals' of the time. SOme of the best photography comes from two scenes. One, when the children are in the canoe at night. The sights and sounds of the animals feels very realistic. But perhaps the money scene is the shot of the children's mother, seated in the passenger side of the car, in her watery grave. The way her hair flows give this cruel death an almost angelic look. Lillian Gish is perfect as the old woman who takes in the children. Gish,a silent screen legend, was cast by Charles Laughton because, in part, she has always been one of his favorite actresses. Even the children are wisely cast, as there is hardly a weak point in this movie. Look for a young Peter Graves of Airplane fame in an early role as the children's doomed father. Sadly, this movie is not on TV often enough, nor is it ready available via DVD or VHS. The haunting end, with Mitchum's capture, is a excellent closing note to the movie. And, if I'm not mistaken, this is the only film that screen legend Charles Laughton ever directed. What a film to make, and leave your mark with.",

Robert Mitchum may be a name you have heard and someone you may admire. He was indeed a great actor and he shines through in this movie too. His performance alone makes this more than remarkable. You can see how people were smitten by him (even when he's fake crying and pretending he cares about other human beings).It's that charisma that may help some viewer overlook certain flaws. Not in the story so much (though the hunting process needs you to suspend your disbelief and go with the flow ... of the river), but more in other details, like how certain characters react, the fact almost everyone seems to like talking to themselves and explain what is happening on screen or how they perceive a situtation, instead of just relying on the visual treat we should be getting. Also while the kids are quite good, they would have been served better at times if the movie would not have cut to their facial expression.The editing process may seem aged as do a few other things too. Still the impact of the movie and the performances overall (with Mitchum again being the very central one that holds everything together while ripping things apart) and the fact this had some interesting and horrific scenes (especially for the time this was filmed, the underwater scene was quite something to behold) ... so if your perception and your attention span has not been compromised, you will be able to enjoy this, if you like tension filled movies - no matter if it feels predictable at times",

A year later, he met and married farm and feed store owner Luella Strother through a lonely hearts ad. But he didn't stop running those ads, as he got ten to twenty replies to his lovelorn classified ads a day.Police would later discover the bodies of several people who replied to his ads, like Asta Eicher, her three children and Dorothy Lemke. A mob tried to kill him and had to be dispensed with fire hoses and tear gas. After a trial so large that it needed to be held in an opera house to contain all the spectators, he was hung. His story inspired both the book and the movie The Night of the Hunter.In 1930's West Virginia. Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum, who is the only person who really could have played this role) is fleeing the scene of his latest murder. He's a self-anointed man of the cloth who preaches along the dirt roads and small towns, a man who is both attracted to and hateful toward women. On his right hand is the word LOVE and HATE on the right, symbols for his ready-made sermons.\"Ah, little lad, you're staring at my fingers. Would you like me to tell you the little story of right-hand/left-hand? The story of good and evil? H-A-T-E! It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low. L-O-V-E! You see these fingers, dear hearts? These fingers has veins that run straight to the soul of man. The right hand, friends, the hand of love. Now watch, and I'll show you the story of life. Those fingers, dear hearts, is always a-warring and a-tugging, one agin t'other. Now watch 'em! Old brother left hand, left hand he's a fighting, and it looks like love's a goner. But wait a minute! Hot dog, love's a winning! Yessirree! It's love that's won, and old left hand hate is down for the count!\"Finally, in one small town, Powell for driving a stolen car while he watches a burlesque dancer, muttering to himself, \"There's too many of them. I can't kill the world.\"Meanwhile, Ben Harper kills two men in a bank robbery and races home to hide the money inside his daughter's doll. He promises his two children, John and Pearl, to keep it a secret. His son is shocked by how the police treat his father, beating him into the ground.Ben and Reverend Harry share a jail cell, where the evil preacher tries to discover the location of the money. He gets just enough info on Ben's family before he is free. Ben isn't that lucky as he's executed for his crimes.Powell then appears in town to both woo and marry Harper's widow, Willa (Shelley Winters). He charms all the other townsfolk except for John, who promised his father he'd never reveal where the money is.Instead of consummating his marriage to Willa, Powell tries to get her to be part of his preaching. However, she learns that he's looking for the money and he stabs and kills her, dumping her body in the river while telling everyone that she left him for a life of sin with a drummer.Willa's drowned body is discovered by Birdie Steptoe, an elderly drunk who is sort of an uncle to John. He fears the town will blame him for her death, so he tells no one. Powell starts to hunt the children and they flee in a raft down the river, only stopped for a moment to sleep in a barn. The shadow of the preacher and his singing reaches them and John exclaims, \"Doesn't he ever sleep?\"By this point, the film has become a German expressionist stage play looking fairy tale. The children escape to the home of kindly Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish, the First Lady of American Cinema), a hard as nails old woman who is one of the few purely good people in this entire film. She protects and raises orphans, keeping the kids safe from Powell even when he tries to seduce the oldest, Ruby.After an all-night standoff, the old woman shoots and wounds the preacher, who hides in the barn until the police arrest him. As they take him to jail, it reminds John of the night his father was arrested. He beats the man with his sister's doll, screaming that he can keep the money.At the trial, even the preacher's staunchest defenders, like Icey Spoon (Evelyn Varden, The Bad Seed) become screaming drunks seeking his doom. A lynch mob has gathered while the executioner smiles at him, saying that he'll see him soon.Meanwhile, our children have gathered for Christmas, finally safe. It echoes the dreamlike beginning of the film, which again seems to be part of a fairy tale.This was the only film directed by actor Charles Laughton and at the time of its original release, it was considered a critical and box-office failure. Laughton never directed another film.Robert Mitchum was very eager for the part of the preacher. When he auditioned, he impressed Laughton when he said that he was looking for the character to be \"a diabolical CENSORED.\" Mitchum promptly answered, \"Present!\" Mitchum later remarked that Laughton was his favorite director and that this was his favorite of the films he acted in.While Laughton proclaimed Mitchum to be different from his public image - \"All this tough talk is a blind, you know. He's a literate, gracious, kind man, with wonderful manners, and he speaks beautifully-when he wants to. He's a tender man and a very great gentleman. You know, he's really terribly shy.\" - on set, once producer Paul Gregory told the star that he was too drunk to be acting, he opened the door to Gregory's Cadillac and urinated all over the front seat.To Gregory, Mitchum pretty much was the character he was portraying: \"He was a charmer. An evil S.O.B. with a lot of charm. Mitch sort of scared me, to tell you the truth. I was always on guard. He was often in a state, and you never knew what he would do next.\"",

Although there are some excellent visual elements, the direction of the actors is very jerky. It's hard to blame the actors for this hokum, but some of the performances are pretty awful. Exception : Lillian Gish is great. Coming into the action as the heroine in the latter part of the film, she basically saved the film as far as I was concerned. I believe the film is based on a book, which leads me to wonder if the screenplay is the major problem or if it was rubbish from the outset. I see some reviewers perceive mythic elements to the story, and praise the film for this reason, but really it's too bad to have serious claims to this stature.",

In all fairness, I haven't read the book (yet), but the adaptation seemed disjointed and awkward at best.  I actually felt sorry for Shelley Winters and Mitchum in the infamous \"wedding night\" scene, both of them exuding emotion and passion in a script page that didn't hint at any.  The mob scene looked like something snipped from a Universal monster flick... gotta love the grandma with the axe!  Film-noir fan that I am, I couldn't help laughing at the minimalism of the sets and the sporadic, clumsy attempts to cleverly use shadows.  The movie hits rock bottom with the sequences of the children running through the soundstage made to look something like a riverbank... watch for the spiderweb made of string! I really, really, really, wanted to love this movie, but it was ultimately amateurish save for Mitchum's first \"sermon on Right Hand and Left Hand,\" which is definitely a benchmark for the presentation of the psychotic movie villain.

What a shame because Laughton was a natural at putting a story on film as evidenced in his acting career and here in his brief stint as a director. He could have answered his critics with more great films and should have but he left to cinematic history a real gem of a film in Night of the Hunter. This thriller has a fabulous cast with Robert Mitchum in the dark role of the sinister serial killer disguised as a preacher on the trail of a the hidden loot of a prisoner who was condemned to death. In his way of his riches are Shelly Winters and child actors Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce. Peter Graves and James Gleason are also in the cast. Adapted from the Davis Grubb novel by James Agee who was best known for his screenplay of African Queen this is like a 20th century brothers Grimm. Look for wonderful screen imagery here. Cinematographer Stanley Cortez photographed this film. Cortez was noted for such films he did like The Magnificent Ambersons, Since You Went Away, Black Tuesday and The Three Faces of Eve in a prolific but uneven career body of work which also included The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini, They Saved Hitler's Brain and The Navy vs. The Night Monsters. Art Director Hilyard Brown who did the classic Creature From the Black Lagoon and would go on to do Von Ryan's Express does an excellent job on this film. He had a career of mostly westerns and horror films in the 40's and 50's and is least acclaimed for such films as Bonzo goes to College and Valley of the Zombies. Look for cleaver photographic effects weaved through this film by the team of Louis DeWitt and Jack Rabin. This film should have received several nominations and awards by the industry and by critics but it was panned by all.

            "content": "If you were to ask me what movies come to mind when you say \"masterpiece\", The Night of the Hunter would be one of the very first movies that I would name. When I watched it for the first time back in August 2020, I was stunned. It would constantly stick in my mind. I've seen it twice on TCM since then, and it's even better each time.The Night of the Hunter stars Robert Mitchum as Harry Powell, a runaway convict and a wolf-in-sheeps-clothing preacher after discovering that a cellmate on death row stole $10,000 and hid it in his property. After he marries and later kills the man's wife, he goes after her kids, and they run away to safety.While this movie has great performances from Lilian Gish and Shelley Winters, the best actor in this movie is easily Robert Mitchum, who gives a chilling and addicting performance as the wolf in sheep's clothing. Despite all of his talk of the Good Lord and his references to The Bible that please the townsfolk, the kids know his true colors and that's when Mitchum shines the most.He also should get credit for making a hymn creepy for me. Whenever he travels, he sings: \"Leeeannning, leeeannning, safe and secure from ALL ALARMS... Leeeannning, leeeannning, leaning on the everlasting arms.\" While that might give comfort in a church, Harry Powell ironically invokes fear with his chilling voice.The Night of the Hunter is also the directorial debut of actor Charles Laughton, and a fantastic one at that. The direction is powerful in many ways, such as the shot where the mother's hair waves in the water when Powell kills her.There is also a scene where Lilian Gish's character Racheal Cooper duets Leaning on the Everlasting Arms with Powell. The \"preacher\" is in darkness as he sings, but Racheal is covered in light, symbolizing that she walks in The Light while this supposed Man of God does not. If you pay attention to the visuals, you can spot many clever details like this that only enhance the story.Sadly, this movie was not well received originally back in 1955 (it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture somehow!), and that discouraged Laughton from directing another movie. That is a real shame, because this is so well crafted. Luckily, time has been good to this movie, and many now hail it for the great piece of cinema that it is.I would love to share more about the brilliance this film contains, but I would only spoil it for you. All I can say is that no horror film (that is what it is by definition) has shaken me more than this one has, all without jump scares or bloody gore.The Night of the Hunter truly is a masterpiece, and it's one of the finest movies I have ever seen. I would also consider it as my favorite horror film. For those who can handle the horrific elements of the story, I can't recommend this movie enough. This is a film that I hope to never forget.",

On one hand, it is a simple tale of two children trying to keep their late father's hidden money from being taken by an evil reverend (played by an excellent Robert Mitchum whose charisma is greater than almost any other actor I have seen). On the other hand, it is an eerie, surreal and almost supernatural mood piece \u2013 the long segment where the two children ride along the river has got to be one of the most atmospheric scenes of the 1950s.One of the main themes of The Night of the Hunter is contrasts; it is about good and evil, about God and Satan and about love and hate. Most of these are personified by Mitchum's character. His humble speeches about religion are juxtaposed by his evil nature, he rides through the night in his black clothes on a white horse, and he even carries the words 'love' and 'hate' on his knuckles. Furthermore, the film hints at the character being something more than human, perhaps essentially an animal, which adds to his complexity and the aforementioned eeriness of it all.The only thing that drags it down a bit is the happy ending, which completely lacks the disturbing subtext that runs through the rest of the film. Had it ended a bit earlier, for instance, when the kind Miss Cooper starts singing together with Robert Mitchum, this might very well have been a perfect work.

Robert Mitchum was free to roam within his character, albeit in a terrifying way, centering all of the other performances around his warped gravity.Mitchum excelled in his role; he plays a deviant priest who was more familiar with the interior of his jail cell than his parish, and his character Harry Powell might have considered himself more a fallen angel than a criminal. But he carries a dark, wilding aura about him which haunts each scene, even if he is not present within it.Night of the Hunter has echoes of Hitchcock, German Expressionism, and countless noir films that preceded it (Out of the Past was Mitchum's other great role) but it did something 'else', which is hard to put my finger on. I guess this is what makes it a great film - it transcends any genre and stands on its own. I only wish it would have led to Laughton making another film, because by this standard he had the chops.",

Here, he plays the diabolical central character almost but never quite over the top. Menacing, violent, murderous and ultimately nuts, Mitchum pulls it off and makes a mere silhouette.Shelly Winters does Shelly Winters standard stuff. The good, slightly naive, slightly stupid young woman who is victimized by a cad (see a place in the sun and Lolita for other classic examples).The two children actors are also quite good, and I wonder what became of them. The helpful IMDb suggests they never made it past being child actors.Peter Graves isn't on screen much, but its kind of cool to see him as a very young actor.Lilian Gish is solid and believable as the ultimate nemesis of the psycho and the protector of small children.Next, the direction.The real genius at work here is Charles Laughton, the director. This was a talent on par with and similar to Spielberg in his understanding of visuals, mood and narrative. The way scenes are set up and run, the steady narrative, the use of imagery are all interesting at least and frequently mesmerizing and all of the themes are echoed in Speilbergs work. Watch the lynch mob scene and if Steven didn't watch that and steal from it, I'll eat my hat. The subsequent film Cape Fear also owes a huge debt to this film, both the original and the remake.Apparently, Laughton's background was stage work and direction and many shots feel like a stage play, but that's okay and I think if he had continued to work in film, he would have appreciated and expanded into all of the greater opportunities that film provides over stage for visuals. He also some times over uses certain things (watch for the twinkling stars and cute little animals that clutter up some scenes) but what the heck.What a shame that Laughton never directed anything else, he might have provided other gems. But, if you had to do only one work, this is a pretty good one. Fifty years later and its still scary.If you don't know who Charles Laughton was, then watch Witness for the Prosecution, immediately.",

You realize from the first scene what's going to happen. It's a shame these leading critics did not have the mental acumen to realize they were watching schmaltz perpetuated by Robert Mitchum.Yet this plays repeatedly on TCM -- an outlet that should know better and which ignores many excellent films to focus on this trash -- and other \"leading: critics all tell us this is among the best. It isn't. The emperor is wearing no clothes. Yet, on TCM, some evangelical actress tells Osborne that \"good Christians\" don't act this way and he nods his approval. How's that for probing and deep? Yet I've sat in church and watched many good Christians do worse.Why do they tell us this is a good film?All of them are in exalted (wealthy) positions, make more money than the rest of us, and have not been exposed to as much real life as usual. They live through film in their libraries. It's a nice way to live.BUT -- No preacher in West Virginia dressed in that manner in the 50s or now. No preacher would have acted that way. Even West Virginians, among the most highly gullible when it came to religious belief, would be able to spot a villain as open and nefarious as Robert Mitchum.Why didn't Mitchum -- or any of the film reviewers -- ever go to an evangelical church? They're all over the world, in every city. You find the same fanaticism, the same \"turn off your brain - accept it all because I tell it to you\" diatribe we see in this movie. Did the film critics think this was fake? It's not. It's all too real.Had they heard of the snake charmers for Jesus? This brand of evangelical comes from Appalachia, too. Same mentality. It's all too real. It's just the way it is portrayed in this film, which is totally over the top, ridiculous, and almost deliberately dumb. This is not \"how\" they act, although this is exactly what they are saying.The reviews miss all this. The don't seem to understand that if a screenwriter truly understood their subject matter they could have written a true masterpiece on this subject. What we have is not just bad, it is atrocious. Mitchum was a grotesque failure in regard to movie making and had no business working with the script or producing.This is one of the very worst films I have ever seen in over 70 years and it has hoodwinked the critics who have little knowledge of what evil truly goes on in evangelical circles.",

It didn't live up to the 8.0 rating IMO but I'm glad I saw it.That said, there were several major plot holes. They may or may not detract from the movie1. The father in prison tells the preacher he never wants his kids to go hungry. But, previously, he tells the son not to get the money until he's an adult which means the money he stole will not help his kids not go hungry.2. I suppose this is not a plot hole but the preacher comes up to the oldest foster girl when she's in town alone and says \"You have 2 new kids don't you?\". We're never shown how he comes by this info nor how he knows this particular girl is the girl to ask. Further, if he somehow found out she was one of the foster kids who had 2 new kids it seems he could have just followed her home instead of asking her about them. He has no idea that the kids haven't warned the foster mom about him so it would be in his best interest not to ask.3. Why doesn't the foster mom call the police after the preacher vows to come back? She gives a lame excuse but I'd argue the excuse was bad writing. Any normal person would call the police if threatened like that. The only reason she didn't call was because the writers wanted the night long watch, not because it makes any kind of sense.4. After the preacher is shot (was he shot?) he hides in the barn for hours. Why did he stay there? It should have been obvious the police were called on him. Maybe he was supposed to be injured but we never see anything that suggests he was injured except his scream and when the police arrive he walks out of the barn on his own suggesting he could have run.",

Not sure why I was so looking forward to seeing it but maybe because one had heard it was kind of a classic. Still it's quite old and one might fear it hasn't aged well and the praise are most of nostalgic reasons. Well need not worry the film still holds up to greatness.The story is not the strong part of this movie and the focus for the thrills is not on that aspect of it. So the plot is kind of simple and you get quite early what it will build on. But it's no problem cause the filmmakers knew perfectly what to create the thrills of. Robert Mitchum is what carries this film, his performance is absolutely brilliant. The characters overall are amazing, both I think thanks to the performance and directing. Robert Mitchum as Harry Powell is so gripping in an very scary way, like when he is trying to persuade the two children it almost feels disturbing. The story though never feels overly simple rather it feels realistic and the brilliant performances makes the feel even better. The thrills are rooted in the psychological depth and it really gets to me. Another brilliant thing about the movie I must point out is the sound. The music is great for the creation of the right atmosphere but also just beautiful to just listen to. The sound effects when Harry Powell appears work brilliant almost making me jump every time and sitting on the edge when he is not around. There is also some singing in the film by Sally Jane Bruce and Robert Mitchum, very impressive and simply great. So are there any flaws in this brilliant movie? Well some of the dialogue is a bit weird, kind of the same with several old films. The problem is not that the speech is old but there are some scenes where I get the kind of funny feeling because people don't talk like that in real life. One other point of complain is the somewhat drawn-out ending. The end is good but when the real plot is over the film keeps going on for yet some time. Still this two complaints are minor and the rest of the film is just brilliant greatness. The Night of the Hunter is rare gem of a movie with it's realistic feeling and still gripping plot and interesting characters with amazing substance.The Night of the Hunter is and should be viewed as a real classic. It really is that good.",

            "content": "I'm unsure who deserves more credit here - novelist Davis Grubb, screenwriter James Agee, director Charles Laughton, star Robert Mitchum, or some combination thereof. Whichever the case may be, the writing of Harry Powell is horrifically sharp, and Mitchum's performance tight and diabolical, and it becomes the sort of role that's so vibrant it's hard to separate player from part. Powell is an utterly monstrous man, a \"snake in the grass\" if ever there were one and barely concealed at that. I'm aware that officially the implication is that Powell isn't a \"real\" preacher, yet the awful truth is that in his misogyny, cruelty, manipulation, violence, greed, abuse of children, and otherwise profoundly regressive and dangerous beliefs, Powell so perfectly mirrors the wickedness of conservative Christianity that 'The night of the hunter' feels abhorrently real. This is to say nothing of the gullible ease with which people get taken in by his superficial piety, to the point of denouncing those they would otherwise never think of badmouthing, and learning self-hatred. His every word is astoundingly inauthentic and false, and the \"left hand-right hand\" bit is so contrived it's hard in 2022 to believe anyone could take him seriously - yet, sadly, they do. Though of a different time and taking a more nuanced and rounded approach, it's hard not to feel in retrospect like the title is in actuality just as cutting an assessment of religion as, say, Kevin Smith's 'Dogma,' or even Paul Verhoeven's 'Benedetta.' This is a vivid, captivating movie - but, golly, is it bleak.Putting aside, for the moment, the sheer brilliance of Mitchum and Powell, it's hard to argue that any other aspect of this film is anything less than perfect. A storied career in front of the camera handily prepared Laughton for a stint behind it, and he demonstrates truly magnificent skills as a director. His eye for shot composition is unimpeachable, and the basic orchestration of every shot and scene is absolutely exquisite. Factor in tremendously smart use of lighting, and keen set design and decoration, and 'The night of the hunter' bears undeniable artistic value like precious few titles could possibly claim. The filming locations are swell, and Stanley Cortez's cinematography is crisp and rich, letting viewers take in every monumental, slight detail. Those details include great hair and makeup work, and attentive costume design - and solid acting from everyone on hand. Make no mistake, Mitchum takes the cake in the most despicable of ways, yet Shelley Winters, Lillian Gish, and even young Billy Chapin impress with strong performances of range and personality, along with their costars in smaller parts.The story is fantastically absorbing, and every scene that builds into it is smart and electrifying. Dialogue is snappy and often biting - and still, for what it adds to the picture, isn't even entirely necessarily. Reading of the production history it's clear what admiration Laughton had for the silent era (and rightly so!), and this rather comes across with steady visual storytelling that could feasibly substitute intertitles for sound and remain intact. This is surely a testament as well to the capabilities of the director, and all others involved. For as well as it's made, it almost feels like treachery to remark that I don't think it's completely perfect. Within the very last stretch of the film, young John Harper's trauma rears its head with a lack of clarity that made me do a double-take. The abrupt cuts at this point to Icey and her fellow citizens - though in keeping with the mindset they exhibited much earlier in the runtime - feels a bit like whiplash. And the very last scene, though providing a soft landing of a denouement, also feels pointedly ham-fisted and overdone: breaking with the tone of the picture otherwise, and just seeming forced generally. I'm sure I'm in the minority in reflecting on these small touches, but to me it's an unfortunate detraction from the viewing experience.Still, for whatever indelicacies or weaknesses one may perceive, by and large the fact remains that this is an exceptional, riveting, stimulating classic. It's worth watching for Mitchum's acting alone, or for the treasure that is the very fundamental craft from behind the scenes, nevermind all else that's executed so well. It's dark, violent, and harrowing - but fabulously satisfying as a moviegoer. Initially received poorly, more modern views of 'The night of the hunter' are much more on point: this is an excellent, engaging film, and it's well worth watching wherever you can.",

Harry eyes for the money hidden by John and Pearl's father before being captured and executed for bank robbery, and only John and Pearl know its whereabouts.Harry is a pure evil, he tricks a beleaguered Willa into marrying him, but humiliates her on their wedding night for indecency, and brainwashes her with the illusion that she is a sinful person needs redemption. Meanwhile he sweet-talks the credulous Pearl and tries to get the information from her but John is vigilant enough to not let her slip their secret. Soon Willa is mercilessly dispatched by Harry (the final shots of her under the water are morbidly aesthetic, Winters magnificently grubs for an under-appreciated and undemanding character), home is not a safe place for the two youngsters. They have a narrow escape on a skiff after Harry knows where is the money. Downstream, they eventually are accepted by an elder woman Rachel Cooper (Gish), who takes care of abandoned children. Rachel is a tough harridan with a golden heart, and when Harry finally materialises on her doorstep, she is nimble-witted enough to see through his pretentious carapace and not hesitate to aim her shotgun at him if he shows any motion to hurt the kids.As a heart-stopping thriller, the tension has been tangibly hanging over audience's head as soon as Harry enters the life of Jack and Pearl, in their home turf, no one, not even their mother, can protect them from the fanatical religious fiend, the film grimly pits two children against an adult villain. Finally in the third act justice will prevail. admirably, Laughton introduces Rachel, a seemingly feeble woman, a saintly protector, a true sermoniser of the gospel, comes to their rescue, and heroically gains the upper hand over the vicious menace. The silent era icon Gish shines vigorously for her unsung tour-de-force.A poignant and unforeseeable moment when Jack is shocked to see Harry being overcome by the police, which is a replay of the scene from his own father, he throws the money to him, and says that he can have it. Subconsciously, he takes Harry as a father figure, and the wanting presence of a father, is a big blow for a child in those desperate days. Also, the lynch mob near the end, is mordantly the same die-hard followers (lead by Evelyn Varden's superbly irksome busybody Icey Spoon).Robert Mitchum is such an outstanding screen villain under Laughton's supervision, although his destiny is doomed to be outwitted by two little ones, his overpowering presence envelops the film with a deadly threat of what an evil soul can ever possibly produce, unreservedly chilling to watch.Another stunning achievement is its mesmerising cinematography, especially those extremely theatrical shots in the sound-stage, with meticulous compositions, innovative exploitation of light and chiaroscuro, Laughton is such a savant in the director chair, what a pity his dabbling behind the camera had to end abruptly after the negative responses of this film, which also partially, accredits the belated fame THE NIGHT OF THE HUNER has garnered worldwide in the niche of being \"one-and-the-only\".",

Whilst in jail he learns of a large sum of money left to the children of a cell mate. After serving his sentence, Preacher makes his way into the children's home by marrying their lonely, religious mother. But his maniacal drive to find the hidden booty leads him back to his old murderous ways.Critique: Charles Laughton's only directorial debut is a triumph of film-making. The cinematography by Stanley Cortez is reminiscent of that by Greg Tolland in 'Citizen Kane'. Using deep-focus, light and shadows to create scenes of surreal-like landscapes. When first released many critics quickly dismissed the film, making it a box-office failure, so much so that Laughton never again directed. However, as it is always the case, 30 years later the celebrated technical virtuosity of the film were finally praised. The story works from a fairy tale story of Good vs. Evil, Innocence vs. Corruption as personified by the children vs. the evil Preacher. A sort of child's nightmare develops as they meet. Robert Mitchum creates a truly timeless performance as the vile Preacher. This movie is a true masterpiece that was years ahead of its time.QUOTE: Preacher: \". . .the body of a woman.

And constantly during the movie I saw gaffs and occasional over-acting (scene in basement?) but I still watched mesmerized because it hypnotized me in a nightmarish way. It definitely wasn't what I expected and I am still unsure how to categorize this movie because it definitely is not \"film noir\" but some surrealistic dream that actually works very powerfully, I mean I still think about it much more than about many other movies. Than I went on line and found out its a recognized classic because of this \"bad dream\" quality, its not \"film noir\" at all but a art- movie of first order and everything was done intentionally. Ah, now I get it. Still strange how a thin line makes huge difference between Ed Wood and a classic.Robert Mitchum is so perfect here as a serial killer (talking to himself and God, hating women obviously and being absolutely psychotic) that its impossible to imagine anybody else in this role. He dominates the story so much that its easy to overlook supporting cast that reminds me very much of citizen of \"Frankestein\" movies specially Mrs. Icey Spoon who is a perfect caricature of righteous busybody, later a scary monster herself. Shelley Winters does wonders with a fairly limited role but her repressed sexual hysteria/religious delusion is very powerful - there is a scene later in the movie where she doesn't talk at all and this is one of most unforgettable scenes in the whole movie, but I suggest you should see it for yourself. Alcoholic uncle Birdie Steptoe is somebody we expect would help the children and he does, thought not in a way we would expect. And than there is wonderful old-time actress Lilian Gish (star from silent era) in a quite epic role that seems like a perfect continuation of her earlier, sentimental work - it is a rare instance of actress finding perfect character definition of her career in later age. Children themselves are surprisingly good, they are not a cutesy Hollywood children but more like Hansel and Grethel of Depression era. Visually, the movie is stunning, with true expressionistic look and lots of Freudian symbols all over. I understand it wasn't successful back than but gained a reputation with time and deservedly so, makes you wonder what else would director come up with if he had a chance. What would Hitchcock made out of this?",

            "content": "I have recently watched Night of the Hunter and found it very creepy.  It has got to be one of Robert Mitchum's best performances.After being released from prison, a criminal pretending to be a preacher goes after his robber cell mate's family to try and obtain $10,000 he stolen.  His cell mate was hanged for the crime.  The \"preacher\" marries his cell mate's widow but kills her not long after.  He then starts stalking his step children, who have the money stashed in a doll.  They end up staying with a woman who looks after orphaned children, but the \"preacher\" follows them there and is eventually arrested.As well as an excellent performance from Robert Mitchum, this movie stars Shelly Winters (Alfie) and sci-fi/horror B movie regular Peter Graves (Killers From Space, It Conquered the World).This movie is beautifully shot in black and white and has some rather scary moments and an excellent, creepy score.This is a must for all movie fans.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "SPOILERSWell, this is my first film of 2007. I just rented Vertigo and Night of the Hunter at Hollywood Video. I commented on Vertigo so I am commenting on this. This is a very dark, black-and-white film. I knew it was going to have children at risk of being killed, but I did not know it was going to be that suspenseful. Robert Mitchum gives a terrifying performance as Reverend Harry Powell. He was as creepy as Max Cady, which was obviously another character he played.Here is the basic plot. A Reverend named Harry Powell who kills women that have no husbands finds out that a man robbed ten thousand dollars from a bank. The man hides the money. The man is arrested. He has a wife and two kids. Powell wants that money. He marries the wife to get to the money. When she does not help he kills her. Then he goes after the children. They escape and find a house with a woman named Mrs. Cooper. She has a gun. Powell follows the kids. Mrs. Cooper traps him in a barn. The police arrest him for the murder of the wife. In the end the children spend Christmas at Mrs. Cooper's.Overall, this is a fantastic black-and-white film. I mean, the music is great, the acting is great, the whole entire film is great. There is also a scene in which Cooper is trying to find Powell. All of a sudden, he pops in front of the camera. Cooper fires into the air and he, screeching like a cat, runs into a barn. That is so deeply disturbing. Just the way he yelps and jumps in front of the screen. It is so creepy. Anyway, this is a great film-noir thriller that fans of horror will enjoy to watch.9/10Recommended Films: Cape Fear.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton is still better known for his character rolls in the thirties and forties, but he had directorial skills, and Night of the Hunter is a notable, but flawed film. Certainly, it is some of the best work that Robert Mitchum ever did. In addition, in the Talkie Era, this is the finest work by Lillian Gish. In fact, this film is allegorical, pitting the hateful Bluebeard, Mitchum's phony preacher versus Gish's warm, loving religion.Indeed, the tattoos on Mitchum's fingers, left hand HATE, right hand Love; says it all as the story of stolen money unfolds. The children are innocence accented by moonlight cinematography, fury animals, and a Huckleberry Finn allusion, the big river as sanctuary from civilization. Mitchum's character with a switchblade is inspiration for future Freddie Kugar's. There are also derivations to the Frankenstein films. The angry mob goes after the monster with pitchforks.The minor character, teen girl, Ruby is a ward of Gish's, but she goes to town to find love with young town punks. Her attraction to the evil preacher, and Shelly Winter's odd attachment, represents sexuality outside of the Garden. This is strange material for 1955.The ending of this film may have fallen victim to the Hollywood cutting room. The mob scene is crazed, but the Preacher is whisked off safely while the DA unconvincingly assures us that the preacher will get his. Then Gish gives out presents to the children at Christmas for a good feel ending. Maybe the studio thought a lynching of a criminal was too harsh for a story with innocent children.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is nothing short of excellent. I can't believe this was Charles Laughton's first and only work as a director. With the help of screenwriter James Agee, who adapted Davis Grubb's novel, he crafted one of the finest thrillers I've ever seen.Harry Powell, a deranged Reverend, roams the South seducing and killing gullible widows to get their money and supposedly erect a temple in God's name. Of course he's just a remorseless murderer, as his first appearance shows when he has a very honest conversation with God, in a stolen car.Arrested and sent to a county jail, he meets Ben Harper, a nobody who stole $10,000 and hid them with his children, John and Pearl, before being arrested. These are the Depression years and he couldn't stand seeing his children wanting anything. So Powell kills Ben and when he's released he seduces and marries Ben's wife, Willa Harper. His intention is to force the children to tell them where they hid the money. All the pieces are set for one of the best cat-and-mouse games ever.The cast is strong. Robert Mitchum obviously steals the show: he portrays a vicious, but smooth-talking character who harbors murderous thoughts while smiling to everyone and being nice to children. With his lovely personality he wins everyone's affection, leaving the kids isolated and vulnerable.Shelley Winters isn't as ostentatious as Mitchum, since her role requires a more reserved acting. Throughout the movie, she shows a weary, melancholy face, the face of a woman tired of life and seeking some support. That's why she marries the Reverend.Then we have Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce, who are marvellous in their own roles. Chapin is especially good as the only who can see through Powell's lies and manages to outwit as best as he can.Finally there's Lillian Hish, who plays a surrogate mother for John and Pearl. Her role is short but powerful.The Night of the Hunter is a remarkable simple movie. It's one of those movies that does a lot with little. Good writing, good acting, and good cinematography - by Stanely Cortez - are pretty much the main ingredients. Cortez' black-and-white pictures are especially beautiful and haunting, creating an eerie world full of dread and mystery, suggesting more than showing. This may be the best black-and-white cinematography ever.Anyone looking for a movie with a great villain and a suspenseful story needs to watch this movie.",

The expressionist photography in this stylishly over the top thriller is stunning.  Two moments especially stand out, those being the central murder scene and the incredibly beautiful shot of the underwater corpse.  But there are moments to remember all over.  The plot works on several levels, and is quite psychologically complex, as well as being rather exaggerated in a way that cynical and stupid viewers will probably find pretty rioutous.  (These people, by the way, deserve a lifetime of Kevin Smith films.)There are serious flaws here, to be sure.  Laughton's skill at photography and imagery isn't quite matched by his ability to choreograph action, and the chase scene lacks tension for that reason.  In addition, the film ends on a saccharine note that rings so false it just had to have been tacked on by uncomfortable studio execs.

Sent to serve a 30 day sentence Powell finds himself being a cell mate of convicted double murderer and bank robber Ben Harper,Peter Graves! How the hell does a petty convicted criminal like Powell end up being in the same cell as a convicted double murder who should be in isolation on death row!It's Powell's discovering that Harper, who talked in his sleep, had hid the $10,000.00 that he stole at his place that gives him the idea that after he's released from jail, and after Harper is executed, to go to the Harper place and retrieve it. Using his usual charms and BS preacher talk Powell has no trouble convincing Harper's grieving widow Willa, Shelly Winters, that he in fact was the preacher at the prison where her husband was executed and got very friendly with him before he met his final end: The end that Harper met was at The end of a rope. Needing a man in the house to look after her and her two small children little Johnny & Peal, Billy Chapin & Sally Jane Bruce, Willa marries Powell not realizing that it's her husband's stolen and hidden $10,000.00 not her that he's in love with! It's little Johnny Harper who smells a rat in Powell's actions and does everything he could to prevent him from finding out where the money is hidden. This has Powell reveal is hand or true self in what his motives really are. And also ends with Powell murdering his wife of less then a week, Willa,in a fit of paranoia and phony religious outrage that in the end would lead to his arrest conviction and execution for his crime or, with a body count of some dozen murders already under his belt, crimes.Robert Mitchum really chews up the carpet here acting so crazed and deranged that it's a wonder that no one in the cast, except for little Johnny, notices it. There are scenes in the film where Mitchum acts so bizarre like crowing and cackling like a rooster at the break of dawn as well as acting as if he were playing a blind, like Bela Lugosi in \"Frankenstein meets the Wolfman\", Frankenstein Monster that I suspect he actually ad-libbed them! And wasn't directed by the movie's director Charles Laughton, in his first and only directorial effort, in doing them!The movie was a tour de force on Robert Mitchum's part who was so convincing as the off the wall homicidal maniac Harry Powell that his future, which seemed to have passed it's peak in 1955, in films was set and secure. That's in Mitchum later being cast in him playing crazed and homicidal lunatic roles, like in that great performance he did in the film \"Cape Fear\", from then on. That's when he became too old and wrinkled to play the tough and handsome parts that he was known for!",

Given his temperament, though, perhaps it was better for his health that he didn't.Robert Mitchum shows his potential as a great actor here. He is so blood-curdlingly evil from the first time we see him on film. His menace is as pervasive as the depression-era despair that flavors the entirety of the film, a predator without conscience and without remorse and there is no ambiguity or saving virtue to him. Shelley Winters is fantastic, her hapless widow is pitch-perfect. The children are capable and well-directed despite Laughton's rumored contempt for them. Lillian Gish is strong and loving and capable, a fierce protector and a compassionate nurturer. Every player is at their full potential in this film; even the bit players are nuanced and directed to perfection.The real star here, as in Fritz Lang's films, is the film itself, though. There are scenes of such beauty that you will be haunted for weeks after, recalling details you didn't know you'd seen at the time. The room where Willa meets her demise. The children spying the preacher on the horizon.

And my natural inclination is to admire any director who takes risks for the purpose of creating a work of art, but this film is nearly unwatchable.My central criticism is that everything on the screen feels so self-consciously purposeful. The script uses words and phrases that feel completely unnatural. There are filming effects that are pointlessly employed because they serve no purpose other than to take the viewer's attention away from the story. When we say that a film feels honest, we mean that it portrays some central truths about life or human nature. In contrast--because of its deficiencies--this film feels completely dishonest. Every character feels like a caricature speaking melodrama.One has to admire Laughton's efforts at creating something unique. But it's okay to recognize that his attempt failed. I would cite \"One From the Heart\" as another film that is very self-conscious and stylized. But that film works, maybe because musicals are better suited to such efforts. Regardless, I understand what Laughton was attempting and, if I had to chance to discuss the film with him, I would applaud his efforts and tell him to try directing again because his artistic vision deserves voicing. And I would suggest that he not direct children unless he first learned how children naturally talk and act.Robert Mitchum in \"Cape Fear\" is a good alternative to his role in \"Night of the Hunter\". I prefer Shelly Winters in \"Lolita\". I do think that Lillian Gish and James Gleason give naturalistic performances in this film, however.Obviously, the film strikes a chord with many viewers, but I don't think it is for everyone.",

This was certainly a unique film. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it sure is a powerful viewing experience, and unlike anything I'd ever seen before. It's very atmospheric, and filled with unpredictable situations. I didn't know what was gonna happen, nor did I wanna know. Robert Mitchum is terrifying as the psychotic religious nut. Not only is he a huge hypocrite, who uses his belief in god to do harm on others, and get what he wants, but he has this charm about him. He's not a villain who goes nuts, but he had this subtle way about him that kept me very uncomfortable. It definitely deserves to be talked about as one of the all time great performances. The cinematography, as many others have pointed out is a sight to behold. There are many stark images that stuck with me, whether it was Pearl cutting up dollar bills, or a very disturbing shot of Shelly Winters dead underwater. I did find it a tad unbelievable that Wila (Shelley Winters) would fall in love with Harry Powell (Mitchum) that quickly, even if it was partly for stability. It was a bit too quick for me. I'll give special mention to Lillian Gish for giving a memorable performance as Ms. Cooper. The kids are pretty good as well for their age, especially Sally Jane Bruce, with all her innocence and vulnerability. The ending put a big smile on my face as well. After the torture those kids went through, I was very satisfied with how things came to an end. Final Thoughts: It's not a masterpiece, but it's an excellent movie.

While there are many classic movies which I may not particularly like, I can generally understand why they are highly rated. That isn't something I can say about Night Of The Hunter.Aside from the superb cinematography, and some of the music, it's technically a poor movie, and seems to fail on just about every count. It's poorly acted, directed, scripted, edited and paced. I really am at a loss to see how so many glaring and fundamental problems can be overlooked by so many people. The biggest single issue for me is the standard of acting, which veers from passable (Gish, Gleason) to toe-curling (Winters) via unintentionally hilarious (Mitchum). As these people have given strong to excellent performances in other movies, the fault has to lie with Laughton's direction. Mitchum's performance is held up as a career best. I cannot begin to fathom this - the cartoonish nature of the character, the ridiculous lines he has to utter and the flagrant hamminess completely undermine any element of fear or suspense he's meant to generate. Villains are supposed to be at least plausible. Why not go the whole hog and tattoo \"nutjob\" on his forehead? Faced with this, it's no surprise Mitchum thought \"to hell with it\" and just turned it up to 11.Winters seems completely at sea, probably because her character is so badly under-written that there's little she can do to communicate how and why she behaves as she does. The rest of the cast are simply cyphers meant to represent good or bad traits, rather than actual characters you might care about, the Spoons being particularly egregious examples. Gish, however, manages to breath a little life into her role, despite being saddled with some of the very hokiest lines.It's clear Laughton had no interest in strict realism, which is no bad thing, but in order to work, this kind of stylised fable requires a certain lightness of touch. Unfortunately, almost everything in this movie, aside from some of its cinematography, is heavy-handed. The characters are pretty unbelievable even as archetypes, and much of what they say and do seems ridiculous. The result is bathos: many scenes are faintly risible, and more than a few are point-and-laugh. You don't feel for any of the characters because it never knits together as a drama, so all you end up with is a bunch of people acting. Badly. Many people have spoken about the dark and unsettling nature of this film. I can see that this is its aim, but when Evil is presented as so obvious and so ludicrous, practically twirling his moustachios and laughing maniacally, it topples over into pantomime. It seems to me to completely misunderstand the nature of evil - its banality, its seductiveness and its plausibility. I'd say it's not particularly strong on the nature of Good either, which is faced with no difficult moral choices or dilemmas and ends up coming across as trite. It's a beautiful film to look at, but so utterly disappointing on just about every other score.",

            "content": "I was expecting a much better conceived film but for what it's worth, Robert Mitchum's performance in the film as the lunatic preacher is quite good. The other merit of the film which I find many overlook is how it presents an unbiased view of religious people by having the character of Mrs. Cooper counteract Mitchum's Rev. Powell. It's a sign of maturity when one refuses to generalize any group of people.Other than that, the film can be quite a chore to watch at times. My main issue with it is that it unrealistically portrays the kids, John and Pearl, especially during the segment when they were on the run. It would have made sense to see the kids express the pains of starvation, or miss their mother, or little Pearl complaining to John that she doesn't want to sleep in the barn and demanding to go back home. By the time they decided to show some realistic presentation of the kids, when John relives the trauma of his father's arrest as the reverend is being subdued, it seems quite forced.It's a film that could have been much better but for what it is, it's not bad. Maybe more of Mitchum would have made it a little better.",

            "content": "This is a film that when I heard it was a playing at the Gateway Film Center as part of its Horror 101, I was intrigued. I originally thought I hadn't seen it, but when I went on the Internet Movie Database, I had it rated so it's been while. The other thing was debating if it was horror or not. Upon this viewing, I've decided that it is horror enough and I'll get into that later. I also gave this another viewing as part of an October movie challenge for the highest rated film from the 1950's in the 'horror' genre with another viewing as part of Movie Club Challenge/Where to Begin With Film Noir/Neo-Noir films.Synopsis: a religious fanatic marries a gullible widow whose young children are reluctant to tell him where their real father hid $10,000 that he'd stolen in a robbery.We start this with floating heads as an older woman tells them a story. It also feels like this all happened in the past and she is recounting the events. We then meet Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum). He's driving a stolen car and he gets busted for it. It is during the meeting with him that we learn he's a religious man. He has married women before he murders and robs them. He believes that God has put him here for him to spread his word. He also has Love tattooed on the knuckles of his right hand with Hate tattooed on the left. This is something that he uses to tell the story of how they're connected as well as how love conquers hate. He carries a switchblade as well.It then shifts to Ben Harper (Peter Graves). The police are after him. He killed a couple of guys and stole money. He makes his son John (Billy Chapin) and daughter Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) promise they won't tell anyone where he is hiding it, including to their mother Willa (Shelley Winters). The police arrive and they take him into custody.Ben ends up being cellmates with Harry and he knows about the stolen money. He tries to get Ben to tell him where it is hidden through talking to him in his sleep. This upsets Ben who at one point strikes him. His sentence is conducted before he reveals the information. Ben is executed by hanging.Back in the town, Willa is shunned by most everyone and her children are bullied. John looks out for his sister. Things change when Harry arrives, pretending he worked at the prison and that is where he met Ben. He convinces Willa that he loves her and that the money is at the bottom of the river. We see how convincing he can be when he brainwashes her and starts to preach to the town. All the while, he is working on John and Pearl, trying to figure out where the money is hidden. Harry will stop at nothing to get to it, even murder.Now I wanted to go a little bit vague on the recap, even though this film is 60+ years old. It has an interesting concept, especially for the era that it came out. The first time I saw this, I apparently thought it was okay, but I wasn't high on it. I will admit, I wasn't as cultured back then and diving more into films has given me a greater appreciation. After multiple viewings, there is more I've gotten out of it.To start off with, this has element that if you know my taste is something I love. We have the corruption of religion here. Harry uses it to his advantage for sure. The first thing is that he seems to only follow the Old Testament. He justifies the horrible acts he does because that section of the bible can be quite brutal. He believes that he can do whatever he wants if he does it in the name of God. His strong personality allows him brainwash people. An example is that he gets Willa to change her ways. She is a weak woman that he influences her so much. I think part of this is the time as we're in the Great Depression here. Women were supposed to be submissive to their husbands. Since he is a man of 'God', everyone in the town falls in love with him. How things play out in the end is great for this and how the mob mentality can take over. It is only John, then finally Pearl who sees his real side until they get to Rachel Cooper's (Lillian Gish).I personally don't consider this horror, but I do think it is close enough. It has enough elements for me to write this review and include it in my horror film research that I'm doing as well. Part of it is the time that this was made. Harry is a killer without remorse. I think that if this film came out later, it would be much closer to what we see from Max Cady in Cape Fear remake. Maybe not necessarily with the sexual violence, but the lengths he'll go. It is interesting though as an actor, Mitchum was the same character of Max in the original version of the other movie. He is relentless in his pursuit of the children, which would be a scary way to live. There is an unnerving feeling of never getting away from him as well as just that impending sense of doom. Going along with this, the dread of the religious song he is singing is great as well. You can hear it even when he's far off.Something that I used to have an issue with was the pacing though. My issue was that I felt like film drug in the second half. The set up to this is great. Getting to know how despicable Harry is and seeing how he preys on this film is good. I even think once he kills Willa and takes over as the guardian is great. Seeing him manipulate everyone is terrifying since we know the truth. I don't have the same issue that I used to though. It does slow down with the children fleeing, but this time I picked up on how they're doing what they can to survive and seeing how hard life is. It isn't until they meet Ms. Cooper, who takes them in and gives them protection. She also molds them into better people.That should be enough for the story so I'll go to the acting which is good. Mitchum is such a villain and is perfect for this role. It is one of his more iconic ones and I thought he does a great job here. I have trouble seeing him as a good guy for how he plays roles like this if I'm honest. I think Winters does a solid job as well. She is trying to be a good mother, but she is in over her head. When someone like Harry comes around, she loses herself. It is like people I know in real life. Gish is good as well in her protective role. She portrays a good mother in that she is stern but will do what whatever she can for the children. I thought Chapin and Bruce were fine and the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed. It was fun though to see Graves in such a small role as well knowing that he'd go on to have a good career in acting.There's not much to talk about the effects of the film as this came out in the 1950's. I do think the backgrounds look interesting when we can hear Harry singing his song and he's in the distance. It builds a feeling of uncomfortability which I enjoyed. This is interesting as it has a surreal look to it There are a few times that we can see they're on a stage where the backgrounds aren't where they are really. I don't mind that. The last things would be Willa in the car at the bottom of the pond. That was creepy. Aside from that I think we have good cinematography here for the era.I've already touched on it a bit, but the soundtrack is solid. Overall, it doesn't stand out. Harry does sing the same song throughout and it is unnerving. He just keeps repeating the same words and it's a religious song. Hearing this come from someone like him is quite eerie if I'm honest. There is also a scene where he is singing as well as Rachel which showing the duality of the two and it worked well.In conclusion, my enjoyment of the film came up from multiple viewings. Even though I wouldn't necessarily consider it a horror film, it is dark in the subject matter and Harry as a character is terrifying. I love the idea of him using religion to justify the horrible crimes he is committing. The acting is good. The cinematography is well done. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but it doesn't necessarily need them. I also like how the soundtrack is used here. Overall, I did like this one and I can see why it is considered a classic. I will warn you it is from the 1950's and is black and white. If that's not an issue, I'd say to give this a watch. It is worth your time.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "I saw this movie in a theater in a restored version that just started showing at Swedish cinemas. I came in with very high expectations of a dark and deservingly classic thriller. And from the first frame to the last one I was completely hooked. First there is the experience of watching a black & white movie in a cinema, which I've actually never done before, which was just extraordinary in itself for me. The difference between watching a black & white movie on TV and cinema seemed much greater than the difference between a color film on TV and cinema for some reason. Maybe because it feels much more prestigious, I don't know - it was just a feeling that hit me right away. When the credits went up on the screen with dramatic music behind the only thing that went through my mind was \"this is what movies are all about. This right here.\"This is however, an eccentric movie, and perhaps not for everyone. For example, the characters often talk right into the camera in monologues, which might not suit everyone (like my brother, who really liked the movie but found that part a little disturbing). But to me this was just plain brilliance. Shortly described the movie is about a psychotic preacher (Robert Mitchum) who marries widows and then murders them. When he is searching for the 25th one, he runs into her husband in jail (the preacher sentenced to 30 days for car theft and the husband to death for a bank robbery in which he killed two people) and he hears him talking in his sleep about the $10,000 he stole from the bank. So when he gets out he seeks the family up and try to steal the money, but after killing the wife the children run away from the village (the great majority of the village always believes the preacher is an honest man of God) and the preacher, who is named Harry Powell, sets out to hunt them down and get the money (which their father entrusted them with before he was caught by the police).However, the movie is much more complicated than this and full of symbolism - the mood is kind of dreamlike and surreal, which can be displayed in the construction of the village itself which seems to be the only civilization in the whole world - both to the viewers and to its citizens. And especially the hunting sequences, where the children take a boat and float down a river, are mesmerizing in its black & white over-worldly beauty. This scene is so full of mood it feels as if you are reading a story book, and you get totally swept away by it. Then the view of Robert Mitchum riding calmly after them, knowing that he will sooner or later catch them no matter how fast they travel, just like all the monsters you are running from in a nightmare. But perhaps the best scene in the whole movie is when the children take refuge in a barn over night, and in the morning they wake to see Powell ride like the grim reaper himself along the road with the sun rising in the background. This scene is so brilliantly executed, so vividly imaginative and yet so aware of all its simpleness that it comes out as one of the best and most beautiful scenes I have ever scene in a movie.But what about the symbolism I wrote about earlier? Well the most obvious one is in preacher Harry Powell himself - who many viewers consider to purely symbolizes evil, which I don't think is entirely true. To me he symbolizes the evil world outside, the scavenger-like civilization which devoures all that show the least bit of fear or doubt. Just notice how the landscape outside the village is built - cold, empty and threatening, it almost looks like some kind of plague is terrorizing the land. And all of the insecurity and fear that this invoke in the children is gathered in preacher Harry Powell. From a certain point the danger lies more in the children themselves than within the preacher. Just notice how greatly his power over them diminish when they find shelter at a lady who is taking care of lost children. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen - the cinematography is nothing but stunning, the scenes so carefully constructed (like the cellar scene where Powell calls from the stairs for the children, which has been imitated countless times), every little detail so perfect, every frame so flawless it left me in a purely ecstatic state. This was the only picture Charles Laughton directed, mainly because the chill response from the audience (although it won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1955), which is a shame since he obviously had limitless potential.I haven't commented on the acting yet, but that is also one of the cornerstones for this movie to work - this film requires a lot from its actors, but they all deliver extremely well. Especially Robert Mitchum who is brilliant beyond words as the insane preacher Harry Powell, one of the most memorable performance I've ever seen. And one of the most memorable characters. Harry Powell is right up there with Travis Bickle, Vito Corleone and Norman Bates.Altogether this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I am especially glad I got to see it in a theater - my first great cinema experience, one I will surely not forget.",

            "content": "This masterpiece is the only film directed by the great actor Charles Laughton and from the way he pulls it off, you'd think he'd been behind the camera for years. Robert Mitchum stars as a psychotic preacher with \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" written on his hands (his story of \"right hand left hand\" is not to be missed). He gets out of prison, marries a lonely woman, tries to get the money of her bank-robber husband, rallies the religious nuts, talks to God, and tries to kill his step-children. This performance makes Max Kady number 2. Don't get me wrong, CAPE FEAR is a great film, but it lacks a mysterious element that this film possesses. Stanley Cortez's cinematography is some of the best and most unusual I've seen. This is one of the earliest films to use the helicopter shot. This makes me wish that Laughton had continued directing films for the remainder of his career. The only first film I've seen that tops it is CITIZEN KANE (that ought to tell you something). It isn't even really a suspense film. The story and its themes are wonderful, strange, and unforgettable. There has probably never been a film quit like it, and that's part of what makes it such a rare joy. Shelly Winters does a fine job as the lonely, then religiously entranced wife/mother. If you desperately need something to compare this to, try Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT, which isn't quite as good. They don't make them like this anymore because they never did.",

Robert Mitchum is one hell of an antagonist, with a booming voice. His singing of ' Leaning on Everlasting Arms' is one of the best things about the movie. But this is Laughton's first and only movie, and there are problems.The 2nd half where the children move to Mrs Cooper, is where the movie loses steam. It is so very melodramatic and righteous that it's boring and you just wait and want Mitchum to crop up again. He eventually does though.But it's that part which really spoils the movie for me. The acting is so unconvincing and melodramatic it seems almost like a spoof. Overall, a good watch, but not a classic for me.",

Very stylized, biblical telling with a Greek chorus beginning and end.The anti-woman theme is not so much a homosexual one but a biblical one. It was the weakness of Eve that caused Man to be cast into the wilderness. Laughton mocks the bible-thumpers by using their own sources and devices.It is a morality play within a morality play. Within the tale of the weakness of woman, is also a modern one about the weak-mindedness of the stout well-meaning American who is so easily subverted by the clarion call of the false prophet. Remember this was filmed in the age of McCarthy, showing the worst side of American democracy right after WW2 demonstrated its best side.The performances are magnificent. Mitchum is brilliant as the psychotic preacher. Winters is under-appreciated as the Pandora wife. Gish is perfect as the guardian angel, with American common-sense righteousness. She restores the order at the end - sort of...The ending is a bit weak I think, but the rest of the journey, especially the surreal cinematography, the thinly veiled satire and Mitchum's performance is perfectly done.A great commentary on the good and bad of middle America.

It's not the story that matters so much as how it's told, as directed by Charles Laughton in his one (credited) directorial effort. It is said he never directed again because the reviews of \"The Night of the Hunter\" discouraged him so much.Robert Mitchum is \"Reverend\" Harry Powell, a self-appointed preacher who preys upon lonely widows - \"What'll it be now, Lord? Another widow?\" - killing them for their money as he believes the Lord has instructed him, and then moving on to the next victim. While in prison briefly on a car-theft rap, he shares a cell with Ben Harper (Peter Graves, best known for his role on the old TV show \"Mission Impossible\").He tries to worm the location of the money from Harper before the execution. When he is released from his brief prison stay, he heads straight for Willa Harper (Shelley Winters); Ben's weak, sweet, sexually frustrated, somewhat dense widow, and her two kids.There is just so much going on in this film: biblical references and symbolism; Freudian symbolism (Powell's knife brandished in a couple of scenes as a warped version of a phallic symbol); Mitchum's and Gish's amazing performances; various other, interesting, smaller story lines; a scene reminiscent of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1919); Powell's tattoos of \"Love\" and \"Hate\" on his knuckles; and the dream-like, surreal riverboat escape sequence. The children, played by Billy Chapin (John Harper) and Sally Jane Bruce (Pearl Harper) give effective performances. There's also the over-the-top campiness in some of Mitchum's acting, which fits in perfectly with the stylized direction of the film; the sexual undercurrent and its repression that runs throughout (and no one played whiny, sexual frustration in those days better than Shelley Winters, as evidenced by this and other roles such as the mother in \"Lolita\" (1962): \"Harrrrrry! I'm lonnnnnnnely!\" and her role as the cast-aside pregnant girlfriend in \"A Place in the Sun\" (1951).Lillian Gish is wonderful in her portrayal, standing up to the evil Harry Powell, and Robert Mitchum is perfectly cast in what some see as his best film role; his charismatic, handsome, oily, smooth portrayal of the serial killer Harry Powell surely must stand as a study guide for today's actors. Mitchum seemed to reprise much of his technique for this performance for his subsequent role in \"Cape Fear\" (1962).I really can't say much more without going on and on for pages. Each scene could be written about and analyzed in detail; each scene is lit and photographed and told in a manner that has a director's hand prints all over it. It's a true artist's film, and we will never know what other wonders Charles Laughton could have directed. I have read of some viwers who laughed through much of this movie, which is unfortunate. I find it difficult to comprehend that reaction from any intelligent viewer who was really paying attention. I guess you either \"get it\", or you don't, which may have something to do with the film's dismal success when it was released.This under-appreciated film is a ghoulish twist on a classic story, directed (and mostly written, it is said, by Laughton, after his arguing with James Agee over the rendition of the screenplay) in a masterful manner by a man best known for his own portrayals of classic film characters such as Captain Bligh in \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935), and Quasimodo in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1939).The hymn \"Everlasting Arms\" recurs throughout, and could never sound the same again after this film.Go. Go at least to rent this movie, or better yet, buy it. It's a one-of-a-kind masterpiece, IMO.",

While Laughton has chosen to give his 1955 film (set in the 30s) the look of something that may have been produced in the silent era - he sometimes adds the odd unintentional laugh - these come via curious characters dotting the equally strange sets and situations.Perhaps the real power of this bizarre work should be credited to Director of Photography Stanley Cortez. Cortex has fused the film with striking visual atmosphere - adding an ethereal mood to the already dark story of a psychologically deranged 'preacher' serial killer. Whoever called the shots, between the two of them, they certainly left us with a haunting visual treat - who could ever forget the long blond hair flowing within the river currents, intertwined with the long wisps of river growth! The casting of stars from the silent era also gives the film an older look but there are undoubtedly many superb scenes to be enjoyed throughout this, at times, unsettling story.There's an effective music score by Walter Schumann along with an odd casting choice of Mitchum as the hideous 'reverend'.",

The way Robert Mitchum channels menace through such a cordial personality is what makes it so captivating and memorable. He's the primary and largest reason why the picture is considered a classic instead of just some movie directed by an old actor.Though Charles Laughton didn't do a bad job on this film.What's strange about his directorial debut effort is that unlike most amateur directors who can do the plain stuff, but struggle with the more nuanced Laughton is the opposite. He gives this more abstract qualities like style,atmosphere and a decent pace while some basic scenes come across as very heavy handed and clumsy. It's a shame he didn't do direct more films judging off of the potential he showed in this film.While it isn't terrible in its other qualities(the cinematography is actually quite good)I would be lying if I told you to watch this film for any other reason than Robert Mitchum's performance. Harry Powell is considered one of the best villains of the screen for a good cause; he's a character that will have you wondering who will triumph love or hate?",

            "content": "Charles Laughton's only foray as director has left us with a movie that is almost unclassifiable.It's a film-noir, certainly; but it's also a fairy story. This strange amalgam may confuse viewers who are used to clearer definitions. Perhaps inevitably, as a debut attempt at directing there are flaws. To expect perfection would be unreasonable.Robert Mitchum plays the titular hunter. He is Preacher Powell - a psychotic, homicidal misogynist with messianic delusions. He is disgusted by his own sexual desire and loathes women for the very fact that he finds them uncontrollably arousing. It's their fault. And they must be punished. And as he is doing the Lord's work, he is punishing them on the Lord's behalf and with His inexorable vengeance. Yep; he's nuts.He talks to God. And during his soliloquies we learn that he may have murdered as many as 25 women. In a cynically perverted way, he seems to have actually convinced himself as to the rightness of his cause. He's also a coward. A chance encounter in prison puts him on the scent of $10,000 dollars. Upon release, he sets himself to hunt it down.That money is in the secret safe-keeping of the late robber's children. And it's now when the film-noir becomes a fairy story, with Mitchum the archetypal Bogeyman. He represents wickedness, the children: innocence. Each is announced by their own music, with deep, foreboding cords signifying the hunter's menace, whilst closer he can be heard singing some religious anthem. The children are depicted by a lyrical tune, almost like a lullaby. They escape down-river, he pursues them at a steadfast, leisurely pace, ever in concert with The Lord.Lilian Gish comes to their salvation as the Good Fairy.Laughton and Mitchum set the template for every bogeyman that followed. His booming cords were borrowed for the later 'Night of The Demon'. His broad-brimmed hat was adopted by Freddy Kruger and the beast from 'Jeepers-Creepers'. His standing briefly in the evening by a streetlamp is reprised in 'The Exorcist' and so on.In each of us there is an adult and a child, still. Laughton's 'Hunter' is an attempt to touch both psyches. If he succeeds then you will be mesmerised by his work. If he doesn't, you'll likely dismiss it as a failure.",

            "content": "When first released in 1955, \"The Night Of The Hunter\" didn't garner much critical acclaim. And today, almost 60 years after its initial release, it's being viewed as a masterpiece by most film scholars and critics. The appreciation shown towards the film is what tempted me to give it a shot. But what I saw didn't match the admiration it has got in these 60 years.\"The Night Of The Hunter\" follows the story of Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a religious fanatic and his attempts to acquire a hidden stash of money his prison inmate Ben Harper (Peter Graves) stole in a bank robbery. Ben, before being apprehended, hides the money, allowing only his son John (Billy Chapin) and daughter Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) to learn of the exact location of the hidden fortune and makes them promise that they will never tell anyone about it. After the death of Ben, Powell decides to go and meet the Harper family in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of the money. He woos Ben's grieving widow Willa (Shelley Winters) and marries her. John, who begins to suspect Powell, is convinced that Powell will try to hurt his sister and his mother. Bound by the promise he made to his father, John decides to keep quiet about it, knowing that the truth may endanger the lives of his sister and mother.\"The Night Of The Hunter\" has got a decent plot alright, but it's the execution of it where the films sinks. The screenplay is a major flaw, in which most of the dialog has a lyrical, poetic sound to it. The characters often sing their dialog instead of speaking it and, after a while, you grow increasingly weary of it. The excessive use of songs begins to take its toll on your patience. The plot too is populated by bizarre characters who share a common trait for being as gullible as the grieving widow. Mitchum, who gives a very good performance as the psychotic Powell, plays a character who has the ability to charm any woman he wants. So charming is Powell that a woman invites him for a picnic and tries to convince her friend, the widow, to marry him just because he tells the story of the left hand and the right hand, the story of good and evil, better than anyone she has ever met. Hard to believe? Here's another one : It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Powell's insane but Pearl, who had been a victim of Powell's rage, still runs happily to him when he shows up later in the film. This is one of the many things about the film I couldn't fathom. How is any of this relevant to the plot which should've revolved around the money rather than the antagonist? Humor and wit are scarce and the plot ultimately drags itself to a rather predictable conclusion.On the positive side, the cinematography of the film left me speechless. There's a remarkable shot of a dead Willa sitting in a car underwater. That particular shot is a triumph of photography. Another one is the one where Powell sits on the fence singing 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms' in front of a house. The sequence, shot artfully, is able to articulate the creepiness of Powell and his desperation. Apart from the idiosyncratic dialog and characters, there are two sequences of exemplary storytelling in the film. One is where Powell interrogates the children in the cellar only to find out that he has been lied to and the second is the one where Powell first learns of the money from his inmate. But, unfortunately, neither of the sequences are enough to deter the brittle screenplay from falling apart. \"The Night Of The Hunter\" could've been a much better film only if the screenplay would've been a bit tighter. I would recommend the film to anyone who wishes to see a marvel of photography. But in comparison with the other suspense thrillers of the 50s like \"Rear Window\" and \"Psycho\", \"The Night Of The Hunter\" fails spectacularly. And it saddens me to say that.",

            "review_title": "Comments based on the Criterion Collection edition",
            "content": "When I got a DVD of this from Netflix only to see the introductory, \"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.\" I was incensed. There is no way that I wanted to watch a truncated version when a wide screen version was available. In addition to the formatting issue, the film quality was not good. So, I bought a Criterion Collection Blu-Ray disc and was happy that I did. Not only did it have the 1.66 aspect ratio of the original film version, but also the film quality was pristine. This latter is important, since a great deal of the enjoyment of viewing this movie is to appreciate the artistry of the high contrast black and white filming. I think this was a truly collaborative effort between director Laughton, screenwriter Agee, and cinematographer Stanley Cortez--it is hard to know which of these three deserves the most credit. Besides its technical excellence the Criterion Collection (produced in 2010) has enough extras to overwhelm even the most ardent fan. There is a 2008 commentary track with four people who seemed to be most interested in one-upping each other--I found their commentary to be of minimal value. There is a 38 minute documentary on the making of the film as well as a fourteen minute segment containing interviews with Robert Mitchum, Shelly Winters, Lilian Gish and others. There is a fourteen minute 1984 interview with Stanley Cortez that proves that he had no small ego. The clip that I found most interesting was a 2010 interview with Simon Callow who gives some informative insights into Charles Laughton and how you can see why he was drawn to directing this. There is a two-and-a-half hour compilation of outtakes. These show multiple takes of many of the scenes and get to be a little tedious. Interesting to see the dialog between Laughton and the actors though.I first saw this when I was young and saw it primarily as a thriller with sinister Mithchum pursuing the two young kids to find out where they were hiding money. On that first viewing I missed out on a lot of more complex themes I found from recent viewing. I think this should get a PG-13 rating, since any kid under thirteen might have nightmares for a few days after viewing. Robert Mitchum gives a remarkable performance as the sociopath preacher Harry Powell. Anyone who has seen this will remember the Love/Hate tattoos on Powell's fingers and the early scene where his hands fight it out between love and hate. This scene sets the tone of the contrasts in the movie: love/hate, good/evil, black/white, young/old, reality/artifice. I think Powell is one of the most unusual characters ever seen on screen. I could not figure to what extent he was in any sense a man of the Lord. He would speak to the Lord, even when alone, but was he really believing this, or was he mocking the practice? In any case the Lord would take a dim view of his penchant for killing and robbing widows. A thing that came across strongly in second viewing was Powell's sexual hangups. His switchblade is used as a symbol for his manhood--in one scene, as he stoically watches a sexually suggestive dance, his switchblade clicks open, jutting out to cut a hole in his pocket. On his wedding night he refuses sex and in a later scene, when one of the pursued children wants to look at his knife, he shouts, \"Don't touch my knife!\" Powell is one screwed up dude.Shelly Winters does well as a naive, sex-starved mother that Powell preys on. This is similar to the role Winters would play in \"Lolita.\" The two kids are good enough, but are not as natural as many child actors of recent times. In one of the extras Laughton is seen directing them and we see that it was not an easy task. Neither of the kids went on to acting careers. This is an unforgettable one of a kind movie.",

            "content": "Robert Mitchum, in his film career, had a number of heroic roles, tough guy roles, and once in a great while, some despicable villianous roles, as in this film, \"Night of the Hunter.\"  Indeed, Mitchum's character, a backwoods preacher named Harry Palmer, could rate very high on a scale devoted to villians and truly evil personalities.That being said, the story basically revolves around Mitchum's learning from a prison inmate that an amount of money has been hidden by him, and his two children know about it.  Mitchum determines to find those two children, and take the money for himself.  The prison inmate's widow, played by Shelley Winters, is unaware of the existence of the money, and falls for the wiles of the preacher, who marries her, then goes after his stepchildren with the same evil intent.  Shelley comes to an unfortunate end, and the two children finally get a person to protect them in the form of their grandmother, played by Lillian Gish.This was Charles Laughton's only entrance into the field as a director, but he made it a classic entrance with this film.

It reminded me of Lugosi struggling with the rubber octopus in \"Bride of the Monster\" or any number of cheap zombie movies with a creature deliberately moving slowly with arms outstretched. Mitchum's assorted weird, non-verbal outbursts don't make any sense at all. And why exactly did the film need a torch-wielding mob straight out of \"Frankenstein?\"",

            "content": "Loosely based on an actual 1920s murder case, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER was directed by legendary actor Charles Laughton--and its failure with both critics and public derailed Laughton's directorial ambitions; it was both his first and last directorial effort. Over the years, however, it has come into its own, and today it is regarded as one of the finest films to emerge from 1950s Hollywood.In general, the story concerns an itinerant preacher named Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a truly unpleasant entity who believes he has made a pact with God to rob and kill unsuspecting women. Arrested in a strip joint for auto theft, he finds himself in prison with Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who is condemned to death for a bank robbery murder--and who the stolen money hidden away. When Powell is released, he heads straight for Harper's wife and children (Shelly Winters, Billy Chapin, and Sally Jane Bruce) in search of the cash.HUNTER is clearly influenced by the film noir movement, but even so it would be difficult to describe as film noir per se. The film is very deliberately artificial in style with an emphasis on remarkably beautiful and distinctly dream-like cinematography that counterpoints the darkness of the story. The production values are memorable and direction quite remarkable, and few films have so successfully created a balance between right and wrong, good and evil.A good deal of the film's success rests on Mitchum and legendary actress Lillian Gish, the latter of whom appears as Rachel Cooper in the second half of the film. Mitchum is truly frightening in is evil--but he proves no great match for a truly Christian woman, who quickly sees through his pretenses and does battle with him for the lives and souls of the children he so relentlessly pursues. What ultimately emerges from the film is both Christian allegory and a classic tale of good verses evil, about which the film makes a remarkable statement: while evil strives to be impressive, it is at best trivial and may be overcome by simple and unpretentious goodness.It would be nice to see the film given a full bells-and-whistles release on DVD--the transfer here is acceptable but no better than what you might find on television, and the bonuses consist of a theatrical trailer and nothing more. Even so, this is a film worthy of inclusion in any collection. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Very good shot in black and white, \"Night of the hunter\" stands on an excellent performance of Robert Mitchum -his role, here, anticipates the part he will play some years later in \"Cape Fear\".In a bigoted region of the United States a preacher (everyone thinks he's an honest man) marry a widow in order to get her money, precisely the money her husband hid. Of course he begins to terrorize her children and shows what he really is, a monster.The film is classified among the best thrillers ever made. Well, with such story, for me, the film could have been stronger, there could have been a higher level of tension. The film is not boring at all, but in some moments it seems that the action goes a little slower.For example, there are moments of humor which makes you loose the dramatic dimension. I also wonder if it is normal that the two poor children never cry and never say that they miss their mother -who has disappeared, they don't know the preacher killed her... Wouldn't normally everyone -children above all- be anguished?!? The film also has a kind of happy end which could be avoided -after all it's a 1955 movie, maybe it was too difficult at that time to end a film with a more dramatic situation...Apart from these points, the film is still watchable.",

Yes, the same Charles Laughton, who also appeared in Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd (1952). Night of the Hunter (1955), is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. It is part of the National Film Registry list. That is an amazing thing to consider, since the film had a rough initial release in 1955. It was a bomb, critically abused and it made Laughton leave the directing business for the rest of his life. It obviously ruffled the feathers of various faiths along the mid-west too. However, over the decades it gained recognition of being a great film, regenerated into cult-classic status by a large fanbase and eventually became a top 100 staple on lists everywhere.The film is about a false, man-of-faith, serial killer, who uses his faith to justify the brutality of his actions. At this point, this fake minister, Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), is trying to swindle $10,000 out of a woman, after he finds out about the money from her husband, while serving time in jail. He uses his charms of the cross, to lure his victim's into a false sense of security and then he strikes. The story is based off of a novel of the same name and Laughton utilizes a lot of great old-Hollywood, filmmaking technical styles, that make the mood of the film even greater. It gathers together a great cast along with Mitchum, such as, Lillian Gish, Shelley Winters and Peter Graves.Some of the scenes are shot on-location in West Virginia, but a large bulk of the film is shot on sound stages, mostly for budget issues, but turns out being a positive, because the set pieces, that Laughton uses are really artful. They are beautiful. Laughton is able to capture the moody, brilliance of film-noir. The lighting and set design looks great in another wonderful black and white film. There were plenty of options to shoot in color, but maybe because of budget issues it was decided to do it in black and white. That, once again, ends up being a positive for the film. That is what makes this film great. Laughton was able to capitalize on budget issues and turned it into a strength. Be prepared for a brutal story (1950s style), about the devil in a black hat, but also be prepared to see a moment in film history that is a sight to see.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

Some of the themes and messages dropped in here and there throughout the piece are pretty racy for the time, and it's clear (though no less tragic) why contemporary critics couldn't get their heads round Laughton's unique, peculiar use of the film medium. The kids in the leads put in some of the weirdest child-star performances ever, but pull it off well, and Mitchum is excellent as the villain, as is Lillian Gish as the \"strong tree with branches for many birds\" who takes in the kids.

            "review_title": "Fabulous parable of good vs evil, child vs adult",
            "content": "British-born actor Charles Laughton's sole directorial venture works on the mind, a nightmare involving adults and children whose mother is duped by the evil pastor superbly and creepily played by Robert Mitchum. Shelley Winters portrays adult naivet\u00e9 perfectly, contrasting with Mitchum's calculated strategy to take over her life, property, and ultimately her children. Winters realizes her error much too late and ends up at the bottom of the lake, her hair gently bobbing like thin reeds in one of the most lyrical images I have ever seen on the screen.Now motherless, the children flee and at every step of the way they seem to be in touch with, and comforted by, animals and nature in general, until they come into the protection of Lillian Gish, who sublimely embodies good, as does Nature, to ultimately defeat evil.I see NIGHT OF THE HUNTER as a near Biblical parable, with pastor Mitchum a wolf in lamb's wool pushing children into adulthood much faster, sooner and cruelly than any child deserves. Children pitted against a dangerously demented man of God adds considerable moral weight to the conflict at the heart of this film. The message that I take from it is that children have it far more difficult than it seems to survive in a world of adults, some of whom may be quite evil, and we must always protect the weakest among us.I see that some reviewers dump this film with 1/10. Of course, they are entitled to their own interpretation and rating, but I think that they miss the spirit of this movie, a kind of state of mind reflecting a deep awareness of the frailty of life.Now that the world sees Ukraine invaded by an infinitely larger country led by a man preaching self-defense while ordering indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets - most notably children - NIGHT OF THE HUNTER serves as a reminder of the wonderful world that we could have and how we all need to stand together to protect it, and above all the future of our children as a Third World War looms large on the horizon.",

Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is a fake preacher who has just been arrested for car theft. While in prison he meets killer Ben Harper (Peter Graves) who mumbles in his sleep information about money that he stole in a robbery. When Harper is sentenced to death and Powell released, he sets out to find Harper's wife Willa Harper (Shelly Winters) and Harper's kids John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) determined to find the money. It's a great story and Mitchum does a great job playing Powell. He comes off as a fooling killer. The kind you would never expect to be a murderer. The film works also because of it's suspense element. It's overall a great movie so go check it out.",

The film remains a genuine American classic: thrilling, spooky, surreal, weirdly funny, and mesmerizing. It's like the darkest fairytale ever committed to the screen, and I call it a \"fairytale\" because it's mostly told from the children's P.O.V., and the story is stylized like a long-ago memory played out through a nightmare. It's a tragedy that Charles Laughton didn't direct another film, but he directed this one and that's more quality in one film than most directors can hope to come near in an entire career. And, by the way, Robert Mitchum gives one of the best performances you'll ever see in this film. Don't miss this one. By the way, ignore the bloke who says to \"rent Cape Fear instead\".

            "review_title": "Original and fascinating",
            "content": "\"Night of the Hunter\" is like no other film of its time.  The visual style, which includes great use of shadows, unusual camera angles (including aerial shots, not nearly as common then as today), stunning shot compositions, and more visual symbolism than you can shake a stick at, shows the influence of German \"expressionist\" directors such as Murnau and Lang.  The script handles some fairly daring themes for 1950's Hollywood, including repressed sexuality finding expression in murderous impulses; the misuse of religion; and, most especially, the danger of failing to look past what a person stands for and at what that person really is.  Finally, some of the acting and characterizations are brilliant.  Robert Mitchum's psychopathic phony preacher is a movie villain for the ages, and Lillian Gish's character provides the perfect counterbalance; unpretentious and nurturing vs. affected and using.There are a few flaws in the film, some of which might be attributed to director Charles Laughton's lack of experience (this would be the only film he directed), some of which probably come from his difficulty directing the principle child actors (whom he allegedly detested), some of which might have been due to budget problems.  The film's structure is oddly asymmetrical; while the first part acquaints us with all the characters (some of them rather two-dimensional, but at least we get to know them fairly well), in the second part we learn very little about any of the characters except for Lillian Gish's.  (Could this part of the film have been foreshortened because it would have meant doing more scenes with the children?)Not all the acting is as good as it could be; Shelly Winters's abilities are clearly taxed, and Laughton's inability to direct the kids hampers their performances.  While Billy Chapin has some brilliant moments, he comes across as self-conscious a lot of the time (some of that, however, might be due to the character's need to put on a front), and about the only times I feel sympathy for Sally Jane Bruce are when her character is in immediate danger.  It's hard to think of any Hollywood directors in the 1950's who could have done that much better with them, however; about the only ones who come to my mind are foreigners such as Satyajit Ray\u00a0and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, both great directors of children and original visual stylists.Speaking of which, the best visuals in this movie make its lapses all the more blatant.  It's just too obvious, for example, that some of the \"outdoor\" sequences were actually shot in a studio, especially after all the gorgeous aerial photography at the beginning.  Laughton also handles some sequences rather perfunctorily, as if to get them out of the way because they're required by the plot; the best example here being (mild spoiler warning) the one where the kids get away from Mitchum in the skiff.  At times it looks like Mitchum is close enough to at least reach the boat, at others it either appears that he's not really trying or that two different sequences have been edited together; either way it's not very convincing.Despite its flaws, \"The Night of the Hunter\" is well worth seeing. Personally, I'd rather watch a flawed-but-original work than a well-crafted non-entity any day.  If I've spent more time discussing \"Hunter\"'s flaws than its brilliances, it's only because the latter have been written about countless times, while the flaws have rarely been analyzed seriously at all. Again, the brilliances far outweigh the flaws here; if you have any doubts, go see it.",

And the movie itself? As someone mentioned at an earlier date on this board, it is very uneven. The first half and second half seem only awkwardly linked. Yet, the entire production is worth watching although it's a bit slow in parts, and doesn't maintain the tempo of a good thriller.

            "content": "Though I admittedly haven't seen a great number of films from the 1950's, this one just took the crown as my favorite. The only other one that really comes close to this for me is Vertigo. I don't often delve into movies older than the 60's. I've got to thank Mike Patton and the boys for covering the theme song on the wonderful Fantomas album, The Director's Cut. Because of this, I recognized the title, and made the decision to give it a shot, and I'm very happy that I did.This movie has just the right combination of everything and it's paced and structured immaculately. It's quite a bit darker than almost every other movie I've seen from the 50's. I didn't even take a moment to process the synopsis before starting it and I'm honestly glad I didn't because every little happening was a surprise for me, even through the film's first act. The movie has an extremely entertaining blend of dynamic characters, tasteful cinematography, and consistent plot progressions that cause the movie to feel like it never stops transforming as it goes. Just about every single member of the cast stands out as memorable, but of course it's Robert Mitchum as the preacher who steals the show with his very methodical and complex performance. The children are believable and endearing, as are most of the uncertain old folks (like...Icey Spoon?!) There are some images in this film very worthy of framing and hanging on your wall. The old school sets, which the movie was shot on entirely, gives it it's own kind of magic as well.Many consider this a pre-horror movie and I wouldn't argue with that. Though it feels more like a classic film with elements of noir, there were moments where I found myself thinking about The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (LOL). This is a very special movie. I laughed, I got teary eyed, I was surprised again and again, but most importantly, I recognized the pure artistry of it and loved it more and more as each scene passed.

            "content": "I have read somewhere, sometime that Robert Mitchum never considered himself an actor. If you check Roger Ebert (rogerebert.com) he interviewed him many times. In one Mitchum tells Ebert about acting; \"One of the greatest movie stars was Rin Tin Tin. What the hell. It can't be too much of a trick.\" In these and other snippets about him you might find there is always the self-deprecating delivery, along with smart Alec answers to many questions. But I think many of us would argue Mitchum was one of the best actors of his generation. One measure of acting abilities is the willingness to stretch out into roles others would shun. I say this by way of introduction to my thoughts on a very good movie, \"The Night Of The Hunter\".The film is shot in black and white, which lends much to its tone. The score is pitch perfect, and this is one of the few movies in which Mitchum sings. I have never known exactly where Laughton shot it, but I would love to see how they did the river scenes when the children have escaped. Much is made of the fact that this was Charles Laughton's only foray into directing. Whatever the reason for his failure to repeat the experiment, this is a wonderful movie to have as a signature. It is unique; try and find another like it. The movie begins with a father (Peter Graves as Ben Harper), on the lam from the police, entrusting the cash he has stolen to the care of his children. He makes them promise to not reveal where the money is hidden. He is arrested and, we see quickly convicted and sentenced to hang. But during his incarceration he reveals unintentionally to Robert Mitchum (Harry Powell) a hint that his children might know the whereabouts of the money.We skip ahead; Harry is now out of prison and makes a beeline to the town where his ex-cell mate hailed from \u2013 a town along the river in West Virginia. Incredibly, through his smarmy talk and sermonizing, he weds the widow of Ben Harper. He is seriously intent on gathering information about the money. After relentless pressure from Powell, the children at one point escape from him, commandeer a small boat and float away down the river. But Powell is never far behind and trails them for weeks. He\u0085wants\u0085that\u0085money.One of the strangers that befriends the children on their adventure is Lillian Gish (as Rachel Cooper). Her role turns out to be quite important, and it has always been difficult to envision a better choice for her part. How this all turns out I leave you to enjoy. Suffice it to say you will be left thinking about what you saw. Which is a sure sign of a good movie. In the same interview noted above, Mitchum shares that working with Charles Laughton was, essentially, a joy. \"Honest to God, you know, you did your really best to try to enchant him and of course it was effective.\" Effective it was \u2013 I will never forget, have not forgotten since I first heard and saw it many years ago, the haunting, chilling scene of him singing and trailing the children along the river.",

The acting is excellent; even the two children (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) are very good. The plot is nicely constructed and exciting to the last minute; it has some moments of suspense that are really outstanding, especially when Mitchum goes after the children. I also liked the black and white cinematography; some scenes (for example the one where Chapin, hiding in a barn, watches Mitchum riding past) are simply beautiful. On the downside, there is the music which I found intrusive. It tries much too hard to underline the points the story is making. I also disliked the heavy-handed symbolism of some scenes: the 'spider web', evidently tied by some poor assistant on the set (a spider would have produced something better), behind which the boat is drifting, or the barn owl catching the bunny. And while I was happy to see Lillian Gish in a talking role (so far I had seen her in silent films only), her moralising monologue about what children have to put up with adds literally nothing useful to this picture. That is not to say her acting is not good (it is very good); this is just a detail that together with the other things I mentioned drags down what would otherwise have been a first class film.

            "content": "Charles Laughton's incredible achievement in the one and only film he ever directed, Night of the Hunter, could not have been completed without an excellent crew of actors and a profoundly talented writer. Here's some background that may help you appreciate this astounding black and white film; the writer, James Agee, a young, wildly alcoholic talent on the verge of his own death, wrote the screenplay with the concept of depicting a child's nightmare, a dream, where the monster is inescapable, seemingly appearing again and again out of no where. No place to run, no place to hide. Yet the river, the current of life, without human manipulation, carries them away to safety and the warmth of what can only be described as a child's interpretation of a rescuing goodness, and its ability to ward off the intruding evil that still pursues the dreamer. One of the most haunting images in all of film history is the extraordinary underwater shot when Birdie Steptoe's (James Gleason) hook and fishing line snag up on the windshield of Willa Harper's (Shelley Winters) sunken car, her throat cut by Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), her hair moving eerily in the river's current as fish swim about. This scene alone is worth watching the film to see. And Shelly Winter's at her beautiful best is worth a glance, around the time of her relationship with poet Dylan Thomas.The ending is intentionally comical and absurd as Harry Powell becomes a cartoon-like image of someone shot in the butt. Its meant to be exactly how it looks, but if you haven't been appraised of, or determined for yourself the dreamlike perspective of the screen and what it is showing us, then many things would seem weak and out of sync. The photographic view offered the audience when we see the images with the children in the background, and the wildlife of the river in the foreground, isn't just a view of the kids moving down river from the distance of the shoreline; its the deliberately unobtrusive view from the eye level of the river's only real inhabitants; of rabbits, frogs and turtles. A remarkable achievement in film at the time of its release, and very attributable to Laughton and his ingenious direction. The Christmas pablum ending was deliberate and meant to have a fairy tale quality, also, to fill our minds with Tiny Tim mistiness and blessings for all of us, each and every one, one and all. It couldn't have been done any better; the childhood viewpoint never waivers. It's cookies and milk and the love of mom, with her unconditional and understanding trust and compassion -- even when it isn't really mom, but a wonderful substitute for Every Child to be comforted by in an otherwise lonely and hungry world filled with evil in waiting -- that is the 12 year old dreamer's imagined finale. And it works. Lillian Gish is awesome as that wonderful adoptive mother-image, Rachel Cooper. The script by James Agee made this a written work of art and poetry on celluloid, and with Laughton's direction inspiring a fine cast, if this was a film anyone was confused or put-off by, they should please watch it again, keeping the analogy of the childhood nightmare in mind, because that is what it is, and what fuels the plot line. It is thought of by most who have seen it as a top of the list classic.",

Ben Harper shared a cell with Harry Powell, who discovered that Harper had stolen ten thousand dollars that had never been found. After Ben Harper's execution, Harry Powell travels to comfort the family Ben left behind.It did not take much effort to convince Willa Harper that she should marry the preacher in order to provide a father for her two young children. John Harper (Billy Chapin) is the only person in town who does not trust the stranger. Before his father was taken away, John promised him that he would always watch over his younger sister, Pearl, and would never tell anyone where the money was hidden. Willa seems to be under a spell, she has changed from a pretty young woman into a frumpy religious fanatic.A significant amount of the film is seen from an aerial perspective. The animal imagery enforces the theme of defenseless creatures being hunted. The film deals with some fascinating themes like the strength of a single woman and the resiliency of children. As a director, Charles Laughton was heavily influenced by silent films and mimicked their style. The film was not well received initially, consequently Laughton vowed he would never direct another film. However, in The Night of the Hunter, Laughton used the typical elements that make a film eerie: black and white cinematography, children, repetitive singing, and religious ideas. Robert Mitchum ingeniously portrays the psychopathic preacher. Billy Chapin is heartbreaking as the orphan who has to find a way to save his sister.

And I say to that, poppycock. It had only meant fewer roles in front of the camera for one of the very best who ever acted and THAT would've been the real crime. Besides, this C/D is not the exemplar that new media would have you believe (2/4). Like Mitchum's other trop-noir, Cape Fear (62), a movie can be too dark and then bitter on the mental palate (the underwater camera-shot is horrible), a sad state where simple revenge is a poor pick-me-up, and yet, this movie probably impetus for fierce films to follow like Al's Psycho (60), The-Birds (63), Steve's Jaws (75) and The-Lost-World (child fatally swarmed by beasts in opening) (97), all crossing the line, though, all but the last with redeeming values in humor and / or charm. As director Bacon said about Hollywood, 'one must first make a film that people want to watch (9.8.19).'",

Most viewers who were raised on a generation of Television pap will find this film slow, but then, life seldom occurs in thirty minute segments plus laugh track. 3. Laughton never directed another finished film but he did very fine work directing for the stage; notably Don Juan in Hell,John Brown's Body, and The Caine Mutiny Court Martial. This film has some elements of German Expressionism as well as a dream like quality, especially the river sequence. In his biography Mitchem says that Laughton did not like Agee's screenplay (he thought it was a mess) so he rewrote it himself. He let Agee get the screen credit, probably to avoid legal hassles.

This movie takes horror much farther. Robert Mitchumm plays the twisted preacher greatly. Taking the concept of the man most trusted and turning it on its head is bold and abrasive. It is also very risky when adding children to the horror movie mix but this film succeeds. Although there is a lack of subtlety that is needed for a movie of this type. Some imagery became a bit too forced and looked cheesy. Styalyzing a horror movie is necessary but it shouldn't go good far or it will break the viewers immersion.",

This happened mostly in West Virginia but also the neighboring states.Some criticize the film for being \"old fashioned.\" Yes, and that's both deliberate and good. Laughton used techniques from German expressionists of the silent era. Laughton's sole film as director was a big influence on later directors Fassbinder, Altman, and Scorsese.The film did poorly when it opened because the studio didn't know how to promote it and didn't even try. Its rep grew from TV showings and art houses.And of course the same religious intolerance that gace some of the 1 star reviews also played a role in its initial failure. Sad that such attitudes still exist.",

            "review_title": "AMERICAN GOTHIC",
            "content": "Two unlikely but unique talents merged in 1954 to create one of the most bizarrely beautiful American motion pictures ever made. The great British stage and screen actor Charles Laughton and the American movie star Robert Mitchum collaborated on a  film project that  had the less than halfhearted  backing of its producing company, United Artists. Under the gun to  finish filming in a record amount of time, first-time film director Laughton ended each day's shooting with  meticulous talks with his cast to prepare them for the next day's work. Mitchum took on the task of  directing the young children who acted with him in the movie. The screenplay, based on Davis Grubbs'  strange gothic novel , THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, was  credited to the acclaimed author and film critic James Agee, but Laughton, unhappy with Agee's overall treatment, reworked the script, lifting original passages from the book for dialogue and  descriptive sections as the basis for the film's physical  look.  A  Depression Era  tale  of  an itinerant, psychopathic preacher who terrorizes a young  widow and her two children in search of  her late husband's money,  the movie that Laughton completed and released in early 1955 went  virtually unnoticed.  Although the recipient of some respectable reviews, the critics and the public turned a cold shoulder to the film ; Laughton's work  didn't look like any other movie released in 1955; containing themes of  serial killing, child abuse and  a pervasive eroticism  hiding  under the guise  of  a fanatical, repressed sexuality , THE  NIGHT OF THE  HUNTER  offered  pretty  heady fare  for  Eisenhower  era  audiences ,  and only  the more informed and  avid film buffs  showed  up  at the box office. Photographed  in  stunning black and white by veteran cameraman Stanley  Cortez  ( the filmic eye behind  Orson Welles' THE  MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS ) , the production design of this film is an extraordinary mix of  perfectly composed  outdoor landscapes ,  looming helicopter views of the Ohio River Valley, and  Grant Wood -like weathered  small town structures that evoke Depression Era  hard times :  coupled with this  are the awe-inspiring  nightime sequences , perhaps the most beautiful ever filmed and all the more remarkable because they are studio shots. In the film's most poetic passage , a small boat carrying two children , in flight from the manaical minister, drifts at dusk down the Ohio River, backlit by a silvery silhouette of  trees; as the journey continues, the sky turns totally dark and stars shine down like diamonds on the two frightened children ; along the river banks at certain intervals are sudden , grotesque close-ups : here a frog, there a couple of rabbits, overhead on a tree limb, a huge spider web. When the little boat lights at river's edge behind  a square country house and tall, ominous barn, both  black in sharp relief  to the pearl-gray  sky, the art of black and white cinematography seems to reach its zenith. Much of the credit for this goes to Laughton, who studied  countless reels of  pioneer director D.W. Griffith's short  films to acheive the intricately textured look he wanted for his movie. Adding immeasurably  to the visual poetry is composer Walter Schumann's eclectic score, sometimes brazingly bombastic when announcing the crazed preacher's appearance, other times an eerily  soothing  backdrop during  the boat journey and  disturbingly alluring  when accompannying a shot of  a body  swaying listlessly  on  the river bottom.  Laughton's artistic triumph must be shared with a gifted cast, and here equal weight  goes to Robert Mitchum, who in Reverend Harry Powell creates one of the most  despicable villains ever created for the movies.  An actor who made his name in the 40's with a  Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1945's THE  STORY OF G.I. JOE and went on to become  famous in film noir melodramas such as OUT OF THE  PAST,  Mitchum possessed an irresistible combination of  street smart savvy, rugged, unconventional good looks and a bad boy image that translated into magic box office appeal.  A powerful  screen presence, Mitchum often looked as though he was merely going through the ropes during filming but the performance  that ended up on the screen was  almost always riveting.  In the Laughton film he was in danger of going way over the top, but  he somehow found the magic ingredient to make the performance work ; by turns  horrifying , brutal and comically pathetic, Mitchum created an indelible scoundrel. His performance would not be complete, however, were it not  for  12 year old  Billy Chapin, whose portrayal of  John Harper, the young  boy who tries desperately to keep the preacher  from harming his mother and little sister and stealing his dead father's money, is  one of  the greatest child performances of all time. From his first meeting with his future stepfather , his own father barely cold in his grave, the  little boy  is a stoic rock,  distrustful of  the bible quoting reverend who shamelessly  fawns over  John's mother and sister.The other invaluable acting contribution to this amazing film comes from Lillian Gish , who plays the  saintly Miss Rachel, the woman who takes the two little river refugees into her house and keeps them from harm. Gish , then a living legacy to the history of film , gives an astonishing performance. Here  was an actress who started working in the nascent  film industry in the early  19th century ,  acted in some of the greatest silent film classics ( many under the hand of D.W. Griffith ) , graduated successfully to sound pictures, became an acclaimed stage and television actress, and here  delivers a  deeply moving , often subtle performance ( when not wielding her rifle and holding fort against  the frightening Mr. Mitchum!).  Her final scenes with young John are indescribably touching.  THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is an odd, quirky little gem of a film that may not be to everyone's liking ;  it wasn't in 1955 and it probably isn't  now.  Unfortunately it was the only movie Charles Laughton ever directed. Deeply disappointed by its lukewarm , even hostile critical  and public reception ,  he never made another movie.  But he did make this one, and  if  the viewer decides to take that boat  journey  up the moonlit  Ohio River , I guarantee  you one of  the great cinematic rides of your life.",

            "review_title": "Say hello to Mr. Dimple, he's after your children",
            "content": "It's a strange and fascinating movie. Sort of an allegory, I guess. A nightmarish fable. The opening credits have an eerie song; music and singing ends up playing a role in the way the film presents its mood (the \"hing hang hung\" song, in particular, is eerily freakish). Robert Mitchum and Lilian Gish singing a duet while engaged in the final battle of good vs. evil, is one of the most memorable moments in the film, which has many.The acting here is all fine within the confines of the film, but some people have found its oddness off-putting and wrongly characterized it as bad acting. It isn't. The only acting that's badly severely stiff is of the father, played by Peter Graves, but he's in the film for all of ten minutes, luckily.Mitchum has a menacing presence -- a real smoothie -- and his chin is the best in the business (doesn't he look oh-so-malicious with that hat?) He's ridiculously charming and I can't think of any modern-day actor who would fare well playing the same role. The two children, the boy especially, give fine performances and I can't believe anyone would call it \"atrocious,\" as someone on this site did.Laughton builds the tension up to an almost unbearable degree at about half-way through the film and it takes a while for us to get settled back into the calmness of the overly-symbolic river part of the story. The boat ride is like a mystical fairy tale; a serene daydream that would work as the polar opposite to the boat trip (and I do mean trip) Willy Wonka takes his little ones on in that movie.There are interesting angles and stark imagery throughout the film (the greatest being that underwater shot); fancy camera tricks that aren't too flamboyant, but quirky, and with those almost gothic sets, the film's look is very distinctive.There are a few moments that are almost slapstick, but they're self-contained and, amazingly enough, don't detract at all from the other styles and genres the film works in simultaneously. When Mitchum runs up the stairs after the children he looks like Jim Carrey doing Frankenstein.This, for me, ranks with the greatest of all horror films, from \"Psycho,\" the original slasher flick, to \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" a masterpiece of unnerving backwoods freak horror to \"The Exorcist,\" the unparalleled standard for religious spookery (even though I don't like it that much). The film's modern companions would be \"Frailty\" and \"The Devil's Backbone.\"The film may seem to take a detour in the last third, but as it resolves itself in with its surrogate father vs. surrogate mother territory I gladly followed. The appearance of Lilian Gish is where the film really shows its heart and it doesn't venture too far into the maudlin. It's out to prove the power of woman and the strength of the child (just in case you missed it, it's repeated explicitly at the end and yeah, it's a grievous mistake).The shots of a curious owl, a rabbit and a frog might bother some people -- needlessly arty and heavy-handedly symbolic, they might say -- but to me, they gave the film a sort of enchanted feeling. A few times I sensed a weird parallel to \"The Wizard of Oz.\"I generally agree that one scene that strikes a notably false note is where Mitchum tries to catch the boat the children are on, but it's not a big deal. I was willing to forgive the flaws for the startlingly original moments elsewhere. Few movies are perfect and if you're going to take risks, as Laughton does here, you're bound to falter once or twice. (The mob scene was sort of weird, wasn't it? At first I thought they were after Lilian Gish for taking the kids in -- as if Mitchum had them under some sort of bizarre religious command.)Don't shoot me for saying so, but this would be a perfect movie to be remade for today's audience, as long as someone who could handle the material was hired. Guillermo del Toro on his better days could do it. But who could ever do now what Mitchum does here?For all its flaws (they're more apparent afterward), the film is a masterwork.****",

If you think she was adorable in the finished film, in the outtakes she was the star, no doubt about it!!! The audience adored her. At one point, Robert Mitchum (God rest his soul!) hesitated, forgetting his lines, and as she sat on his knee, she informed him \"You forgot your lines!!\" Mitchum, in a scene with Miss Lillian Gish, forgot his lines and said \"Oh, poon-tang!!\". Well, Miss Gish's reaction was priceless-she recoiled as though faced with a nest of cobras, as Mitchum hid his face in his hands!!! I have since found out that this is the only American film in which every scrap of film was saved, and I can see why. It was lovingly put together in order for this special event, and I feel privileged to have seen it!! My fervent hope is that someday these scenes will be available on DVD for all fans of this wonderful film to enjoy!!",

Harry is amazing, great southern way of speaking that isn't over the top, and the way he morphs from an evil stepfather to basically the Devil is interesting. We don't have a lot of extra information that isn't needed, for example we don't know a lot about the home they are in at the end, their neighbors, etc. It's really quite simple in how it tells the story, which I like. I think it does a great job of telling the story from the kid's point of view, so it doesn't deal so much with things that they wouldn't be affected by. It does deal with what it's like for families when the mother marries another man, who is abusive, which is an adult theme for sure, but one that the kids were able to understand more or less. The part where he tells the mother what sex is to him isn't really relating to the kids at all, more just to the mother, and it says a lot about his character. I did not like the acting of the boy. I think his character is clich\u00e9 (stubborn, loyal, smart but impulsive). I've just seem that kind of character and acting from children in movies too often.Some truly amazing looking scenes, such as the one underwater, or where Harry slowly rides across the horizon singing. Just his singing, and how his intentions relate to who he is, in different parts I think makes the overall feel of the movie really special.",

It's now recognised as a classic, and has been recently re-released in the UK, where I saw it at the Metro Cinema, Rupert Street. There is much to recommend this film, which is a shot as a bizarre mixture of children's fantasy, biblical allegory and cat and mouse thriller - a sort of Hitchcockian 'Wizard of Oz'. Shot in expressionistic, high grade, monochrome, the film makes a powerful impression; one of the most visually rich films of its age. Low key lighting and low angles predominate, interspersed with scenes of a more fantastical nature: The discovery of the murdered mother at the bottom of the lake, hair billowing in the current like sea-weed; the fairy tale imagery of the children's escape by boat under the stars, with a host of woodland creatures such as toads and rabbits framed in the foreground. We are whipped through the introductory scenes and straight into the heart of the story with considerable energy. Mitchum, as the renegade Preacher Harry Powell, creates an imposing presence, shot from a child's eye view and introduced in looming silhouette. The later scenes, as he tries to extract from the children where the $10,000 is hidden are full of incredible suspense, making great use of framing and the depth of screen in a way that is seldom used any more. It is during the final third where the film begins to fall apart. The claustrophobia of the early scenes with the children holed up in the house with their new surrogate father is lost as the film opens out, and the tone changes to that of mawkish sentimentality with the introduction of Shelley Long's character. The tension has all but disappeared by the time of the anti-climactic confrontation with Mitchum at the end. Whilst the film stands out amongst others of its era due to its mix of fantastical imagery and dark allegory, ultimately its never quite as good as the first half promises.",

We see quite a few shots which suggest that this is more something of a parable, but that is already conveyed by the prologue and epilogue, which invite the audience to consider this as a morality play.The fairy tale elements are all the more enhanced by almost surrealistic set pieces and rich symbolism, especially involving animals. There is also an eerie underwater sequence which, even nearly 70 years later as of this writing, is still surprisingly unsettling.This movie has been variously called a noir, fantasy and horror film, which suggests it is hard to categorize in the standard genres. I believe this indicates that it really belongs to its own category, what I would call \"Noir Fantasy Americana\".I can only think of two other movies which would fit this category, both of which are similarly hard to categorize within standard genres: THE REFLECTING SKIN (1990), and TIDELAND (2005). All three movies tell a story of dark happenings in an American countryside setting from a child's perspective. Also, all three tell their stories really well.The exquisite performance of Robert Mitchum, the imaginative direction by Charles Laughton (apparently his only credited work as a director), the fantastic set pieces and the dialogue, which conveys a bygone era in America that seems further in the past than it really is (just over 90 years as of this writing), all combine to make this an extraordinary film.The bookends do age the movie considerably, but it is still worthwhile to watch this classic.",

Most of all though, the movie's everlasting greatness is preserved by the sensational effort of Lillian Gish. Gish was making just her eighth sound movie, and first film in six years. She shines very brightly and is a true treasure in an otherwise dark film.",

The story is a joke and the overall narrative is so bad, it borders on being laughable. There are so many holes in this story, you could use it as a wind chime. When this movie was released in 1955, it was panned by the critics; just bad reviews. But, for whatever reason, it has gained in popularity and acceptance since then. Why? How? I have no idea. This movie should not even be in the top 1000, let alone top 100. Robert Mitchum's acting is comical. This must have been Shelly Winters first movie because she is a much, much better actor than what she put on the screen here. Same for Mitchum.",

            "content": "Certainly one of the most unusually frightening films ever conceived, this 1955 film was a box-office failure upon its release, it being quite ahead of its time. Many consider the role of the psychotic \"preacher\" Harry Powell, to be Mitchum's greatest performance. Although I do appreciate the film, there are certain aspects such as the too-phoney set where Ruby goes to \"find love\" which I find a bit distracting.  The symbolism for the most part is beautifully etched by Charles Laughton in his sole directorial effort: unfortunately, this film simply isn't deemed very frightening by today's standards: it's more of a work of art in its Germanic cinematography and over-the-top performances by such veterans as Evelyn Varden as Icey Spoon. I loved the performance of John's old uncle played by that great character actor James Gleason & I thought Lillian Gish was most effective as Rachel, the kindly woman who takes in wayward homeless children.  Shelley Winters is all right in her role, but hardly colorful.  Billy Chapin, who plays John does well, but I have some reservations about Pearl singing that song while on riverboat with John: too hokey.  The musical score by Walter Schumann is bizarrely haunting.",

The cinematography is visually stunning.  The use of black and white film only adds to the good/evil theme.  There are many images that are etched in my memory...the scene in the bedroom just after the preacher and widow are married seems almost to take place in a church.  The arched window, the shadow of the windowpane making a huge cross on the ceiling...pure genius. The scene where the children are asleep in the hayloft and the crescent moon rises and moves across the sky...so beautiful.   The children seem sometimes to be wise beyond their years, yet never lose their innocence.  You just have to watch this film knowing it is not meant to portray reality.  It is a vision, a dream, a nightmare, and I feel that is why the sets are so minimal.  I've watched this movie so many times, and each time I see something different.

            "content": "I've seen this film a few times now and it remains one of the most enjoyable and memorable films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.The film is about convict turned \"preacher\" name Harry Powers (Robert Mitchum) who marries widow Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) in order to find the $10,000 that her late husband Ben (Peter Graves) hid before he was convicted and hung for robbery and murder. Harry learned about the hidden money when he was a cell mate of Ben's. The only ones who know where Ben hid the money are his children, street-smart nine-year old John (Billy Chapin) and sweet four-year old Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce). The children swore to their father that they would never tell where the money is hidden but Harry will stop at nothing to force them to reveal this information. What evolves is a battle of wills and wit between Harry and young John.This movie can be divided into two parts: Part one focuses on Harry marrying Willa and trying to become a wonderful stepfather to the two children. He puts on an outward charm to the local towns people but is cruel to his meek and religiously repentant wife Willa and also to the children, especially John who sees through Harry and knows he is a shyster. Harry is relentless in his questioning about the whereabouts of the money with the children. Willa eventually realizes that the money is the real reason why Harry married her and she confronts him. It is after this revelation that we are now privy to the real depths of this man's evil. Part two of the film takes on the air of a dark fairy tale complete with tough, wise \"Mother Hen\" Rachel Cooper who reads stories from the bible and sings hymns. She finds John and Pearl who have arrived on a river boat. The children live with Ms. Cooper and her foster children. For a little while, the kids appear to live a normal life; although John remains a bit aloof in his new surroundings. The happy fairy tale is soon interrupted as Harry reemerges and the battle between good and evil are heightened to full effect.Mitchum's Harry Powers is one of the most evil characters on film. He is a psychopath serial killer with hints of Frankenstein and Jekyll and Hyde. He walks around with the words \"love\" tattooed on his right hand and \"hate\" tattooed on his left. His description of why he has these words tattooed on his hands is one of the many memorable scenes in this film. Every character in this film is rich and complex and superbly played, especially Mitchum's Harry, Chaplin's John, and Gish's Ms. Cooper. I'm always pointing out ways a remake might make a film better but in this case, I have nothing. In fact, any remake would surely be inferior to this version.",

            "content": "Charles Laughtons only attempt at direction is, at first glance, a straightforward tale of the battle between good and evil and the effect it has on the lives of two young children.Set in 1930's rural America, the story concerns religious maniac Harry Powell a preacher-cum-serial killer on the trail of $10,000 hidden by a former cellmate. The only people who know the whereabouts of the money are John and Pearl Harper the cellmates young children. After first marrying, then murdering their widowed mother Powell relentlessly pursues the children as they flee downriver, before finally meeting his match in Mrs. Cooper, a woman as equally religious as him, but one who has devoted her life to caring for children made homeless by the depression. Into this basic storyline Laughton weaves several distinct strands, using the performances of the actors and differing cinematic techniques. He attempts to show the opposite poles of religious belief. Powells God is violent and bitter, twisted to Powells own ends. Mrs. Coopers is loving and forgiving. Powell himself sums up this conflict, and shows how it will end, when his right hand 'LOVE' wrestles with his left hand 'HATE'.There are many examples in the picture of striking film technique. High aerial shots are used along with repeated close-ups. The flight downriver uses extreme depth of field to combine the children adrift in the boat with huge close-ups of animals on the riverbank. Effective use is made of light and shadow. This echos the light and shade of the story. Despite containing many dark and even violent scenes the film is handled with humour and a lightness of touch.As with most films it is the actors performances that most people remember. Here it is impossible to pick out a weak cast member. Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce as the two children are particularly good, staying just the right side of cuteness throughout, Pearls song as the boat drifts downriver is spine tingling in its simplicity. Lillian Gish as the eccentric Mrs. Cooper is excellent, but it is Robert Mitchum as the charming, dangerous and truly sinister preacher Harry Powell who steals the picture. It is unlikely that he ever gave a much better performance than this one.In the end this is a story about the strength and endurance of young children, a phrase that is repeated several times in the film. Despite all the troubles that beset them and despite being let down by almost all the adults who are supposed to be looking out for them these two young innocents endure and survive.All of these different strands combine to make a whole that is both strange and compelling. A one off, and a true classic",

The treatment of spirituality is quite subtle - true religion is not simply the religion of the Church, as shown by the hypocritical townspeople whose allegiances change with the wind.

            "review_title": "Highly entertaining and accessible, but with considerable thematic depth",
            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is a great example of a film that convincingly accomplishes that difficult balance between accessibility and substance. This is a wonderfully entertaining movie that is exceedingly well-paced, but is also a film with considerable thematic depth that urges you think as much as it makes you reach for that next handful of popcorn.One of the things I really enjoyed about this movie is the very unique tone. The film is a mixture of so many different styles and moods: family melodrama, thriller, Gothic horror, fairy-tale, surrealism and whimsy. Somehow all of these disparate elements come together in a surprisingly effective manner without ever feeling disjointed. The uniqueness of the film on this front alone makes it worth the watch.This is also a fantastic film visually, with the lighting in particular being absolutely superb. This is definitely one of those movies that feels like it couldn't be anything other than black and white. The lighting is frequently harsh, angular, and jagged with bright whites and deep blacks intermingling. This makes for the perfect visual depiction of the themes of good and evil and their intermingled nature within all of us. The cinematography is also phenomenal with many instances of memorable and haunting imagery, particularly an extended shot at the bottom of a lake which is truly unsettling and chilling. So yes, on a technical level this movie is excellent. But beyond that it's also an interesting and thought-provoking tale with plenty of substance. Harry Powell is a fantastically memorable villain and the perfect embodiment of the themes here. He's a walking contradiction - a pastor and a self-proclaimed man of God who is a self-interested opportunist and cold-blooded murderer seemingly lacking in any sense of morality. One of the things that makes him such an effective character is you never really fully understand what's going on in his mind. Is he mentally ill and having auditory hallucinations which he interprets as God commanding him to commit these acts? There is certainly a suggestion of that given his frank, out-loud conversations with God even when there is no one else around and he does give off the impression that he is speaking with someone who he actually hears. Or is he just a very intelligent criminal who has donned the guise of pastor in order to project a holy image that disarms people and makes them feel he is trustworthy? There is plenty of evidence for this as well, as he cunningly manipulates John and Pearl's mother and other folks around town. The other characters in the film aren't quite as larger-than-life, but they too have nuance worthy of consideration. Especially interesting is the way that the adult characters in the film contrast with the children. Nearly every adult in the film is significantly flawed and represents that \"duality of man\" theme. John's \"uncle\" seems like a nice guy that has taken a liking to John as a sort-of mentor but is an alcoholic who fails to help when John and his sister are in danger. John's mother cares for him and Pearl, but selfishly marries Powell due to her attraction for him without considering what is really best for them. John's father murders two people to rob a bank, but does so for righteous reasons to help homeless and starving children (an action which, interestingly, ends up setting in the motion the events which eventually put his own two children on the street and homeless). Each of the adult characters also seems to be blinded by Powell's superficial charm and are unable to see the malicious intent that is right in front of their faces. The children however, particularly John, are shown in a very different light. John immediately dislikes Powell and sees right through him from the start. He also has a strong moral compass, as he keeps his father's secret and protects his sister who is too young yet to understand what is really going on with Powell. John is seemingly at that magic age of idealism where he has a clear sense of right and wrong. He is old enough to be attuned to his surroundings and the intentions of others, but he hasn't grown up enough to be corrupted by the evil in the world. Luckily, John and Pearl end up in the hands of Rachel Cooper, a grandmotherly figure who becomes their guardian. She really is the beacon of light among the adult characters in the film. She's definitely strict, but extremely strong- willed and protective of her foster kids. She seems to recognize the extreme value of children at John's idealistic age and the importance of a nurturing parent who can develop those characteristics into adulthood. Interestingly, she is also a religious women and acts as a direct foil to Powell's character. Although the film definitely implicates the corrupting power of religion and how many use it to justify their own perverse actions, Cooper's character is the other side of that coin. She has incorporated religion into her life and uses it as a motivation to take in foster children and care for them in their time of need. In light of this, the condemnation of religion that might seem obvious at the beginning of the film shifts into more ambiguous territory which is to the film's advantage. All in all, The Night of the Hunter is one of those films that mixes high and low art to fantastic effect. It's well-paced, twisty, entertaining and accessible, but also offers plenty of substance, symbolism and thematic heft for the more discerning viewer. This is definitely a movie worth rewatching many times and I anticipate it will only grow on me.",

            "content": "The fact that Charles Laughton never directed another picture but this one is a true shame. In fact, I'd call it one of the biggest shames in all of Hollywood. My favorite directors are determined by whether they directed films that are both visually stunning and tell a story that engulfs the viewer. And it's also very important that they directed more good films than bad ones. The fact that 'Night of the Hunter' is Laughton's entire embodiment of work as a director, I have to say he's one of my favorites. I have never seen a film more visually stunning. There aren't too many movies out there... I can't think of one actually, where a real story about real characters that could exist in our world takes place in a world that looks like something out of a fairy tale. Fairy tale this is not though, as it's a serious tale of a rampaging false prophet. He's after two children who know where a large sum of money is. I love this dark story and the haunting look of the film that goes along so brilliantly with it. Practically the entire film is obviously filmed on sets. The set designs are nothing short of pure genius. The lighting and the slightly off kilter structure of buildings... beautiful. Call me twisted, but I've always found stories where children are in peril to be some of my favorites. I suppose when we were all young, we wondered what we'd do in those kind of situations, fortunately not many of us have to go through what a lot these kids do in certain horror movies. And it's always been a heart pounding experience to watch a horror film where the main star is a child. That's why I feel only the first two Child's Play films really worked best and after that they became less interesting. I can't recommend 'Night of the Hunter' enough.

Often\nclassified as Film Noir\ufeff, it shows us what is really terrifying in this\nlife while making sure the audience leaves the theater well grounded Demonstrating real charisma and a credible singing voice, Robert\nMitchum\ufeff is devastatingly good as the serial-killing preacher, Harry\nPowell. (The character is loosely-based on real-life serial killer\nHarry Powers, executed in 1932.) After being arrested for auto theft,\nthe switch-blade wielding Powell shares his cell with Ben Harper (Peter\nGraves), who is shortly going to be hanged for killing two people\nduring a bank robbery. Prior to being arrested, Harper hid the loot\nfrom the robbery, entrusting his two children, John (Billy Chapin) and\nPearl (Sally Jane Bruce) with the secret of its location. As soon as he\nis released from prison, treasure-seeking Harry Powell pursues the\njust-widowed Willa (Shelly Winters). Young John, tasked by his (late)\nfather to look after his younger sister and keep the secret, is the\nonly one suspicious of the charismatic preacher. With the encouragement\nof one of her employers, Willa marries him. Eventually, John must\ncontend with a much larger adult who wants to kill him (and Pearl).\nJohn's dilemma is still horrifying today. As a conniving preacher, Mitchum's uncanny charm and ability to\nimmediately win over unsophisticated rural people works on many levels.\n(His knuckle-bearing demonstration of how Love conquers Hate speaks\nabout the power of organized religion.) However, Powell's misogyny and\nrighteous celibacy make for extremely creepy moments. To counteract all\nof Powell's raging hate, the screenwriters (James Agee and Charles\nLaughton) introduce an essential character towards the end of the film\n(representing Love), aging matriarch Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). She\nis a philanthropist and feminist hero who rescues and rears homeless\nchildren. She also is quite capable of using a shotgun to protect her\nflock. She is the first adult who sees through Harry Powell and can\nstand up to him.It is curious how Laughton, a renowned thespian in his own right,\napparently wanted his actors and the story to reach the limits of\nbelievability. There are monologues early and late. There are Mitchum's\nexaggerated physical gestures when chasing after the children in the\ncellar. (Somehow, Powell can never get his adult frame to move faster\nthan a fleeing child's.) Shelly Winters also portrays the partially mad\nwidow very woodenly in places. While Billy Chapin as John Harper is\nconvincing overall, another reviewer points out that he always delays\nreacting to every new piece of dialogue in a way that belies his\ncharacter's age. Rachel Cooper is a challenging role for Lilian Gish\nbecause of how corny Rachel's lines can be. There is a fairy-tale side\nof \"Night of the Hunter\" that modern audiences, used to fantastic\nhorrors appearing in the daily nightmare (i.e., news), may find a bit\nunnecessary.This is the only film that Charles Laughton ever directed. He uses\nshadows impressively, and his style recalls German Expressionism from\nthe 1920s. I really like the two scenes with Peter Graves; they are\nboth very memorable. There are also several images which rank among the\nbest in movie history. The dead person in the lake is unforgettable.\nAnd, the sight of Harry Powell in silhouette at night time as he croons\na children's hymnal while riding a horse is superb.Cinephiles who want to experience 1950s era Americana and a really\nhorrifying story should saddle up their horse and head over to revival\ntheater showing this.\"Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world, Ends up making\npayments on a sofa or a girl.

This guy believes God is on his side and therefore has no conscience whatsoever making him far more credible than the villains of most movies today.The script is great. Had this movie been done today I'm sure it would be changed to make it more politically correct and in the process making it predictable and the characters stereotypes. For instance it had been a lot more convenient to make the children's father either pure good or pure evil. Or the mother a gold digger or alcoholic to justify her actions and role in the story. Surely we would also have some (more) gunfights.Instead this movie is simply believable because it tells a good story, stays to the point and justifies the characters actions. Not including Mitchum the rest of the characters is like most people. We mean well and all have flaws.Night of the Hunter is certainly a down to earth movie not romanticising any subject.

His singing of the Gospel song \"Leaning...\" was very chilling throughout the film.Lillian Gish's performance was also Oscar worthy in a supporting role. The script was equally superb! I cannot think of anything negative about this movie. I highly recommend it.",

The plot - enticing and suspenseful. The passage of time has done nothing to even remotely diminish the effectiveness of this intriguing story. In fact, it has enhanced it, which brings me to...The Cinematography - done in the contrasting film noir style, it gives the kind of visual suspense only seen in films of that time period. Gorgeous. Several images that particularly stand out to me, that will stay with me forever include- a) the very first sillouette of his trademark hat on the wall of the children's bedroom; b) the shot immediately following, of Harry Powell down by the lamppost, singing that hymn; and c) the sillouette of Harry riding the horse across the horizon, singing the hymn. The very thought of it sends chills down my spine. And I can't hear that hymn in the same way anymore (\"Leaning on The Everlasting Arms\"). The actors - Robert Mitchum! Need I say more? Shelly Winters in a role that she does so well, a nervous fanatical woman - but it works so well. And Lillian Gish - with a gun no less...a far cry from her role in Birth of a Nation that's for sure. haha, but honestly, I believe that everyone should see this movie and once you do, recommend it and show it to your friends.

Yes, Mitchum is great as the murderous preacher, in a performance very similar his portrayal of the psychopath in the original version of Cape Fear, but Mitchum is the only great thing about this film. There are some interesting shots, foremost being the scenes of Shelly Winters' corpse at the bottom of a lake. The pacing is weak, and the film, although only 90 minutes long, drags, primarily during the children's voyage down the river. There also seems to be a lot of filler footage throughout the film to stretch it out. There are some risqu\u00e9 elements considering the date of the film, including some subtle references to the fact that Mitchum is a pedophile/child-killer (the dead girl's body at the beginning, Mitchum's refusal to sleep with Winters on their wedding night, and the amount of attention Mitchum directs towards Winters' young daughter) which adds a disturbing undertone to the film, but overall Mitchum's character doesn't get enough screen time.",

I won't mince words, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is the movie that made me an atheist because nearly every religious person I've encountered reminds me of Robert Mitchum's character, Harry Powell (others remind me of Piper Laurie's character in CARRIE).  Admittedly, some of the movie looks kind of dated today, but if you look at Mitchum's performance, you will see how much it has influenced a lot of the televangelists of today.  That Mitchum was denied an Oscar nomination and that Charles Laughton was never to direct again was truly a shame. I'd go so far as to say that Harry Powell is my choice for the Best (Worst?) Movie Villain of All-Time (narrowly beating out Margaret Hamilton's Miss Gulch/Wicked Witch of the West from THE WIZARD OF OZ).  The words LOVE and HATE probably never had a better representation than in this movie, especially in the scene where Harry explains why he has them tattooed on his fingers.  After seeing this, the 1991 TV movie with Richard Chamberlain pales greatly.",

            "content": "While he appeared in many films that are hailed as classics of cinema, acclaimed actor Charles Laughton would only helm the director's reins once during his lifetime. And unfortunately, his debut would ultimately be a failure, with the film bombing at the box office, and being derided by critics. He would take this rather personally, and he would never direct another film. Which is, quite frankly, rather disappointing, since he certainly made something incredible on his first (and only) attempt.The Night Of The Hunter is an incredible and breathtaking experience that features what some might say is some of the most brilliant filmmaking in cinematic history. The film contains many visuals effects and elements that are clearly inspired by German Expressionism, which Laughton worked hard to replicate, and managed to perfect. And in addition to that, the film also contains some incredible acting and masterful storytelling, and not to mention what I would probably say is one of the most haunting cinematic scores that one will ever hear.The film plays with preying on the unsuspecting. At the beginning, a man named arrested for robbery and murder. Before being arrested, he hides $10,000 dollars that he stole, and tells his two children, John and Pearl, to promise to not say where the money is hidden. Before he is executed, Ben shares a cell with a traveling preacher named Harry Powell, who was arrested for driving a stolen car. Although Ben tells Powell that he did steal $10,000, he doesn't say where he hid it. Unfortunately, Powell isn't really a preacher, he's actually a serial killer who marries widows and then murders them for their money, with him using the guise of \"God's work\" as a justification for such an action. It isn't long before he makes his way to the town where John and Pearl live, where he manages to marry their gullible mother as he tries to find out the mystery of the $10,000. All of this amounts to a suspenseful film that what not be inaccurate if one were to say that it it's borderline horror.Robert Mitchum stars in one of his most iconic roles, as the absolutely chilling Reverend Harry Powell, who uses the guise of religion to get what he wants. Mitchum is terrifying, but he is also very charismatic, to the point that he manages to manages to exploit the town's naivety to his advantage, to where they can't even sense the aura of death that surrounds him. Shelly Winters did a fine effort in her role as the unfortunate mother who is so determined to find happiness, that she fails to notice the danger approaching in her marriage to Harry. I must admit that I was very surprised at how incredible I found the performances of Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce, who play the two Harper children. Considering how child actors can either make or break a film, there was a potential for them to be either a hit or miss. Fortunately, they were astounding, and were perfect in their roles. And, there's Lillian Gish, who is incredible in her role as Rachel Cooper, a rather compassionate woman who looks after parentless children, and who, when push comes to shove, is capable of standing firm in the eye of danger.Charles Laughton directs this film with incredible expertise, in which he plays up the elements of expressionism. I previously mentioned that this film could be considered a borderline horror film, which in ways, it is, as the film is essentially the viewing of a nightmare, a child's nightmare to be exact, with the main characters representing specific elements. Pearl and John represent innocence, and Powell represents the bogeyman. How villainous is Harry Powell? He's someone who uses what resembles a god like power to get what he wants. Upon arriving in town, he manages to trick the gullible people who live there in order to move closer to his goals. This reverend isn't a good reverend at all, as he's not interested in saving any souls as he is in obtaining the $10,000 dollars that the two children's mother have. And what's very nightmarish, is how easily he manages to con the na\u00efve townsfolk, including the two children's mother. In terms of representation, Pearl and John represent innocence, and Powell represents their demons, while Rachel Cooper represents John and Pearl's savoir, their light in their darkest hour.As I also mentioned, the score by Walter Schumann is incredible, with it providing a sense of a dream atmosphere to the film. There's a sequence that involves John and Pearl floating down river after escaping from Powell, and that music that plays during that sequence is so incredible, that it can probably make one feel as if they're in a nightmare themselves.Ultimately, The Night Of The Hunter is an incredibly breathtaking experience that makes for an absolute cinematic classic. It's a disappointment that Charles Laughton's directorial effort wasn't appreciated back in 1955, because if were to say that he perfected something brilliant, that would be putting it lightly. With its haunting score and nightmarish story, and especially it's absolutely stunning cinematography, this film still holds up perfectly, and has rightfully earned what it failed to do upon its original release, earn a place among the classics of cinema.",

The Yuletide end makes clear what it really is: a Christmas tale in the English tradition, such as Dickens's tale of the same name or Stevenson's \"The Body Snatcher\" about Burke and Hare. The reader feels all the thrill and horror of the little children's predicament and prays for a redeeming end until it eventually arrives. No realism here, but a visually deep blood-chilling story set in a southern State and along a river (anybody remember Huckleberry Finn? the importance of escaping on a boat?) by an extremely talented Englishman who had read both English and American classics. There are cases when the junction of different cultures works miracles, as it did with Nabokov's Lolita (which actually is a declaration of love for the English language). Differently, but also on a very high artistic level, Laughton focuses on very American themes. Maybe not the way the US would like to be depicted - ah, but then Lolita is just as cruel to a certain self-representation of American society as The night of the Hunter. Bless Shelley Winters for acting the victim both in this film and in Kubrick's Lolita! Although Lilian Gish's transformation from Stoneman's daughter (The Birth of a Nation) into the saviour of children is the most evident tribute by Laughton to US filmmaking.",

One odd thing about this movie is that the villain, Harry Powell, is terrifying. There's no real reason to be terrified; there's little to no real violence in the movie, and Powell has no special powers, just a small knife. I could probably beat him up myself if I had to.

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is a film thriller of a preacher man who has found out, through his cell mate, about $10,000 hidden in his home. This is a story, if I heard about it or read it at a back of a DVD case or poster then I would be very interested to watch it and most likely love it but as I go through the film, I start to see flaws that brought the film down a bit.The film is based on a novel by Davis Grubb and written for the screen by James Agee. The Night of the Hunter is one of the few films that Agee has written for the screen. He has created a dark and haunting story of a man who go great lengths to attain the hidden money because the lord has told him so. I like characters like that, as what they are doing they is right. This is why I enjoyed A Clockwork Orange so much. My issue with the film's script is the third act and the parts leading up to it, which is after the barn scene. It did not have the fun and suspense that it did in the first half. The dialogue in this film are at times laughable because they seem almost ridiculous at times, not sure if intentionally or due to the actor's delivery of the line but it did disrupt the tone at times.The only film that Charles Laughton has directed, and a good one for a debut. What he has created here is, for the most part, fantastic. At least for an hour and ten, the film has great suspense but the last half almost changes it's tone which didn't really work for me. I felt that it would have worked much better if the film was dark and horrific throughout but Laughton somewhat brought the tone down a bit with making it feel a little accessible to children. If the film throughout kept the dark tone then I think this would have been an excellent film.This film feels very fast, the first hour in particular. I wished the film took it's time in fleshing out the characters and building up that tension. The boat and barn sequences are an example of the pace and tension that I wanted for the scenes preceding it. Laughton and Robert Goldem, the editor, should have slowed the film down and extended the running time a little bit more.Stanley Cortez was the director of photography for this film, and let me say that this man's work in this was fantastic. I never thought black and white films could be so beautiful. There is a noir-ish sense in his photography here and it does add to the tension and horror of this story. Mitchum was already frightening as the preacher but adding Cortez's photography on top of it makes it much more spectacular.Walter Schumann's score in The Night of the Hunter does give off that horror sound but I felt it was a bit melodramatic, mostly because on the moments it chooses to come on screen. There are times where the score does hit an impactive note for me and those times, the scenes felt really frightening. If Schumann lived longer, he might have become a much more acclaimed composer.Robert Mitchum as the preacher is fantastic. If the supporting cast was just as good as his acting here then my rating for this film would be much different. The most frightening moments coming from him is when he just sits there and watches you or sings a tune. He doesn't overdo his role and at the same time not being pale and simple. Mitchum gave personality to this man and in the end result, it payed off. Shelley Winters is a good actress but like Lolita, she did not have enough screen time to show off her abilities, but when she is on screen she gives off this vulnerability and sadness; making her performance very believable. The child actors in the other hand are so-so, at times they're good and at times they are just a little bit over the top. I was able to power through it and not cringe every time they open their mouths. Billy Chapin though was the better one out of the other child actors in this. Lillian Gish isn't introduced in the story until later on in the film, she was fine with her performance but with the third act being a tad bit dull in it's execution, I couldn't really appreciate her acting as much.If I watched this film when I was much younger and a little more innocent then this film would have been like a favorite of mine but since I grew up and my expectations and my perception of cinema has changed, then certain films like this one, may not be appreciated as much from me. Nevertheless, this film had some strong points but jest held back a bit by certain flaws. The film deserves to be watched alone for Mitchum's performance or Cortez's cinematography as both are powerful and horrific.",

Being as flawed as they are, they are still deadly.  (Possible Spoiler) The most haunting scene is of one of Mitchum's victims lying at the bottom of a river; her throat slit, the water and light playing on her bound form. She looks both peaceful and troubled. Much to my delight a local theater recently ran this and I got to see this scene on the big screen. If you ever get the opportunity to see this in a theater please don't miss the chance. I prefer black and white film to color, because I don't think anyone has mastered the use of color in film as of yet. I believe Welles mastered the use of black and white. Black and white film has a bare bones feel to it.  You're essentially stripping away the frills and revealing the true qualities and values that every object and living thing have.  It's quite lovely.  I loved the contrast of good and evil, although we get the feeling that perhaps the elderly woman is trying to make up for past mistakes with her own child by taking care of the lost souls that wonder up to her doorstep, although it's hard to imagine what she might have done to alienate her child so.

The script and delivery is exactly what one would expect in the exaggerated retelling by one of the children that lived through it.There are sequences that make you feel like you're in a dream. Notice the river scene. All those animals! Their presence would be significant to a child that would be aware of them, though they couldn't see them in the dark. The girl even begins to sing a song, the villain already forgotten. An adult would be planning and plotting.........not sleeping like the boy.I love the fact that it is set during the Depression. It really strengthens the hopelessness that overshadows the entire narrative. This ominous mood is not lifted until the very end of the film with the exchanging of gifts. The boy takes an apple, wraps it and gifts it to the lady. The apple already belonged to her, but she receives it as if he grew it himself. She gives him the watch, which represents \"time.\" This is all he ever wanted, but could not get. His father thought money was the answer to his children's woes, but they needed him to spend time with them. The mother thought that remarrying would repair what was broken and clean what was dirty, but the children really needed her attention! At the end he had found someone that would give them time. Time to enjoy what childhood that was left.It's really a message about how difficult life can be for kids.The lady in the water scene could be the most visually haunting film shot of the 1950s",

            "content": "A big surprise. Perhaps the best psychopath-serial-killer movie that I have seen so far. I have seen quite a few. If there ever was a creep on the silver screen, his name was 'Reverend' Harry Powell. No kidding. This black and white movie that not many know about (well, I didn't) is one of the scariest movies I have seen. But it is a beautiful movie at the same time. In fact, I would put it under the category of movies which can separate those who know what good movies are from those who don't. If you don't like this movie, you don't know what movies are about.Unlike many other great movies, it doesn't seem to be making any promises, but it fulfills a lot of promises anyway. That's why it can be a big surprise for those who have not heard that it is (now) considered to be a great movie, although it was such a failure when it was made that the director (otherwise actor, Laughton) never directed any other movie.I would say it is much more advanced than many other movies about psychopaths. It shows how it is society that makes and helps a psychopath. The word of the 'Reverend' Powell carries more weight than that of the children, even with their mother, let alone with the neighbours. This is what makes this movie more scary than the other psycho movies. How easy it is for the religious whore killer impudence slayer abomination hater bounty hunter preacher to con everyone. Well, almost everyone. For once I didn't mind the not so realist happy ending, because otherwise the movie would have been too scary to digest. This is not the kind of movie which needs gallons of blood and tons of gore to scare you. This is where you can have a poem and painting (with real music to boot) to scare the wits out of you. This is a horror movie that doesn't let you forget that the world is horrible enough without supernatural beings and it is not an odd individual alone that fills the world with horror.I can go on rambling about this movie, but I better stop lest I raise your expectations so high that even this movie fails to satisfy them. And to think that I haven't even talked about the technical aspects...",

Rather, it's an allegorical tale of good and evil (and also of naivete -- believe it or not it's the adults who are mostly naive and the children who listen to their instincts in this tale). The directing AND acting are brilliant. It dances on the cusp of the subconscious with a sophisticated touch, never going over the top. The use of light and dark, stage locations, shadows and sound are all handled deftly and again, the acting is brilliant. Lillian Gish, Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winters each handle their roles in unexpected ways (going against the grain of their standard fare). This film is a gem that is not to be missed, dismissed or oversimplified, and it's complexity and layers are to be savored. Sophisticated film lovers are in for a real treat.",

            "content": "First off, if you are watching this film because you loved the book, I am to understand it is a faithful and overall good adaptation and you should read no more of this review. Go ahead and watch the movie. I have not read the book, don't know/care about what's in it or how accurately it is brought to screen and will therefore only anger you seeing as how you will likely defend it. If you are a film buff and heard it was a classic, you have, as with most films, a 50% chance of liking it and will probably go ahead and watch it regardless of what I say. Have fun. If however, you read somewhere or thought, \"Preacher stalks children\u0085\" have I got news for you!I read that line in a magazine and rented it. I have since regretted it. That excerpt ended up sending me on a crash course for disappointment. From the first oddity of the screen to the last yawn, I was not glued to this film for the movie itself. I just kept hoping it was about to get better. Don't get me wrong, it seems to be a great film in retrospect\u0085if you go into it thinking of it as a Grimm fairy tale or a nursery rhyme. If you SERIOUSLY think of the character of Harry Powell as the big bad wolf, the kids as Hansel and Gretel and the old lady as the old woman in the shoe, you will probably be thrilled with the results. If you were expecting terror or true film noir\u0085you might want to try Fritz Lang's \"M\" about a demented child murderer or \"Cape Fear\" with Robert Mitchum. One is a great example of social realism, the other a wonderful piece of film noir.OK, I'll start by saying that the villain is a preacher named Harry Powell, played by Robert Mitchum. If you've seen \"Home Alone,\" \"The Villain\" or \"Wiley Coyote\" cartoons and thought they were funny\u0085tune in. If however, you are expecting realism, tune way out! Mitchum looks evil. He's got tattoos, a scowl, and he carries a switch blade. He's after loot and has a habit of turning himself into the most eligible bachelor in town. He is smooth talking, suave looking and walks with a swagger like Mr. Blond in \"Reservoir Dogs.\" He also has himself a habit of doing \"the lord's work.\" Anybody who remembers Maggot in \"The Dirty Dozen\" knows what I'm getting at.So he's a pretty cool sounding bad guy until he ends up taking pratfalls like Bruce Campbell. He quickly starts looking like a bumbling fool time after time. It makes me wonder how he even made it through the pain of getting his tattoos! I suppose having the villain be a weakling makes the viewer think that only cowards try to steal from/threaten children. Speaking of children, they're his arch rivals. That's right, the psycho is continuously thwarted by a couple of kids and when they're not the ones schooling him, it's a haggard old lady serving him. I was halfway expecting Dudley Du-Right to save the day and make him cry, \"Blast, foiled again!\"The children have the spontaneity of Jake Lloyd, except with less talking. They act wooden the entire time until they're unhappy whereupon they decide to act like crying buffoons. Their lines are often cheesy and their reactions quite unbelievable. And yet, somehow they end up being a match for the evil preacher! The most interesting aspect of the film is that halfway through the movie, the gears are switched. The movie goes from being about some psycho \"stalking\" kids, to being about family values. It pulls a \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" twist and you'll be left saying when did this movie become about the importance of family? Of course then you'll have someone chime in and say something stupid like, \"It was always about family\u0085if so and so would have paid more attention to so and so\u0085\"Many lines in this film are ridiculously hammy. Inspirational lines will leave a person trying not to laugh at the silly manner in which they are delivered. For instance, after the plot change, an old woman comes into the picture. In one scene, a rabbit is attacked by an owl. The old lady spouts the corny line, \"It's a hard world for little things.\" I was like, \"Wow, this could not get more melodramatic.\" The production values are there. It has its moments when you can appreciate the overall film. Good scenery and some decent lighting. For instance there is a scene that deals with an object under water and it's very good. I think if you go with the idea of it being a melodrama, the cast did a good job for the most part. If not, \"Oh, the humanity!\"I think that the concept was excellent, the execution, for what I was hoping for at least, was heavily flawed. I believe it to be an OK movie, but not quite as good as people are making it out to be. As a melodrama I'd give it an A for being so cheesy/over-the-top. As a family movie, I'd say an A for lessons learned: \"\u0085don't talk to strangers,\" etc., as an \"Army of Darkness\" \u0096 style comedy, a solid B. If you are expecting a film noir, a B at the most and if you were looking for horror look somewhere else! Overall I'd like to say, Laughton you fool! Sadly, I must admit if I would have watched it without having prior expectations, I'd probably have given it a yawning but stout *** out of *****. I would have found it boring but a well done melodrama, which is what I consider it to be. Bottom line: If you are enamored by its 'classic' status, just remember, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is a 'classic' too, though not for the same reasons\u0085or is it?",

A couple of the scenes were visually appealing and the cinematography was good, for instance the trip down the river and the lighting in the film were great, but this doesn't make up for its other shortcomings. To start things off, straight out of the gate the movie felt cheesy and unrealistic, from the children's floating heads among the stars to Powell's complete disclosure of his character within the first 30 seconds of us seeing him. The story was lackluster and went from flying at some points to crawling at others. The plot progressed more by the character's stupidity rather than the villain's actual efforts. Practically all of the characters were unrealistic and so gullible they fell very close to the point of complete ignorance and idiocy. A lot of people said this movie was chilling because it's more realistic than most horror films, and while most horror films are unrealistic, this is definitely not a good indicator of realism.",

Charles Laughton narrates with biblical force a story of good and evil, the story of the hunter, the flight of the two children and the story of their final salvation.

Evil never sleeps. And sometimes it may even come your way singing gospel hymns in a deep baritone.Sixty years later, I have a deeper appreciation of this film. The cinematography and lighting are beyond spectacular. This may be Hollywood's finest use of the German expressionism of the silent era. There is symbolism and metaphor throughout this masterpiece, giving it a dreamlike quality. Or, should I say, a nightmarish quality.Robert Mitchum's Harry Powell is simply perfect. To me, he is up there with Hannibal Lechter as the scariest movie villain ever.And Lillian Gish is the perfect foil.This masterpiece stands alone in many ways. It is a child's nightmare come to the screen. Having seen it as a child, it is still the stuff of my nightmares. And viewing it as an adult, I have gained a deeper appreciation of how Agee, Laughton, Curtis, Mitchum, Gish, and others crafted this story into a classic for all time.",

Yeah, nobody really does, but there were a slew of things that were a first that came after those pivotal steps that were most likely draining in varying respect and trying of every aspect of your persona; take most of these experiences and measure them up to having to make your major studio feature length directorial debut. Very few directors really genuinely get it right the first time; Lynch did with Eraserhead, Huston hit the nail on the head with his adaptation of Hammett's Maltese Falcon, and most notably Orson Welles did relatively well with what's now his best known, if, unfairly, his only really well known effort as director: Citizen Kane.Then there's this Laughton guy. An actor who decides to give directing an adaptation of a book by the same name a shot. In the studio system of 1955 Hollywood you had to have quite a pair of balls to willfully make a film about a psychopath who dresses as a preacher with no reservations about hunting down two children with the intention of murdering them to get to the decent chunk of change their recently deceased father left them as a safety net. Then there's the tattoos; HATE on the knuckles of one hand and LOVE on the other, he has no hesitation to divulge listeners to the epic struggle between the two base human emotions; but this is a man wholly without one and an ample amount of the other, how many other blatantly sociopath characters, dressed as preachers, can you name from an American film from the same time? What? None? Yeah, I didn't think so. Mitchum's portrayal of Harry Powell, one of the most despicable human beings in the history of cinema, is so pitch perfect that if you were to have seen him walking towards you on the street chances are you'dve run for your life or just jumped in front of a speeding car.The film, more or less, tanked on initial release; leading Laughton to proclaim his lifelong resignation from the director's chair: thanks general film going public and useless critics of 1955. Not only does the film contain one of the best performances of the 1950's, not that everyone else is lackluster it's just that this is Mitchum's film; everyone else is background music, it's also home to some of the most stunningly gorgeous black and white cinematography since somebody decided to film a garden scene in 1888. Dually influenced by Film Noir and the German Expressionist, which gives the film its feeling of a Grimm fairy tale, films there are more memorable scenes in this one film than in the vast majority of a lot of other directors entire filmographies.Of all films to compare this now established American classic (ain't that the way it always goes; film gets released, no one cares, 20-40 years later it's hailed as a work of art.) it, in a sense, resembles Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre because, without really spoiling Hunter there is a happy ending but the two children have gone through so much hell that it was most likely a concrete impossibility for them to grow up into mentally stable adults, sort of like Harry.",

I am a huge fan of cinema with favourites ranging from Billy Wider, Wyler, Sturges, Mankiewicz etc... so I think I know a bit about movies that matter.This movie is a great mixture of dark realism, fantasy and childhood understanding of the murky world of adulthood. That's it in a nutshell. I wont cover the grounds other reviewers already have but I just wanted to add my voice in praise of this unforgettable film. The soundtrack is haunting in its simplicity and darkness and is, again, reminiscent of a child's understanding of life. It is a ten out of ten and will always be. It is what cinema should be about.

The only thing missing was the twirling of the mustache (see Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate). In this movie, director Charles Laughton wanted a broad as a barn performance from Robert Mitchum. And he has a howling good time of it. Seen with the eyes of a child, Night of the Hunter is a frightening fairy tale. Mitchum as the ogre. Lillian Gish as the Guardian Angel (When she is walking with a basket in her hand with the increasingly smaller children walking behind with their baskets, it is hilarious Mother Goose imagery). Seen with older eyes, you see the movie for what it really is. What once seemed like a frightening performance by Mitchum turns into high camp. When he stumbles up the stairs trying to catch the children, or stumbles again after the children in the row boat, think of Wile E. Coyote chasing The Roadrunner, taking a few steps into the air before he realizes he is off the cliff. It really is that funny. Not that this isn't a serious movie. There are many layers that make it a hoot and a gem. The innovative cinematography and art design are terrific. They walked a great line in creating a fairy tale land that looked just real enough to keep you in the game. The aspects of repression and redemption are hammered home. And Laughton got the exact performances he wanted from his cast. It seemed as if everyone involved was in on the joke. If not entirely, they at least loved working for/with him. How he got a very conservative Lillian Gish to work on such a film is interesting.Laughton's repressed homosexuality and self-loathing made his life much more difficult than it should have been for such a great actor. But the stars aligned when this project was pitched to him. He was not only able to expose many of his demons but in doing so, made a movie for the ages.",

            "content": "Somehow made it in the pantheon of oughta see films. Oughta see films are 2 steps below must see films. I love Charles Laughton and think he's one of the greatest actors of all time, but he's no director. Mitchum is sentenced to 30 days for car theft (not his other heinous crimes) and is put in a cell with a man sentenced to hang. Even in the 30s when the film is set, that rarely happened. There were county jails for 30 day sentences and prisons for the ones to be hung. Not a spoiler: the kids' father has about 2 minutes to hide stolen loot: takes the stuffing out of doll and replaces it with lots of bills. Dolls remains soft and pliable and stays together while the kid swings it like her old man. Just couldn't happen. Cops don't look for $10,000 in loot (bills were larger in size and this was a stack bigger than the doll) and don't find the doll stuffing he had seconds to scatter (the sirens are blaring when he's hiding the money so you know they're close). Well, suspend your disbelief and keep it suspended when Shelly Winters marries Mitchum. There's no sense setting the film in the depression; it wasn't integral to the film. (See Paper Moon, PLEASE!) Toward the end Gish blows Mitchum's arm near-off making it hang like a real rag doll (not one stuffed with stiff paper bills) then it heals miraculously when Mitchum is cuffed and stuffed in the back of the cruiser with nary a squeal. Really? Some nice cinematography but not enough to save the film. I give it 5 stars because too many 4 and 5 star films are harder to watch, but not much. A major disappointment. If you wanna see Mitchum in noir, watch Out of the Past. If you wanna see noir, watch Burt Lancaster in The Killers. Decidedly not a classic.",

I had seen many others, Dracula, Frankenstein, all the wolfman movies (they creeped me out). All were good horror movies, but Robert Mitchum was the scariest villain ever and much more frightening than the monsters in his sheer evilness. There is one scene that shows the children in a rowboat with night sounds and pictures of nocturnal animals. It is absolutely gorgeous. Then you see Robert Mitchum riding his horse outlined against the night sky. He's singing Leaning on the Everlasting Lord and the children shrink into the boat in fright. It gave me goosebumps. Mitchum's opposite number is Lilian Gish and her innate goodness is essential to keeping the movie from being unremittingly black. The scene where she and Mitchum sing Bringing in the Sheaves together is unforgettable. A must-see movie for every adult. But make sure the kids aren't watching. It is many times spookier than any of the Halloween or Friday the 13th movies.",

            "content": "turned to an old movie I haven't seen since 1955. I can remember sitting in the Cinema De Luxe, in Lewes, half way up School Hill, and although it was an authentic fleapit it was my true seat of learning. One day I sat and watched - and loved - Night Of The Hunter, and my hazy teenage memory of it led me to buy a DVD. It turns out to be effective if much more god driven than I remember. Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish share the acting honours, and Shelley Winters does all she can with what she was given. An associative pleasure is a brief scene in a cafe, possibly seized upon by Laughton from the great Norman Rockwell Saturday Evening Post cover of 1951. Lillian Gish and the kids saying grace in the local cafe surely came out of Rockwell's Saying Grace painting? And is that Jimmy Stewart on the extreme left of the picture? The way Norm underlines it all and sprinkles his skill all over the table cloth, the window, the tea service; it's all there, and it looks so like the movie. I was carried on through the film, despite the hokum. Charles Laughton directed it - (his only film as director) - but so too did Mitchum; they created a marvellous dark chase along the Ohio river above Cincinatti, where the holy rollers used to play their biblical games. At the end, and this is me speculating again, is that vigilante scene inspired by Peter Grimes? I imagine Laughton would have been very aware of the Britten opera. Robert Mitchum is perfect as the religious fanatic, tortured by sexual guilt, and a ladykiller in the literal sense. He even sings well. A good if not a great movie, simpler than I remember it. It held me as a youngster and it held me as an old man despite being a touch hokey, a little too simplistic and with a few improbable events. It is important to see it as a parable, a fairytale, and allow it its happy ending.",

            "content": "In the depression era, a man robs a bank, killing two people in the process, to provide a better future to his kids. He tells his two little children where he hid the money before he is arraigned and hanged. Before his death he shared the cell with a serial-killer, Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum). After his release, Powell heads to the dead man's village dressed as a preacher. He impresses the simple folk of the place with his spiritual talk and marries the widow Willa (Shelley Winters). His new step-daughter Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) takes to him pretty quickly. Only her older brother John (Billy Chapin) suspects his true nature.The children escape on a boat down river. They are found by an elderly woman Rachael Cooper (Lillian Gish), who runs a home for a few orphaned children. In her, our little protagonists have finally found a good parental figure. She is willing to love, trust ans protect them. But the shadow of Powell is still large over their lives.The first half of the movie is a thriller and the second deals with themes like protecting the innocent and the triumph of good over evil. Nothing wrong with the idea itself but it here it is done poorly. The characters are written well at first; gullible Willa, her annoyingly pushy neighbor Icey Spoon (Evelyn Warden), innocent trusting Pearl, strong protective John etc. But these personality traits are soon stretched beyond belief. Willa is so convinced of her new husband's bona-fide intentions that she remains still when he is about to slit her throat. Icey Spoon does not think twice before believing the stranger Powell, when he tells her the pious Willa, a person she knew for a long time, has run away with a tramp. Pearl is inclined to be affectionate towards Powell even after he put a knife on her and her brother's throats on two separate occasions.The whole idea of good vs evil is slapped onto our faces. Powell has \"Love\" tattooed on back of the fingers of his right hand and \"Hate\" on the left. He even demonstrates the fight between his hands. The movie could do with a bit of subtlety. The climax too is a let down. Powell is sitting outside Cooper's house at night while she is keeping watch inside with gun in hand. One moment of distraction on her part and he sneaks in. She shoots in the dark, hitting him in the leg and he starts yelping like a Warner Bros. cartoon, taking cover in her barn. So much for building him up as an undaunted monster.There many good points about this movie too. The reactions of different people after Powell is caught by the Police are spot-on; John remembering his father's arrest, the same crowd who were swayed by Powell now self-righteously condemning his, Cooper shielding the kids from the crowd. Where most movies have a happy ending after the bad guy is caught/killed, this movie goes ahead to show the scars an episode like this can leave on those involved. A lot of taught has been put into these scenes and results are there to see.The acting is top-notch. The famed cinematography and lighting are everything they have been praised to be. The songs and the score are beautifully haunting. The film is a mixture good, bad and ridiculous.",

            "content": "In The Night of the Hunter Charles Laughton showed his incredible talents at directing a movie. It is a shame that the reception of the movie crushed his will to direct anymore, because like they say \"the true artists are never respected in their life time, only after they're gone\".The Night of the Hunter is an excellent suspense movie and could be nearby called a horror movie. The masterful use of shades and the darkness is something really chilling and unique. On the other hand the movie got also its beautiful scenes in the nature like the wonderful river scene. The very unique thing in the movie is the way the evil and the religion are connected. The religion is connected with everything and with every character in the movie. The biggest spotlight falls on Robert Mitchum's villain who's stating the bible and attempting to justify his acting with religion and God's words. This might have been one of the reasons why the movie was turned down when it originally came out. But today it can be seen as a radical and very effective way to create the suspense out of something pure and untainted. This is what makes the villain so unique. The way he believes he's doing the work of God while haunting the children, who are described as a lambs later in the movie.The actors are are pleasant to watch in this movie. Not to forget Robert Mitchum's frightening role as a villain, or the cheering and warming role of Lillian Gish as Rachel Cooper, the biggest weight of acting falls upon Billy Chapin's shoulders and he does his role very well too. Tecnically the only actor I didn't like was Sally Jane Bruce's Pearl Harper but that might fall to the fact that normally I can't stand child actors and their frustrating behavior in the movies. This is why I find Billy Chapin survived his role very well because he didn't give me that feeling.Overall the movie is a milestone in the history of suspense movies. It is one of the few suspense movies that manage to challenge Alfred Hitchcock's suspense thrillers and even beats the most of them with its unique directing and clever use of its visual aspects.The Night of the Hunter was never understood on it's own time but today it is a masterful suspense movie of classic cinema and a remind of what kind of a director Charles Laughton was and would have been.",

            "content": "The Night Of The Hunter is a powerfully astounding piece of film art. It is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. Ranks #1 on Mitchum, Gish, and Varden's performance lists. The film's pedestal is Christianity. It enlightens the mind on the horror's humans can bring to it- ripping it to shreds for all it stands for (\"wolves in sheep's clothing\") by those that mask themselves with it using it to unspeakably grim advantages. In modern day, this film proves how religion in the heart of goodness has been taken away by those that tarnish it. And displays how easily those that don't bother to look underneath the surface can be fooled. Christianity and religion in general have fallen prey in todays world by the very theme of this movie. Hate, abandonment, and evil causes people to stray away from the importance of \"goodness\" which is/was the original tie that binds us all together. And THAT no one can argue with. The Night Of The Hunter impresses with its dark silhouetted cinematography and stagy artistic set pieces. Particularly in the mouth-dropping unique (and far ahead of its time) row-boat getaway scene that all starts with a haunting lullaby. It should go without saying when lacing any kind of horror or suspense film WELL with religious themes is the most frightening. Why? Because it hits a little too close to home (things we as humans get a little too good at turning our backs on). This film does not hold back in the slightest. The brilliance of the film is in the risky story flow. The tone changes so many times, no normal film could stay afloat. Thankfully this is no normal film. It agitates me that Laughton never directed film again. But if this were any inkling to what he had in store for audiences, he has nothing left to prove. As stated, Mitchum has never been better, in an Oscar worthy turn he proves he is more than a pretty face and more than just a male box-office draw with movies that pale this type of acting in comparison (IE: Thunder Road, ick). Varden (The Bad Seed- fantastic), who had never failed to impress on stage uses it to her advantage here and amps up her role as the \"fooled\" Christian-lady taking the law into her own hands. Gish \"the old pro\", perfectly cast, nails her character dead-on and gives the film its much intended heart. The part where she sings the hymn \"Leaning On The Everlasting Arm\" with the devil (the Hunter) is compelling displaying an effortless battle for good vs. evil. I could go on and on talking about The Night Of The Hunter. But in a comment such as this... all that can be said is... you have to truly see this movie to believe it. You WILL NOT be sorry. You will be chilled to the bone, disturbed, joy-filled, and haunted... hours after its left your television screen. Step aside Citizen Kane. This, in a word, is a \"masterpiece\".",

            "content": "Robert Mitchum can do it all and does so with a director that combines so much style. I've never seen \"Cape Fear\" but I bet the performances are very similar and the characters very different. Here Mitchum plays a psychotic \"preacher\", he claims, that actually kills for money. well, he certainly looks like one but however murders widows and fancies himself someone as a biblical angel of death that steals their money and preaches to everyone in his path. He actually preaches things that he personally hates in contempt to himself and just lets everyone hear what he thinks they want to hear rather than the truth, to his own benefit. But not everyone knows the wisdom of such bible passages such as \"beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but, inside are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruits nor can a bad tree bring forth good fruit wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.\" Combining that passage with \"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God\" and \"just not lest ye be judged\" could help some. This movie is based on a novel and you know how hard it is to describe a plot in short so,i'll just describe the virtuosity of the directing of this movie along with nice writing. Here the movie combines a thriller, morale story, film noir, depression-era/proletariat story, coming-of-age even a musical and a bit of a comedy. The beginning shows a character (an elderly woman that was preaching those words i said to her children, we find out) who you almost forget that comes into the story long in to end of the second act. It shows her at the end of the credits with stars in the background as if part of the stars and the children. The music during the credits are at first thriller music, and then lovely children singing what seems to be the theme song of this movie: dream little ones dream, oh the hunter of the night fills you with fright, fear is only a dream, so dream little ones dream. The hunter being Mitchums character. Hm, lovely singing about a hunter that kills?...its perfect for this movie. The plot set in expressionistic style: Mitchum's psycho character is caught stealing his car that he drives int the beginning and tries to talk a bankrobber into telling him in his sleep where the money is hidden. Of course, the guy wakes up and punches him right off his bunk. The man is the father of the children in the story and robs the bank so the kids can grow up and have money in these hard times--never mind the death penalty, depression is tough. Of course, Mitchum catches on and thinks \"my god, now THIS is the widow i've been looking for!\". The kids promise not to tell their mother, which makes it very hard for Mitchum to put his knife into someone--he can't kill/preach without his money. He soon kills the mother who falls prey to his twisted thinking having no common sense and the kids are left to fend for themselves. Soon, the kids having been unfortunate in these tough times to find a good home stumble onto the elderly woman's lawn and she takes them in along with all the other children. Some coming-of-age (even elderly age) lessons are learned along with beautiful song, even the Mitchum character can sing some nice songs.",

The film is basically a morality lesson told in a strange fairytale style but with (obviously) more adult themes. Similarities between classic fairytales such as Hansel and Gretel or The Three Little Pigs abound, yet are not blatantly presented. The film is very stagy and the acting is either laughably over the top or wooden. Some of the reactions and behavior of the characters are completely implausible (in a real world). The preacher is at once cunning and methodical yet a comic, yelping foil when the door is slammed on his fingers or he's shot at. Others have mentioned the implausible reaction of the boy upon seeing the preacher's arrest mirror the arrest of his own father, but if you follow the moral dilemmas cited throughout you can accept that he has perhaps had the revelation that \"the money is the root of all evil\" when you consider that it was stolen money to begin with and was the cause of the preacher's pursuit and ensuing murders/arrests, etc.In any other film, these qualities would be considered negatives that detract from the sustain of belief, but in this film they only reinforce the surreal atmosphere.I can't help thinking that the film would be even better in the hands of better actors, but I suspect that if the film were redone today that it would completely miss the point and go for a more direct (and commercial) focus on the suspense aspect rather than the fairytale moral storytelling.",

The most striking thing is of course the photography-it is lit like a dream, with images that will stay with the viewer for ever. Then there is Mitchum, in his best performance ever. I have yet to see a scarier character in any movie-in fact he embodies the American Dream: good and shimmering on the surface, but underneath a dark and malevolent heart. Think David Lynch and Blue Velvet. Lillian Gish is almost as memorable and the children are fine. Shelley Winters plays the stupid widow superbly, and the script is resonant.

Perhaps Citizen Kane. I thought most of Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. I certainly would not call it an example of noir thriller or horror. It's that rare thing: a movie without genre. Laughton was a very great actor and, judging by this film, quite a director, too. The cinematography and design are extraordinary throughout. Some of the most remarkable images I can remember in a film of its time. It almost suggests the current fashion for graphical novels in its stylized, subjective angles and set ups. The acting, too, is strange and unlike most other movies. It's very theatrical and very effective. Some people have complained about what is seen as a corny, tacked-on ending. But I don't think it's that at all. Gish is a kind of Old Lady Who Lived In a Shoe. She collects stray children at risk in the world (though her love was unable to save her own son from some unexplained misfortune) and defends them against the evil that stirs at night. As in a fairy story, when the danger is past, the good characters are allowed to celebrate. Though in the final image the black smoke pouring from the chimney is ominous. Strange too is the erotic atmosphere that surrounds death. His knife that opens like an erection. Then there is the drowned woman. And how handsome and sexy and scary Mitchum is.

Often given shallow tough-guy roles, in this he showed himself capable of exhibiting exceptional range. From piety to madness, Mitchum is flawless. In his very stillness, there is menace. The conniving, vicious and greedy preacher with his personal conversations with the bloody deity of his imagination is the stuff of nightmare.The dream sequence of the children's flight for life is made more terrible by the relentlessness of his mostly unseen pursuit, and the musical soundtrack of the hymn sung by the untiring pursuer. The song sounded vaguely familiar to many movie-goers of the time, as something they might have heard in childhood but could not quite remember, and yet it was written for the film.Worth notice was the performance by the still lovely Lillian Gish, whose long career gave fans many memorable moments. Grubb wrote this character as an old country woman abandoned by her son who's wife was ashamed of his background, but no one could have turned their back on this strong-as-iron, but loving soul.Laughton's direction may have been a little uneven, but what a shame he allowed the initial failure of this film to keep him from further efforts. He got fine performances by all the members of the cast. Not many child actors in this era could have excelled in the role played by Billy Chapin, who seemed entirely natural as the boy entrusted with a terrible secret. What a shame that he was never given another role that fulfilled this promise.Shelley Winters played the role of her lifetime.An interesting side note: The Hunter's \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" tattoos haunted parents, teachers and probation officers of the '50s, by showing up on the hands of immature males of all ages",

I shouldn't feel like I, a non-actor, can portray a serial killer better. The boy's motivations for not trusting the reverend, as well founded they turned out to be, also didn't make sense.

Instead, the story meanders as randomly as an episode of \"The Simpsons\" but regrettably, at a slower rate. Everyone in the film has their own story, and it seems as though the director was trying to give everyone, from Mitchum's character down to young Ruby, their 15 minutes of fame. The result was a story that left me asking \"so what?\" at the end.Overall, as I said, not terrible at all, but the tedious production detracted greatly from what could have been a stunner.

The feel of a thriller is apparent throughout. One of the main characters who seeks to find out where the children's dad hid $10,000 hums a song throughout the whole movie that leaves a very eery effect. The use of wide shots in this movie like when the character Harry Powell comes riding on his horse humming his religious song there is more of an effect of creepiness. Also the way they were able to film the mother's body under the water is fantastic. The way there is no noise and just an eery peace really ties the theme of the film together.",

This is not just a suspenseful story, it is a successful collaboration of great talent.  The writing, directing, photography, and acting somehow merge into a production that displays great creative intelligence.  It is film as art.  As young as I was when I saw this movie, I knew that Robert Mitchum didn't have the snob appeal that the others involved had.  However, his presence is the most memorable aspect of \"Night of the Hunter.\"  There is never a false moment in his portrayal. He is masterful, terrifying and seductive at once.  The only disappointment (way in the back of my mind) is my wish, as a woman, that his sexual magnetism be rewarded.  How could he not be a good guy?  (I think this was my first Mitchum experience.)",

It consisted of a lot of short takes and featured a lot of dark lighting but that helped add to the scariness of it. The movie is about a reverend named Harry Powell who is secretly a serial killer. He ended up getting arrested in one town for driving a stolen car but the police didn't know he was also a murderer. Meanwhile a man named Ben Harper killed two men while he was robbing a bank. Harper went home before he was arrested and hid the money and only told his two children where it was and made them promise not to tell anyone. Harper and Powell became cell mates and Powell tried to convince Harper to tell him where he hid the money but he refused. Harper was eventually put to death for the crimes he committed and Powell was finally released. He decided to marry Harper's now widow in hopes that she would know where the money was and tell him. However, she didn't know where and the children refused to tell him no matter how many times he asked. Powell ended up killing the wife and was left to care for the children. The movie ends with the children running away and staying with an old woman named Rachel. Powell ended up finding them but the police soon found him and arrested him for all of the crimes he committed including murdering Harper's wife. The movie ended with the children finally being happy and living as close to a normal life as they could under their circumstances. I thought the movie was very fun to watch.",

Finally a pious woman finds the kids and starts taking care of them like mother Teresa. The preacher finds them by following them on a horse!!

The movie is filled with some allegories and you can interpret things in different ways. I think it's one of those movies in which you'll discover new things, every time you see it. In essence it's a story about good versus evil, in which the evil gets masterfully personified by Robert Mitchum, as a preacher on a killer mission in life.

            "content": "Perhaps the least prolific writer/director to create a masterpiece in a class of its own - almost - was Charles Laughton, who wrote and directed ONE movie in 1955 called \"The Night Of The Hunter\" with Robert Mitchum as a demonic preacher, Shelley Winters in a fine role, and Lillian Gish at her best. Charles Laughton was 7 years from the end of his 55-film acting career (that began in 1928) when he made Hunter, a film that had little commercial success upon its release, but has since achieved cult status. When I first caught Hunter as a afternoon movie broadcast, I was mesmerized by its haunting mood, earthy characters, photographic brilliance, and perfectly matched soundtrack music.Decades later upon first seeing Terrence Malick's Badlands (1973), I remembered a movie from my distant past that evoked the same awe, starred Mitchum, and was directed by Laughton. It was at this IMDb site years later that I was able to ID it as \"The Night Of The Hunter\". My most memorable similarity noted between the two masterpieces was the cinematography - clever camera angles, sweeping stark landscapes, menacing crime scenes on land and water, and above all the frequent close-ups of animal and plant life, the latter with time-lapse growth montages. Hunter was a remarkable directorial debut for Laughton as was Badlands for Malick, whom I suspect was somewhat influenced by his predecessor.Ever since I first caught Badlands as a late-night movie broadcast, I have been mesmerized by its haunting mood, earthy characters, photographic brilliance, and perfectly matched soundtrack music - so much so that I am compelled to watch broadcast after broadcast. After buying first the VHS then the remastered DVD, I am still left wanting the ultimate package that would feature not only better widescreen video and richer surround sound, but also a separate bonus audio soundtrack with all the musical selections, especially those by Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman. Fans of this movie have long lamented the absence of a published soundtrack. For more info on the actual Badlands Orff/Keetman cuts, see my review at Amazon 'Soundtrack for the Terrence Malick 1973 movie \"Badlands\"?'.We who hold Badlands in high regard have also bemoaned the two-decade drought of directorial output by Maestro Malick that ended with a poorly edited theatrical release of \"The Thin Red Line\". \"Days Of Heaven\" was nearly on par with Badlands, but then did Orson Welles ever have a realistic shot at surpassing Citizen Kane with HIS subsequent efforts? Interestingly, 43 years passed from the premiere of Hunter until the soundtrack CD was finally released in 1998 with narration throughout by Laughton (never before published)! I just discovered the existence of this CD today while surfing IMDb prior to writing this review. Perhaps there is hope we may see a Badlands soundtrack release before 2016, maybe with some Sissy Spacek narration and Martin Sheen dialog as separate tracks.",

The acting is okay. I think the kids are just as good as Mitchum quite frankly. Although I understood the basic underlying plot, a lot of times I was wondering what the hell was going.

Her hair was sticking up waving in the water and the uncle couldn't believe it when he saw her down there. He didn't believe it was true.

This movie seems so dated that I can't imagine it even being good when it was released.  Lillian Gish has the honor of being the only cast member who effortlessly turns in her performance.  I think Shelley Winters deserved her oscar for A PATCH OF BLUE but this role is just absurd. Robert Mitchum doesn't know if he's appearing in a comedy, a drama, or a \"suspense\" thriller so he does it all at the wrong times of course.  His singing in the distance is the only thing creepy about the movie.  Also the little boy is remarkably good however there are several scenes where you can see him smiling or trying to stifle a laugh, as if Robert just teased him prior to the filming.  One scene stands out as wonderfully ahead of it's time and that's the scene in which they show Shelley's character underwater in the car.  Other than that I was very disappointed in this film.

Robert Mitchum elicits a terrifying performance as Harry Powell the insane, brutal psychopath masquerading as a preacher, stalking Americas deep south.The plot, two orphaned children fleeing from their evil stepfather, works, albeit that its context is peculiar to the period. This helps establish the films credentials as a classic. Its good versus evil in many guises.The actor Charles Laughton directed this film. He was a complex character himself and some of the scenes carry messages that are subtle yet profound, particularly the father son relationship between Mitchum and the boy John Harper.Lilian Gish, arguably the greatest actress of the silent movies, makes a memorable foster mother who takes in and protects the two children from the menacing evil that is embodied by Michum. The sense of the struggle between good and evil is, at times, almost unbearable. Its gripping stuff!",

Before his death he confesses to a man in prison about the money he stole. This man, Harry(a \"preacher\") is released from prison and goes after his family to get the money. Harry is able to seduce the children (John and Pearl's) mother and trick her into marrying him. Behind her back he continues to threaten the children in search for the money. After Harry kills the mother, he goes after the children who are able to escape his grasp. John and Pearl, with the money, find refuge with a woman who takes them in, along with other lost children until Harry is taken in by the authorities.This film over all is not the strongest in terms of its story line, but is beautiful for its use of light and cinematography.",

Bouncing between hokily over acted and brilliantly dark the film never really took off for me but there were certainly segments where I was in awe. The shadow of Robert Mitchum in the children's room is one example of the brilliance contained in this mediocre film. The silhouette of Mitchum on the horse pursuing the children is another and of course Shelley Winters in the lake. The parts that I was less enthusiastic about were the scenes with Lilian Gish. As if the blatantly obvious imagery near the end wasn't enough we have Gish endlessly repeating that children are resilient. Was Laughton not aware that he could be subtle with messages? Regardless, I also don't understand why everyone seems to think that this is such a terrifying movie. When Mitchum is running after the children it looks as if he's doing a bad impersonation of Frankenstein's monster. Later when he's pursuing them into the river he seems more concerned with keeping his feet dry then recovering the money. Overall though the film is worth seeing for some jaw dropping cinematography and occasional moments of brilliance from Mitchum.",

I don't think there is any period in American cinema in which such disturbing visions of capitalist greed, violence and existential paranoia are so vividly depicted; and all in glorious black and white.

I just how he talked, acted, and how she acted towards the preacher in the same motion the young women with the two children did. If anything the children in the movie, were the best characters. John was great, the acting for his character was done well. I thought a lot of the lighting didn't make sense nor did I like to watch kids flow down a river for 20 minutes. I was constantly wondering when would this movie end. I thought it would end when the children reached the old women's home and have a safe place to live, but nope.

All the more despicable for his pious posturing, the same venomous charm which blinds the townspeople somehow works on the audience, and its difficult to hate the pathologically dishonest Powell. We see his evil from the outset and inexorable movie logic tells us he is schemes are destined to backfire. (Even his eventual comeuppance is overshadowed by the stoic little John Harper's cathartic emotional collapse.) As a result, the soft resolution belies the early shocks, in a way that makes you say \"they don't make em like that anymore\" and you're right... in today's Hollywood equivalent, the climax would have Powell blown away by the kid with a '45 in slow motion.",

I like movies that can hold me in suspense while also bringing up deeper questions. The theme of religion's role in American life and its potential to do great harm comes through without feeling preachy or going too far to make a point.

And showing only her legs makes the audience wonder \"who is this woman?\"The movie does a great job at capturing the era/decade in a way that feels natural and subtle, between the fashion, automobiles, set design and the way everyone talks about religion.Harry was a great character. He reminded me of the serial killer from David Fincher's Se7en. And the soundtrack that plays when Harry is arriving on the train and reappears whenever he is chasing after something, is very ominous. He is character that I hate and love at the same time, and typing this, I now realize that I quoted his fists.It was a really creative sequence of actions for John and Pearl's escape. It stood out as natural, like Die Hard or Home Alone where people are not action heroes, but normal people who can get hurt, by slipping on a bottle, or having a door shut on your fingers. The action beats really stood out, and did not go unnoticed. And after all the fast shots and quick cuts during the chase, it switches to a long static shot once they're safe, like a moment to catch our breath.It was really cool the way the 3 girls were introduced with their heads popping up out of the garden. And it was cool how Ruby was made separate in some ways to indicate that she has feelings for Harry.It was a cool cut-in shot where the owl captured the Rabbit.I love Uncle Bertie's character, and I only wish we got to see more of him.",

            "content": "**Warning: Spoilers Included**Its hard not to get chills when watching Robert Mitchum stroll slowly along a road, singing the spiritual 'Leaning'.  Night of the Hunter is one of those rare thrillers that takes you to edge, where the story and cinematography is so surreal, its like you're watching a dream.  Charles Laughton makes his only film behind the camera this time (you may remember him from 'Witness for the Prosecution', or as Capt. Bligh in 'Mutiny on the Bounty') and its sad to see that this was his only directing job. The chilling image Shelly Winter's hair floating in the water, or the surreal adventure down the river, all these are critical moments to the film.  But my two personal favorites are: a single shot from outside a window, where all you can hear is Winter's car being pushed into the lake. The other, even more gripping and chilling, is Robert Mitchum on a horse, slowly going along a flat plain in the dead of night, with only the lights over the horizon illuminating the outline of Mitchum and the horse. The plot is not so much as important as Mitchum's diabolically brilliant performance as the \"preacher\", who performs crime in the name of the Lord. But his latest scheme has gone wrong, and he follows the two children in a game of cat-and-mouse. 'Night of the Hunter' is true genius, ****/****.",

It falls on the lines of so many different genres and kind of balances on top of them, sometimes almost falling off into a categorie, but it always regains its balance and keeps going. Beautiful visuals, great casting, and a special form of \"mise-en-scene\" that most film makers would only hope but to replicate. This movie holds a special \"dream\" like quality to it, whether that is the result of how the plot and everything has come off to the viewers, it inspires a strange sense of \"adventure\" and disconnect. Giving it a very strong sense of a dream, almost like the film is being experienced rather than enjoyed, it kind of enters it's own immersive plane for what it is.",

I was pretty disappointed.Seen through the eyes of someone who's been watching movies for the last 25 years, this movie is nothing special.  In reading the other comments, I can see why; people praise it for various original elements (scene composition, the 'evil preacher', the Shelly Winter underwater scene, etc.). Unfortunately, all these elements have become some of the most enduring cliches in the movie industry.How many times have we seen the dead girls underwater?  Or the corrupt preacher?  Or light making symbols on walls?  For the modern viewer, there's nothing new here - it's like visiting a museum of film technique, enlightening as to the origins of these cliches, but not all that entertaining.It's a problem I have with a lot of the classics (Third Man, Citizen Kane, Star Wars); just because they were first to use a technique, does that make it the best?  It certainly means kudos for the director devising it, but it doesn't mean the film will stand the test of time.  Very few 'classic' films really remain classics.  Wizard of Oz, The Sweet Smell of Success, The Godfather; all these manage to still carry the same impact they had on the first viewing.  Night of the Hunter just seems a little odd, notable mainly for its gimmicks which we've all seen a hundred times by now.",

The acting wasn't terrific or anything, except for Robert Mitchums character. He did a pretty job at playing his character because throughout the movie you kind of hate his character. Which is a good thing because his character is not one that should be praised......but Robert Mitchum should be for portraying that character. Billy Chapin did pretty well too, he's also pretty young in this movie so thats pretty cool. But other then those two, i didn't really think the characters were all that entertaining or special. The story is pretty sad and the way the film is shot makes it seem even more sad. Its black and white and very dark in a lot of the scenes but not in all the scenes is it that dark with the lighting and shadows. Camera angles were \"different\"and very unique. I read that this movie didn't do to well when it first came out but now people like it. I mean its cool to look at, don't get me wrong but besides Mitchum the rest of the characters seemed so boring to me. Overall i liked the look of the film, but for the most part it wasn't my cup of tea. Not enough seemed to be going on when watching it for me to really get into it.",

The movie has such a slow tone throughout that it does drag a bit at times but I think that also adds some of the creepiness to it. The leading character Reverend Harry Powell is brilliantly played by Robert Mitchum. The slow southern draw and calm creepiness is what really makes this movie what it is. The children on the run are merely support for Mitchum to focus his terror on in search of a treasure. We want the children to succeed in escape and the audience gets a certain comfort from the orphanage mother Rachael Cooper. She is a tough, old lady and we find ourselves in her corner.

Poor Charles Laughton, his one masterpiece is so obtuse for some viewers, they seem to forget that films are a product of their times. Laughton wanted a movie that was truly disturbing, and visually striking. Mitchum is the prototype for all subsequent obsessives, but this wasn't apparent at the time. Now every phsycho on film has a little Preacher in 'em, ( and maybe a little Tommy Udo, as well, but that's another story ) and the cinematography is copied endlessly over the years. I still feel if you can get the feel of this movie, you've tapped into a vein of weirdness and mayhem that Laughton was shooting for. Too bad some viewers have too much modern baggage to see this without trying to compare it with newer flicks. I doubt if any era in movies has given birth to such a film, that in its own time repulsed so many, and enchanted just as many more. Remember, Agee's writing on this was truly out of nowhere in 1955, and still not equalled. Guess I just love this flick.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is a haunting movie that mixes characters out of a Faulkner novel with the chilling intrigue most closely associated with Alfred Hitchcock movies. Based on the real-life serial murders of a killer who preyed on women he met through lonely-hearts ads, the movie stars Robert Mitchum as a sinister and sexy con-artist and killer who masquerades as evangelical preacher Harry Powell to gain the trust of the community - and of his next victim.He pursues Willa Harper (Shelly Winters), a young widow whose husband was Powell's cell mate after Powell was incarcerated for car theft. Powell learned that Ben Harper (Peter Graves) hid $10,000 he had stolen somewhere in their house. Powell intended to get it. He doesn't count on the fact that the only people who know where the money is hidden are Harper's two children, and they've promised their father they would never tell. After attempting to tell the adults in their world that Powell's only interest was the money and being dismissed as liars, the children soon become the targets of Mitchum's manipulation and wrath. He kills Willa after she discovers her son was telling the truth, leaving the two children to deal with Mitchum and his evil intentions on their own.Mitchum's oily, controlling and manipulative Reverend Powell is starkly contrasted by Lillian Gish's Mrs. Cooper, the person who ultimately takes in the children after they've run away, believes they are in danger and protects them from Powell. Both Powell and Cooper quote extensively from the Bible, but the difference in the way they apply scripture distinguishes evil from good, and hypocrisy from real faith. Powell uses Biblical passages to condemn all women, especially those who evince any hint of sexuality. Cooper, on the other hand, focuses on the biblical exhortations to love, taking in children who have been neglected, abandoned and born out of wedlock.Powell is brought to justice in the end, but this is still a movie that can produce nightmares. The looming danger that Powell presents is a constant, and the suspense is intensified by the bleak landscapes that scream Depression-era poverty, the black and white cinematography and the haunting background music. It is a well crafted bit of film noir worth watching at least once.",

It's similar to precious moments dolls; they are supposed to be cute and holy but they're downright frightening. Examples of this lie in little Pearl's naive child lines that somehow came off sounding demonic (and her facial expressions!)  Also, the manner in which Lillian Gish (the good religious person) says \"little children endure and abide\" toward the end--you expect her to say, \"But not for long...\" and then take out a gun and kill them. This movie made me giggle a lot.  The dialogue is very corny and the symbolism is the most overt I've ever seen.  But these components are coupled with a very expressive spookiness that makes the movie quite hypnotic and unforgettable. (One of my favorite parts is when old Mrs. Spoon talks about how women don't care about sex: \"I've been married for 40 years and all that long, I just lie there and think about my canning.\") I love the part where Robert Mitchum (the evil preacher) and Lilian Gish (the righteous woman) sing a hymn together while he's outside stalking the household and she's in a rocking chair armed with a rifle; love and hate at odds but still part of the same divine plan. 9/10",

For a movie made in 1955 the style is straight from the mid to late 1930s. Extreme facial close-ups, exaggerated expressions, unrealistic physical actions - all in an attempt to convey the director's interpretations of the script (which itself is highly suspect). The casting was a mix of truly talented people and hambone performers.\nSupposedly, Mitchum wanted it filmed in West Virginia for the correct setting, but Laughton used Hollywood studios and backlots to control the visual style he was imagining. I wish Mitchum had won the argument.\nIt is reported that the principal actors all loved Laughton's directorial style and that he made their working experience very harmonious. That may due to allowing them to do what they wished with their performance rather than the director telling them what the he wanted. After all, Laughton was an actor rather than a director.\nIn all, this movie would have been a better product with an experienced director working from a better script that did not try to infuse social and religious opinions into a simple thriller motion picture.",

The cinematography was advanced for its time. It's an odd combination. I had to force myself to watch it all the way through. I liked the way that wildlife, such as rabbits, birds, a frog, and a turtle were shown in the foreground to frame a scene. I did not care for the opening montage of faces floating on a dark background while scripture was read. It is a wild card, very much out of context. If you need to check this off your list, go ahead and see it, but if I had realized what it was like, I would not have bothered to rent the DVD from Netflix.

Consider this \"Mad Mad Mad Mad World\" meets \"Enough\", or one of those other pieces of crap about a jerk who seems nice at the wedding but later turns into a jerk. While the plot isn't exactly original (there are several dozen TV films and even more Hollywood that follow the same general idea) the storytelling is. but not necessarily in a pleasing way.Charles Laughton directed the film, and it does seem to have his signature style as part of the film making and dialogue. Laughton isn't going to be remembered as one of the best directors (his last notable piece of work came in the form of the \"Jerry Seinfeld meets Abbot and Costello\" tribute show) but the film shares qualities with other works like \"The Blue Veil\" and \"The Strange Door\". Please note that I'm not calling the film style brilliant by any means. just different. Parts of this film remind viewers of the more \"playful destruction\" style that became popular in the mid to late 90's, and seems slightly out of place for an older film. Parts of the movie which were panned by critics at the time seem completely out of place for the time period, which isn't a problem for current viewers but likely confused the hell out of audiences in the 50's.One wonders if the film was meant to be a thriller, a comedy, or something in between. Ultimately it doesn't come off very well as any of those, and lacks the effective genre locks that a Coen or Stone seems able to create when inspired. The phrase \"jumbled mess\" seems to come to mind, although the film was not awful. simply badly disjointed. The quality of the filming and production was unusually high for the time, and it stands up well some fifty-odd years later. One wonders what the reaction would be if it was released within the last decade.The acting was fair, nothing outstanding although perfectly competent. There was not a completely awful actor in the film, although most roles will come off as unmemorable. Robert Mitchum plays the evil role well, but somewhat uninspired. Likewise for the children, who seem to be reading off a slightly different script and thus give the movie an odd quality when the children and the pursuer are interacting together.Not an amazing movie, but worth watching if for nothing else than to see a film that likely inspired several others and a fairly innovating storytelling approach for the time.",

He was a master as an actor and to me, he was also a master as a director with only one film to his credit.Mr Laughton also had choosen a very gifted cast and a performance from Robert Mitchum that will always be a favorite of mine. Never thought I'd see him play such a role as this one. He is sinister throughout the film but there were times when he changed completley and gave you a jolt when you could laugh at this evil man too. My favorite one being when the very gifted actress Lilian Gish, sitting on her porch with shotgun in her lap, scares the **** out of Mitchum and he goes off like a scared rabbit. Don't want to reveal just WHAT HAPPENS, because it might spoil it for those who still have not seen this BRILLIANT film.I have two films that come to mind, when someone asks me what my favorite SCARY films were. The first is NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and the second is THE INNOCENTS with Deborah Kerr. It also happens that BOTH films involve children in their plots. The children in both films were the focal point, which I think is part of the reason they stick so close to my mind as favorites. Children are so innocent and helpless when they have to SAVE themselves from the evils of adults around them.  Miss Gish has a line at the end of this film which says it all....Now if you haven't seen this film...or if you have and don't remember that line...then watch it again to see what it is...It is a great line and has been with me all of my life, since seeing this GREAT FILM!!",

I won't need to clarify that I'm not a qualified movie critic but I feel I should say a couple of things about this one. First and foremost, not being able to discern whether I should praise the director or the cinematographer for the astonishing success of conveying to the screen the extraordinary variety of imagery that makes it impossible to choose a favorite from one end to the other. I believe this is the best quality of this film. Depicting the small town physical, social and psychological atmosphere was just perfect as it was setting up the background and mental works of Mitchum character in less than a couple of minutes. Particularly effective was his insertion in a sort of naive, well meaning and trusting community and the way he engaged in his relationship with Winter in such a natural way that the audience found it hard not to feel comfortable with it while knowing in advance what Mitchum motives were. And even thou the rest of the plot went exactly as it was supposed to be, it never failed to keep the everyone wondering what was going to happen next. From this point of view both the script and the direction where impeccable all the way, as a whole. Of course a few mistakes were made here and there, and no matter how hard to swallow they were you give them all the benefit of the doubt or something else. I mean that you never got entangled with the boy being able to see the shadow of Mitchum reflecting on a second floor wall when the only source of light was a gaslight lamp post and both the post and Michum shades were casted a couple of ft down on the lawn by the picket fence, by an different light source. Also, I'm not convinced at all about the incriminating car going down to rest right in the middle of a very shallow lagoon without a steep slope to allow that to happen. Also, I was very confused with Mrs. Gish character that was somehow depicted as a tough person with harsh manners that you wouldn't be so sure whether she was taking care of homeless kids or actually exploiting them in her business ventures and most of the time feeding them just with apples. I've read a bunch of other confusing or badly explained stuff and I rest my case as for minutiae sake. I'm also convinced that Michelangello's Monalisa has a very disproportionate upper body and everyone believe it's a masterpiece. So, all thing given and taken away, this is a great movie with very good acting, except for Peter Graves while arriving home chased by the police, but fortunately he was hanged early enough. If you like soft horror and great suspense, just go and watch this one. it.",

            "content": "It's impossible to divorce this film from the era it was created in...it was loaded with anti-1950isms. Here were a few of my favorites:1.In one scene a young girl walking around a suburban street in the 1930's as store signs flash around her that is absolutely priceless. It just screams anti-commercialism! 2.There's also a slight backlash against the preachy, overly religious tone of the 1950's(remember kids, there was a religious revival in progress, due to Cold War conflict with the SU)where hypocritical piety (the Reverend) is contrasted with pure righteousness(Rachel Cooper). 3.And hypocritical piety(yes,I'm still talking about the Rev.) also does a (probably) accidental take on the 1950's monster movies when he makes his hands into claws and chases the children up the stairs.",

            "content": "With so many reviews on this movie, what more can still be said... well, actually there is one striking thing that I didn't come across yet: the numerous references to the art form opera, both in content and in style. The operatic ingredients are simply remarkable. Charles Laughton must have been an opera-lover!1. The minimally defined, fairy-tale alike world --- The stage is deliciously generic. We do not see a whole lot of the world wherein our heroes live, there is hardly any historical context besides the mentioning of the Years of Depression. Most of the movie is timeless. The characters live in a sort of medieval setting: there are a few houses, there's the river, and there are trees and cows. On just a few moments, especially towards the end, we get to see a little bit more. Likewise a lot of operas are staged within a minimally defined, rather timeless framework. With this the attention if fully geared towards the story, plus the story is given the stamp of timelessness - its value is universal.Especially interesting is the central role of the river. It is the mother's grave, it is the escape for the children, and it is the artistic setting for the most beautiful transitional scene celebrating the girl's song, the peaceful river current and the comforting nature around; we see rabbits, frogs and we feel the connection between this beautiful and pure animal world and the children, still open-minded.2. Characters are associated with a musical theme --- Heralding the most dramatic moment of Verdi's Rigoletto, the court jester Rigoletto hears the Count singing, filling Rigoletto with great fear. Another example: at the beginning of Mozart's Die Zauberfl\u00f6te announces Papageno his arrival with his jolly song \"Yes, I am the bird-catcher, and ever merry - hopsasa!\", while the hero Tamino is recovering from a dragon attack and surprised that he is still alive. In lots of operas characters announce themselves with their song, on the background. In The Night Of The Hunter the little boy observes The Hunter on his horse in the night, singing His theme - which is therefore a frightening theme, and that is exactly what it should be. The theme alone makes you shiver. More operatic is not possible.And what to think of the duet between the Hunter and the heroine caretaker, she with the gun on her lap. It is mesmerizing. In real life the opponents do not see and hear each other, in this piece of art we still believe that, while the two are singing in harmony. How operaesque can you go?3. The curse of the treasure --- The central role of the 10.000 dollars - the treasure - has a strong thematic bond with the Gold in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen: it is the curse which lies on the treasure. The owner will always be hunted by this curse, for the treasure was not honestly obtained: it was stolen and the heavy price of two lives was paid. In the movie the blood money is thrown on the Hunter's back.I am sure more operatic ingredients can be traced. Well, I'm looking forward to see this movie again...!",

            "review_title": "Stylized, Allegorical Children's Fable",
            "content": "Contains Spoiler!! This is one of my favorite movies.  It is not without flaws, but it is an unusual combination of unreal, fantasy/noir visuals and a childlike, fable/religious storyline, through which the menacing preacher Harry Powell (Mitchum) relentlessly stalks the innocent children.  By today's standards, some of the acting is over the top (Shelley Winters and Peter Graves)and the dialogue is unintentionally funny in some instances, but all of this should be forgiven considering the great cinematography and the mesmerizing performance by Mitchum.The director, Charles Laughton, was really trying something unique, telling a basic story of good versus evil through the eyes of the innocent children, who are constantly stalked by the evil wolf Mitchum.  As others have mentioned, there are some unforgettable, haunting scenes like the dead Shelley Winters at the bottom of the river, her blond hair flowing in the water like seaweed; the dreamlike trip down the river; two dimensional houses shot (Cabinet of Dr. Caligari?) and silouetted at odd angles; shots of animals totally out of proportion; the relentless preacher riding a horse on the horizon, singing his favorite hymm, \"leaning, leaning, leaning in his everlastin arms\"; the children in the barn, waking up to his dreadful song and stating, \"Don't he never sleep?\".Don't go expecting a typical thriller/horror movie.  It certainly has it's scary moments, but it is not meant to be a \"thriller\".  However, if you let yourself see the good versus evil plot through the eyes of the children, sometimes real, sometimes trance-like, well this movie can just take you away.  I really think that was the purpose of the movies fable-like quality, essentially surrounding the malignant, devil Mitchum with the good and innocence of the children.  As Lillian Gish says at the end, \"The children will abide.\"It you like action movies, don't bother seeing this one.  However, if you are looking for a VERY different movie with one unforgettable performance, go out and get this now!",

Unlike most films of this genre, the protagonist is a young boy. Robert Mitchum plays a deranged preacher, a wolf in sheep's clothing, who supports himself by marrying, and then murdering, rich widows. The look of many of the scenes is inspired by German expressionism, making for a haunting and surreal movie. Shelly Winters is great as always. I highly recommend this film, especially if you like film noir.",

There's nothing I can say about the cinematography that hasn't already been said. Beautiful, shocking, brilliant, rife with symbolism and expressionism. This entire movie, aside from the ending, feels like a child's nightmare, with that same feeling of inexorable dread with no end in sight, until abruptly, it's over. The performances are all wonderful, creating a world full of quirky characters that borders on surrealism. If you're a fan of Orson Welles and David Lynch, you'll almost certainly like this movie. The prints are pristine, and it's a feast for the senses and the mind. The Night of the Hunter is easily one of the greatest suspense films ever made. The only complaint I have is that it turns into a Christmas movie at the end, and the tonal shift is enough to give you whiplash.",

Its flaws hardly detract from its effectiveness, though its great scenes are heavily weighted towards the first half of the movie and the end has an utterly bizarre humanism that may leave quite a bad taste after the previous brilliances.**SPOILERS**What stands out is the great madness: that cramped, impossibly angled house, (some of) the acting of Mitchum, the sexual horror of that wedding night scene in the bedroom.  The most chilling moment in this frightening movie comes during that scene when the psychotic preacher commands his new wife to look at herself in the mirror and asks if she wants more children.  And then there's that scene where the town children sing that terrible song, \"Hing Hang Hung...\", as you watch innocent children being as cruel as any sadistic adult could.  There are enough great moments of horror in this film to fill five less inspired movies.  The basement scene is good, but the details of the children escaping are ridiculous.  Mitchum never really seems to be trying; as he slips on the mud before the small boat it smacks of poor directorial timing.  After that, the movie drifts unconvincingly to a silly ending.  The hideout with Lillian Gish is truly strange, and by the end when she directly addresses the camera, great horror somehow has become shallow humanism.  This is still worth watching though, and as you watch the end just think of the scores of movies entirely based on awkward sentiment. At least this one has some good scares.",

            "content": "I thought this movie was basic trash.  I thought the directing was sub-par, the acting hokey (with a few exceptions), and the screenplay weak.  After an hour of watching this movie (we did finish the whole thing mind you), we turned the lights back on, and we said in almost unison \"what the hell was that?\".  I found the bad acting (which some say was on purpose) to be revolting. A noteworthy performance was the \"speech\" on the preacher, his actions were almost laughable (remember him chasing the children up the stairs in a stance similar to the original frankenstein movies).  Parts of the movie actually had us in a confused shock, such as when the children pushed the boat away from the ground as the preacher chased after them.  He made almost no real effort to get them, someone in the room said \"why don't you try going INTO the water?\".  The end of the movie was a total joke.  It seemed as though the director wanted to fulfill his \"symbolism quota\" and tried to cram 100 symbols into the end of the movie, and left most of our audience staring blankly at one another as if to say \"what is going on here?\".  Which is exactly what i said to the person next to me during the whole mob scene.  That mob organized very quickly and dispersed twice as fast.  The mob formed, miss cooper took the children out back, and the mob vanished with no mention to what happened to them.  I'm sorry, but large crowds of people do not just vanish.There were some good parts that did not want to make me wretch.  The lighting was well taken care of and added a nice erie mood to the film (the bedrooms, the preacher outside by the fence, etc).  The scene where the precher is seen riding the horse out in the distance singing his song in the morning is well done.   but that's about it.  eh... i wasn't impressed, and the only entertainment came from making jokes about the preachers lines.",

I won't go into detail, as I'm not in the habit of posting spoilers, but there are a good number of hackneyed, poorly written moments: Characters doing things that don't make sense, some silly dialogue, and an ending that is ultimately quite anti-climactic.All in all, it is a good film with a handful of ground-breaking moments, and I would certainly recommend it.
