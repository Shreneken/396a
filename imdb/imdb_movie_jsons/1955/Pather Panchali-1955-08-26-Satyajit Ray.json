            "content": "It is a little known fact that India produces more films per year than any other country. The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby's Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful _Pather Panchali_. This film has got to be the best ever made about, well, life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film, Zhang Yimou's _To Live_, which was good, but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. _Pather Panchali_ feels as real as life itself. To be sure, it contains great moments of sadness, but, for the most part, it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman, maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over, has no teeth, and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family, and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful.\nI could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see: a DVD version of this film, and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy, and only Criterion could do this effectively, which is kind of disappointing, since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay; a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film, along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course, I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture, so I was able to catch a little, but there is so much I don't know. A commentary track on a DVD would help me understand the film better, and thus love it even more.",

            "content": "I've been asked what my favorite film of all time is. It's a silly question, and the answer might have changed over the years. But I am certain now. It is \"Pather Panchali,\" completed by Satyajit Ray in 1955. Strange that I would settle on an Indian film, since I have specialized all my life in Italian movies and think I know a good deal about them. But no, \"Pather Panchali,\" spoken in Bengali and made on a budget that couldn't buy a coffee break on a major production anywhere today, is my favorite film.Why? Oh, goodness...because of its poetry, its humanity, its timeless and haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, its powerful portrayal of a family and a culture. I first saw it when I was a senior in high school. I went to the Avon in Providence, where it played for a week in 1959. Overwhelmed, I went three or four times that week. I told people about it but nobody seemed interested. And it's futile even now to promote this film among folks who only respond to graphic action, moronic one-liner comedies, thundering vacuous soundtracks, the vapid melodrama of snakes on planes. \"Pather Panchali\" means \"Song of the Road,\" and was the first film by its director, made as a total labor of love. He began in 1952 in 16mm, then got financing from the Bengal government to complete the work in 35mm. It took four years, and was shown to great acclaim at Cannes, where it won one of the top awards. It was a radical departure from Indian film convention which has characters breaking out into song every ten minutes, regardless of the story.The movie was the first of a trilogy Ray completed in a few years. \"The Apu Trilogy\" is about the life of an idealistic hero. \"Pather Panchali\" deals with the youth of Apu and his impulsive sister Durga, and the travails of his Brahmin priest father and his worrying mother in the midst of crushing poverty. The second and third parts are \"Aparajito\" and \"The World of Apu.\" All these classics are highly acclaimed masterpieces and very much liked by discriminating audiences.\"Pather Panchali\" turns everyday childhood occurrences into wondrous events, whether it is brother and sister crossing the fields filled with white feathery rushes to see a train in the distance, a pursuit of the candy man, a Hindu feast, the wonders of the natural world, an ancient aunt telling bedtime stories to children. Death interrupts the family twice, taking away young Durga too. The scene in which the long-absent father returns to learn of the death of his daughter is a lacerating wail from the beyond. Apu's concealing forever the suddenly-learned truth of a secret theft by his sister is a moment, once seen, can never be forgotten. In sadness, mother, father, young son move away. The film ends.Musician-composer Ravi Shankar did the beautiful score. He was a virtual unknown at the time, but I traced down recordings of his music (decades before his legendary Woodstock appearance!) and still listen to them. Ray was influenced by the Italian neo-realists, particularly De Sica in \"The Bicycle Thief,\" which he said bowled him over.In the mid-90s the films of Ray were restored and reissued to great acclaim, and retrospectives took place everywhere. \"Pather Panchali\" and the rest of the \"Apu Trilogy\" are available on video or DVD at libraries and retailers and form the nucleus of any collection of world cinema. It is a shining work of art.",

I can totally believe in the eccentric grandmother, the strung-out mother, the mischievous sibling relationship and the simple but fragile village life. Yet I also feel like nothing really happened. After about the first fifteen minutes, I got the main message of what life is like for these characters, and then the film offered nothing else beyond that.

            "review_title": "Possibly the best film ever made about childhood",
            "content": "*** WARNING: SPOILERS ***The three films Pather Panchali, Aparajito and Apur Sansar form a trilogy, and, although each holds up well in itself, they are best viewed as a unity. Speaking on a purely personal note, I know of no greater achievement in cinema, and have certainly seen nothing that moves me more profoundly.The twin themes of these films are progress and loss. The former implies the latter, and both are, in a sense, inevitable. This is, as all summaries must be, an over-simplification. Certainly, the loss of childhood, of innocence, of parents, is universal to the human condition. Growing up, progressing from childhood to maturity, is similarly inevitable. But Apu wills his progress: at least, he wills its direction. He always grapples with life, painful though it is. Only once, after the death of his wife (in the third film of the trilogy), does he turn his back upon life, but this crisis is temporary: the trilogy ends with Apu once again facing the future willingly, uncertain though it is.It is this refusal to turn one's back, to stagnate, this refusal to renounce, that forms the backbone of this trilogy, and gives it a unity throughout its often disparate episodes. The central character of these films, Apu, always aspires towards becoming something greater, other than what he is. He wants to educate himself. This, in a western context, appears somewhat obvious, but, given Apu's background, education is something to strive towards, to struggle for; and Apu, despite great temptation, never abandons this struggle. It is not that he sees education as a means towards wealth or power: this is not, after all, anything so crude as a rags to riches story. But he does want to outgrow the village, to understand, and come to terms with life and the larger world outside. And in this he is, as is suggested by the title of the second film, aparajito, undefeated.Over the three films, we see Apu progress from childhood to, perhaps, his early thirties. In this progression, we see his character develop through experience. This experience is often painful, and Apu is not always capable of rising above the pain. Perhaps no other film has depicted with such a terrible intensity the emotional pain of loss; but the vision, ultimately, is far from tragic. The last film - Apur Sansar - actually ends with a sense of joy. The joy is by no means unqualified: it has been hard won, and we, the audience, recognize its fragility. But it is, nonetheless, exhilarating.Pather Panchali, the first of the trilogy, takes place some time early in the 20th century, and covers the years of Apu's early childhood. We see him born into a poverty-stricken family in rural Bengal. Later, we see Apu at play with his sister, Durga; we see him excited by the travelling players; we observe the uncomprehending wonder of Apu and Durga as they see a train for the first time. We are shown all those events of childhood that are apparently trivial, but which nonetheless shape the adult personality.Apu's mother Sarbojaya (the superb Karuna Banerjee), is understandably harassed, trying to keep her family clothed and fed. The father, Harihar, is good-natured, other-worldly, and quite unpragmatic. With the family lives an aged aunt, Indir. She is a pathetic figure, helplessly eking out a meagre existence on the charity of those who barely have enough for themselves, and relying on Durga - with whom she has a close relationship - to supplement her inadequate diet with stolen fruit. Aware of her status, Indir generally speaks and acts in an ingratiating and conciliatory manner; but there is a repressed rage within her that bursts out on occasion. It is a magnificent performance from the aged actress Chunibala Devi. Sarbojaya has no patience with this old woman, and takes little trouble to hide the fact that she is unwanted. This is not out of deliberate cruelty, or indifference: it is simply that looking after her own immediate family is burden enough. The old woman, desparately trying to retain the last vestiges of her dignity, is forever storming out, attempting to find a roof to shelter under from some other relative. But she keeps returning: even a hostile roof, after all, is preferrable to none. It is a picture of desperation which moves the heart beyond mere pity. There is one particularly heart-rending scene where she sits in the dark singing of death in her old, cracked voice.This first part of the trilogy ends in tragedy - Durga's death - and I know of nothing in cinema that delivers so powerful an emotional punch. It took me quite unawares at first viewing, and even on repeated viewings, it moves me like nothing else I have seen. Particularly unforgettable is Apu's final, quiet act of love for his dead sister, which really needs to be seen in its proper dramatic context to be appreciated. It is the end of a chapter in the family's life, and they move on. The sense of loss is overwhelming.This is perhaps the best film ever made about childhood. I watch the entire trilogy about once every year, and wonder afresh at what cinema, at its best, is capable of achieving.",

            "content": "There is this one scene in Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali when the eruption of a conflict between Apu's family and a quarrelsome neighbour brought the film to a complete standstill (for me anyway). Those few characters' state of mind and their relationship dynamics at that point in time, was conveyed with such explosive intensity, I got gut punched drunk.\nPather Panchali boasts of suitably melodramatic yet highly intuitive performances. Its breath taking cinematography ranks alongside existential beauty this side of Malick heaven. The musical scoring, by the great Ravi Shankar, is identifiably Indian, yet universally sublime. Together, these myriad parts melded into a whole so grand in its social consciousness, so incisively intimate in its portrait of one family, I could do nothing but be slowly devoured like a most willing prey. On 4th Oct 2003, I saw my all time favourite film, Tokyo Story. The feeling I got today from Pather Panchali, is as close as is possible from that fateful October day. Pather Panchali is one of the best films I have ever seen. This will be a night to remember. Now on with the other two then.",

            "content": "I won't go into detail about this film, because the greatest films ask that you really just sit back and enjoy them without questioning. This is in a very very small handful of films that create a kind of 'ecstatic truth' that Werner Herzog is always talking about. There is not a moment of hand-fed emotion, and that's probably what hits you first after the film is finished. This is probably why the film has not hit even the first 250 on the IMDb list, while it is more easily accessible than, say, most 'foreign' pictures, it still refuses at every turn to make a clich\u00e9 out of itself or to be unfair to the audience or its characters by making its machinations obvious, a ploy that most filmgoers fall for time and time again. A reason for this might be that Ray, a young director at the time who had already worked with Jean Renoir on his landmark film about India called 'the River', really didn't have a lot of money or power to wield around, and made this tight, intimate story on a shoestring with an amateur crew, without real concern for anything else but this story that he wanted to tell. A lot of that comes across - the locations, the actors - were all real, however this is a work of masterful collaboration between director, cinematographer, actors, sound recordist, and particularly the editors, a collaboration that is unparalleled in most modern, big budget films. This is a movie created solely with passion, and I am joining in the crusade to make this one of the top 250 on IMDb, though it should, by default, belong on the top 10 of anybody's list.",

            "content": "I originally saw the Apu trilogy in 1961 in a little theater in Berkley. Sat through a straight showing of all three films and walked out after six hours in awe. It was a defining day in the development of an avid film buff. I have waited three years for the DVDs to be released, and hoped against hope that Criterion would get the rights, but it was not to be. Sony has released an unadorned, Mirchant and Ivory Foundation restoration: but they are finally available. I bought all three of the Trilogy the day they were released, but have been reluctant to put them on. So many of my memories of \"great\" films have made me wonder what I was on when I saw it to think that was great. Think \"Brewster McCloud.\" My experience of Pather Panchali and the full trilogy was a memory I didn't want diminished in any way. Tonight I came home from work, put the Pather Panchali in and sat totally rapt for the full two hours. The DVD production values and the print quality are really bad in spots, but all that fades as one of the really great art films takes over, and the immersion in the lives behind the film works its magic. Film doesn't have to be an act of corporate commerce: Pather Panchali is living proof that film can be a medium of great art.",

            "content": "POSSIBLE SPOILERS:\"Pather Panchali\" is not only the start of a highly recommended trilogy (the so called \"Apu trilogy\") but also the first film of the legendary Indian director Satyajit Ray.It is hard to believe that his entire team as well as himself were busy on their first ever film project.According to Ray himself the first half of the movie is not satisfactory as it is in some ways amateurish.The second half however is very fluent.These are his words and although I concur with his analysis I have to say that the first half is also of a high level.The second part however is truly great and even more so when you remember that it is his first movie ever.That the movie was finished is all thanks to the West Bengal Government who saw some parts of it and wanted to finance the rest,since Ray's money was all spend. As said,the first half is a bit slow and incoherent but that doesn't take away it's overall drama and power.Most of the actors were unexperienced but that doesn't really show.All star performances are from Chunibala Devi as the old \"Auntie\" (she died before release),Uma Das Gupta as \"Durga\" and Subir Bannerjee as the young \"Apu\".These two youngsters played only in this movie,I wonder what ever happened to them. My favorite performance comes from Karuna Bannerjee as she plays Durga's and Apu's mother,a very powerful and convincing role it is.The story is about family life in rural Bengal and although there are several great scenes in the movie my favorite one is the scene in which Durga is sick and her mother tries to cure her in the middle of the night while the storm is raging outside.This scene is so realistic that it actually feels that you are there,the chills came over me.The next morning Durga has died and left her mother helpless while the father (played by Kanu Bannerjee) is returning from his voyage in search of money.Another important part of the movie (besides Ray's great directing) is the music of Ravi Shankar,who is best known for his friendship in the late sixties with \"The Beatles\" (listen to \"Within or Without You\" on the legendary album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\").The music can be annoying to some people because of the always present \"Sitar\",but to me it is a necessary add-on to the movie. For me as a film lover this movie was very much an experience since it was the first Indian movie that I say.I've rented the entire trilogy so I can't compare them yet,but I will do so in the comments on the other two. Anyway,as I am a film lover (and future Film student in September) this was a personal must see.After watching it I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy and other Ray movies.9/10 (currently number 61 in my top 100)",

Ironically, I must confess that I had never seen Pather Panchali completely. The several times I started to watch the film, seemingly something arose during those few times and I never got very far into it. However, now in my senescent years, I finally got around to seeing it after realizing that I never had taken the time to see it. Having read about the trilogy and about Satyajit Ray, I look back and wonder why of all the classics I've seen, I'd overlooked these works of Ray. Maybe it was the trauma I experienced 50 years ago at UC Berkeley while taking a year of Sanskrit but I doubt it. I'll only say now I must have been saving it for a treat during my later years. And, what a treat! The film has a languid quality and moves slowly, listfully. The imagery is diffused due to in part the quality of the film but the eye of the camera misses nothing from shots of nature to a kitten stumbling and licking itself, to the old Auntie brushing away flies from her food. The starkness of their poverty does not affect the world of a little boy as it does his frustrated mother and sister. His father, a kind-hearted dreamer, seems resigned to his lot and is willing to take less to keep his sense of life and desire in balance. All of this life trajectory is classic Indian and Ray shows us to us through the camera's eye in a way that is moving, joyous and profound. This is their world and Ray lets us see it through their eyes. Akira Kurasawa called Ray a genius and we guess we could say, it took one to know one.",

They go on, not because they are exceptional, but because they must, because they are human.Ray does a masterful job of capturing the simple joys of childhood, and the ambitions and dreams which make us all human, regardless of where we are. Simple scenes such as a disfigured elderly woman seated on a porch, singing of her approaching death, are very moving. I have never seen the basic elements of life treated with such an incisive yet soft touch as Ray has in this film. It is wonderful to watch in comparison to the broad writing strokes and vulgar generalities of most directing and writing today. At the risk of sounding trite, this is a film which is not merely entertainment or art, but one which reaches into your heart and makes a place for itself there. It belongs there.",

The characters are so true to the ethnic rural-sixties Indian existence that one is compelled to wonder if the film was captured through surveillance cameras. Pather Panchali, released in 1955, is the first film of director Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. The film is a serene and beautiful depiction of a little boy's childhood in the Indian countryside in the 1950s.The film was made on a shoestring budget by a hitherto unknown director. Apart from a seventy-year-old woman who made her name in the 1930s on the stage, none of the cast had ever acted before and many had been plucked from the Indian rurality. In contrast Satyajit Ray completed the trilogy on the behest of the Indian Prime Minister, pointing to the film's cultural impact.It's a quiet, simple tale, centering on the life of a small family living in a rural village in Bengal. The father, Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee), is a priest and poet who cares more about his writing and spiritual welfare than obtaining wages he is owed. The mother, Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), worries that her husband's financial laxity will leave her without enough food for her two children, daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee). Harihar's family often lives on the edge of poverty, coping with the unkind taunts of their neighbors, the burden of caring for an aging aunt (Chunibala Devi), and the terrible aftermath of a natural catastrophe.Most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either Sarbojaya or Durga, and, as a result, we identify most closely with these two. Harihar is absent for more than half of the movie, and, before the penultimate scene, Apu is a mere witness to events, rather than a participant. Until the closing moments, we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual, since he's always in someone else's shadow. The simple story of the Bengali family will definitely stay in my heart for a long time to come. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?........",

Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a \"kash\" field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter? No. His expression and technique was more than sound, although this was a maiden venture. Some critics found(and still find, I might add) the film to be too slow. Satyajit Ray wrote about the slow pace - \"The cinematic material dictated a style to me, a very slow rhythm determined by nature, the landscape, the country. The script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble.\"There you are, if you have not watched this movie, you'll probably missed the greatest movie made on Indian rural life.

I am not the sort of person who even remotely feels like crying during movies, but this one had me weeping like a child.Magnus.",

            "content": "Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.",

            "content": "Growing up in India I had heard of this movie as one of Satyajit Ray's classics and a movie which showed the utter poverty of rural India. Anything classic used to evoke a feeling of a movie usually boring and worse it's most likely would be a black and white film lamenting on the sorry state of human affairs. Of course those were the childhood metrics to gauge what a good film should be and thankfully I have outgrown those notions. Nevertheless I wanted to watch this movie when Satyajit Ray died in 1992 and once again media was talking about his movies. But somehow I didn't have access to this movie anywhere (those days of VHS tapes).I watched this movie recently and was in a stunned mode throughout the span of movie. What an emotional roller coaster ride this had been and it has been done without even making you feel that it's a movie, it's just seems real life happening in front of your eyes. I don't want to describe much the story here(as other have already commented much) but more of what I felt watching (re-watching)this movie. The beautiful and poetic flow of this movie is so smooth that you sort of start living the life as depicted. This movie conveys the reality of hard life but with such gracefulness that you don't feel utterly bad or depressed rather you start contemplating about your existence and the beauty in such mundane things that we tend to ignore. This film gives you the moment, the pause, that forces you to reflect on the meaning of life. There were many moments in the film which touched the heart in many ways: - Durga and Apu's longing for sweets and following the \"misty kaka\" (candy man) in hope. - Old Aunt's happiness on such small things as getting a stolen fruit, couple of stolen chillies, etc. - Mom's inner strength on managing on in a hopeless situation and shattering of it with Durga's death. - Father's wail on hearing the fate of Durga... - Apu's instinctive hiding of the truth about Durga's theft.I am fascinated and surely will watch the other two movies in the trilogy...",

            "review_title": "A film of Quiet Perspective and Natural Beauty.",
            "content": "\"Pather Panchali\", Satyajit Ray's debut film about life in a Bengali village, was the first movie from India to gain wide recognition and acclaim in the west. It is an affecting story of a rural family struggling to deal with poverty and tragedy in their ancestral home. Ray adapted the script from Bibhuti Bihushaw Banerjee's semi-autobiographical novel of the same title and retells it with natural beauty and a quiet perspective. The filmmaker, who came from a literary and artistic background(He was a product of the Indian Renaissance) was interested in the contemporary problems of his country-and he shared with the Neorealist films from Italy- a simple and direct approach to making movies. Ray created ordinary scenes that were incredibly life-like. His films contained very few strains of artifice. He believed that the raw material of cinema was life itself. Ray generally concentrated on small subjects and ordinary people. He favored using non-actors and shooting on location to heighten the realism. He made films in his own style; dignified and subtle; sincere and with a conscience. In \"Pather Panchali\" (Song of the Little Road\") Ray makes superb use of his milieu. The viewer immediately feels the cramped conditions of the families' decaying house and the open-air confines of the surrounding forest. When Ray sends his camera beyond the village, the observer can sense the allure and freedom of the vast fields that spring immodestly from a thin, winding trail. Rays' was a cinema of thought and feeling, in which emotion was deliberately restrained because it is so strong. This restraint adds to the psychological intensity in his work. Nearly all of his films are marked by this remarkable depth of feeling. \"Pather Panchali\", the first installment of the Apu Trilogy(\"Aparajito\" and \"The World of Apu\" would follow) depicts a young boy (Apu) exploring his ever-expanding universe with a growing sense of wonder. Ray excelled at showing how children and adolescents confront mystery and joy; sadness and death. The director shows Apu's burgeoning awareness with a masterful use of the long shot. High-angled, distant shots track Apu and his older sister Durga, as they run spiritedly through white-kashed fields. This sense of discovery gives the film it's emotional power. The director's main subject was India-it's customs and culture. It's conflicts between the traditional way of life and the impact and influence of the West. He tried arduously to capture this synthesis between western ideas and traditional Hindu values. His concern for human problems and not issues of national politics gave his films universal appeal. \"Pather Panchali\" delineates the small joys and acute sorrows of a poor Indian family. It is an endearing testament that poverty does not nullify love and that even the most afflicted person can find some modest pleasures in their world. The film's indigenous sound track is vital to Ray's story of ancestral limitations. Twanging ektaras, wailing tarshehnais and six-stringed sitars resound liberally throughout the movie. It would be difficult to imagine \"Pather Panchali\" without it's memorable score. Satyajit Ray was an unpretentious filmmaker. He was genuinely uninterested in commercial considerations. His films were life-affirming, authentic and honest; gentle and poetic- truthful observations on human behavior that employed simple but strong themes. Ray's unadorned style of film-making was intimate, probing, and revealing. (Possible spoiler) The final scene shows the grieving family leaving their home in an ox-driven carriage to begin a new life. A trailing camera in medium close-up captures a compelling mixture of emotions on their faces. Expressions of pain and resolution; hope and despair; the future and the past. A seemingly simple yet unmistakably powerful scene that typifies Satyajit Ray's profound cinema. A cinema of gentle but deep observation, understanding and unabashed love of the human race.",

There is the symbol of true oriental artist...\" i think it best describes Ray's work where he suggests in his cinema enormous reserves of power and feelings which never spill into emotional displays.the strength and variety of the cinematic craftsmanship in this film can be explored endlessly, but what strikes me the most, is the way his work has confirmed, sustained and nurtured the existence of an art form, western in origin, transplanted and taking root in Indian soil. in a way pather panchali is so 'rooted'. it is so earthy and 'regional' at core and may be thats why its 'international', may be thats why, despite being the product of its time and place it is universal in its appeal. the moods and moments that he creates are simply 'matchless'. so simple, and yet so profound. the Indir Thakuran sequences of the film remain for me the highest, noblest and rare expression of art in Indian films so far (except films by Ghatak and Mrinal Sen) The film induces a kind of contemplation and a sense of wonder, about the truth, individual and privet. almost without you being aware of it it opens windows to the truth that lies within and beyond the boundaries of cinema itself.",

After all, Parallel Cinema (also called 'New Indian Cinema') is India's answer to this style of film which uses real folks (non actors) in realistic situations.

Heck, it's currently the highest rated Indian film on IMDB....yet I just didn't like it. I felt the film was very, very slow and I had a hard time focusing on the story...mostly because there really wasn't much of one. These people are very poor, generally miserable and it just felt oppressive.Just because I didn't like this film doesn't mean I won't try the other two films in Ray's 'Apu Trilogy'...but I felt disappointed by this one and I really wanted to like the movie...but didn't.By the way, I've probably reviewed at least a couple hundred Indian films....so it's not like I don't enjoy their pictures nor Ray's work.

For various reasons it is most definitely that - a masterpiece.Ray started making this film in 1950 and finally completed it in '54. The problem? Lack of a financial backer. The reasons for this were two: 1)Ray was an unknown in the film-making business and 2)his ideas for the film were deemed unworkable in terms of catering to a paying audience. However, Ray persevered and managed to obtain the financing from the local West Bengal Govt. and in the process changed the face of Indian cinema forever (and it needed some changing too).This is a miraculous film if one is to look at what had preceded it in India and most of what has come after. It is sensitive to the ambiance of rural Bengal (which is brought out oh so beautifully by the graceful photography and the musical score of Ravi Shankar) and it is - unlike most Indian cinema - honest and tender to its rustic characters without a shade of any patronising or exploitative element. The result is a beautiful, warm, languid film that truly captures the essence of village life in Bengal in a celluloid form that any movie-goer the world over will be able to not only appreciate, but more importantly, love.The acting is stunning considering a lot of non-actors were used here - a la De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief', an inspiration according to Ray. I must mention the lady who plays Chunibala - you will not find a role better executed in cinema. A prostitute in her younger days, Ray tracked her down at the local Red Light District where she was living with her daughter. Ray was always an expert at picking the right man for the role and then prodding them along till they produced near-perfect performances on screen and this film is no different.This is a landmark film for Indian cinema in so many ways - the first time in India that shooting happened almost entirely outdoors, the first time someone with any knowledge of the film medium and film-making the world over handled a camera, the first time that actors acted naturally instead of the melodrama-infused performances that were and still are the norm in Indian cinema. Keeping everything surrounding the film in mind, and then watching the film for the beautiful journey that it is - makes you realise just how immense this work is. A remarkable tour-de-force. A triumph of cinema in a truly hostile environment for intelligent film-making.",

            "content": "Exotic (Adjective)- 1. Strangely Beautiful THE GENRE Ray developed a language of his own through the Apu trilogy- a slow, lush, languid, lyrical language reminiscent of enchanting poetry in the most maudlin and mundane circumstances. He didn't ostracize poverty nor did he glamorize it, He didn't exploit it but merely romanticized it. He found romance and beauty in the most hideous of circumstances. It was like a pain that was so severe that the agony became sweet, a sore so deep that its anguish felt sensuous. Like death- so terrifying that it's freeing, exonerating. It's the kind of erotic pain one feels in the muscles after a hard day's work. You want to laugh at the pain almost with contempt and with a condescending, patronizing attitude, never realizing that it is your own pain that you're laughing at. But you want to wallow in it all the same because you think that it'll make you more profound and hence you're thankful for it having been bestowed upon you THE TREATMENT Ray gave an explanation to the people who have a problem with the pacing of the film by saying that the slow rambling rhythm of the film was a clue to the subject matter itself, as villages in rural Bengal do, in fact, ramble. Pather Panchali has numerous colloquial anecdotes in chaste Bengali but despite the localized context, the message of the film is universal because pain and suffering knows no boundaries- they transcend and pervade our hearts, overcoming mythical barriers of race, religion, nationality, language, time, place and other such superfluous demographic constraints. Pather Panchali is ultimately a comment on the indomitable insubordination of the human soul THE POETRY Ray is rather unforgiving in his vision. He chooses stark landscapes sans an iota of conventional beauty and surrounds his world with equally pathetic and ugly faces but he finds a beauty amongst them that is so pristine and divine. He literally hears the beating of a heart in the throbbing of a wound. The small moments- a torn bed sheet (torn, mind you and thereby being an article that if placed in any other film, would conventionally arouse feelings of sadness but not in Pather Panchali for here that very article becomes a magnificent artifact) through which Apu's eyes can be seen for the first time when we see him as a child. It assumes an artistic expression of its own. The kaleidoscope becomes a voyeuristic instrument, enabling a glimpse into the world of fantasy albeit one that is decidedly and inexplicably, out of their reach. The simple act of following a sweetmeat seller and the hope of eventually extracting some savories from him or from the house he's selling them to, becomes a 'chase sequence', the tragic mood uplifted by the lilting Sitar music by Ravi Shankar. We feel victorious when Durga is given sweets by her young friend right under the disapproving gaze of her bitter mother. THE TRAGEDY 'Song of the little road' is a joyous journey through a road of unbearable suffering. Tragedies are many- the death of the aunt being the first moment, Apu's first encounter with death. Whether he fully comprehends the situation or not is debatable but the indelible impression of this one incident on his nubile mind, is not. Then, the second tragedy- the death of Durga, Apu's sister and his best friend is even more heartbreaking than the earlier tragedy simply because of the higher shock value it has. Durga is in many ways the protagonist of this film. Apu is merely a bystander who observes rather than experiences most situations in this film. It is Durga- playful and protective, child and woman, innocent and naughty- so captivating is Uma Dasgupta's performance that the viewer falls in love with the character and therefore cannot quite accept her death in the film. Why she was here just a few moments ago- playing carelessly in the rain with Apu and then, suddenly, nature seems to have defeated her but isn't there a lesson in that? The lesson being that it took death to conquer her undying spirit, for she wouldn't have succumbed to her circumstances while alive. It's as if she was saying- \"You may take my life away but you'll never conquer my spirit\". Her presence wraps the film like a halo and she is enshrined forever in the viewer's hearts. Another exemplary sequence is the one where Durga and Apu run out of their house to watch the trains go by. The haunting look in Apu's utterly captivated eyes touch the viewer. Steam Engines, like the kaleidoscope, are again a symbol of movement and fantasy and yearning for an outside world and these symbols of change and freedom become even more evident when seen within the startling paradoxical context of their waking existence of stillness in their never changing lives that they partake everyday like bonded labor. The difference between Yesterday and Today is barely discernible in their village where life follows the hum drum of a set pattern. So set that it's almost a sacred ritual. THE INSIGHTS Relentless in its pursuit of reality, Pather Panchali is a neo real masterpiece. I have been fortunate enough to have visited the actual location where Pather Panchali had been shot. The landscape is still the same, still as barren, the sons and daughters of the villages still look like Apu and Durga, Ray's voice still seems to resonate through the hollow tree barks and Ravi Shankar's soulful Sitar strings still peek from behind the antediluvian cobblestones. Because just like an old painting, the colors may have dried and got slightly discolored, but Ray's impeccable genius is still visible through the Gothic canvas.",

Part three, \"The World of Apu,\" seems a bit flawed by sentimentality and overly melodramatic qualities, but is still a masterpiece, if a more minor one. \"Pather Panchali\" is visual and moral poetry, and provides enough thought-provoking material to last a lifetime--or more.  Meditation on the human truths exposed in these three films can be a very salutary thing. Satyajit Ray was one of the very great moral-centered filmmakers--which is not to say he's preachy or condescending, just the opposite: he does what great dramatists have always done from the Greeks through Shakespeare and onward, which is to search the human soul, compassionately revealing its weaknesses and strengths so that each member of the audience, if attentive, may learn more about himself or herself.What nobler purpose could drama, or film, serve?  It's a joy to see this done, and a privilege to witness the work of such a master.",

            "content": "I approached this movie with as much hesitation and trepidation as I would approach a book by Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche or music by Beethoven or Mozart or movies by Fellini or Kurosawa. I mean, you just can't watch a Satyajit Ray movie as if you are watching 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' or 'Wedding Crashers', especially when the movie is listed in all possible 'all time great' movies.'Pather Panchali' translates as 'Song of the road' and what a beautiful sonnet it turns out to be ! I have never seen before anywhere such beautiful portrayal of village life of India. As a master artist Ray has painted a poem on the canvas of celluloid. The beauty lies in the depiction of characters that are so real, I felt as if I am not watching a movie but actually living with them. Not a slightest of melodrama (that Indian movies are famous for), the movie is all about how life flourishes amidst extreme destitute. Its not the words, but the eyes tell the story. Eyes tell the story of joy and wondering of Apu, adolescent curiosity of his sister, forlornness and disappointment of his mother, hope of his father and prayers of his old wizened aunt.For me the most moving performance was given by the stooped wrinkled woman playing the old aunt who is waiting to die but wishing to live everyday fully. It reminds so much of our old grandmothers. And yet her death scene was shown so realistically without any histrionics, that you won't have anything but praise for the director.As some one said every frame of the movie is a work of genius. Be the births and deaths in the family, or the discovery of train or watching a musical, every scene is worth remembering. Top of that the soothing background score is heartwarming, thanks to Ravi Shankar. However, the best scene of the movie for me is where Apu finds the stolen beads in her dead sister's closet and disposes it surreptitiously to preserve her dignity.Only complaint that I have is, that it lacked a narrative story. May be it is just a prelude to the complete tale. Now, I so want to watch the other two movies of Apu trilogy.(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)",

            "content": "I don't even think myself as someone who could write comment on Satyajit Ray's movie. But I have to tell people what I feel about this movie Pathar Panchali. Let me ask you a simple question have you ever been 'moved' emotionally? Well! If you have! Then you know what I am talking about, but you haven't been then I am sure you want try that out. Watch this movie and then you will know. Pathar Panchali is a very different movie and is not about romance, wealth, beautiful faces, relationships, cars, computers and cellphones. Not about bombs, wars, jails, science, space and fiction or whatever. The movie is the first one in famous Apu Trilogy and is about a poor brahmin family in West Bengal (India). It is an story of a girl in this family, how she grew up among in a poverty stricken family and never had a chance to all things (garland of fake pearls, dolls, candies, bi-scope and hair oil) a girl kid deserves. She grew up a very good girl despite the fact she never went to school. Her brother was born when she was about 5-6 and she loved him a lot. Her plays with her villages girls were very well done. The scenes when one of her friend got married were wonderful and show that how mature she was in her thinking that she is never going to get married was more than a reality. The story captures real moments (hard to describe here!) from a typical poor family in India when (1955) it was not even a decade since India got independence. Poverty was a real issue in India during 1955 and it was Ray's vision to capture it in his movies for generations to see after hundreds of years later what India has come out of today when Bollywood makes $10bn budget movies and they fail to even break-even on box office.Its amazing that Ray had a vision of making such movies when rest of the country was struggling to survive. These movies are really really low cost movies and are example of pure intellectual work. When I was one of the Italian movie \"La Strada\" then I thought that perhaps it is the only movie which comes close to Pathar Panchali.I would say all three movies in Apu Trilogy (Pathar Panchali, Aparajito and Apu Sansar) are great jewels in Indian cinema and they will continue to amaze people for hundreds of years. If you haven't watch them then you will never know what a true will looks likes. It moves you! No kidding! Pathar Panchali is really a best human document ever produced.",

And then the young boy, Apu, who goes to school and gets to learn to read and write. Living with the family at times is their elderly aunt.At insistence from his wife, Harihar gets a job, but only gets paid after three months. His wife is concerned about the lack of maintenance work at their home, but his reply always is that there is no money. But, incidentally, enough money for his tobacco. He eventually realizes that he must increase his income and leaves to find work in a large town.Months go by without a word from him, the family runs out of food and the wife has to sell her precious silverware to get food. When the husband eventually arrives back home, he was in for an unpleasant surprise...The film has many elements: it highlights the huge difference between how men and women were treated. A boy gets preferential treatment, gets to go to school and gets better food than his female siblings. The girls stay at home to assist their mothers with housekeeping chores. The film also effectively shows the dynamics between the poor and the very poor.This kind of subject matter can easily be sentimentalized, but it is handled with restraint. The natural cast is amazing, the black and white cinematography and sound track excellent. A masterpiece. 9/10.",

            "content": "Clearly influenced by Italian neorealism, this is the simple story of a small family living in poverty in rural Bengal. The backstory behind the film is quite impressive; it was director Satyajit Ray's first, and done with an incredibly low budget, inexperienced crew, and amateur actors. The result is often stunning. There are some truly beautiful scenes in the natural surroundings where the family live, and the cinematography is wonderful. The family members are striking as well, starting with the grandmother (Chunibala Devi), who with her withered face and stooped back, has quite an appearance. Devi portrays the character with inner fire and depth, and it was sad to read she passed away at 80 before the film was released. The little boy, Apu (Subir Banerjee) also looks out on the world he is growing up in with such beautiful eyes.Despite the film being the first in the 'Apu Trilogy', the film really centers on the mother (Karuna Banerjee), who is the bedrock of the family. She keeps it together while the husband (Kanu Banerjee) pursues idealistic dreams, often not taking their economic condition seriously enough. She deals with her neighbors, who criticize her daughter (Runki Banerjee and Uma Dasgupta) for stealing fruit, and also her parenting. She accepts her own broken dreams (\"I had lots of dreams too. All the things I wanted to do...\"), and handles the sadness which comes their way. While I appreciated the film's beauty, and the fact that it transported me into this impoverished little world, it was a little too quiet for my taste. There are some moving events and it finishes strong, but too much of it was mundane along the way. Perhaps Ray simply captures this little world perfectly, without pretense and completely realistically, which artistically is saying something, and what resonates so strongly with most critics. If that's what you're looking for, this is your film. As an alternative, I personally liked a couple of his later films better (Charulata (1964), and The Coward (1965)), which you might consider.",

It seems, Ray came across this Novel 'Pather Panchali' by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay and became obsessed by making it into a movie. He had to face a lot of hardships but was somehow able to fulfill his dream. And what a debut it is. Each character and each scene is so real that this is not just realist cinema but reality itself.I always wonder how Ray got those performances out of children. No one seems to be acting or performing and yet it is so entertaining. Apu with a cardboard crown trying to copy that character from the play he watches, Durga trying to comprehend a telegraph pole, a stray dog following Durga and Apu as they follow the sweat vendor are scenes that make you wonder how did Ray got these so perfect. And he uses elements of nature to accentuate each of his scenes so well that each scene is complete in itself.I won't say the obvious like \"it's a masterpiece\" or \"it's a classic\" or \"it's brilliant\" because everyone has started using these terms for almost anything these days.

            "content": "Somewhere between the Oriental placidity of a great Yasujiro Ozu film and the harsh reality of a great Vittorio De Sica film lies the world of Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali, the first of his Apu Trilogy of films. And in case there was any doubt, that place is a very, very good one for any filmmaker to be, for the two aforementioned filmmakers were masters of their own sorts of films, and- if this one, and first, film of Ray's is an indication, the same plaudits can be ascribed to Ray, a former advertising firm's employee who struck out on his own to raise Indian cinema from the melodramatic doldrums it had been in since its creation.This almost two hour long black and white film, made in 1955, was not only Ray's debut in the medium, but the first 'serious' film in Indian history- at least that made by an Indian. It is no surprise that Ray, a Bengali, made his film in his part of India- funded by the provincial government of West Bengal, away from the more commercial films of what would later be called Bollywood. The film's English subtitle is Song Of The Little Road, but this is a bit of a nonsequitur since the film is based on a novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, and the only road with any prominence in the film is a recurring hagiography of a local set of railroad tracks. Some websites claim that the title connotes the subtitle, and that Pather, in Bengali, means of a path, and Panchali means a kind of Bengal song; however, other sites and critics dispute this claim. The tale is set in the early 20th Century, although the film never specifies a date- at least not in the white English subtitles of the Artificial Eye DVD The Apu Trilogy three pack, which includes the other two films, as well: Aparajito and The World Of Apu.Like the Italian Neo-Realist films of De Sica, Ray relied on an excellent script (adapted by Ray, from the novel) and amateur actors, for the most part, to pull the film off. A low budget made 'big' scenes an impossibility, but Ray shows off, in this film, some nice touches with the camera that cost nothing but a few minutes of cogitation. These skills all led to international praise of the film in many quarters, and a special award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.The plot of the tale is rather simple, and easily conveyed, but this film is a great example of how merely recapitulating or summing up a plot utterly does an injustice to the deeper and greater story....Pather Panchali is a truly great film; it is not only a classic of its native land, but of the very art form of film. And, as mentioned, it not only derives its power from Italian Neo-Realism, but also from the diurnal do of Yasujiro Ozu's films. Ozu is another filmmaker who has been criticized as dull and tedious, but both men are keen observers of their fictive worlds. In those realms the flicker of an eyebrow can have greater consequence than an army brigade's assault on an enemy. Yet, to the viewer not yet weaned off of the Lowest Common Denominator, such moments are not even noticed. I only wish that Satyajit Ray, who died in 1992, was still around to know that his film was yet influencing more people in the positive way all great art does, but realize, as he surely did, that he need not be, for great art always and eventually fills out the places the human body gives way to. In watching Pather Panchali, one gets a sense of Satyajit Ray, as he was. Go know him.",

This is such a subtle, graphic portrayal of life in India in the Fifties (an probably today). In a small village, a family is just barely keeping going. A man, his wife, and their two children live on a subsistence level, trying not to starve. He is a man of honor and, on the word of a neighbor that his family was owed money, has given over an orchard to them. This may or may not be true. Now when his daughter steals a bit of fruit from the orchard, she is branded a thief. The man is an idealist. He is a poet and playwright who is optimistic that his work will be published or performed. Meanwhile, he works for nothing, trusting his employer to give him back wages. The family lives on handfuls of rice, also looking out for an ancient aunt. They are shunned by neighbors. The wife takes on the huge burden of the family, respecting the wishes of her husband, but knowing that he is a hopeless romantic. Apu, for whom the trilogy is named, is a little boy who manages to kee constantly on the move. He is sensitive and hard to read. His sister realizes that her peers will get married and have a better life, but she is convinced this will never happen for her (their economic state pretty much assures this.). This film is technically magnificent. Ray does things with the camera that are so on point. The black and white photography is stunning. His close-ups of the locals are masterful. We live and die with the family, hoping things will get better. The father is sort of Hindu priest who goes to another city to perform a religious ceremony for a rich man and disappears for over five months. Upon his return he is devastated by horrible news. The story of this family will now move on to another place for Part 2. It is as much about the human spirit as any film I've seen.",

Widely regarded as India's best movie, it is a major cultural landmark. It made an instant superstar out of Satyajit Ray. Despite the frequency of scenes depicting mundane life for a family of four peasants in India, \"Pather Panchali\" really packs an emotional punch.It is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's 1929 Bengali novel. Apu (Subir Banerjee), a young boy, is the protagonist. In one of his earliest scenes, we wonder if he will wake up to face the day. Apu has a naughty older sister Durga (Uma Das Gupta). Durga's habitual lying and stealing causes conflicts with the neighbors. Sarbojaya Ray (Karuna Bannerjee), mother of Apu and Dirga, is frustrated with her daughter's ways but must defend her from accusation. The patriarch, Harihar Ray (Kanu Bannerjee) is emotionally distant from the troubles of the other three family members. He's a priest earning meager wages during the work day. At night he cheerfully writes poetry, plays and stories with the optimism his artistry can wipe out his family's debt. Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi) is the very old (80) aunt who also annoys the matriarch. The needy old woman is the picture of misery. (While Chunibala Devi died before the film was released, Ray had visited her and showed her an early version.)\"Pather Panchali\" was controversial at the time for its unflinching depiction of villagers experiencing bone-crushing poverty. Destitution is weighing everyone down, like gravity. There are scenes where characters eat rice with their fingers from a bowl on the floor and it feels like you have been transported to rural India. Yet the peasants are mostly stoic, and inspiring for how they generally cope with their burdens.Two performances really strike a chord. Karuna Bannerjee as the beleaguered, fatigued mother trying to discipline as well as hold her family together is amazing to watch. When she mentions during one moment of despair that she used to have dreams of a better life it really pulls heartstrings. Uma Das Gupta as Apu's naughty sister Dirga is also very memorable. The mother and daughter roles are both exquisitely realized. The 34-year-old novice director (Satyajit Ray) started his career at a very elite level.Ray begins the film with many scenes that are dark, even though the family seems to be prospering. When Fate has dealt the family a bad hand, the scenes are well lit and occasionally, in deep focus. The lighting pattern is counter to how many filmmakers would have approached the material. In addition, the conclusion is foreshadowed. Notice how often one character seems to occasionally stumble or falter. Regarding the music, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\u200b's score adds authenticity and depth to the narrative. Shankar's music is very highly regarded among film critics. It also inspired George Harrison about a decade later.For those who see \"Pather Panchali\" on the big screen, expect to emerge from the theater a changed and wiser person. Satyajit Ray demonstrates the world is available to a young artist who hasn't given his soul to the dark side.",

            "content": "For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives \u2013 one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.",

            "review_title": "A flawed, but rich slice of neo-Gothic.(possible spoiler in last paragraph)",
            "content": "'Panchali' has been acclaimed for its Renoir-like naturalism, but the tale it tells is as close to Gothic as  'Toni'.  The noble family in decline, the crumbling family house, the steady, overpowering incremence of nature onto civilisation, the generational conflict where the hopes of youth are tainted with decadence of the past, the climactic storm scene that brings everything to a head.  These are all staples of the Gothic story, and although the world of the film blazes in an intolerable sun, the film itself is shrouded in ominous, often impenetrable shadows (although, admittedly, the print I saw was very saturated).  But this is not a study of an old, fat, corrupt, European country hobbling on its last legs, the usual subject of classic Gothic, but a newly emergent nation less than a decade old.  Is the film, like most Gothic fiction, an allegory for the nation?  Ray doesn't make hammering political points - there are references to a neighbouring landlord who probably conned the gullible family of land; there is the bizarre and comic sight of impoverished elders in tatty British uniforms playing a discordant brass version of 'It's a long way to Tipperary'.  The hideous old crone for whom Durga steals fruit, and whose presence exasperates her mother, is called India - it is tempting to see her age, her expulsion, her constant need for water, her enlisting the young in dangerous schemes to feed her, her abandonment, her lonely death by a stream, as some kind of allegorical reading, but of what?  Certainly, throughout, Ray is constantly pushing his realism further than mere observation, so that scenes that seem simply to record a way of life are pregnant with hidden meanings.  For instance, the harrowing depiction of poverty is frequently disrupted by spectacle and play, from the children's games to the theatrical melodramas that enrapture Apu.  Even Ray's style continually, disarmingly changes registers, alternating calm, distant compositions with urgent sequences broken up by strange angles, choppy editing, heightened music and sound.  The film's structure seems to embody this duality between realism and the figurative.  The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature.  It is full of rich characterisation, even comedy, and full of set-pieces that reveal character and society.  The second half, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical.  There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action.  The nature that had been encroaching on civilisation spills over in these sequences, with stunning montages that recall Dovzhenko.  The whole film feels slower, more meaningful and monumental (and sometimes duller).  My favourite sequences are in this half, the discovery of the road and railway, the possibility of another life; the silent roaming through a beautiful, dwarfing landscape that recalls the mysticism of the Archers' 'A Canterbury Tale'.  This clash between nature and the home is expressed in the immediate terms of children growing up, their senses (and sensuality) awakening, seeing clearly the flaws of much-vaunted tradition.  The film is very acute about gender, to the point of schematism; the dependence of the culture on servile, worn-down women, the charming, irresponsibility of men, the doom of any girl who might seek independence (figures who quickly (or maybe always were) types).  The fate of Durga, after her sprightly impishness at the beginning is heartbreaking.  The film is also a sophisticated analysis of modes of representation and the nature of cinema, of looking, linked to social control - Apu's entrance, where, after a lengthy build-up, he returns the observing eye, is as shocking and exhilarating as 'Un Chien Andoulu'.",

Everything was shot in un-improvable fashion, from the marriage arrangements at the rich neighbours' house to the wrinkles on the old aunt's face.The second thing is that Ray's passion for the story comes through so clearly. I heard he gave up his job, and pawned his wife's jewelry to make this movie, but still did not have enough. He apparently kept on wondering if he would be able to make the movie before the boy who played Apu grew up or Chunibala Devi, the old aunt died.The beauty of the story grew on me over subsequent viewings.

Maybe it's a delusion, maybe it's wishful thinking, maybe it's really there, that soul of the light impression. Sadly, it's extremely hard to digest. For a local, or anybody familiar with the culture and life, things might be more than obvious with the flowers or the interactions based on outer appearance. For me it was a search in the dark. Does the little girl praying to the showered flower means she {the character} is improvising hoping for the better? Or is it a ready-made formula of good luck? Does she look forward for a marriage because her friend and neighbor did it? Does she look forward as a way to help her mother and brother ease on spending thinking one less mouth to feed? Does she want to marry well to escape the poverty? By her actions it seems less plausible. But maybe she wants to have someone to help her family. Or something else. As I have written - for a local it must be quite clear. If not from the scene itself, maybe from the context. For me it just raised questions.

It can be informative, because we learn a bit about how their day-to-day lives look, but it's not what I would call enjoyable. Pather Panchali takes us through a handful of years in the life of an Indian family that is struggling to provide food and shelter for their children. It is a big slice-of-life drama that doesn't exactly follow a narrative, but hits on some of the highlights (or should I say lowlights) of their menial existence. Watching the film reminded me of when missionaries visit my church and show a video. While seeing their simple lives in these remote parts of the world, it does give me a strong appreciation for all I have, and it also makes me extremely grateful that I don't have to spend time in places like that. However, Pather Panchali takes me right there and keeps me in that place for more than two hours.Pather Panchali is clearly an accurate reflection of life for people in these desperate parts of the world, but that makes it somewhat unpleasant for me to watch for long. I don't find any pleasure in seeing people suffer, and the more the movie made the characters likeable, the more I hated to watch them struggle. The other thing that didn't work for me in Pather Panchali are the slow silent moments. There are times when the film halts any dialogue, and not much at all happens as we stare at a person walking or a breeze blowing through the trees. I hate to say it, but for a film that feels so personal and authentic, I was bored a lot. Then when things started happening again it was more disappointment or agony for our main characters. I can see how others might embrace Pather Panchali because there is nothing inherently bad in the way the film is made, and it feels like it could be documentary footage, but it was fairly tough for me to watch.",

            "content": "Part one of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy which concludes with Aparajito and Apur Sansar, Pather Panchali (literally translated as 'Song Of The Little Road') is a Bengali masterpiece and the film that introduced the master filmmaker to the world. Made on a shoestring budget, it focuses on the struggles of a poverty-stricken Bengali family seen through the eyes of their smallest child Apu (played by Subir Bannerjee). The film came about when Ray was illustrating a new edition of Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's novel, and the idea of writing a film script occurred to him as he admired the lyrical writing and honest depiction of a struggling family. Ray assisted Jean Renoir as he shot his film The River and suggested the idea to him, to which Renoir reacted with enthusiastic encouragement.The film follows the Ray family as they go about their day-to-day lives in a small, rural village in Bengal. The mother Sarbujaya (Karuna Bannerjee) carries the weight of the burden, seemingly forever cleaning and working and living off the land. The father Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) helps out doing odd jobs and mostly working away, chasing back payments he has not received from his landlord boss. Durga (Uma Das Gupta) is the teenage daughter who seems to have a weakness for petty theft and has something of a reputation in the village. The grandmother Indir (Chunibala Devi) spends her time stealing food from her daughter and wandering the village. Watching over everything is the most recent arrival Apu, who sees everything with a wide-eyed innocence and remains generally silent throughout the film. By the way, the mother, father and Apu are all played by actors with the surname Bannerjee, although they are not related.One of Ray's key influences to filmmaking are the great films of Italian neo-realism, such as Vittorio De Sica's masterpiece The Bicycle Thieves and Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City. It is evident here, as the film has the same visual poetry and social realism, as well as the ability to transport the viewer into a world that they most likely have never, and will never, experience first hand. It is a fascinating insight into how some people of Bengal had to live during this period, and their social attitudes. When Durga is accused of stealing a necklace from one the village children, the women of the village form a kind of posse to confront her mother, accusing her of being unable to raise her children correctly. The family have conflicting attitudes to the rogue- ish grandmother who spends her time almost begging for clothing to keep her warm; the mother looks down on her as a leech, yet the children, especially Durga, look upon her as a lovable character, and someone they can always seek comfort in.It's a film dominated by outstanding performances. Devi was discovered by Ray living in a brothel, having previously starred in two films in her heyday. She is lovable and tragic, and her performance here would become her swansong, at the age of 80. Tragically she died of influenza before the film was released but she will be immortalised for her portrayal here. Karuna Bannerjee is also a standout, switching from sadness to joy to tragedy with effortless conviction, especially during the third act of the film where the family struggles to hold out during monsoon season, where her home risks being ripped apart by the torrential rain and wind. The biggest star of the show, however, is Ray himself, creating a multi-layered film of visual poetry and gorgeous cinematography, with very little funding for his project. He would go on to be one of world cinema's most creatively successful and critically acclaimed directors, making over 30 features in a 35-year career. At the start of filming, Ray had never directed anything in his life, the camera had never shot a film, and the majority of the actors has never acted in front of the camera. Absolutely outstanding stuff, and deserves it's place amongst the world's greatest films.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture.Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is.Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema.This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy.On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble.Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: \"Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.\"",

Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future.Just like \"Jalsaghar\", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, \"perceived\" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life \u2013\u00a0bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered.There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.",

            "content": "Pather Panchali or \"Song of the Little Road\" is a Bengali film dealing with Life and poverty engulfed in social realism , and is rightly stated as an eloquent cinematic masterpiece . Life is a long journey which consists of many ups and downs , and this is exactly what this movie is all about . Satyajit Ray commenced his journey with this film . It has a unique essence in it , a sense of peace . Influenced from Italian Neorealism , this movie reflects life in rural Bengal during the early 20th Century . The viewers dive into this small yet beautiful world through the eyes of Apu , and partly through the eyes of Durga .Satyajit Ray perfectly captures the beauty of life through the elements of relationships and bonds , elements of Nature , and the narrative which drives effortlessly forward .While it uphelds the beauty of life , it never ignores the pain and miseries that come with it . It teaches us to find solace in small little things because life really is unpredictable . Who thought that a film regarding the day-to-day life of a simple poor family could reflect such a moral that cannot be captured by any other story-driven material . Perhaps that is why this film is eternal and internationally well acclaimed .From a technical point , the camera movements were commendable , and addition of background music at key scenes made the impact greater and over-all added to the peaceful essence of the movie . The editing is good too , the film is slow-paced but never feels dragged . A two hours runtime is more or less perfect.The movie excels on it's Characterisation. Each and every character represents a shade of life , each and every one of them shares a bond . As an Art film , this movie relies on relationships between the family members , but it neither stresses on it nor forces or spoon-feeds the viewers about the love they share among each other . It's beautiful because it gives us freedom - the freedom to feel the movie , the freedom to understand what it tries to convey , the freedom to fall in love with the movie.",

Basically it is the 1920s in Bengal, in the village Nischindipur, and the story focuses on the impoverished Ray family. Wife and mother Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee) takes care of the home and the two children while husband and father Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) earns the meagre money from being a priest. Sarbojaya finds living in the home hard when she has to share it with very old, toothless and hunchbacked cripple sister-in-law Indirtharkun (Chunibala Devi), especially when accepting stolen fruit from her children. Sarbojaya's children, daughter Durga (Runki Bannerjee and Uma Dasgupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee) have a close relationship, and they enjoy sitting quietly under trees, chasing a candy seller, running about through the surrounding Kaash fields, and catching a glimpse of the passing trains. After many irritations with the fruit stealing and just being around, Aunt Indir is found dead in the bushes, and Harihar meanwhile is travelling abroad to find a better paying job. While he is gone the family sink further into poverty, with Sarbojaya becoming lonely, and worse, Durga develops a cold and fever from rainfall, from which she dies. When Harihar returns home he and Sarbojaya burst into tears because of Durga's death, and in the end, Apu finds a necklace that Durga denied stealing, which he throws in the pond, and they all ride away to their new destination. Also starring Tulsi Chakraborty as Schoolmaster. The performances are all very well done considering that the cast consists of non-professional actors, and the story combined with good Indian music and a marvellous director make this great drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!",

            "content": "The movie 'Panther Panchali' is the best movie I have ever seen in Indian film industry and also one of the prolific one in the International film industry. Panther Panchali describes the world from the view point of a young child with dreams, imagination, interpretation of the world around him and his encounters with reality through the characters around him and the surrounding. This makes the movie a well balanced mixture of revelations of realism and the imagery interpretation of that realism through the mind and eyes of a young child Apu. This very fact also provides the film with a simplicity and flow that is very striking while at the same time bringing out the hopes and sadness, happiness and struggle of a newly emergent nation, primarily rural society based, still struggling and striving to raise itself to a higher level. It is reality interspersed and woven through imagination and hope, the striving for a betterment, the eternal flow of the path of life through hopes and struggle of a common Indian poverty stricken rural family which is the striking reality of a nascent nation where even today more than 70% of the population live and die in the same abject poverty yet resilient enough to hope and endeavor for amelioration of their social status, a better life. This hope for better future has been nicely portrayed at the end of the movie when the whole family move out of the village in search of a better life in the city in-spite of their losses and uncertainties. The whole movie has a poetry like characteristics in its unfolding of the realism woven through imagination of a young boy and his striking encounters with the real world and its malaise through incidents like the death of his sister with whom he shared a very sweet relationship, his revelation of the theft of his sister after her death and the though that flows through his mind and his act of throwing the same in the pond in an attempt to consciously deny and forget the negativity in his beloved world surrounding him, his first encounter with the modern world of steam engine and trains, etc. The skillful screenplay and the wonderful musical tune in the movie has definitely helped in bringing out the central flow of the incidents and the inner meaning of the movie. It is eternal in nature and not really confined to a particular family, time or place, it brings out the very real and everyday story of millions in similar surroundings in Indian society. This is a movie which leaves you thinking and filled sweet and melancholy emotions after you have finished watching. This movie stands out for the very fact that it brings out the striking harsh reality in a sweet and nice manner like a poetry, a musical tune, the tune of life of millions.",

There is simple no denying that this is a greatly done film.It's one very minimalistic movie. Not only with just its sets, costumes or camera-work but also- and foremost, with its story. It's being very simplistic, which in this case is a real good things, since it lets things seem and feel real. It basically focuses entirely on one small poor family, in Bengal, India, at the beginning of the the 20th century, who are trying to survive and overcome everyday's struggles.It has lots of melodrama and other dramatic developments but yet the movie manages to keep things real and maintain a realistic approach and feeling to it all. This is all due to its minimalistic approach, that makes the movie feel very honest and real. Despite it's minimalistic approach and low budget, the movie still took a lot of time to make, due to lack of sufficient funds. Luckily after the success of this movie Satyajit Ray didn't had this problem again for the rest of it's trilogy, that got based on the novels by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay.

            "content": "Pather Panchali is one movie that touches the inner soul of whom so ever seeks to find themselves. Ray's extraordinary ability to bring out the most raw feelings from the audience without being the least bit dramatic is all visible in this first installment of his masterpiece.Although the story line is seemingly thin, its the depth and slow development of the characters that gets to the audience. Ray uses relationships as the strongest tool in his narrative, he breaks beyond the normal conventions of good or bad, but builds more on the 'nessesities of relationships'. One fact that surprised me in the comments is a lack of this understanding. For example Apu's mother and her Husband's old sister(the legendary old woman), they have a relationship pelted with nessesary Harshness. The scenes where the Old woman tries to bond with Apu's mother but without results is heartbreaking. Although at first you would think Apu's mother is a horrible person, on second thoughts you would realize she's simply putting her children before this woman who at an old age had become an extra mouth to spend for at home. Ray is so brilliant in his narrative that even the worst of worse characters gain the audiences sympathy.The beautiful camera work, music is something almost all reviews have inolved in them. Though before ending this review Id like to answer one question that haunts quiet a few people 'Why is this movie so great?' Well in all honesty amidst all the poverty, The characters in Pather Panchali live the most purest of lives, one devoid of the evils of politics, racism and all such Urban social evils and absurdities. They live among nature and touch on the very basics of life, something most of us can never feel because we're lost in a seemingly materialistic world.",

Perhaps not \"Citizen Kane\", but pretty darn close, this autobiographical film from Satyajit Ray, the first of a trilogy, is many things...a bildungsroman, an intense family drama, a harshly lyrical picture of rural life...but for me what it most vividly and powerfully evokes is the awfulness of poverty, the sheer misery of not having enough; enough money, treats (forget luxuries), clothes, sanitation, decent medical care, education, and, perhaps most crucially for someone as naturally curious about life as is Apu, exposure to the world outside that stultifying village in which he must spend his youth, with only a passing glimpse at a train to serve as an escape valve. And Ray gives us this bitter pill without sugar coating, a la Hollywood depictions of poverty (No charming Bowery Boys here). Yes, there are occasional moments of happiness but they are fleeting, while misery, in the shape of death and hopelessness, can always be counted on swiftly to return. And the film's last shot, with the reduced family being forced to flee out of economic necessity, in an ox cart, to the city, as they stare hollowly into the future, is as utterly bleak an ending as you will find. Not much more to add except that Karuna Banarjee ,who portrayed the mother, by far the most complex member of the family, with her combination of love, hard heartedness, hopefulness and resentment, should have won the Oscar given to Grace Kelly for \"The Country Girl\", the kind of Hollywood hokum for which this film is the perfect antidote, and that people who find this film \"slow\" should be consigned to an eternity of watching \"Smokey And The Bandit\".

Even the smallest of situations can be made to be eventful. His camera helps us to experience the beauty of such things as a wind blowing against a field or lifting lily pads in a river. The mood is greatly aided by the sweet musical score by Ravi Shankar especially when the sitar is played.As the film is mostly seen through the eyes of the older girl and her younger brother, the audience can feel many emotional memories of childhood including that emotional love/hate ambivalence that is shared among siblings, cousins, and neighbours. This emotional gut feeling also occurs when Durga and Apu have wants that exceed their family's means but they also have a sense of wonder in things adults would either take for granted or are too busy to experience.While the film might seem simple through most of its duration, this technique is used to build up for a final fifteen minutes that is so shocking and gripping, it would move even the most still of hearts. The impact is felt well after the film's conclusion. One powerful technique Ray uses is to have the camera on the faces of two people simultaneously where one is aware of the shocking event while the other is blissfully ignorant.The rating below reflects my feelings after a fourth viewing but, keep in mind, it was a perfect four-star rating the first three times I saw Pather Panchali.

It's not that I didn't feel bad for the impoverished family's circumstances at the center of the story, but it's resolution at the finale leaves no sense of reconciliation or hope for the viewer. It's as if the picture seeks to confirm a statement by one of Sarbojaya Ray's (Karune Bannerjee) neighbors near the finale when she states that life in their dirt poor village was like 'rotting away in one place year after year'. I felt the movie was more about daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) than about her younger brother Apu (Subir Banerjee), as described in the IMDb 'Storyline' description on this movie's title page, though the emphasis does shift when she is unfortunately taken ill and perishes. I found it inspiring the way Apu decided to insure Durga's reputation and legacy by throwing away the stolen necklace that was a focal event early in the picture. Knowing now that this film was the first in a trilogy by director Satyajit Ray, the emphasis on Apu does make more sense. However the sight of the poor family leaving their village for a new start in another area left this viewer wondering if in fact they would ever be better off.",

A taste for movies which doesn't show an incredible or cheap story lines, but which are beautiful snapshots with each scene depicting its own saga.'Pather Panchali'(song of the little road) is one of such movie. It's a 'kaaljai' (one which is not bounded by space and time) piece of art.Though some people will find it fragmented, but the truth is that Ray has worked on each and every scene. Some scenes are historical like 'rain shower' and 'the vessel floating'. Surely Ray is the Shakespeare of Indian cinema, who loves to develop the characters. Though the movie dates back to late 50s still you can find traces of the 21st century's society (Indian) and the universal behavior of human. Bound in the ties of selfishness, ego, our own problems and society often the behavior of human is quite disgustful. But when it comes the time of crisis our true heart is revealed which is loaded with love and is hungry for it. The climax really highlights this notion in a beautiful way. Secondly, Ray seems to be well acquainted with the importance of family. And the selfless love among family members is the part and parcel of the movie.The innocence of Apu and Durga, brother-sister love, humanity, mother's care, relation between Durga and her aunt and (of course) the miseries and songs of the aunt had made the movie eternal. About the acting, I'll say that Chunibala Devi (Indir Thakrun) is the person who suppresses all other great performances. From her scene first to the very end she seems to steal all the scenes. I would call this one of great Indian performance. Uma Das Gupta has very well presented the character of Durga (I personally find her most amusing part of the movie). Both she and Subeer Banerjee (Apu) had presented their innocence quite artfully. There are some songs in the movie which in spite of being in Bengali (incomprehensible for many people and me) flow with the movie. Perhaps I might be wrong but they (songs) don't satisfy as such. At last, if you still had had no opportunity to watch this classic then I would personally recommend it to you, but with two precautions:First watch it if you really have taste buds for such art films (as I already have said). And second the film is of 50s so prepare your mind for a slow and no larger than life or exciting events in the story (it is quite realistic)If you are mentally prepare then don't wait just fetch it anyhow and see the 'weird beauty' of your own world through a genius' eye\u0085..",

This film put me under great depression, and the hangover is going to be there for a long time, for sure.Selling properties, borrowing and adjusting funds, a man working in the advertisement field has a passion to film making. He never had any previous experience, his cameraman had zero experience in film making, and the actors were randomly chosen from the surrounds, and here emerges the magician, the one only Ray, to the international attention with his debut, low budget movie. Through the struggles and delays, it took over 3 years to complete the movie, the final hands were stretched from the Goverment of West Bengal. When, acclaimed director John Huston saw the film, the fate of Indian cinema changes for over. Ray and his films always had international attention thereafter. No film student can complete his studies without analyzing the work of Ray, especially Pather Panchali.More than a movie, it takes you to the life of a remote Indian village, and the life of very common people. Appu and Durga seems to be like very familiar friend, or a nostalgic feeling of my own childhood somewhere. Bengal is always in resemblance with Kerala, therefore, each frame gives me a nostalgic mesmerizing feel.

Probably because of a lack of character development. The father is hardly even in the film. The mother is a witch to her daughter. The aunt is a caricature of an old woman who means well. Same goes for the daughter. The son comes late in the film and basically copies whatever the daughter does. The neighbors are like the bad people in a chorus of a Greek tragedy. How can anyone be emotionally moved by characters like these?! They were all pretty much one-dimensional. And to top all that off--there was no plot! Well, I wasn't surprised to see that because how can you have a plot when you have only static characters. I do not recommend this film.",

But every so often, a film comes along that is just as great as everyone has told you it is, and \"Pather Panchali\" is one of those.This is a magnificent film about a poor Indian family struggling to make a life for themselves in their ancestral home. The father is a dreamer, a writer and philosopher who makes decision after decision that prevent his family from bettering their financial situation, while the mother is the realist, the one who feels oppressed by their stifling conditions and the one tasked with keeping the family going day after day. Satyajit Ray was influenced by the Italian Neo-Realist movement, so the point of view is fairly objective and nearly journalistic, but it does lean toward the perspectives of the family's two children, an adolescent daughter and especially a little boy, Apu. This is not a movie with big emotional scenes and manipulative histrionics. There are moments that will take your breath away, sometimes with beauty, sometimes with sadness, many times with a mix of both, but they sneak up on you. I didn't read the ending as hopeful, as some have. Rather, I read it as resigned. The family may be ok, but they may not be. In any case, they keep on going, because what other options do we have in this world?I don't know what took me so long to get around to this film.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Though its focal family doesn't actually have any sort of plumbing in their home, 'Pather Panchali (1955)' is essentially a kitchen sink drama. It's a slice-of-life affair that chronicles the lives of a family struggling to survive in rural Bengal. The father is an optimistic priest whose gentle nature and general desire to maintain his relaxed reputation often lead to periods of immense poverty, something which is made worse when an opportunity in the city takes him away for far too long. The mother is a pragmatic, if not downright pessimistic, presence who holds everything together with all her might but can't escape her reputation no matter how hard she tries. The children play innocently, unable to see the severity of their situation (even rejecting food in favour of play on occasion), and their happiness is touching even if it's constantly drenched in portent. The picture has as many moments of joy as it does of sadness, but its overall vibe is undeniably downbeat. It progresses almost as a series of vignettes, depicting the passage of time ambiguously and refusing to provide on-the-nose exposition when it comes to who is who in relation to each other (which is actually a bit of an issue sometimes). It's an experience that's far easier to admire than it is to enjoy, especially when you look into its behind-the-scenes process and realise it was shot on a shoestring budget over a period of three years by people who had never made a movie before. Shot with a deceptive simplicity, the black-and-white feature often feels as close to a fly-on-the-wall documentary as a narrative affair can. It's an impressive effort, for sure. Though the acting occasionally falls a little flat (and isn't helped by the sometimes emotionally unconvincing screenplay), most of characters are convincing in a down-to-Earth way. The drama works as well as it does because of this realistic nature, even if the detached style prevents the piece from being as devastating as it could have been. In fact, it generally feels sort of hollow. It's very slow and, though its pacing improves in its back half, it could have probably done with a bit of its runtime shaving off. It's conceptually solid and technically sound, but it isn't exactly an enthralling or, even, especially enjoyable experience. It's entertaining on occasion and it does what it sets out to, but it just isn't as affecting as it ought to have been. With some tightening up, it could've been a real tearjerker. As it is, it's a good effort that affords a glimpse into a time and place most people (if not everyone) reading this will never experience first hand.",

Its quiet pace & random moments can alienate some but Ray's concise direction, wonderful camerawork & Ravi Shankar's mesmerising score remains gripping throughout.Also benefitting the film greatly are the strong performances from its inexperienced cast, for every actor plays their part responsibly. Through its adults, the film depicts the everyday hardships of impoverished life while through the kids' youthful eyes, it attempts to capture the small delights of their world. Though the entire cast delivers, 80-year old Chunibala Devi is singularly impressive.Overall, Pather Panchali commences Satyajit Ray's filmmaking journey on a highly promising note and is rightfully considered as a landmark of Indian cinema, for the film feels different to the established norms of our film industry even today. Finding comfort in its rambling quality which it embraces wholeheartedly, this poetic, lyrical & unfailingly human classic is by all means an essential viewing.",

The best part of this movie is probably the down to earth nature. Everything is as realistic as it can be and I just love looking at cats.The basic plot is that Apu's father goes off to try to make money. We get a ton of little things going on. The aunt dies, his sister is accused of stealing beads, and many others. As a slice of life story, you can expect a lot of little things to go on.

Satyajit Ray has been known as the Greatest Filmmaker ever born on Indian Soil and so he has legacy and films that prove it authentically. When did he debuted was the question many of us had, here is the answer. It's Pather Panchali, the debut of Legendary Filmmaker. In early 50s Bollywood Cinema thought about Social realism seriously and that resulted into so many socially important films. From Commercial blockbusters to Realistic art films, Bollywood begun running fast on the road of rich content cinema and it would be difficult to know where did it all begin? I see many people calling Pather Panchali as the pioneer of Parallel Cinema that broke Socially Realistic theme but didn't we have a Classic like Do Bigha Zameen before? This arguments can never end if one really want to get into it so let it be. Pather Panchali is a tale of poverty that comes through social realism and defines Art Cinema mode. I won't say it's a grest story and all, but for me more than story it's about cinema style, filmmaking techniques, artistic nuances and realistic carnation of disturbing tale. The background score tells us how the scene is making sense and what mood it has, that's unbelievable. Can you believe it? A background score is used for the exploration of mood and turning situations in the film that too in mid 50s. While supporting this, the Cinematography does something similar unbelievable stuff to achive some great heights in creative techniques. Such things can't be described in words because these had to be experienced and recognised. Of course because everyone has a different brain, everybody will understand it in different ways. I didn't mind the slow pace as far as it was maki sense and showing quality but what's so Outstanding in that needs to be explained. Overall, A Classic Piece of Realistic Cinema but why so special is still an arguable point.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Else the kittens are always kept at their neck (as if we could not keep them under their belly) and thrown to ground.In an extraordinary scene we see a Bengali steam train passing by, and the boy running beneath it. The boy, as meager as he is, anyway seems at every opportunity be running through backyard and field.Note that I wrote SILENT PICTURES, not SILENT MOVIE, because this film makes a persistent static impression. So that I fell twice into sleep, something which had never happened to me before. Hitchcock warned not to make films by photographing people who are talking. This films shows a lot of scenes with mother, children, neighbors talking. In addition, we become witness of how to cook under that environment.What kept me a bit under suspense: the people always walk or run bare-feet through the bosky backyard and garden, as if there could never be a snake.The sound was of bad quality, the soundtrack by Ravi Shankar, too. It is not sufficient just to play the sitar a fast a possible.I have the impression that it is the one and same person who wrote the other reviews, which are too good to be true. Or maybe they are employees of the Bengali film office, since that was the sponsor and producer of the work.I have written reviews for films which are nearly 100 years old (and they are FAR better than this one).

The focus was upon childhood spent in poverty in a developing country, the message being that childhood is universal.In any case, Pather Panchali surely helped me achieve my initial purpose of, being from India, understanding Indian cultures different from my own, in this case the culture of Hindu Bengal.A note about the subtitles: English subtitles are great, but if you're like me and speak an Indian language that isn't Bengali, try finding subtitles in them instead of in English.

            "review_title": "A Walk Down The Little Road: An Essay On Pather Panchali",
            "content": "\"Not having seen Ray's films is like not having seen the Sun and the moon\", said Akira Kurosawa, the famous Japanese director and an ambassador of Indo-Japanese relations along with Satyajit Ray. Kurosawa wasn't flattering Ray when he opined this. There is no tinge of contempt in this praise to those who haven't seen Ray's films, or the Sun and the moon, for that matter. There is only the assertion that Ray's films are a sign of life, much like the Sun and the moon. That the rise and set of the Sun and the moon are an internalized experience in humans, and so are the ideas of Ray's films, even if one hasn't taken notice of either. Pather Panchali is a reminder that all who have seen the Sun and the moon can be familiar with the film, for that is the only qualification needed.This is illustrated in one of the many wonderful scenes of the film, the famous train chase. Apu chased Durga into a Kaash Blossom field. He chased her because she teased him. She teased him because he caused her getting a scolding from their mother. Their mother scolded Durga because Durga was hitting Apu. And Durga was hitting Apu because he wore a crown out of her box of personal belongings. How very sibling! Durga beckoned him to sit down with her under the tall, fluffy grass flowers, both forgetting the quarrel. The sound of a train's engine roared. This callback to their yearning to see a running train, earlier in the film, does wonders to their character arcs. However, the astonishment of this writer didn't end there. While Apu and Durga began to run after the train, the camera cut to the other side of the train tracks and tracked them from between the wheels of the train. On the first viewing, this writer was exhilarated at the scene. A sheer excitement ran along with Apu, Durga and the camera. Watching a train run was so terrific, for a 21st century viewer!Whereas the second viewing of the same scene, not long after the first, was very different. The sound of the running train was calming. The wind that blew through the Kaash fields was calming. The black smoke from the train, left behind in the large sky, was calming. The scene brought a fulfillment at its ends and was more about the completion of this plot thread of the characters, than about the callback. What remained common in both viewings was the force of life. The train was a juggernaut and Apu and Durga, two beams of passion. The constant throughout the scene was a human yearning and a chase for that yearning. But what intrigues this writer furthermore is how the scene will feel on further viewings. The scene full of life.Along with the affinity of Apu and Durga, Karuna Banerjee as Sarbojaya shares her sorrow with the camera. Her eyes and expressions are enough to tell her story. The story of plenty of women who live under weak roofs, crippled due to debt and poverty. Women left with such little potential in the four walls of their home, all they remain capable of is tending after the children and worrying. Women who are helpless of their own haplessness. Whose eyes are a sum total of their grief and happiness, but mostly grief. In a very pensive shot towards the end of the film, Apu stared into the distance while brushing his gums. There is the realisation that he has his mother's eyes. And his eyes and face began to tell the same story as his mother's did. This child had witnessed death, twice. He was getting acquainted to growth and the accompanying grief. The last glimpse of his boyish charisma comes further in the last minutes of the film. The Ray family was packing to leave Nishindipur and Apu came across Durga's box again. He found that Didi had, infact, stolen the beaded necklace, of which the neighbouring woman had alleged her. He threw it into the lake. Not to relieve himself and everyone else of the last memory of Durga, not to complete another plot thread and character arc, but in a simple effort to not be caught.Renowned film critic Roger Ebert once said, \"The problem with a film that is ten years old is that it isn't thirty years old.\" The time periods aren't absolute, but his message is. The life of a film is a test of time. A newly released film has the perfect era and audience for its release. Ten years later, it may still continue to have a resurgence when the next generation of moviegoers rediscover it. It might still prevail under the habitats of its original release, if such habitats remain. At this point, it's still not certain whether the film will live on or not. But a film that is thirty years old would be devoid of the era it was created in and the audience it was created for. When the movie-going audience revisits such a film, the film might become timeless, if it still receives the acclaim. Or it may become dated. Pather Panchali and Ray's other films are the Sun and moon of cinema. And as long as we can see the Sun and moon, we will fall in love with Ray's films, generation after generation.",

But the most honest thing one may be able to say about Satyajit Ray's tour de force is that although it should be required viewing for virtually everyone who takes their automobile, their computer, their cell phone, their paid vacation, and their \"right\" to \"live as they choose\" for granted... only those who know the Yogic Hindu and Pali Cannon Buddhist \"way\" will likely \"get it.\" For this is not only The Way Life Is for half the world's (over-) population even 60 years after it was first screened, this is proof that all our \"stuff\" is just that, regardless of how effectively it lulls us into our (supposedly) painkilling trance.",

This is the first movie of Satyajit Ray I have watched yet, and I must watch all of his lifelong work. And this feeling indulges my mind to read Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's original novel.Superb acting by every character, so strong, so real! Still camera, use of natural lights and shadows, makes you think how intelligent was the mind behind it. Sensitive story plot, and attention to every minute detail is phenomenal.This movie is a remarkable and classic story which tells both how beautiful and worst is life in very bad and in extremely bad situations, and flows in different ages as time passes.I can watch it for tens of times if I could make time for it!As a note, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon Movie is not so different, but Pather Panchali feels at home and heart touching.A recommended one for classical movie lovers.",

            "content": "Off late i have stopped writing about films because my perspective has progressed that films are not an essential and valuable service, apart from non outdoor entertainment provided which is required to have healthy mind. Also, films are one sided and not two way as people on screen and behind keep exhibiting their talent and we the viewers have no participation (example in sports-Tennis or Chess is two sided). But recently got inspired to come back into my favorite arena-(parallel) movies(commonly/colloquially known as non song movies, award cinema, art film, documentary, slow movies, elite film festival audience movie) after getting inspired from a TV show accidentally i watched while changing channel, where Indian film director told that his favorite personality is Satyajit Ray(a veteran with Oscar and Bharat Ratna to his credit). While saying there was a special spark in his eyes. Then i came back to this movie called Pather Panchali - Song of the little road(1955) which was released 61 years ago(was in development hell for 3 years indeed), which is Mr.Ray's first movie with no experience in films except for watching, analyzing and discussing them. Unresisted to watch the movie despite the criticism on Rays movie as selling poverty abroad, lack of modernism,melodramatic and slow.Needless to say, movie is sourced to a literature as like any parallel movie should be. The film is into 5 characters of lower middle class family set in rural India. Rays movie has deeper touch with realism, story being natural and so the characters(in simple-the style is into absorbing story and characters strongly, parallel movie trademark). His style is more focused on characters. Its a chilling experience and a break from blood and gore and over romantic, repeat artificial routine movies in recent and past trend. Characters moments of living life as a human being is captured in close shots which is overwhelming. The boys reaction to his sisters beating and making-up with a mustache as a man after watching a theater performance and enjoying the rain with his sister is close to heart. Not to miss the deepness of Apu's love to sister when the movie ends he throws away the beads(which his sister stole and got beaten) to protect her reputation.The end of movie is heart breaking to be not in touch with the family we enjoyed overseeing while they are living. The chilling experience is deep because of the family living in a natural surrounding-lovely nature ambiance. People who have suffered lack of humanity in real life will enjoy this movie of 2 hours and 6 minutes for sure. Fiction seated in realism some or most of the times is purely enjoyable because we already built a stage(as we can closely match the realism in our life) to launch a fiction on top of it.",

It's production was initially about that sophisticated, it all takes place in the same neighbourhood, and the mother and daughter characters really are mother and daughter. The result of all this is that the film is far more affecting than it would have been if it had been more obviously made.This movie is based on a novel apparently, but there's really not much plot, simply because real life never has much plot. It's just plodding along from day to day, with interesting things occasionally happening along the way, and where only a sudden, horrible tragedy can really break things up. There is not one false note to be found in any of the characters, who are some of the most real I've ever seen. They each have their sweetnesses and their villainies, and you like them or not on balance of them. If you doubt how effective this is, I'll only say this: NEVER have I so hoped a character wouldn't die as I did when the climax of this film drew near.India is a country that seems to thrive on excess, both in its own Bollywood productions and in the sort of films it generates in Hollywood (Passage to India, Gandhi, Kama Sutra, for example). This is totally the other extreme, showing us the mundane, undramatic lives of the ordinary people. This doesn't even have the absolute-rock-bottom drama of Salaam Bombay.

It's a slow moving slice of life film about an Indian family, particularly a mother and daughter. I think De Sica would be proud of this one, as it does feel extremely similar stylistically to Bicycle Thieves. Few real events happen in the film - instead, we just spend time with the characters as they struggle to get by and enjoy the small things in life. In this way, it reminded me of a wonderful recent slice of life movie: The Florida Project. In both, we understand the parental struggle to balance emotional, financial, and parenting stability for their kids, and we also get many scenes shot from the children's perspective, where these wonderful kids living in extreme poverty see simple things in the world with utter awe. The bond between Apu and Durga was very pleasant, and the way all the characters reacted to the ending was realistic and heartbreaking. One small directorial choice I loved was the mirroring of how Durga woke Apu up at the beginning and how she found Auntie dead - shaking them while there was a blanket over them, with the music in the early scene hinting at darkness. There's a lot to get out of this one thematically in regards to family, tradition, and what defines a community, but you have to be ready for the slow, contemplative pace.",

Movie making has since undergone a paradigm shift both in terms of content and techniques but the outstanding quality of this movie has remained unmatched over the years. All iconic scenes have been discussed and analysed many times over. Director Satyajit Ray along with cinematographer Subtata Mitra and music director Ravi Shankar created great cinema which had come in for praise by established auteurs of the likes of Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan. (Ray himself was an admirer of prominent Italian director Vittorio De Sica). All actors have acted superbly and are under the skin of the characters. The camera work is first rate capturing the scenery of the village with great artistry. The close ups are superbly done and tell a lot. Memorable scenes include the train scene, Apu getting ready for school, the storm shaking up the home, the wedding, the sweetmeat seller, the death of the old woman, the makeshift village drama, the shopkeeper cum teacher, the rains, the sibling banter and many more. As far as technique goes the trolley shots, the close ups, the dissolves and the fade in/ fade out in the scenes reflect the signature style of Ray. (Later Ray is said to have remarked that he would like to try out the emerging European style of hand held camera, jump cut and freeze frame.) The plot of a very poor man living in a dilapidated home with his wife, two kids and a sister in her 90s spoke of abject poverty, sickness, hunger and misery. This did not go well with some people as they felt that it depicted poverty in India. Right from the simplistic credit titles in Bengali to the the village atmosphere to melodious music of flute/ sitar, the movie was totally Indian in all aspects. Certain social aberrations of middle class India of those times shown effectively include the pampered boy child, the domesticated girl child and the neglected senior of the house.",

The rural world, being unenlightened is shown strongly in the role of the little girl, who dies shortly. The old lady which is highly praiseworthy for her genuine involvement is still mystifying. I generally liked the dual sense hidden in the girls life. The father longs to earn money in the urban apart from his poetic abilities. The death of the little girl in the whole episode is so true even in the metaphorical sense. The girl represents the unenlightening existence. She is peaceful in rural life, sometimes gets scold from her mother. She has her private space in the movie, plays around the village, the natural experiences of her teenage. The scenario of the rural area matches in total of the girl unenlightened existence. She dies peacefully in rural area is a thought provoking issue regarding both fear and peace hidden in her life. It strikes me as the metaphor of unenlightening super power ends in the beginning of 20th century. A truly maestro's touch by Satyajit Ray in visualizations through human characters. Apart from that all the performers truly did thier part reflecting the genuine rural life of east India.Apu birth is the first part of the trilogy. It is followed by Apus study life and then his married life. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in Indian movie. A fine start in depicting the story of Apu and his family.

Despite all this I think the greatest strength of this movie is it's 'timelessness' I haven't seen any film from the 50s or even the 'Hitchcock'ian 60s that are as timeless as Pather Panchali.

The characterization in the screenplay reduces the pace of the film quite a bit, but it engages the audience and reels you in. You start rooting for the characters, and the payoff is especially bittersweet in the end. The cinematography is beautiful and the emotions are almost tangible. There is poetry in the frames, soul in the score, and everything comes together wonderfully.The actors are absolutely perfect in their roles. Every single actor is incredibly endearing and they will wring the emotions out of you. You will feel the pain, the despair, and the little moments of happiness.

Even though it has been cited to showcase poverty, I do not see that is ever pinpointed anywhere in the film, and there is no crying over it. This film actually does not say much. Some western critics mentioned about the theme of endless sorrow throughout the series, but I do not think this was made, or could be interpreted in that way. That kind of sorrow is part of the then life in our country. Let us not take the ending as a cliffhanger. Kudos to the actors too, but Ray even played the role of casting director well. Of course a great slice of credits goes to Bibhutihushan Bandyopadhyay for the awesome story and narrative about the serenity of nature, but that adaptation accusation applies for all the movies of Ray.",

A film is an art form which can profoundly have an impact on society.\nFilms have a lot of influence on me. Growing up watching movies of foreign languages and different cultures have helped me to approach the world more broadly and to accept the diversities. I moved to the United States from India few years ago. Because of the films and the books I have read, to an extent, I was able to adapt very quickly into this society and embrace the cultural differences.\nWhen I was in 10th grade, my teacher screened the film \"PatherPanjali\"(1955 )directed by Satyajit Ray which was adapted from an autobiographical tale written by author Bibhuthibhushan Bandyopadhyay in 1929. The movie is about a Brahmin family, an impoverished priest (Harihar Ray), his wife and two children ( Durga and Apu) struggling to make both ends meet. Though the film deals with the struggle for survival by a poor family, what the director has tried to project instead is the respect for human dignity. The film as a whole seems tragic but it is a lot more than that. It is full of love, care, share and humanity that is fading away in this current era. The director has used the cues and signals from nature at it's best for picturizing the mood of the scenes. Despite the movie was dated for my generation (come on! What does 15-year-old know about film appreciation), unlike my classmates, during the film I was in a different emotional state. That was the first time I see the struggles of poor old villagers who even steal Guavas to calm the hunger and later on takes one's life. That was the first time I see how social status and pride overrules the humanity. Watching those scenes made me sick in my heart. At the same time, even in adverse circumstances, the children enjoy their childhood, sharing, caring and living in the moment exploring and exposing the mountains, rivers and the forest happily made me question whether the inconveniences I had is even a matter to consider. After the movie was over, I felt ashamed of myself for being ungrateful towards such a beautiful life I live. This movie made me question why people choose pride over dignity (the mother's pride took precedence over daughter's death) or is those words are some thing that is often misintrepret all the time.\nThis movie completely shifted my approach towards cinema. After that film, I always try to pick movies that stir intense emotions and reach me at a deeper level.",

            "content": "Even though I'm of Indian decent, I only visited India on holiday but I've lived in an Indian community in South Africa. This movie reminds me of my childhood, the way the old aunties and grannies used to be in our Indian neighbourhoods but it wasn't as rural as it was in India and my generation was a few decades later. Yet, I related very closely to this film.I grew up watching many Bollywood films in our family, with our parents and I'd yearn for the quality Bollywood of older times. Satyajit Ray doesn't provide that Bollywood nostalgia but he provides total realism that I haven't seen in Indian cinema - to his level. I mostly love the way his characters are free to walk around the rural areas and their simple pleasures in the field, going toward the train and playing with water. Being about children, it is playful but also very serious with the way Ray depicts the grandmother and her relationship with the children's mother. I've been calling her grandmother, but i wasn't sure if she was just an old lady/aunty in the village or a blood relative. I might've missed that but it's all the same as she was treated as a relative and I think in Indian communities they could've adopted this responsibility to take care of her anyway. Ray isn't sympathetic to his characters, he shows us their ugly and beautiful side. He does this with the mother and children. He exposes some real weaknesses and his coverage of Apu is very dreamy, seemingly like himself. For me Pather Panchali is the best of the Apu Trilogy because its very real, but it's not easy to get going because it was Ray's first film and he was notably still mastering his craft at that stage.",

            "content": "Last weekend it was my fortune to see the entire Apu trilogy at the DIA Film Theater. It was a pleasure and relief after reading stories of burned negatives of Satyajit Ray films and anxiety that seeing his films again after 40 years may be a disappointment. I had seen a clutch of his films at a festival in Bombay and had seen Pather Pancheli again in late 70's as a student in U.S. I had not seen the other two films in the trilogy, Aparajito and Apur Sansar before. It was great to see all three films in a two day span, but this also helped me obtain perspective on this great filmmaker. Pather Panchali is superlatively great. Nothing in Indian film repertoire approaches it for its freshness, naturalness, authenticity, playfulness and ability to relate its experience to the audience. Words are inadequate to describe how affecting Chunibala Devi is as an 80 year old close to death. She walks back and forth from being a beggar/thief to a loving aunt to Apu and Durga. In the extreme conditions she lives in, there is no contradiction in the two roles. Subeer Banerjee as Apu is absolutely charming and Uma Dasgupta as Durga with her rebelliousness and budding sexuality breaks our heart. The photography of Subrata Mitra has few equals in B/W film world. It is not only beautiful; it finds beauty in the most unexpected places such as tattered huts and dark unlit interiors; but is also expressive and lyrical. Ravi Shanker's music is mostly enchanting, but occasionally a little too overpowering for the gentleness of the scene. Kanu Banerjee as the hopelessly romantic father and Karuna Banerjee as the ever suffering mother are excellent.One can view Pather Pachali is the story of India's urbanization. From the beginning, the life in the village is hard and there are always stories about jobs and opportunities in distant cities. The railroad tracks outside the town beckon Apu and Durga and fill them with wonder when they finally see a train passing by. There is no electricity in the village (or running water, paved roads etc), and the electric lines outside town hum and sing to the two children, singing the song of modernization and breakup of the rural culture. It is inevitable that the family will end up leaving the village and our hearts collectively ache about this possibility and are afraid for them. Their pain is palpable as they leave in a rickety bullock cart, and Satyajit Ray makes us share that pain. What an astonishing achievement!After the glorious achievement of this first film, the other two films disappoint. Aparajito seems mostly to be a transitional piece and Apur Sansar ends on an oddly sentimental note. Although death comes regularly in all three films, it is less and less able to shock and sadden as the trilogy wears on. When the last death occurs in Apur Sansar, it seems gimmicky. Subrata Mitra is still spectacular and watching Sharmila Tagore as the bride of Apu is a treat in itself, but most other characters seem wooden and the storyline increasingly becomes artificial. Worse, Satyajit Ray does not seem to have a good grasp of or a point of view about the city life as he does about village life in Pather Panchali. This is especially true when the story shifts to Calcutta in the third film. It is difficult to identify or sympathize with the grown up Apu and we become less and less interested in his fate. Too bad. I loved Apu in Pather Panchali and still cared about him in early parts of Aparajito, but by the end of the trilogy, he seemed more a stick figure created by Ray, than a flesh and bones human being. To me the Apu trilogy had lost its humanity.",

The actor seem like they were made for the very particular role they play and the touch of classical score scored by Mr Ravi Shankar himself does the defining work of inducing emotions in each scene.

Satyajit's understanding of photography/cinematography for his time, is such a treat to witness. This is an institution on what a brilliant mind, can do with limited resources.Also, props to the Criterion Collection for cleaning up and denoising the print, sound, and jitter. (The original prints were lost in the infamous fire at the National Film Archive of India at Pune in 2003.)",

Pather Panchali, is truly a remarkable masterpiece that is carved with brilliant film making. It leaves us awestruck and scene by scene is a sculpture. I do not recollect when was the last time that I watched an Indian film that portrays reality to this extent. It's been almost 60 years since the release of Pather Panchali but no other movie can inch closer to this marvel. Epic performance from the entire cast. Editing was top notch, so was the cinematography. If you want to become a film maker, you don't have to go to a film school, just watch the trilogy. This movie is very precious for the Indian cinema and will be cherished forever.",

From beginning to end, it is a perfectly told and emotional story about a family's struggle and tragedy from a life of poverty in rural Bangladesh. It's a simple story, a gentle one, with universally relatable characters and relationships between them that anyone in the world can relate to.This film and trilogy is one of a kind. Pather Panchali is a demonstration of what a movie can actually be, of how great a film can be. I don't feel that I can overhype this film at all. It's an experience, it has characters that you deeply care about even though they can also grate on your nerves in a very human way. Of all the films I have ever seen, I can only think of two other films that have reached the same heights of cinema as this. I saw this for the first time over ten years ago and its imagery and story has haunted me ever since.",

You never know what's ahead. The movie is a matter of pride for every Indian. This movie is a major landmark of Indian and World Cinema.Talking about characters. Characters were defined with such depth and scope. Each character has its own uniqueness. The old aunt and Apu were outstanding. The old aunt played by Chunibala Devi acted out very well. Every actor just brings out the realism in the story. I think watching Apu and Durga brought out immense joy in me. Durga stealing Guava and the happiness in old aunt when Durga gifts it to her.The role of music in this movie. Movie is not about visual treat by Ray but a collection of melodious tunes by Pandit Ravishankar. Every frame in the movie is backed up by a background score suiting the ambiance and mood at that instant. I guess the score added to the beauty of the movie. For instance the scene where Durga and Apu are drenched in rain. The music played a great role in giving the warmth to the visuals.Apart from story and music, Ray's visuals attracted me mainly. A perfect visual treat. The cinematography is stunning and apt to the theme of the movie. It never failed the ambiance or feel of the movie, Lyrical maybe. I loved the scene where a cat cuddles by a dog. Likewise, old aunt showing the hole in her blanket. Apu finding the necklace Durga stole. Perfect.As Akira Kurosawa said of him:\"To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun\"",

The film misses the \"Ballali Balai\" part of the novel by Bibhutibhushan which is a must read for a complete picture of the background of the film. Bibhuti's novel consists of three parts, a) Ballali Balai, b) Aam anti-r bhnepu, c) Akrura Sangbad. Ray covers Aam aanti-r bhnepu in \"Pather Panchali\" film and the \"AKrur Sangbad\" deals with the first half of \"Aparajito\" which ends with Harihara's death.",

Even the smallest of situations can be made to be eventful. His camera helps us to experience the beauty of such things as a wind blowing against a field or lifting lily pads in a river. The best part of this movie was ' when Apu and Durga saw the train from the paddy field . The mood is greatly aided by the sweet musical score by Ravi Shankar especially when the sitar is played.\nIn its sequel, \" The second film, \"Aparajito\" (1956), follows the family to Benares, where the father makes a living from pilgrims who have come to bathe in the holy Ganges. The third film, \"Apur Sansar\" (1959), finds Apu and his mother living with an uncle in the country; the boy does so well in school he wins a scholarship to Calcutta. He is married under extraordinary circumstances, is happy with his young bride, then crushed by the deaths of his mother and his wife. After a period of bitter drifting, he returns at last to take up the responsibility of his son. the trilogy, tragedy strikes without warning, and Apu's real challenge is an existential one-how to go on in the face of life's fragile and temporary nature. The great, sad, gentle sweep of \"The Apu Trilogy\" remains in the mind of the moviegoer as a promise of what film can be. Standing above fashion, it creates a world so convincing that it becomes, for a time, another life we might have lived.\nThe three films were photographed by Subrata Mitra, a still photographer who Satyajit Ray was convinced could do the job.\n\"The Apu Trilogy\" is a different kind of life than we are used to. The film is set in Bengal in the 1920s, when in the rural areas life was traditional and hard. Relationships were formed with those who lived close by; there is much drama over the theft of some apples from an orchard.\nI am blessed to watch this three movies of \"The Apu Trilogy\" by Satyajit Ray, which enhence me a lot. These are among the most beautiful, richly human movies ever made-essential works for any film lover. It would move even the most still of hearts, the impact is felt well after the film's conclusion. One powerful technique Ray uses is to have the camera on the faces of two people simultaneously where one is aware of the shocking event while the other is blissfully ignorant.",

The film's use of natural light and its ability to convey the essence of the land and its people are truly extraordinary.In conclusion, Pather Panchali is a film that should not be missed.
