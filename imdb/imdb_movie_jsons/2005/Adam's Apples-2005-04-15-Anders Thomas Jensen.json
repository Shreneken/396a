And then, there's Adam's Apples.If you want to watch a movie that takes some of the most depressing, horrible things you can think of, and makes them absolutely hilarious, this is the movie for you.I won't spoil much of the story, as watching what unexpectedly happens throughout is one of the pleasures of the movie. It begins with a priest named Ivan driving an unrepentant neo-Nazi named Adam from prison to the church where he will be performing his community service. Ivan gives Adam the choice of one goal to set for himself to complete, before he leaves. Ivan, completely uncaring, chooses to make an apple pie from the apple tree outside the church, once they are ripe.From there, things quickly get out of hand. Let's just say that the sensitive need not apply.\u00a0I recommend Adam's Apples to people with a dark sense of humor, who are fine with laughing at incredibly inappropriate (yet incredibly amusing) things. This movie was made for people like you and me.\u00a0I'm not referring to low-brow humor. This is a different animal. An utterly unique (as far as my experience goes), intelligent comedy that ultimately brings sunshine forth from some of the darkest clouds you've ever seen (both figuratively and literally).",

            "review_title": "A Job well done",
            "content": "This was a wonderful surprise at the (Cleveland) CIFF, a well-made dark comedy.Adam is a neo-Nazi on a sort of Danish \"probation for reprobates\", where society's sinners are given a gradual re-introduction to public life under the guidance of Ivan, a parish minister. Adam needs to negotiate a \"program\" for his several weeks stay; despite his efforts at being arch and cynical Ivan takes him totally in seriousness, setting \"baking an apple pie\" as Adam's goal. A battle of wills ensues between Adam and Ivan, with wonderful comedic support from Gunnar (Nicolas Bro in another wonderful role) the ex-tennis player and Khalid (Ali Kazim) as a not-yet-reformed terrorist.Everyone is coping here, but the central character is clearly Ivan (perhaps the funniest I've seen Mads Mikkelsen!). He comes across as \"Pangloss\" with a twist: \"everything is for the best\" in this world only in that the devil conspires to make everything a test of man's faith. He is completely deluded yet completely steadfast. This rational irrationality is perhaps the greatest challenge to Adam; no matter what he does Ivan retains his faith\u0085to a point where the comedy simply takes another course.Not to give away the delight of this comedy's surprises, the characters cope with life, each other, are exasperated and exasperating, consistently inconsistent\u0085the trials of Job are well played out in this barely disguised absurdist romp.",

            "review_title": "The Bible twisted and gnarled",
            "content": "It is a simple but effective film. In spite of the fact that it is a rewriting of the Book of Job, the film conveys interesting questions. We totally have to forget about who is torturing the poor minister, God or Satan. That's not the question. The question is that his attitude is determined by what he believes. He believes he is being tortured by the devil and that is enough to justify the final miracle of the end of his cancer with a single gunshot. What is important is that, no matter what he believes, he follows a road of truthfulness and he brings comfort to extreme cases of a-social people. The apple tree then becomes a cross between the Book of Genesis in which the apple tree is the tree of knowledge and wisdom but absolutely out of reach due to one of God's ukases and that Book of Job I was citing before. The newcomer being called Adam the allusion is obvious. That tree is God's tree. Then all the attacks he suffers can only come from the snake, Satan, the devil. The point is that the plagues that tree suffers are quite reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt. That's where we meet with Job. God is not only planning the future ahead but he is also testing his servants by torturing them and the plagues come from God and the silly mortals around that tree have to make penance because they are punished by God and tested by God and they have to go away or keep their faith. And they just do so. Adam will make a small apple pie with the last scavenged apple of the tree and he will share that apple pie with the minister Ivan, a direct allusion that has to be designed so to Adam and Eve, or here Adam and Ivan. But after that episode they are not rejected by the parish, they can come back to their little piece of Christian paradise in a world of squalor, the two of them and yet they won't make many children but they will welcome the lost errant children of god. And guess what: they welcome two men together coming from some prison, Abel and Cain of course, and the world can go on turning. Bad of course, but turning all the same.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

            "content": "Anders Thomas Jensen may be the most interesting danish director/scriptwriter in recent times, and this movie certainly proves it. The neo-nazi Adam (Ulrich Thomsen) is sent to resocialization at a local church with a priest who can't do anything but turn the other cheek. In a religious context he relive the life and destiny of Job who's punished by God. This could very well have been an abstract and far-our movie, however Thomas Jensen has the ability to make it understandable, humorous and very entertaining, while keeping the love and respect of the religious story. He also has the ability to make the audience reflect the content, by providing black humour, quickly followed by caring tragedy. One might not always know why one laughs. Following the success of Blinkende Lygter and the not-so-great De Gr\u00f8nne Slagtere, Thomas Jensen places this story in between, by providing a black comedy with a great mind.",

            "content": "Anders Thomas Jensen has with his earlier films, \"De gr\u00f8nne slagtere\" and \"Blinkende lygter\", convinced the audience of his scriptwriting talents, especially his distinct sense of dark humour. \"Adams \u00e6bler\", clearly a more ambitious project, is now gaining him recognition as a director with a vision. Apart from merely being amusing and intriguing as a comedy, the film succeeds in communicating a meaningful message to the audience, while being deep and sufficiently complex in its values. Indeed, the film's central theme questions our central notion of good and evil without giving definite conclusions: whether there really exist absolute values is eventually left unanswered. Which is better of the two: the blindly devoted and fanatically optimistic priest Ivan or the nihilistic neo-Nazi Adam? Jensen attempts to twist the basic setting by making Ivan appear rather unsympathetic: while he helps people as a priest, he doesn't seem to do it because of them but rather because of his faith alone. It is often Adam, who notices this, not failing to observe (almost objecting to) the weaknesses of Ivan's behaviour, and yes, it is the cold-hearted, evil Adam who seems to care more and more as the story goes on.It is difficult to sum up the whole film with only a couple of words. Mixing biblical allegories, especially the story of Job (the Fall being also an essential part of the film, yet not actually in the plot itself), with modern drama and dark comedy, Adams \u00e6bler does not fit into traditional categories. As a comedy, it doesn't straightforwardly tell what to laugh at, but the humorous is intertwined with absolutely serious elements. Thus the movie examines the outskirts of comedy and humour: it encourages the viewer to ponder whether the events are humorous or not. Even the music doesn't correspond with the comedy genre at all, but is constantly foreboding and solemn. It is a versatile film, but despite the exceptional blend, it succeeds in keeping the story together. And it's a good story.Characters are well built and well played. Ulrich Thomsen gives perhaps his best performance to date as Adam (challenged only by his role in Festen), and so does Mads Mikkelsen as Ivan. Nicolas Bro, Ali Kazim and Paprika Steen must also be commended for their roles. Bro is a kleptomaniac and a drunkard, Kazim plays an immigrant Robin Hood gone bad, and Paprika Steen delivers a steady performance as an unbalanced future mother considering abortion. Special mention goes to Ole Thestrup as the devilishly comical (almost malicious, though we are not quite sure) Dr. Kolberg, who, while joking with his patients misfortunes in lovable dialect and showing virtually no respect to any taboos, fails to demonstrate signs of empathy or other proper human feelings. \"He's done for. You could use him as a crapper. Have you had coffee?\" As to its thematics, the film is utterly uncompromising: in its treatment of today's starkest evils, it never offers an apology or a clear moral; the final return towards the acceptable, so frequent in the comedy genre, doesn't quite occur. Instead, none of the problems are resolved or even discussed properly \u0096 rather, they are laughed at. As in his earlier films and as many of his Danish colleagues have been doing, Jensen is examining the limits of comedy \u0096 how far can one go in making fun of sensitive matters such as abuse, rape, violence, racism, disability and so on. Jensen is a provocateur: he discusses ugly subjects with little discretion, avoiding compromises. Like Dr. Kolberg, he wants to talk about things with their real names and discuss them as they are. But in addition, the comedy genre allows him to treat these issues openly.It's about the battle between good and evil: Ivan sees only the good, Adam only the evil. Ivan tries to make Adam see the good, Adam attempts to force Ivan into seeing the evil around him. Ivan preaches about the distinction between good and evil, pointing out how much the modern world is in confusion with these terms and how much our common conceptions have changed with time. This is ironical, because the movie questions the whole distinction: in other words, it questions the consequences of the fall (not uncommon in Danish lay theology). While not making an actual statement, it points out that good and evil are, at least to a great extent, constructs of society and dependant on the point of view. On the other hand, by making Ivan absolutely blind to misfortunes in his life, it illustrates how it is possible to see good in everything, and close ones eyes from everything bad.Adams \u00e6bler is a very interesting movie. It entertains, shocks, provokes, and finally, redeems. Whether this redemption is favourable as such, is left to the viewer to judge. All in all, it's an absolutely surprising masterwork, one of the rare gems. 8/10.",

            "content": "'Adam's Apples', a 2005 film by Danish director Anders Thomas Jensen, abounds in religious symbols. The main characters are named Adam and Ivan (resonating close to Eve), the story takes place in and around a church, Ivan is a priest, (numerous) Bibles fall down and always open to the Book of Job, and an apple tree loaded with fruit will play an important role in the story. But this is not about Paradise, the characters are rather confronted with the Devil and their own demons. It is an original and interesting film, which highlights the conflicts between faith and non-believers, between reality and imagination as a mechanism of self-defense against the hardships of life. It is a film with strange and unfortunate characters, and it is one of those Danish comedies in which the absurd, the grotesque and the sublime coexist well together.Adam in this movie (Ulrich Thomsen) is a neo-Nazi, a violent and rude man, who does not hide his opinions and brutally cuts through any situation. Fresh out of prison, he must serve a probationary period of public service in the parish of the priest Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen). Gunnar (Nicolas Bro), a former tennis champion who fell into alcoholism, and Khalid (Ali Kazim), a refugee from a Muslim country and a gas station robber, are also here. Ivan seems at first to be a model preacher who strives to bring sinners on the right path through sermons and socially useful activities, but we soon begin to understand that his reality is not the same as the one seen by those around him and especially by Adam, and that the struggle with Satan preached in sermons has a much more concrete embodiment in his person.'Adam's Apples' is one of those films in which the story is more of an allegory and less a faithful and immediate reflection of reality, but that does not mean that the characters are abstract or belong to the realm of fantasy. On the contrary, each of them is far from stereotypes, has a life and a complexity that avoids patterns. Ivan, Adam, Gunnar, Khalid, Sarah - the woman asking for the priest's advice about an abortion - and the old former guard in a concentration camp gradually reveal themselves to the spectators and each becomes something else than what they seem at first sight. Acting is exceptional, Mads Mikkelsen formidable as always being matched with the right partners in this film. The cinematography signed by Sebastian Blenkov creates a seemingly idyllic setting of a Danish rural area which at key moments turns into threatening. Of the Anders Thomas Jensen films I've seen so far, 'Adam's Apples' seems to me the most impressive.",

In and around this church, Anders Thomas Jensens unleashes an outright war of good and evil in a story full of black humor that leaves the viewer little choice but to laugh tears. Ole Thestrup as the local doctor beats everybody and everything in terms of comic morbidity.And yet behind all comedy, Adams \u00c6bler discusses much more serious issues. Is not Ivan's naive (in danish the perfect anagram: naiv Ivan) denial of evil more dangerous and irresponsible than Adam's evil, but realistic attitude? While Ivan suggests as Adam's project to bake an apple pie, Adam is set out to break Ivans faith in God. The audience is seriously in doubt as to which project will be accomplished and what comes after that. In the pursuit of both projects, Ivan and Adam change places and take responsibility in very surprising and strange ways. This story is told with perfect timing and moving gravity realised by great actors.Despite all praise, I have one problem with this movie: I did not get the pun about the \"Adam's Apple\". Why make this play of words without making use of it in the story? And while I'm at it, the last scene should have been left out. Adam becomes ... well no, I won't spoil it.",

            "content": "There was a recent report that stated that Denmark is the happiest country in the world. We all know that a good sense of humor leads to a happier life, and, based upon Adam's Apples and other films I have seen from Denmark, the Danes surely lead the way in exhibiting a sardonic, biting humor that is often very dark but not the least bit destructive.This little film draws much of its inspiration from the Book of Job and places it in a modern context with a witty touch of dark, dark humor. Adam is a neo-Nazi who has been released from prison to enter a work program run by Ivan, a country minister. Ivan is exasperatingly optimistic and doesn't seem to be able to acknowledge any real evil in the world. Adam - the personification of hate and evil - seeks to destroy Ivan in any way he can.Adam is added to a motley crew being sheltered - and supposedly reformed - by Ivan. Gunnar is a gluttonous thief who surely is not on the path to reform as he just sits around all day eating whenever he is not stealing from someone at the rectory. Khalid is a Pakistani radical who sees himself as a modern-day Robin Hood who hates Denmark and all Danes and wishes to get out of the country. Sarah is a confused and desperate pregnant girl.The men supposedly have duties at the rectory and church which will help them reform and follow productive paths. Adam is given the job of caring for the pride of the garden - an apple tree. Needless-to-say, Adam totally shirks his responsibility because he has developed a manic desire to destroy Ivan.Another wry character in this tongue-in-cheek delight of a film is Dr. Kolberg who supposedly takes care of Ivan's health issues. It is disclosed fairly early in the film that Ivan has a brain tumor and has little time to live. Dr. Kolberg is definitely not your gentle, loving family doctor. This character is great fun.Adam is played to perfection by Ulrich Thomsen in a beautifully understated fashion. Mads Mikkelsen as Ivan has the looks that fulfilled the idea of a Danish minister and an off-the-cuff manner in his portrayal that is absorbing.Even with its dark comic nature, Adam's Apples is also a fascinating drama and an enlightening look at good, evil, and the power of faith.",

Right next to the best of directors (without further comparison) like Lars Von Trier, Nicolas Winding Refn and Thomas Vinterberg. I fully believe that this film deserves all ten shining stars. I will recommend it to everyone who appreciates films with a certain visual and emotional freshness and impact. With \"Adams \u00c6bler\", Anders Thomas Jensen has made his, of my opinion, best movie yet. By far. His Last two movies, especially the first one, \"Blinkende luger\", was very entertaining, but this one moves beyond.With his brilliant authenticity in the character of the troubled reverend, Mads Mikkelsen (\"pusher\", \"bleeder\", \"blinkende luger\", \"de gr\u00f8nne slagtere\") rises up from just being a good bi-actor, to becoming a complete artist of performance. Together with Ulrich Thomsen who plays the Nazi on re-socialization, he carries the viewers through a fresh, shocking, dark, utterly intelligent, and exceptionally both humorous and psychological experience.Being more than rich on nerve-shattering imagery, great performances, and a very well crafted story, this film also leads a sharp edged, underlying parallel to an ancient story that comes to life in the film, and ends in a brilliant paradoxical way.

Ivan can turn the other cheek to beat the band, but seems deeply disconnected from the world around him--for good reason, as we learn during the film's second act. (He also has a character tic echoed by Mikkelsen's later role as Le Chiffre in Casino Royale.) Adam's Apples also features stunning cinematography by Sebastian Blenkov, who uses over-saturated colours to lend the film a touch of the fantastic.

            "content": "The premise of this movie seemed simple enough, about Neo Nazi called Adam (Ulrich Thomsen) being sentenced to community service at a church. A priest, Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen), informs Adam that in order to complete his hours of service, he must have a goal in mind. And that goal actually turned out unexpectedly, as a passing remark, to be as banal as baking an apple pie, with apples found in the apple tree grown on the church's premises.Written and directed by Danish filmmaker Anders Thomas Jensen, Adam's Apples is a black comedy about God and the mysterious ways in which He works. Sometimes He does things in an indirect manner, in order for you to explore and find out exactly what He wants you to do. Or He might intent to pose some challenges in order to shake you up, or have a sublime message in which you are to learn from.Adam didn't have it easy, as in his opinion, it is as if God was punishing him by making things extremely difficult. Weird stuff kept happening with nary a warning, like having crows infest the tree and eating away at the apples, or by having worms invade from within. All these clue Adam that perhaps he wasn't meant to finish serving his time as soon as possible, but rather has to find meaning in the extended period of time of him being at the church.The story actually got more interesting when the audience is introduced to the host of quirky characters who seek refuge at the grounds, such as Khalid (Ali Kazim) the Pakistani with a thing for robbing petrol kiosks, and Gunnar (Nicolas Bro), the fat kleptomaniac. And the plot actually allowed more to ponder upon, with the Bible playing a key plot device with its reference to the Book of Job - is there a modern biblical reference to Ivan, or is he living one himself?But no worries about this portion of the plot getting too stifling for comfort. While it actually had a really dead serious mood throughout, there is plenty of comedy delivered, which came at times, fast and furious, but yet still maintained that deadpan feel, as if these comedic situations happened as \"a matter of fact\"-ly. Certain (violent) scenes stood out and made you think about how those shots were actually achieved.Watching the movie actually made me wonder about the existence of an omnipotent being, and actually had this uncanny feel good factor about it at the end.

Despite Adam being a thoroughly unrepentant neo-Nazi, Ivan seems oblivious to the evil man who he's agreed to care for...as well as two other rather screwed up criminals he's already caring for at his church. Through the course of the film, Adam is amazed that Ivan has the most horrible life on Earth...yet he is bizarrely optimistic and happy. Even when Adam nearly beats Ivan to death, Ivan is still idealistic to the point of insanity. What gives? And, what does making an apple pie have to do with all this?!Technically speaking, the film is well made and the acting good. I was also impressed by how all this ended.

            "content": "Having known next to nothing about Danish cinema (except for Lars von Trier, perhaps), the film took me by surprise. I spent an agitated 90 minutes laughing my head off and silently praying, 'oh please, don't make this into an educational film, pretty please with sugar on top...' Given the plot outline, it was not difficult to imagine a 'bad guy turned into a good guy' storyline that allows us to shed the two tears Kundera described in his account of kitsch. However, think twice with the likes of Anders Thomas Jensen. The taciturn neo-Nazi, Adam, scheduled for community service at a parish in the middle of nowhere, enters a bizarre world of deranged minds, malicious birds and human beings who just wouldn't die. At the outset, one may read the characters as a company of outcasts - a priest who has conditioned himself to block out negative aspects of reality, a tennis prodigy turned kleptomaniac, a seemingly incontinent ex-Nazi, a robber harboring the fallacy of taking money from multinational corporations by means of robbing Statoil gas stations, a woman pregnant with a retarded baby - they all seem to inhabit the fictional space of the film because they might find it difficult to function within the human society (a theme portrayed, in a less subtle way, in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest). However, we are constantly reminded that what unfolds before us is not a realist narrative. Be it the neo-Nazi who walks grumpily away, being shot twice through the chest, the phlegmatic, malicious birds who decide to plague the apple tree, the Bible that always opens on the same page (uhm...some books actually tend to do that) or the priest who survives a shot through the head - these and other unreal occurrences provide for a genre shift. Together with a series of bizarre situations, all portrayed as relatively mundane happenings, the film creates an atmosphere quite akin to the books of the great magical realist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. As the story becomes liberated from the constraints of realist narratives, we as viewers are allowed to laugh in a light-hearted way. We are no longer watching a realist odyssey (and, consequently, there is no such catharsis as for instance with Lars von Trier's Dancer In The Dark); rather than that, the film provides an opaque screen where we project our own emotions. Since the movie presents bizarre or unreal occurrences in a matter-of-fact way, one finds it difficult to ascribe a clear, definite meaning to them. One is thus forced to create one's own meaning, or abolish the idea of 'meaning' altogether (as it often happens with magical realist texts). Some reviewers admit feeling guilty while laughing in the course of the film. My laughter, on the other hand, was liberating and quite unstoppable. The movie is a magical realist take on the Book of Job - and a hilarious one, at that.",

The acting is superb and the performances are even more powerful due to a relatively small amount of characters. Anders Thomas Jensen does not spell things out for you: you are free to think what you want about religion, stereotypes, unwavering optimism or criminal behaviour.

The skinhead might hate Pakistanis, but he has nothing against cats. Khalid(Ali Kazim) shoots skinheads, too, but we sense that he's apolitical. He'll shoot anybody, or anything. After all, he shot a cat.Adam Petersen(Ulrich Thomsen) intimidates. Bald people are intimidating, especially if you're a skinhead and out on parole. Ivan(Mads Mikkelsen) is the minister that takes him in. Ivan, however, can't be intimidated, because he's crazy. He has a brain tumor. According to Adam, the minister is Job. Every time his bible falls to the floor, it lands on the Book of Job. The skinhead, the Pakistani, and Gunnar(Nicolas Bro), a recovering rapist, are supposed to be saved by God, with Ivan serving as his conduit. But the minister can't even save himself. \"Adam's aebler\" tells the story of how Adam helps reconcile the co-existence of evil and God, apparently, by baking an apple pie.The film isn't shy about using bible imagery. There it is, an apple tree, ripped straight out of the pages of Genesis, a tree that's struck by lightning and catches on fire. The stove also catches on fire. Ivan was right. God is preventing Adam from baking an apple pie. Maybe he's Job, not Ivan, because he's certainly not Adam in the Garden of Eden, because Sarah(Paprika Steen) eats seven apples without doing herself any harm.There's a happy ending to \"Adam's aebler\", but it's a bumpy ride.

You'll do all four, while wondering which reaction the director intended. In the end, you find that the story supports all these reactions. Seemingly bizarre actions and statements from the characters are revealed to in fact fit into a sensible context, and the beauty of the setting and cinematography, at first contrasted against the jarring characters, grows to encompass the beauty of their revealed humanity.The story follows a rural pastor who offers his church as a half-way house for released prisoners. The pastor asks our newcomer (Adam) to set a personal goal, as the others have done, and he's meant to ease back into society while pursuing it. His goal involves the plentiful apples growing on the church grounds. But we soon wonder if the pastor, or perhaps his few parishioners, are in more trouble than the prisoners are.The film is brilliantly inspired in concept and story, playing out like a fable. Be prepared for bits of violence, mostly stemming from Adam's skinhead past, but also be aware that the film offers hope for its cure.This is a top-level Danish film, which says a lot. Go see it.",

The pastor works with him on his goal to bake an apple pie from the fruit on a tree on the premises. As the story is revealed, we find out the pastor may have more problems than the violent neo-nazi whom he's trying to help recover. The prisoner finds out he has a son that is paralyzed but the pastor refuses to believe this fact and when confronted with the truth he bleeds from his ear. The local doctor informs the neo-nazi that the pastor can die if too much truth about his actual life is revealed and we find out that he also has cancer and could die anytime. This mixed-up perspective is what makes this movie so intriguing. The pacing is perfect for the story as we are presented with other characters who also live at the church(most of them placed there for comic relief) and of the course the character of the apple tree which keeps being invaded by crows. This wonderful relationship movie helps us to see that all people need help and the ex-prisoner eventually becomes the one that helps and in a way that helps him.

He is accompanied by the pugilistic neo-Nazi Adam, the thieving Gunnar, and the would-be terrorist Khalid. An apple tree outside the church offers Adam the chance to complete a constructive task - baking a pie - but the apple tree is beset by misfortune. The storyline will be enough to make the most unshockable squirm and includes jokes about disability, rape, and cruelty to animals just for starters. Whether you feel the end justifies the means or you plump on the side of condemning it as bad taste may be to do with your sensibilities and how you look at such issues.For all his professed piety, Ivan can sometimes seem a little heartless. An elderly man who needs the loo during a sermon is subjected to much sermonising in an extended joke about holding it in before allowed to go and use the toilet (but not the church one). The only woman in the story is hysterical Sarah, who seeks Ivan's solace after getting herself pregnant. The child has a chance of being disabled. Ivan regales her with the story of how they had the same worry over his own child, but now he delights every day to see him running around. When Sarah discovers that Ivan's child is really paralysed, she feels betrayed. It transpires that much of Ivan's world is a fantasy based on a belief in the goodness of everything. The gossiping doctor explains how Ivan's wife didn't die accidentally but committed suicide. Ivan was raped by his father. Psychologically, Ivan is in denial about almost everything, and this poses the question, Is religion a form of denial of the harsh reality of the world?Adam's bible is one of the few things in his room apart from a picture of Adolf. Each time the door slams, the picture falls off the wall and the bible falls on the floor, always falling open at the same place - the Book of Job. If you are well up on your Old Testament, you will probably recognise the film as an extended essay or modern version of Job. This is the book with the lines made famous by many cinematic funerals, \"Man that is born of woman is of a few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.\"In the original, Job's afflictions are a test of his faith, which is how Ivan translates every misfortune, even when he is beaten up by Adam. The ultimate point is probably that goodness is valuable of itself - whether as a way of life or as a virtue - and whether or not it is always appreciated. (This maybe holds true whether you support the parable with a religious context or not.) Ivan's 'goodness' certainly endures adversity, although many might suggest it is really a self-righteous stupidity. Ivan does not have the self-possessed humanity that marks any sort of 'Gotterdammerung' or humanist moral high ground. This is Adam's point, who gets a gun to scare \"the goodness sh*t\" out of Ivan. He tells him that God really hates Ivan, and that's why all the bad stuff is happening. Is Adam the devil tempting Ivan, or just a realist trying to get him to admit his hypocrisy?Adam's Apples boasts good production values and excellent acting. Its style of humour is the thing that will divide people. Dark humour is a cornerstone of Danish cinema, from Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration to von Trier's Boss of It All and even including Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself, which Jensen wrote: but in all these examples, the humour directs us to feel uncomfortable about jokes that are 'politically incorrect' and hurtful, or are handled with a sensitivity towards the victims. Adam's Apples, on the other hand, seemed to have little redemptive concern for those groups who are the butt of jokes, whether women, Muslims, or people with Down's syndrome. Funny and cleverly-written they are, and the audience mostly laughed throughout, but they are heartless. I was pleased that a gag about Sarah being trussed up and probably raped at least didn't elicit laughter from the Scottish audience at the screening I went to; I wondered how reactions would differ in different countries and continents.Adam's Apples is a clever film but not nearly half as clever as it would seem. Biblical allusions to stoicism in the face of adversity work better in the original Old Testament, and the racist, sexist and homophobic jokes (whilst acceptable to O.T. morality) are less tenable by enlightened standards.Whenever Ivan is driving, he plays the BeeGees' \"How Deep Is Your Love\". He does indeed perhaps find some light in his deepest, darkest hour, but this reviewer might be tempted to leave him to it.",

They are really great to follow, even if their characters' actions make you shrug your shoulders, or some jokes or scenes are just above/your comprehension.

Jensen has watched too much Tarantino and fails in bringing the \"funny killing\" to his own movie. It's just out of place.Besides, the characters are caricatures, meaning they have no depth and are only there to give us our laughs.

It's a funny, odd film which mixes a handful of characters with diverse backgrounds together, including a priest who has some farfetched religious beliefs, a neo-nazi inmate on probation, a terrorist trying to save up enough money to leave the country, and a former alcoholic. The film takes some risks in terms of offending the audience, but even though the characters are far out there, it simultaneously has enough restraint so that it doesn't go too far and, as a result, it makes for a surprisingly enjoyable experience. The solid twin performances from Mikkelsen and Thomsen enhance the material as well. Also, bonus points for having some unexpected outcomes to a few character arcs since comedies tend to struggle with this. For the most part, the religious themes were pretty good as well. As the film goes on, it seems less likely that the misfortunes the church's apple tree goes through are just coincidences but actually brought about by a deity. Given that, my interpretation is that the film is a modern day rendition of the Book of Job. I do think it loses its way a bit as it moves to its ending though since the priest's restored faith doesn't feel entirely earned. Unlike in the Book of Job which has a more complete character arc, this film's arc is more akin to the characters finally outsmarting God and then turning back to him, which doesn't make as much sense. Still though, it's a really good film and I enjoyed my time with it.",

But the real stand out here is Mads Mikkelsen's insanely scarred priest adding another unforgettable performance to his resume. On the negative side sometimes things get so bizarre that make almost no sense, and I think Ulrich Thomsen doesn't make for a very convincing neo-nazi, he lacks some gravitas and menace that are necessary to portray such a strong character.

The church is run by a timid and deluded Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen) who suffers a brain tumour, the loss of his wife, his son having cerebral palsy, and a history of sexual abuse. Ivan runs the church with several other troubled people - those with alcohol issues, terrorist sympathies, and anxiety.Ivan has his head very much in the clouds, thinking that the Devil has it out for him, and has vowed to live the word of God at all costs - even at the expense of rational thinking.Adam is too hard nosed for this, and believes that most issues in life are very much human in nature - and he tries hard to break the thin veil that Ivan has placed around himself. Once the veil is pulled away, Adam quickly realises that it was Ivan who kept the others at the church in check.Adam is blown away by how these people live, however after witnessing their delusions and new heartaches they suffer, and see how they all stand by each other and come out the other end almost better for it, he too comes to accept their humble ways.The comedy in this film is very very dark - I love Danish writers for this. The subject matter is things that no one should be laughing at, and you find yourself confused and ashamed at why you are laughing at all. The indifference of the characters to some of the chaos and intense scenes adds to the humour all around.Mikkelsen, Bro and Lie Kaas together are always great - they are good friends in real life and their chemistry on screen is always entertaining.
