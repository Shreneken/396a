            "content": "I'm gradually becoming less and less surprised when I see a foreign film that's every bit as good as those produced by Americans or the Brits. This was my first Turkish film, and for those of you struggling to find it, I would direct you to Youtube where you can find it in it's entirety with English subtitles. As the translated title suggests, the story is about a man struggling to come to terms with a father who disowned him, and his feelings of growing away from his own seven year old son. The back story of Sadik's (Fikret Kuskan) personal history does not fully come to light until well into the picture, when we learn that he became an anarchist journalist, much to the dismay of his father, who had designs for his son to take over the family farm upon attaining an agricultural degree. For viewers with a Turkish background, the conflict that resulted in Sadik's jail time and torture will probably be understood better within the context of that country's history, so for someone like myself, a lot of that perspective is lost. However that doesn't affect the impact of the story when it's finally revealed that Sadik's reconciliation with his father occurred because of his impending death due to a pulmonary edema condition. The man did a noble thing for his own son Deniz (Ege Tanman) by returning him to the village of Sadik's childhood to remain with family and friends. I would challenge the viewer to maintain a dry eye as the mystery of father/grandfather Huseyin's (\u00c7etin Tekindor) 'secret room' reveals Sadim's happy and hopeful youth before he left his family. One comes away from the film with a serene sense of family bond that transcends nationality, as in the end, we are all humans subject to the same emotions of love and loyalty.",

            "content": "A masterpiece that must be seen by everyone!It's the better film I have seen so far. It's not only about the relationships between fathers and sons, or the sequences from a coup d' etat, especially against leftist people. There are a lot of things and ideas included. For example the attitude of a former lover, wounded, married to another man, but still carrying. Its an insight to the human relationships as a whole, the role of the family in Mediterranean countries. This does not mean that people from the North for example will not understand or will not be moved. But the situations depicted, fit especially to Turks, or Greeks (like me), or perhaps Italians. The director is really one of the highest class. I had previously watched his later film Issiz Adam (Always alone), and I was so impressed that I looked for another of his movies, so I found this film. I found very good the actor who played the young boy. I was really shocked from the scene of the father regretting for his behavior, it looked very much like a Greek ancient tragedy. Also the music of the film was excellent. Everyone must see this film. Not only he will like it, but I am sure that he will be moved.",

            "content": "The movie starts on the days of military government, which started Sep.12th, 1980, and lasted 3 years (Effects of this action against democracy lasted more than 15 years). A young socialist newspaper writer (Fikret Kuskan) loses his wife on birth of his only son on the very first day of the military action, because he can not find any help for delivery of the child. After 6 years past, the father was desperate to find any jobs on the papers, which are now supporters of the new order, and decides to return his father (\u00c7etin Tekindor)'s home in a small village near Izmir: A house that he has left years ago fighting his father's wills to make him a person that his father would like him to be.I can not even summarize the rest of the movie, since one should see the movie himself/herself to understand the encounters of two strangers, father and son. One should notice the mother (Humeyra)'s role on the relationship (or non-relationship) of these two different men, and the grandson (Ege Tanman).If you have a Mediterrenean blood, Greek, Italian, whatever, you will find many things in this movie. You don't have to be Turk to understand the emotional rivers in this movie. It really touches hearts of the Turkish people.",

I must admit that before watching this masterpiece I was a bit skeptical about it being a drama because most dramas I have seen evolve around irrelevant topics - but this movie will change the way you think.The story is so heartwarming and real that it will move you far beyond anything you have probably ever experienced before. The actors do such an amazing job that you will sympathize with them and might indulge in some crying even if you are a male.Even if you don't cry this movie will touch you and will make you think about your own life.Movies that are able to and make you REFLECT and THINK about yourself, for my taste, are part of the best movies of all time because their messages are delivered in a way so that you will never forget them.Go see this movie and vote because this is not only the best Turkish movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made.",

A very good choice of cast is the most powerful criterion of the success of the movie. Humeyra, the grandmother is a very talented woman in acting. Emotional scenes become more frequent while we see the movie to get to the end. Unfortunate events make the Turkish people get closer to each other. The movie shows that perfectly. Hospitality, love, grief, laughs... Everything is included in this movie. An emotional breakthrough. The movie also points on the elderly reality -now an impossibility- the torture, made by the cops.Better to be watched by fathers and sons. Also, crying may occur, don't worry; too many people who watched the movie had the same.",

Every person I know who had the chance to watch this wonderful movie have cried -especially during the second half.. I applause everyone involved in the production of this magnificent piece of work.. Really brilliant work, presenting some top-notch performances (esp by Humeyra and Cetin Tekindor) and a clever collection of spectacular moments. No special effects, no superhuman strengths no fantastic landscapes.. Just human and the ordinary feelings. I felt some rush to call my mom and dad just after the movie to be sure that they are OK and to make them know once again that I really care about them. This movie makes you think deeper on values that make us human and also etches itself irreversibly to your memory by touching the deepest possible regions of your soul.. Highly recommended; a must-see! Do not forget your tissue papers because you probably will not be able to keep your tears from flowing...Thanks Cagan Irmak, and continue to blow our minds away..",

Everything is perfect, direction, photography, acting, you cannot help but feel for its characters and identify with them, especially if you share the same location in the map, similarities in history and personality traits.I loved the child actor, he can make you smile and cry, but also the whole movie is about feelings, pain, sadness, anger, love, forgiveness and most important the joy of life.Another strong point is the music, made by the Greek composer Euanthia Reboutsika. Gave the movie wholeheartedly a 10 rating! I wish there were more of its kind.",

Deniz \u00c7etin Tekindor ... H\u00fcseyin Fikret Kuskan ... Sadik H\u00fcmeyra ... Babanne Serif Sezer ... Teyze Yetkin Dikinciler ... SalimI Salute them all. I have always despised the entertainment industry, most of all the Film industry, at the back of my mind, though I fancy a career there. I have always thought that half the money that goes into movie production or theatres or things like that could feed so many people out there or give them a job, get a living for them.If someone's going to bring to the screen a movie like Babam ve Oglum, I'd never ever utter a single word against the industry. You won't believe that one movie can affect you so much for the moment that you, even if you haven't cried since 5th grade, would be overwhelmed so much that you'd cry more than the characters on screen. Especially when you watch it alone, without anyone to distract you from the scenes. I have never felt the urge to cry for a long time. This movie reminded me of a lot of things that were hidden in me, that I strongly urge everyone who has had even a glance of this page to watch it at any cost. A must watch movie.Apart from the Director, who deserves to be recognized at the highest level, I must mention a few words about the background score. NO other BGM I have heard has ever got even close to this. . Out of this World.Finally, Coming to the story, this movie is about a father, who, after the loss of his wife, takes his little son back to his hometown (from where he had run away, defying his dad) because he suffers from a lung disorder. He wants to ensure that his child has a home when he's gone, and decides to confront his father and tell him about his condition and reconcile one final time before the final goodbye. And the characters portray the situations and experiences so convincingly that I couldn't help but put their names on top of this post.I am sure that this will remain my most favourite movie of all time for a long time to come.Bravo.",

            "content": "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It's a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country's history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it's still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it'll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It's well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i'm afraid. Similarly, the film doesn't give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry's heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don't know if it's true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn't even be noticed by someone who wasn't around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It's worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role.",

The life from a 7-8 yo kid's eyes gather things in a three-generational dimension.... There are many scenes that are going to be remembered long.. The first encountering of the kid and grandfather is really touchy.. The blood is thicker than water.. This is what so called about a FAMILY..By the way\u0085 for the international audience..

            "content": "A huge hit on its first release in 2005, BABAM VE O\u011eLUM (MY FATHER AND MY SON) is an unabashed melodrama with the emphasis on excess.The story is a straightforward one: Sad\u0131k (Fikret Ku\u015fkan) has to deliver his first child alone, when there is no one to take his wife Aysun (Tuba B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00fcst\u00fcn) to the hospital. The wife dies, leaving Sad\u0131k a single parent on the first day of the military coup taking place in the Republic of Turkey on 12 September 1980.Time passes: Sad\u0131k is imprisoned and tortured for his political views; but on his release, he leaves \u0130stanbul with his son Deniz (Ege Tanman) to return to the family home near \u0130zmir. He receives a frosty welcome from his father H\u00fcseyin (\u00c7etin Tekindor) who has never forgiven Sad\u0131k for quitting his studies in agriculture in \u0130stanbul and turning to politics instead. The rest of the movie focuses on the way familial relationships change, as well as how people cope with an unexpected tragedy.Director \u00c7a\u011fan Irmak looks at the oppressive influence of the past on the present; not only does it affect relationships between Sad\u0131k and H\u00fcseyin, but it significantly dictated Sad\u0131k's love-life too. Returning to his home-town, Sad\u0131k is at once attracted and repelled by its familiarity; those who have never left - even for a short time - remain blinkered in their world-views. On the other hand BABAM VE O\u011eLUM shows how families stick together in times of crisis, and can resolve their own problems so long as they are prepared to acknowledge them in the first place.The narrative contrasts Sad\u0131k's story with Deniz's imaginative fantasies, in which the little boy positions himself as the hero. In the first part of the film they can be read as a retreat from reality, as Deniz tries to cope with the trauma of moving to a new town and coping with a new life. By the end, however, he has discovered that such fantasies might change, once he grows up. They will remain fantasies, but they will fulfill a different function in his life.The film is full of major scenes of confrontation and reconciliation, with Irmak's camera-work designed to achieve maximum dramatic effect through the use of close-ups, panning shots, dissolves, and two- shots, complemented by a florid musical score (by Evanthia Reboutsika). Although the narrative celebrates excess - of emotion, of feeling and of reconciliation - it does not seem in any way forced. In fact, it is as convincing and emotion-provoking as the best Ye\u015fil\u00e7am melodramas of the past. Clearly Irmak planned BABAM VE O\u011eLUM as an homage to the genre, and he accomplishes his task with \u00e9lan. Definitely worth more than one viewing.",

I think it's due to the way Cagan Irmak (writer and director) cleverly and carefully blends everything. The movie is definitely not like a Hollywood production, maybe more like a European film. The film has many enjoyable moments but it's mainly emotional. The actings are magnificent, the story is heart-breaking and the places are so real. All performances were remarkable, but I should say I was over impressed by Cetin Tekindor's (Huseyin Aga) acting. While the bitter truths about life and family relations are portrayed perfectly, the movie also reflects life from the innocent eyes of a child. Personally, the local rural village life took me back to my some good memories. There is no need to tell what happens in the film as enough is said in the plot summary. More would only spoil it. But, it should be noted that even though the plot may sound political, the film is actually not.The movie came out without much advertising, but in short time became very popular - won many awards in Turkey and some in Europe. Not much to say... brilliant work. If you haven't seen it, I advise you watch it whenever possible. If you don't feel like crying in this movie, you will feel sorry for yourself.",

While acting wasn't spot on in a couple of places, mostly everybody has done a very good job and though it may appear that the actors are overacting you have to keep in mind that different cultures have different norms and different ways of expressing emotions.\"My Father and My Son\" is not groundbreaking, but It is both touching and humorous without falling in too many clich\u00e9s.

            "content": "As a Turkish viewer residing in the United Kingdom, promising word of mouth/reviews of Turkish films are always a delight for me to hear. After much hype and recommendation of Babam ve Oglum, I was pretty anxious to watch it.Babam ve Oglum deals with Father/Son relationships and is charged with story-values of Life/Death. The relationship and chemistry between Huseyin, Sadik and Deniz are not only believable but poignant. It is by far the strongest point of the film, and if I were to review this film on this aspect alone, I would have given it a 9/10. Unfortunately, the script and some misdirection provide crucial mistakes, with the former underpinning the films over melancholia.Despite the credible relationships and fantastic performances from the lead fathers and sons, the script implements clich\u00e9 and melancholic Acts that stray from believability and feel a tad forceful to elicit an emotional response from it's audience. It's partly reminiscent of the old H\u00fclya Ko\u00e7yi\u011fit, Turkan Soray type Turkish films. Whilst paying homage to old films is one thing, I felt this film unintentionally did that with some conventional, dated storytelling. I believe Turkish Cinema is currently evolving with directors such as Nuri Bile Ceylan, but conventions used in this movie is a step backwards.In terms of it's direction, it's got a nice classical feel which complements its Arch-Plot themes and even delivers absolute movie magic. The scene where Tarik has his first meal with his family coalesceds humour and drama in an accurate fashion. The scene of Sadik and Tarik's first night at their new home, is an undeniably sad moment. However, what contradicts these realistic, subtle scenes are Anti-plot elements such as the convenient collapse of Sadik at that very moment, or the hammy scene of when Huseyin demonstrated how he could have stopped Sadik from leaving before. Exposition is one thing, but be overly visual breaks the films realistic aspect, which is what worked in the first place. That is not to say the film cannot implement experimental features, the resolution of the boy confronting the notion that he has to deal with moving on without his father at the end, was a touching moment of the loss of a father.Overall, Babam ve Oglum is a good film but misses out on being a great film due to over-sentiments and melancholia. Had it maintained balance and stuck with a realistic/subtle direction, it would have been a fantastic film.",

He has been estranged from his conservative father since leaving for school in Istanbul. Intending to leave Deniz with his parents, his mother forces him to stay. The father and son struggle to come to terms in their relationship.This is digging into a deep family rift and finds a compelling movie. I would prefer Sadik to look more sickly when he arrives back at the village. It meanders as the plot lacks an obvious ticking clock. That's why Sadik's sickness should be played up to make his end more inevitable. It culminates with one oddly riveting emotional eruption by the father. It is breath-taking in its rawness. It helps that these actors are unknown to me which creates a realism despite the surreal emotional eruption.",

I love those moments when the film is over and i am sobbing & sniffing. I love it writing a film review with teary eyes and wrenched heart. After seeing more than Ten Top class Family dramas in Hollywood, Bollywood and Indian Cinema finally i found something which i can call 'The Best Family Drama Ever'. Family emotions were never so new and never so touching before. I know Emotional Family Drama is nothing new, it's the same old story but i don't know how this film managed to pull off the same old stuff with such a new and innovative way? My Father And My Son is story of Sadik who left his father and Mother years ago and now is blessed by a Child. He returns to his Father and Mother's house so that his Son can have a Home. See there is nothing new or outstanding in the plot but the storytelling is New and Outstanding. The way film is narrated by a Child who is living Real Life and Fantasy together, the way things are mixed up, the way memories from old days are used, the way Father and Son relationship is explored, everything is so Emotional and for a change so Clever. I don't remember watching such an intelligent narrative in this genre. All actors make this one look like a real family, they create thier place in your heart because every character is different in nature and you are forced to love them all. Background Music is so beautiful and mesmerizing, i could feel it in all those emotional moments. Direction is Top Notch. A rare case when i don't have any complaints to make. My Father and My Son is a story for everyone who love thier kids, fathers and thier family and that's why it is Universal subject. It would be shameful for you if you miss this MASTERPIECE..RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",

The role of the strong mother (H\u00fcmeyra) who is trying to do her best to retain the relation between her husband and her son into its normal course and how she is keen to get her family back together was brilliant that she make you cry and laugh in the same time. The father (\u00c7etin Tekindor) whose sorrow when he lost his son made me cry although I tried to control myself. The oldest brother (\u00c7etin Tekindor) his natural simplicity which he conducted in his role of a loving older brother whose ill youngest brother was being fed by his own hands while he is waiting for his destiny at the hospital. The little boy (Ege Tanman), no one can deny the ability of this young boy who is living in his dreams that his father is his hero even after his death, his maturity in acting is quite spectacular.

            "content": "Kenan Evren,the the leader of the coup d'etat on 12 September 1980 and the 7th president of Turkey let the cat out of the bag before a press member a couple of months ago:\"Under the same circumstances I would lead the same coup d'etat without hesitation.\" Naturally the DA opened an investigation but the gory leader of the 80s saved himself based on recently made constitutional changes related to \"freedom of speech\". What's ironical is that he was saved by some concept he repressed for years.I am not necessarily a member of Generation Y which could understand the sufferings of the period better but I know what a coup d'etat is and what it did to the people of this country.Kenan Evren and his troupe(!) of force commanders which were named \"our boys\" in the CIA headquarters after the coup led just another 'stumbling block\" which caused Turkey's democracy to lag behind for another fifteen years.Evren seemed to have great admiration for the founder of Turkey, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, but he shut down some institutions founded by Atat\u00fcrk and is often accused of deforming the country's legal system against Atat\u00fcrk's principles. Thousands of people who were remanded in custody were killed or heavily injured in the prisons. I wonder why the Turkish movie makers have waited for more than twenty years to make a movie out of this calamity. You see it's not more than five years since the USA invaded Iraq but there have been lots of TV series,movies,plays which have a little of that theme in it. They just know how to stand up for the actual course of things.An example: There is still a Guantanamo prison and there are still many prisoners there who have no right to appear before a court-martial but Michael Winterbottom-the British film-maker made a 2006 docu-drama named \"The Road to Guantanamo\". He did not really wait for US officials to shut down this prison to make his movie. I know a lot of people have already seen \"Babam ve Oglum\" and most people know what it's all about but I just wanted tell something on the plot too.Sadik is sort of a free-spirited person. In a period where people find every opportunity to fight with each other on capitalism-communism conflict he gets into continuous clashes with his father. This is what we learn during the course of voice-over in the movie.His family as a village family sends him to Istanbul to study agriculture. He loses his wife on the night of coup d'etat just because he cannot find any taxi to take her to the nearest hospital.Probably nobody was outside because of the general curfew,he was a bit tipsy at the time and he did not hear of anything.He helps his wife to give birth.His wife dies but his son survives the birth. In a coup d'etat period where people have been charged based on their political beliefs he is tortured in custodial prisons.After his release he develops a chronic lung disorder.After losing his job and when his health deteriorates heavily he decides to go back to his village, to his father's home. Actually this is a plot developed by flashbacks and some kinda voice-over because the whole 2 hours nearly is set in the village specifically on the father-son relationship. Sadik feels like he could never leave the village neither could he stay there. He feels to be trapped in a limbo.He does not seem to understand his father neither does his father attempt get his son under the skin.By way a voice-over for example we hear their discussion on \"serfs.\" The son accuses his father of being kinda capitalistic power the father defends himself by telling \"Have we ever treated them different? Have we ever prevented them from sitting at our dinner table and eat?\" He has a point.In Anatolian culture field workers have not been seen as indentured servants mostly.So the son does not get his father's point but the father has not offered him some \"latitude\" either so that his son could have made his life on his free-will. Two hours cinematic feast flows on this father-son relationship,their final efforts to understand each other in the final days of Sadik before his death.",

Although everyone at home is elated to have him back, his relationship with his father still needs mending, which he hopes to accomplish before it's too late.Written & directed by \u00c7a\u011fan Irmak, the film features a simple premise but packs a lot of emotions that's honestly captured. All the characters are embedded with meaty arcs but it's the sum of their relationship with each other & a sense of history between them that provides the necessary weight to it.The father-son dimension between Sad\u0131k & his son as well as Sad\u0131k & his father is portrayed in an earnest manner, and all the actors play their part responsibly to make their interactions genuine & share a wonderful chemistry together. Camera-work is no slouch, pacing is steady, and music really complements the whole narrative.On an overall scale, My Father and My Son is a skilfully directed & deftly scripted family drama that pays proper attention to its characters & their relationships, develops those bonds at a steady rate, and at times even indulges in a child's imagination to add more depth to its tale before finishing on an emotionally hefty note. Definitely one of Turkish cinema's finest works, My Father and My Son is absolutely worthy of a broader audience.",

Humeyra ( the grandmom ) also performs one of her best in her career and let's you put a smile on your face in all those dramatic occurrences.I hope this movie will find a way to exhibit itself worldwide and warm up many hearts who need to examine the fragility of a father-son relationship. Bravo Cagan Irmak !!! Thanks Avsar Film...PS. For anyone who reads this critic: if you have no way to watch the movie, insist on having the DVD, that'll be a classic in no time.",

            "content": "Babam ve Oglum, or My Father and My Son, takes place at the start and in the aftermath of the 1980 Turkish coup, where the existing government was overthrown and a military junta took power. This took place on September 12th, and on that same night a left-wing journalist, Sadik (Fikret Kuskan), lost his wife in childbirth. We jump some years into the future as Sadik returns back to his childhood home in the countryside with his son Deniz (Ege Tanman).What I appreciate the most about this movie is how layered it is. How it tells so many stories at once. First of all, it's a great story about returning back home after having left it years ago. I too grew up in the countryside, and this movie tells it just like it is. About how it feels so alien, like the place has been frozen in time, but at the same time there's immediacy to it, certain purity even. It feels like home in a way city never can.It's also a story about three different generations trying to build and rebuild bridges. About grandparents finding a connection with a grandson they've never met. About a son trying to reason with his father, both Deniz with Sadik and Sadik with H\u00fcseyin (\u00c7etin Tekindor), Deniz's grandfather. And as a sidenote, can I just state how much I loved the character of Salim (Yetkin Dikinciler), Sadik's brother, who stayed when he left. What a kindhearted, honest and utterly likable character.And yes, it's also a story about a certain period in Turkish history. But that stuff is not at the foreground. It plays a part in the narrative, but more as a source of causality. It's the reason why things happen, but not the focus. And I think that was the right call to make, in order for these other stories to have enough room to grow and shine.This movie isn't widely known as of writing this review. And that's a shame. It has the depth, the expertise and the purity of message to be a true classic. I hope more people find it in years to come, because it surely deserved to be watched and appreciated.",

The difference is that we ordinary people are trying to overlook our feelings but the writers and the directors slam us in the heart by showing how close we are, how our fears are alike. Maybe some day we can learn not to put any distance between the people we love whatever the conflict is between. Cause nothing is permanent in this world, but irreversible regret is.

Cagan Irmak did fine work on making movie about this fact.Using local accents, authentic music in background, accomplishment of actors and actress are the main factors for being liked. The characters are very familiar to us and they are certainly assimilated from the life itself.Dramatic wave walk with a swaying movement along the movie.One of the last scene in which Sadik come out of camera and make a speech to this son should have been eliminated. This scene does not contribute to the story. If the marginal contribution of scenes is zero, cut them and make the movie simpler.

Lots of people have already commented that this is a good film so I don't need to add to that, but I did have some problems with it.The film is very Turkish, while that is not a bad thing I do think it appeal to audiences from other countries is limited. That nearly all the comments here about the film are from Turkish people shows that it appeals mainly to Turks.The theme of the film is: blood is thicker than water. The moral of the story is: even if your father treats you like rubbish you should still respect and love him. The father/grandfather is unpleasant and self-centered. If my father was like this man I would never trust him with my son. But this is why Turks will understand this film better than some other people. This is not about being 'warm blooded' (as Turks like to believe they are), it is about being unable to survive without a family support system (even if that system is dysfunctional).Towards the end of the film the old man seems to have a turn around of character; but we have to assume that this is only temporary, and that he will later go back to be a horrible old man, because it is noticeable that no one likes him. And they have good reason not to like him.The film is not really political, it dodges the political issues. The military coup is only used as a melodramatic backdrop. If fact the film also dodges the issues about family, about why we treat people they way we do and instead uses sentimental melodrama to pull on our heart-strings. I do not believe this can be the best film made in Turkey (as many people have written).",

Even then the music could sometimes be overbearing but it fitted more since we got to know the characters and things had more weight for us. Overall it was well shot, the acting was good. I expected this movie to be more political but it was mostly family drama about relationship between father and son. Although some things were exaggerated for the sake of emotional impact, the movie still held together without being a typical spanish or turkish soap opera, but it still has elements of them none the less.

Although it may not affect a foreigner in the same way, for people who lived the era described in the film are moved. The film focus on the coup d'etat of 1980, and how it ruined the lives of idealist people, especially leftist. However, there is more than that... The drama of the small family is based on a contradiction between the traditions of the Turkish rural families and the thoughts of the youngsters of these families. This contradiction is in the minds of these young people as much as it is in their relationship with their parents. Thus, the film both judges and defends the Turkish traditional family structure, first by showing how cruel they can be when a family member is against the \"tradition\", and secondly by showing how compassionate they are when the same member of the family is in trouble. Consequently, the film may not mean much for foreigners but I should mention the fact that I have cried first time watching a movie in my 28 year long life!",

Many scenes were acted convincingly or adequately, but others seemed either unrealistic or overacted. In my opinion, the only consistent actor played the brother Salim, who was quite funny in several scenes (even if one of those scenes abruptly killed an emotional scene).A final comment is that the composer and director quite obviously did not cooperate for this film. Whenever background music is playing, the end transition never failed to be jarring. The music would stop or change in such a way that never failed to break any immersion I had in the film. It was very apparent that the director, composer, editor, etc. did not have any idea how to make a musical transition.",

The atmosphere of Agean District, the accent people speak, the cars they drive ( Renault 12) was so original Particularly the performance of Cetin Tekindor (father) in having regret about the relations with his son after his funeral was outstanding. It was so effective that most of the spectators including me watching the film in the cinema could not help weeping. I think Sadik's son will be a great actor in the future. Because his performance at he age of 7 was remarkable. Fikret Kuskan's performance also meets our expectations. The beginning of the film I think conflicts with the quality of the whole film, the only performance that did not fit the situation was the performance of Sadik's wife. She was so artificial, her appearance of pregnant woman was not convincing at all. Fortunately, her role was short. Overall, it was the best Turkish film I have ever seen.",

Both groups went as far as to do bombing (or they say it was the work of the Western ideologies in play along with the secret state in Turkey). Then the Army staged a coup on September the 12 in 1980 and made thousands of arrests and significant amount of torture went on in the prisons... They even hanged 50 people that were found guilty(!) as they tortured hundreds of people (at least 171, proved) to death... And to this day the good people of Turkey suffers the consequences... Now, if we say that this movie tells one of the many stories of that era, it is absolutely true as \"the father\" had seen the torture and mistreat in the prison for what he had done nothing wrong... His heartbreaking story also reveals so many levels of the culture of Turkey and the bigheartedness of its people... Last but not least, if you ever claim that you have seen \"drama\", and your eyes won't just stop \"shedding tears\"; I kindly dare you watch this piece of art!.. I say it is gut-wrenching as well as mesmerising!.. So, no point in denying that the top 250 it belongs to!..",

I'll admit, one does take a chance when he buys based upon the recommendations of other IMDb users, but sometimes the risk is worth the reward. I suspect that the movie was \"ramped\" up by users in order to increase its appeal, and it certainly caught my interest due to its seemingly high ratings. But let's not be fooled. The $30 I spent for this title, yes $30!, was a complete waste of money. Usually I will try to resell those purchases I make on Amazon and Ebay that don't meet my expectations, but in this case the movie was so poor that I threw it into the trash, not desiring to foist the same foolish film on others.

The wife was awake and knew that she was going to give birth to Sadik. I could n't get a car on the road, and I could n't see a wife who was in labor and could n't move anymore. On the roadside, ssadik delivered his own baby until the next day when a soldier came to the truck and saw Mu Ran sitting on his face and The child is covered with bloodThe reason why I said that it was mulan because I only saw a man who was simply accompanied by his wife because the child was not on him, so he would go to drink in the middle of the night and wake up to rely on the hospital. It was just that he ran into a war and left him overnight Growing up facing an unacceptable situation of raising children independently and facing bereavementImmediately after the three-three-three-two people in the movie came in and kissed and left the child, the front teeth were open. I think it should be when the teeth were changed at the age of seven or eight. Then, Sadik took denniz and his parents' home on the road to let the child repeat the precautions he taught him. Do n't make grandpa grandpa happy when you 're unhappy. Then you can see the uncle. Do n't ask questions. Do n't fight with nearby children.When I arrived at my parents 'house, I was harvesting wheat. It seemed that a bunch of bundled wheat straws fell in the field and waited in the yard for a while. The family came back. My mother wept with joy. Thank God, my father turned away and went cold and ruthless.Sadik saw that his father would n't see him. Although he was prepared, he could n't help but turn around and would leave. Son 's sentence, dad, where are you going, stopped him, stood there, turned to look at his sonCome back for dinner in the evening. The family tweeted. The relatives came one by one. The elder brother and his family of four. The aunts dressed up by the nobles made a table. The only one who filled the table was eating. Only Dad went to the cafe to hide.The next morning, the curious little denniz walked to the stable under the guidance of grandma and heard that the horseshoes are all good I was restrained and turned to leave. At this time, I saw that Grandpa did n't hold back and said that the kid who was wearing was happy when he got an answer. Why did n't I see Grandpa saying that you were too far away? Ma is wearing iron shoes and the child asks the horse to have a name. If you know that the child likes to read comic books, the translation shown at this time is the uncle. The old father said how do you call me uncle, I am your grandfather and hug the child. I got up and went away. The old mother and sadik on the balcony saw a hearty smile and felt sent a breath of relief. Then I turned to the comic store on the street. It was originally to buy a book for my grandson. This old man pretends to be very caring and indifferent. I was thinking that Turkey and China have similar aspects .... I met Sadik and his brother who wanted to meet the original acquaintancessadik thanked him and told him why he came backIn the evening, the drunk sadik came back and asked his mother to take his son to stay with his brother for one night. He had important things to tell his father. He did n't want his son to see them quarreling.This time is the climax of the story. All the emotions are revealed here. Sadik said why he was given this name. The translation is faithful. His brother's name is safe. Are you afraid of not being arranged for a life back? Not begging for forgiveness, not admitting mistakes But he has been between the home and freedom for many years. He has a home that cannot be returned to, and he has been thinking of violating his father's arrangements. In the past, he said that he was back to give his son a room, a home, and a free home. Did you know that you can't do it?At this moment, I could n't cry, watching their conversation, tears,Behind is that the old father finally can't hold back, and seeing the fallen son shouting at his son, as if he were the only one in his lifeThe reason why this movie is good is that it expresses the relationship between father and son. It has a deep and heavy responsibility. Love through the relationship between sandik and his father and the relationship with his son. Every delicate emotional treatment makes people move. Can't ownIt 's really a good movie, but there are also bad things in it. When I was convicted and went to jail, the part was very vague. Finally, my lungs were sick and I died abruptly, and I was awkward. Little danniz was very dependent on his father, but he did n't have any memories or memories of his motherThis is a film focusing on expressing fatherly love",

To close the gap between father and son with Sadik's death is another form of tragedy. This scenario is still played out in this world, because in the face of death, any form of ethical conflict has to give way, and any form of competition is meaningless. Death is the most powerful force and the most powerless.My son and ISadik's affection for his son is reflected in many details and, of course, sometimes more of an expectation. In a sleeping next to their favorite cartoon books, the son of son seriously answer various questions, put out your cigarette before son came to the bedroom and to disperse the smoke, aware of their own will and his father the son off, while fighting repeatedly told his father to give his son a space, and so on, believe that these details are not deliberately. Sadik knows that the conflict between him and his father is difficult to resolve, so he has reflected his personal thoughts in his son's education: more independence and freedom, and try not to let his likes and dislikes have any influence on his son. Because Sadik understood: the maintenance of family ties, in addition to blood and love, more important also need their own independent space. The premise of this space should be mutual understanding and non-interference.About the movie itselfIt's a film that impresses a lot of people, but it won few awards at the festival, with only three small prizes at local festivals. (one is for public opinion and the other two are for sound), which I think may be the reason for the unclear theme. From the title, the theme should be the family, the love between two pairs of father and son, grandpa's love for his grandson. The subject is clear and full of ink. Another theme is freedom, the choice of values, the conflict of values between father and son. The third theme is country and nation. At the beginning of the film, he fails to call an ambulance and dies the night his wife is due to give birth, all because of a coup that has crippled the entire medical system. So, Sadik later told his friend, \"I thought I was fighting for my country, but the country didn't care.\" Reflection on the government is also one of the important themes. Because the theme is a bit too much, just dilute the film most want to express things.",

Her music can stir all kinds of emotions.\nThe movie was a good example of character development. Especially pleased with the acting of the kid (Ege Tanman). He was just mind blowing. Hussain Aga sometime looked like Turkish version of Vito Corleone. At the time when Hussain said '.... if I stood like this, Nuran if I stopped Sadik, if I hugged him like this......' - this was probably one of the best scene in the history of movies.\nThere is no happy ending for everything in life. Like Deniz, it's important to accept reality - no matter how hard. It's necessary to move on. Some movies can portray this truth artistically. That's how they become milestone movies.

            "content": "This is a movie that has a crying guarantee on almost anyone who would watch it. It portrays a family in turkey in the early 70's mainly concentrating on the relationship between the dad and the son.It is by far the best Turkish movie i watched, and i really did not like most of them. This one is definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made.The drama and comedy genre is so perfectly mixed that many times one will get the feeling of laughing and crying all at once.If you have not watched this movie yet, get it. No matter what you will like it. Actors do a very good job and the director's is one which is not even one to mention, just EXCELLENT.This movie will relate to everyone and will give you an emotional vibe.",
