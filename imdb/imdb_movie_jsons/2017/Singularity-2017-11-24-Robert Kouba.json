            "content": "This film is so bad I can't even be bothered stringing how much I hate this film into cogent sentences.So, 97 years after the bots take over you're telling me that the windows on the shops are crystal clean? You're telling me that despite no new clothes being manufactured the human characters look like they've just got a whole new wardrobe from GAP? That nearly 100 years of neglect has seen no collapsed roofs, no weeds growing from gutters, and fields that look like they've been fallow for a couple of years? That street signs, railings, window shutters, metal roll shutters have absolutely no signs of rust? That despite the bot driven apocalypse, the main female lead still has time to obviously dye her hair? In the scenes running through forests, they follow well worn and undergrowth free paths.... worn and maintained by whom exactly? Bots? In one of the opening scenes, a shop is engulfed in ivy inside yet in one of the later scenes, a house described as 'really old' has perfectly white whitewashed walls, and inside looks pristine - photographs aren't faded, glass cabinets haven't a speck of dust on them... in fact there is no dust, not even a cob web! And given that the house hasn't been heated for 97 years, it's amazing that there is no damp whatsoever. 97 year old Polaroid film works and, it must be energizer, because the batteries are still fresh. Despite being out in the wilds for days on end the male lead is always perfectly cleanly shaven. Even when he is woken from sleep he has been mysteriously shaved - then again he is a robot - a fact that the writers are at pains to have us aware of from the outset with the laboured 'no food for me' scene - funny then that when the girl falls asleep on his chest she doesn't notice that he doesn't need to breathe (we presume) And then, when they meet some nasty humans, they are all covered in stubble, dirt and worn clothes - oh my, so original.The male lead gets tied up in a brand spanking new rope. I mean, this thing clearly was just bought from a shop on the day... and the rope magically moves from one scene to the next... did they take lunch in the middle of shooting the 'tied up in brand new rope' scenes? Maybe they should have...The male lead is only capable of two expressions - eyes normal and eyes bursting out of his head. There is nothing in between and the rest of his face is entirely pointless. Lucky for him that the dialogue doesn't require much else. Actually, I'm not giving him credit... he can do a variation on these two expressions above including with mouth open and with mouth shut.The female lead should take urgent note that crying involves water coming from the eyes. You can't snivel and gasp for air, and then expect to look authentic with a perfectly dry face. Special effects are dire - in the opening scenes burning buildings look like someone went mad with the Photoshop clone tool. Explosions don't cast any light on objects that are close by and clouds of dense smoke don't cast any shadows and dissipate in moments leaving no trace. Enormous bots appear to defy the laws of physics and move through dense forestry without causing a single tree to move. 'Whats in your chest' scene - great work on the 97 year old straw bales that look to have been made in the last week... and the plentiful fresh straw on the ground in the barn... just lazy... Lighting.... I mean really.... what is happening with the lighting? In a dark and dingy forest, and it looks like two blazing follow spots behind the cameras.... just cheap and nasty.The characters are so poorly developed that their behaviour is schizophrenic at best.Continuity is a joke - in the opening scenes we see buildings burnt to to the ground, yet in later scenes, and I mean 97 years later scenes, they are visible in the background, with lights on inside. Really, 97 years after the rise of the bots, they are still using lights? Who is changing the bulbs? Bot janitor? Who even makes the bulbs?The bots themselves. If you're looking for humans, perhaps IR might be better than visible light to detect them? I think it's utterly lazy that the main feature of the film, that drives the whole storyline, the bots, are so poor.After leaving the 'facility' (you just know that's what they call it), they walk through a field of corn ready to be harvested. I'm feeling like a stuck record here...John Cusack must have been desperate for the cash.",

            "content": "I gave it a 2, but it's more of 4/10 movie...maybe. I lowered the rating because producers/owners of the movie are using one of many sites that give you free positive ratings, which is illegal. They should've spent that budget on making the movie better! Just google: buy IMDb ratings and many sites will pop-up offering this service. Real rating of this movie is more like 4/10 at the MOST!OK acting by some...Bad for some others and of course 1 good actor.The issue I have with the movie is that it is pointless, slow and predictable. I won't discuss bad graphics sfx as certainly the budget wasn't big.The story could've had so much more to it. It just sad they decided to dumb-out the script and make it so plain. It is a very slow pace movie and not in a good way as I got bored 1/3 of the way and not sure how I got through the rest- I was really expecting it to pick up and it never did. The idea behind the movie is nice,but it was never developed at all.Do NOT believe the high rating (currently 8) as those are fake ratings. There are many sites that sell Anyone giving this more than 5 or 6 did not watch the movie at all. I'd say any reviews of 2-5 can be considered real.",

Plot has so many holes it's hard to describe, and sometimes you wonder if perhaps the editing moved scenes around (so ending scenes are in the middle of the movie etc). Lines are clich\u00e9 (\"you have to let me go\" and such). Acting is sub-par (main character only uses two facial expressions - normal face and bulging eyes face). It steals ideas/images from other movies (octopus-like machines from Matrix; girl with a bow from Mockingjay series - yes, there are even birds here; the whole Terminator premise; bits of Mad Max wildlings). Also, as other mentioned, 97 years after the annihilation you still see crop fields, used rail tracks, clean paths through parks. And this student-project B-or-lower movie gets 8 out of 10 here? Don't waste your time on this one.",

If you like the post- apocalyptic genre but you need one for a mature audience (e.g. The Road, Mad Max, City of the Blind, Soylent Green etc.) skip this one, if you are a youngster around 12 or something like that, well, you may try it.Why John Cusack took a role in this flick is a mystery to me. Thanks to some semi-pro or almost pro looking technicals like effects and camera (tv-scale), I rate a 4, but this is imo no B-movie but a C- movie.Redundant.",

And when built? And how was it produced in a post-apocalyptic environment? And why did that EMP not knock out 'Andrew-bot'? So must be a plot-element right? The lack of attention to a potential mortal wound. That could wait until the next day. Only to reveal a metal chest where she snuggled against without noticing? And who was so bright to bury a spaceship to get to Aurora and in 92 years these 'kids' are the first and yet there is a completely colonized planet that somehow has escaped the attention of this super AI. How did they get there? And how was that a secret?Not to mention all the clean clothes. Clean streets, obviously used train tracks, brand new 92 year old camera, a battery that keeps going and going.. to name but a few. And the best she has is a crossbow? I seriously expected this all to be glitches in the matrix..... It would have been nice but turns out the writer and production designer just phoned it in. We enjoyed bitching at this movie.

I think I'd rather have my finger nails pulled out than watch this film again. Rarely do I come across acting this bad (shame on you John Cusack) so in some ways I feel blessed having witnessed this but maybe I am convincing myself to see the silver lining here because I know that I can never unsee this utter rubbish. If I could direct the main actors, Julian and Jeannine any career advice I would say \"don't give up your day jobs\" - please, for the love of mankind. Please! The plot is so hollow and incoherent that when some scenes start, I had to rub my eyes because I thought I had fallen asleep and woken up 5 minutes later. Alas, that was not case, it was just the plot that was bad. Singularity get's my vote for worst acting in the history of EVER: \"I'm not pretending\"...\"I do feel\". Honestly, I wish I would say that this was a B movie but actually there isn't a grade low enough to give this film. Maybe one day, we will look back at this move and laugh like we did with Sharknado or Teletubbies.....well, wishful thinking perhaps. Unlike some other reviewers on here, I actually hope that there is a sequel because it cannot get any worse than this. Even if the sequel were to show 90 minutes of night sky with David Attenborough singing Amazing Grace nonstop, it can still not get any worse than Singularity. IMDb - can you introduce negative ratings please? Oh, and BEWARE FAKE RATINGS ABOUND. IMDb - you need to sort this out soon or your business will disappear.",

VisualFX, SoundFX and music are on par with with large studio productions. Film editing have been done to get a slower tempo than most current movies, but is also professionally done.So what's the problem?I think it's the script and the director. In one scene our young heroes seem stiff and cold, in the next one they are massively overplaying emotions. Then they are stiff and cold again. Repeat. Although the main story line is OK, there are plenty of stupid lines, some of them repeated several times.I would recommend this movie for a rainy evening when you feel like watching a slow-tempo B-movie where everything except the script is actually a first class production.",

The FX were good, and there was a good plot twist at the end - but the filmmakers managed to ruin even that.The young female lead was okay - hopefully she survives this debacle to go on to better things. The young male lead I can only describe as punchable.

He was atrocious! You've hit rock bottom, John, and you continue to dig. You really need to stop hanging out with Nicholas Cage. The rest of the actors were equally as horrible. Julian Schaffner's performance was as plastic as it gets. He honestly looks like he has no clue what he is doing throughout the whole film. Jeannine Wacker was trying to go for the Hunger Games look, but ended up more like the Emo Games. There is a scene where she is sitting by the river, singing; uhhh, so terrible, I actually laughed out loud. If you are in the mood for a train-wreck, this is it. I made it through half the movie before I decided I had better things to do like help my neighbor unclog his toilet. BTW, this is supposed to take place 97 years after Kronos exterminates the majority of the human race.

Just wow! This movie was abysmal. Granted, the movie was off to a good start with the introduction and the Kronos thing going on. But then fast forward the storyline 97 years, it just went downhill so fast that there was no chance of anything saving the movie. And nothing did...I endured 1 hour of \"Singularity\" to the point where I was ready to put a gun to my head. Wow, this movie was just horrible. There are elements strongly inspired by the \"Terminator\" franchise all throughout this movie and thrown in with some elements from \"The Hunger Games\". Wait, what? Yeah, you read that correctly.There was so many things that didn't make sense. If humanity had been brought to the brink of extinction and 97 years passed, you'd think that the entire world would be overgrown, as there would be no one to keep nature at bay. But no. The cemeteries were neatly trimmed and had grass cut nice and low. It was just horrible. Cities would have been claimed by the growth of nature, but no, not here.And with the fact that John Cusack was just gazing with a blank stare at a monitor throughout the entire time he was on the screen, his performance was ludicrous, and he was in the movie for the sole purpose of his name only to draw in a crowd.Another thing in the movie that made absolutely no sense was the fact that the AI apparently could see anywhere on Earth at any time, even without having any means of visual link there. I mean, John Cusack's character could see the protagonists of the movie wherever they went, but there were no camera feeds or robots there to provide the visual. So with that kind of omnipotent vision, why didn't he just extend that vision to find Aurora without having to use a robot spy? It was just laughable.The characters in the movie were monotonous and had the same effect as wet cardboard have of holding up a wall. They were pointless to the core. A bow-wielding woman running around as a sole survivor, taken straight out of \"The Hunger Games\", even resembled her as well. And John Cusack's character was just irrelevant and annoying.It should be said, though, that the movie actually did sport some good enough CGI and special effects. But they alone were nowhere near enough to make amends for a horrible storyline, pointless characters and a script that was just non-existing.Stay well clear of \"Singularity\", it is a horrible waste of time and effort.",

The difference is in his book is more about the professional discussion of A.I and deep contemplation to human nature. It is quite significant for us humans I think. But none of these key elements were left in this movie. Only shallow, stupid Third-rate B movie plot there, looks they made it in a hurry. And very boring!! Let alone those very obvious story loopholes... So I called my friend on the phone and he told me he did chat with someone who claimed to be a Swede online before, and leaked some of his book's plots to him. It was about may 2016. Then the so-called Swede disappeared. Never contacted him again. He was very frustrated to hear the news, also very disappointed with this movie.

She was great and despite her not even having a single photo on her IMDB profile I wish good things for her.The Good:Jeannine Wacker is greatThe Bad:PretenciousUnoriginalOpen ended finale with no sequelThings I Learnt From This Movie:When people die all they leave behind are their skullsThe ropes tying him to the tree were about as tight as a KardashianMovies need be cornfield scenesJohn Cusacks career is nose diving faster than a flat earthers argument",

            "content": "The clich\u00e9 subject matter of this film (revealed in the first 5 minutes) set aside, the weakness of this movie is simply the lack of common sense in all story aspects. Well, that and a terrible script, awful directing and amateurish acting-- even from the seasoned veterans, who apparently have no other expressions than detached boredom (main villain), open-eyed goofy wonder (male lead), and disappointing dullness from veteran Carmen Argenziano. The only decent acting in the entire film is from female lead Jeannine Wacker... but the lines they gave her were just unbelievable.Examples of plot dis-continuity: * A Polaroid camera that still has a working battery, flash and film after decades of sitting on a shelf.* Julia plays a \"Hunger Games\"-esque female that carries a bulky crossbow as her weapon-of-choice. (In a world where she could have about any weapon she might find, this cumbersome contraption would be one of the least viable.) (Did she even use it in the film?) * Her almost-instant acceptance of the male character, who frankly just appears out of nowhere looking like a model from a teen magazine-- with no real questions as to 1) why he has no weapons or supplies 2) Where he came from 3) How he got there 4) And just accepting the very lame answers he gives to her limited questions.* An AI construct retaining a human body (badly damaged at that). Nice \"head glow\" effect... just rather unbelievable.The list goes on. As science fiction goes, this has very little science and a whole heap of fiction. Add to this long stretches of unnecessary scenes and trite dialog that can only be described as tedious and we have a predictably ludicrous and nonsensical ending to top off 90 minutes of uninteresting schlock.The CGI is decent; the robots are believably awesome (if now clich\u00e9, having appeared in this form in many films. What are these, rent-a-bot models from a 3-D program?).But the film just drags. By the time you're into the 40 minute point you'll be wondering if you should play solitaire on your cell phone to fill in the dull periods while you wait for the movie to get around to the end.This is a bad film.

Artificial Intelligence decides that humans are a virus and wipes most of them out.\nFast forward 97 years (if you read the movie synopsis - or 60 years if you follow the dialogue in the movie.)\nMore rip-offs. Hunger Games rip-off as \"Katniss\" makes an appearance in her brand new and perfectly clean leather jacket and Walking Dead crossbow.Supposedly most of humanity has been wiped out but when she encounters another \"survivor\" she saves him (using a really cheesy \"explosive device\") and then immediately ditches him. Little does she know that he is an \"evolved\" Terminator that \"thinks it is human\".\nMeanwhile - \"Katniss\" is trying to get to \"Aurora\" - the last human stronghold (yeah, just like Resident Evil - Afterlife).\nAmazingly, Polaroid cameras found in abandoned houses still work perfectly fine (60 or 97 years later) as do Coleman lanterns which magically light up a whole room with no shadows.\nNot to mention - advanced combat robots that can't detect thermal signatures, sleeping outdoors on the ground every night (I guess the robots wiped out tents, sleeping bags and all other camping gear), nobody apparently ever needs to go to the bathroom or wash or change clothes.\nCross country trip through hostile territory with nothing but the clothes on you back.Oh and electronic devices that apparently never need charging.And John Cusack looks like he just came off a year long cocaine bender only to find out that he has incurable lung, liver, testicle and brain cancer.I couldn't make it through the whole movie. I could add that the direction sucked, the music score sucked, costuming and make up sucked, lighting sucked and the other actors also sucked (but some of that could be attributed to the script and the directing - some of it).Seriously disappointed in John Cusack and seriously glad I didn't pay to watch it",

Wood Jr has directed them in this movie.There's good reason to suspect that the female lead is a plagiarised script, so identical it is to the Hunger Games and Divergent series movies. She has a crossbow, so it's a mix of rifle and bow/arrows. Yes, she uses a crossbow and arrows against five-story high robots...There are better CGI and animation in the most common commercials than in this movie.**The only way this movie will ever be worthy of watching will be when Mystery Science Theatre 3000 gets hold of it, and does some dubbing of lines.",

And the rest of the movie, two survivors are running from the \u00bfboogieman? or something, again missing the AI activities. Instead you see two figures following these two running survivors with impossible camera-views. It's left-out how these two figures where kind-of assimilated to be enslaved working for the AI. Unrealistic, to many gaps, bad acting. And therefore not understanding this movie gets a 7.4 (done by 417 IMDb-users), with an average of 72.9% (304 IMDb-users) voting a 9!",

In 2020, company CEO Elias Van Dorne (John Cusack) initiates computer AI Kronos and it immediately declares war on humanity as the cause of all of the world's ills. Another 97 years later, Andrew Davis is unarmed and running from a killer robot in a deserted town. Calia uses her last electromagnetic bomb to save him.John Cusack looks tired and old. Of course, we can't be young forever. He's a minor character anyways. He probably spent a day on that set to collect the cheque. Other than Cusack and Carmen Argenziano, these are amateur actors doing most of the heavy lifting. The special effect also looks amateurish with student level work CG. Action often happens with the characters staring in awe at the CG in the distant. Most disappointing is the lack of set design. It's 100 years into the apocalyptic future and the world isn't overgrown. The places look abandoned but only for a few months at most. I don't know anything about the production. The budget is probably too low to make this look good. There are also bad story elements. Calia should have figured something is wrong with Andrew right from the start.

            "content": "What is it with John Cusack , he has gone from superb movies to taking any old part that comes along - He has gone down the what i call the Ron Perlman and Lance Henriksen road - ie Brilliant actors who have either gotten too old or just decided to take the money and run and its really quite sad to see such giants of the silver screen reduced to taking turdula like this on. I have to disagree with the one reviewer who has said 2012 and Cell were terrible - they weren't that bad - Cell started well but kinda lost its way and 2012 was a superb film i thought!I don't know but Mr Cusack seems to have had so many face lifts he actually looks like a woman now as well and he seems to permanently be black boot polishing his hair to keep it from grey. Obviously not growing old gracefully - he actually looks like a bit of a freak now.The movie itself; well I was really looking forward to the first full Robert Kouba movie after the most excellent short \"THE RIFT\" and unfortunately we have been sadly let down.Its as though they spent the budget on the first 20 minutes as it started so well but like so many other movies it just lost its way and the effects became cheap and nasty looking. The story itself started well and then went completely to hell at the end - if anyone has a clue as to how humans or aliens or whatever existed and how the golden city skyscrapers of Aurora was created let me know as it just leaves the viewer saying \"whaaaaat\" at the end - its plain and obvious that they were deluded enough to think at the end that the movie was going to be a hit so left us with the remnants of possibility of a second movie to explain just what the heck the end was all about.It was also sad to see so many parts ripped from other movies - my brother immediately pointed out the skulls in the water reminiscent of the original terminator and they actually used the same voice-over telling the tale of the machines destroying humanity almost word for word from the original terminator.Now here is what gets me - the main actor Julian Schaffner was absolutely the worst i have ever seen , in fact its an insult to call him an actor and quite sad when there are so many other talented young actors out there who could have brought something to this movie - no emotion it was as if he was reading off a card or like many actors like Jonny Depp and Gerard Butler to mention two who have a microphone in their ear and the script read to them - the difference is that Johnny Depp is a superb actor and this guy hadn't even had a full movie under his belt - it also transpires that he co-produced it so presumably mummy and daddy in Switzerland paid for his first movie Jolly - To be fair the female lead was not bad and you could see her trying so hard to battle with the script and awful actor she was with I just felt so sorry for her!Sad also to see Stargate SG-1's brilliant Carmen Argenziano waste his time on this as well. I wouldn't waste your time on this as the whole thing is like some student movie written on the back of a cigarette packet and not a very good one at that. I think that if Robert Kouba had more money and a much better script he would have made a memorable movie; going by his past short films - such a shame for him that his first major movie outing would be so lame.One point I would like to agree with one of the reviewers - there aren't many films that are worth a 1 rating (except maybe the exceptionally arty farty Keanu Reeves BAD BATCH lol) so I think most of the 1 ratings are a bit unfair - the start of the film was good and I think they possibly did the best they could with the budget - what cannot be forgiven is giving a non- entity like Schaffner who clearly cannot act the chance so star in this and that is what is unforgivable and worth a 1 - overall its a 4/10 for me. To me 5 is average and 4 is less than average. This is a lot better than some of the movies masquerading as Scifi out there - not many but a few and Robert Kouba does try and do a good job with a smal amount of money - I think the brilliant THE RIFT was made with just $20,000 which always impressed me so in all fairness its not decent to give this a 1 out of 10 that is unfair.What is also unfair are these Chinese and Pakistani review shills - you can actually buy reviews so i have found over on a site called fiverr - its so obvious who these are and why IMDb cannot filter them out is beyond me - let me give an example - reviewer who have been members for a few days and only posted 1 review and its a 10/10 - On here Davelenox from Lugano in Switzerland i presume is Schaffners mum or dad or how about the 1 review 1 days member samuel-93041 who gives it 8/10 - cmon IMDb weed these guys out - no profile - no picture 1 review its not that hard. Although sites like fiverr are now getting genuine members to give good reviews with of course the monetary incentive so i guess its getting harder to weed out the shill reviewers.",

            "content": "Oh John Cusack, what in the hell happened to your career? The fact that Cusack, who has starred in so many movies that I cherish from my childhood, is in this is the scariest thing about this movie. *sigh* Oh well.So briefly, this your standard \"computer achieves self-awareness and immediately decides to kill all humans\" cliche. Like Skynet in Terminator but so, so much worse. Every writing, acting and directing choice in this movie is a complete head scratcher.Cusack plays his role without an ounce of emotion or nuance. They might have literally filmed his scenes by FaceTiming with him and having him just read the script over the phone. But he's hardly alone when it comes to horrible acting in this movie; all of the performances are completely uninspired.My working theory is that the movie studio actually built an AI and tasked it with writing, directing and editing the movie..It then scanned every television movie of the week from the mid eighties to the late nineties about rogue AIs and decided to approximate the ideas from those films for this one.There are tons of plot holes, of course, because the AI didn't really understand what \"humans\" were and guessed that they were kind of like voice emulators that occasionally moved and turned off if hit with CGI bullets. So it got confused and decided that Skynet could turn off 8 billion humans everywhere on the planet overnight, but that the other humans could just escape that...somehow.It's explained what happened but not how in gods name it makes a shred of sense. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's pretty banana-bread bonkers. Unless, as I said, you view the plot thru the \"eyes\" of an AI that doesn't quite get what humans are.I think the AI also struggled with the notion of the \"real world\", because one hundred years later lawns and buildings are pretty much just the same as they used to be, suggesting that the AI doesn't quite grasp the concept of growth and time. Although I suppose maybe Skynet was sending maintenance crews around to mow lawns and fix roofs and windows and stuff, which was pretty nice of it if you think about it. Gotta keep those property values up.So in summary the AI made the humans move around a little and say things, mostly dialogue from other movies I'm guessing, and would occasionally turn them off with CGI bullets and explosions until there were only a few left. Then some other stuff happened, I think.Or something like that. I don't know, I stopped watching around 25 minutes, flipped ahead to see how it ended, then watched High Fidelity and felt very old and sad.",

There were point in the movie where I found myself laughing hysterically at how many scenes/story lines/special effects had been lifted from other movies or video games. By my count there were at least a dozen - most notable being terminator (several of them), matrix, gladiator, hunger games, blade runner, mech warrior, battlestar galactica, transcendence, Independence Day.... I could go on for a while. Others have noted the plot holes and I agree with their assessment. With that said, this movie is the good type of bad. Don't watch it looking for a serious dystopian movie- seriously, the main character has bleached white teeth, a jersey shore tan and highlighted hair - his love interest has a cell phone (didn't society collapse 97 years ago?), perpetual lip gloss, and a bow and arrow (apparently to shoot robots)..and let's not mention the Cusakinator.

I actually marginally enjoyed a similar kind of movie that appeared on Netflix starring Lee Pace as an American mercenary in an African country when an alien invasion happens.\nBut this one is just stupid. Flat out stupid. Even by the lowest of low-budget standards, this is stupid. This is 4th grade sci-fi stupid. This is too stupid even for that. It was so stupid I couldn't get more than 20 minutes into it.\nFirstly, the movie sets us up in 2019 where there are helpful robots everywhere from a corporation run by John Cusack's character, while he one night ominously decides to run Kronos, the first ever AI. to absolutely no surprise at all, Kronos awakens, and apparently decides, in it's dime store 5th grade sociology wisdom, that \"there's a problem with earth, and the problem is humans are bad and dumb and must be destroyed using nuclear weapons in order to save earth\" because we all know when you need to exterminate termites or cockroaches from your house, the best method is to take a sledgehammer and smash up all the walls and floors.\nnext, we're shown that John Cusack and his sidekick guy are actually AI beings themselves, in human guise, which kind of renders the whole Kronos gimmick pointless since they are already AI and have already made the decision to end all human life on earth, so why even bother making a show of this brand new first ever AI? Why even tell any of the humans?\nall of this is relayed in a numbingly monotonous exposition dump voice-over from an actor who turns out to be a complete ripoff of Katniss Everdeen from the hunger games when she arrives, and is unbelievably badly acted. Not even badly acted to a degree that it is fun to mock, but just boringly badly acted. she announces it is 97 years later and earth sucks now\nthe other element added in is some random teenaged boy in his mid-20s who somehow managed to survive the initial apocalypse and is now inexplicably wandering around 97 years later. But this is helpfully explained by John Cusack and his sidekick that this guy is secretly a robot like them, completely indistinguishable from human, who ALSO is unaware he's a robot!\nCaving in like a wet cardboard roof is; if this kid thinks he's human HOW HAS HE BEEN LIVING FOR 97+ YEARS WITHOUT AGING? On top of this stupidity, he gets attacked by a random robot and escapes, and the sidekick pointlessly asks John Cusack why he sent the robot to attack him, and John Cusack says so Katniss can trust him, implying that him being a human wandering around on his own post-apocalypse where robots kill all humans on sight isn't enough to get her interest.MAYBE she has experienced androids in human disguise at some point and so now can't trust all humans, but this was not mentioned in the minutes leading up to or coming after this, and at that point around 20 minutes in I just flat-out gave up on this stupid pile of stupid and ended it.",

Why does that facility burn down? Why where there at all any trains 37 years after the event? Why should groups of (male) humans be hostile towards strangers, when there is no competition and they are no threat to each other, only possible help? How could humans survive underground even for days let alone decades, where there is no food and machines are better equipped to catch their prey? How could humans develop fantastic technologies within a few, what? years? months? weeks? when they barely have food to survive let alone factories, supply lines and indeed the knowledge of the necessary physics.

            "content": "I'm so tired of seeing either. Whether its slamming a film for being low budget or writing fake 10 out of 10 stuff about how its the best stuff of all time. I'm so sick of you people. Here is an honest review from a guy who tried to give this movie a chance whilst being sceptical all the way through. Its a nice movie. The plot reminded me of several movies. Terminator, Hunger Games, etc etc. Its a survival Sci Fi. Going in I expected something low budget. But I was surprised to see the films effects were actually handled quite well. The sci fi is really well portrayed and and quite rad. The story itself takes a turn when we exit the futuristic city theme that we begin with and enter a post apocalyptic world ( though serene) And that can be a bit of a turn off for some. I stuck with it. And I got an engaging story, interesting plot, good characters and a couple that was made believable and likable. It was a nice movie to watch. A mix of various films within the same genre. Bit of The Host, bit of the hunger games, bit of terminator etc etc. And although not a masterpiece ( Is this a requirement, self proclaimed IMDb expert critics) its still a good film you can relax to. Its well above average. Slow phase, nice story, cool plot twist at the end that had me going \" wow\" which I wont spoil for you because I encourage you watching it. Plus having John Cusack in the film which surprised me was quite a nice touch too because although his character doesn't have too many lines, he still played a vital part in the movie and gets good screen time that manages to heighten the tension all the way through. Evil genius with a plan to rid the world of Humanity. Come to think of it. Its starting to remind me of the latest Deus Ex game. Mankind Divided. You got the same scenario.But yes. It might be a little bit rough sometimes. I would have personally preffered a more futuristic world, more robots and such. But thats just my personal take. If I accept what the film decided to do instead ( which isn't bad) its still enjoyable and once again. The plot twist at the end explains a lot. There are no loopholes in this, which I applaud the script writers for. All that matters is explained and rounded off in a satisfying fashion. Unless of course you're a IMDb super critic who feels he / she has to #### all over anything that isn't the latest Superman, Ironman or Transformers. 7 out of 10. A pretty good film. Satisfying visuals, nice calm story, good characters, good acting. Watch it with your girlfriend who enjoys sci fi, or give it a shot if you feel like something different and relaxed. And to the people saying this is garbage, horrible, boring, etc. Its pretty clear you're the kinda people who judged this film the moment you began watching it. Ah yes. The average expert super critic in an age where being overly critical is considered intelligent. Well, fellas. Here is a little reminder. The nr 1 rule when wanting to criticise a text, book, movie, song, is first and foremost to watch / listen to it closely, pay attention and try to understand. If you only view it from your own point of view and dismiss the rest... you're not an objective critic by any means and your review means nothing. All of which isn't remotely intelligent. And on that note, I recommend anyone reading this to give it a chance. needn't pay to watch it. Check it out online.It is worth your time if you're in the mood for something relaxing and can keep an open mind as with everything :)",

Unbelievable that it currently has a rating of 6/10 on IMDb. The graphics are terrible, and the story line is more boring than staring at a wall for 2,5 hours. Really ingenious how this director managed to make a movie with this concept (and potential) so bad. The movie immediately gives away that the lead role is in fact a robot. This could've functioned as a huge plot-twist, but no they f**k it up.. Furthermore, the script is awful and boring, no connection to the characters whatsoever. This also includes a lot of suspense moments in the movie with a silence and dramatic music, while in the end nothing happens.Considering that the movie takes place 97 years after the robot take- over/apocalypse, one would assume that the lead role (who just woke up after 97 years) has some questions. But no, he accepts everything he sees. Also, there is no sign of erosion on buildings, even some windows are still intact. At one point in the movie, the lead characters walk into a house. Where after 97 years, there is still not one molecule of dust, come on! The roofs of all buildings are still intact and there is no grass growing all over the place, which you would normally expect if you let nature run its course. Since (as the movie claims) 8 billion people were killed overnight, i find it astonishing that there are no skeletons all over the place. In the movie you only see skeletons once, neatly stacked in a river. Then i am wondering, did the skeletons walk to the river, or what? Well, i could go on and on about this horrible movie but i thinks this gives the general image.Summary of this movie: A disgrace!",

It's latest creation is Kronos which are robots who have been created as a tool to prevent all wars. However, Kronos sees humankind as the real threat and as a result of this Kronos wipes out the majority of the human population. A few human survivors are believed to be living in Aurora which is the last human stronghold and Van Dorne uses a robot who can mimic human emotions and a female human freedom fighter in order to discover the whereabouts of Aurora in order to wipe out the rest of civilisation...To me, the film poster for this film seemed to suggest that Singularity would be more of an action-orientated picture, but it doesn't actually play out like this at all and unfortunately in this case that turns out to be a bad thing..In fairness, a science-fiction film doesn't always have to go overboard in the action stakes in order for it to be enjoyable, but if a film chooses to put focus on narrative rather than action then it really needs to have something worthwhile to say which just doesn't happen here. OK so a robot army has destroyed civilisation because it determines that they are the real threat. This is a fairly interesting way to set the story up, but it fails to delve any deeper and as a result of this you're left with a film that offers no real social commentary or critique on anything that happens. This perhaps wouldn't be as much of an issue if anything else remotely of interest was going on anywhere else, but the truth is that it isn't.As I've previously mentioned, I felt like I had been mis sold on this film being about survivors fighting and battling the machines in order to survive. The reality however is that Van Dorne is using them to discover Aurora which actually makes for a much less exciting picture. You know full well that they're going to survive at the end (or else how is Van Dorne going to find out the location of Aurora). This in turn makes the picture fairly uninteresting, predictable and results in a complete lack of tension existing throughout the film.Further problems with the picture relate to its general lack of explanation for certain things within the story; such as how people have managed to survive on Aurora for the past 97 years when the rest of civilisation has been destroyed? What exactly are they living on? A human robot and a human freedom-fighter have real difficulties escaping Kronos to get to Aurora yet 1000's of civilians have managed to escape Kronos to Aurora with no explanation of how they managed to do this?Perhaps the worst thing about this film lies with the ending which isn't actually an ending it's actually just lazily left open to allow an inevitable sequel to come along. In fact, this whole film could merely be seen as a very long dull trailer to set up the second film in the franchise and given how poor this film is I can safely say I won't be checking out the sequel to this film should it ever materialise.",

I don't think so, movie should have been like 2145 or something. Second, movie pretty much rips off way better sci-fi stories from Terminator, Cleopatra 2525 to the Matrix. Let's talk about Van Dorne's plan. Because one man used his robots to murder innocents making him take the blame for unknown reasons. So the answer is killing all people, so the spilling of some innocent blood is so bad the answer is spilling more innocent blood? That makes perfectly no sense, but any excuse for humans to fight robots I guess. Thirdly, if Elias Van Dorne was determined to wipe out mankind because we don't deserve to live, logically speaking he should have stuck his main computer to automatic before blowing his brains out. Instead, he turns himself and his best friends into cyborgs, the problem is humans killing not being made of flesh. So that makes no sense other the filmmakers paid star John Cusack too much money to kill him off early even though that would make sense. Fourth, why Singularity? There is nothing about space, black holes or time travel, title makes no sense, like everything in this movie. Lastly, speaking of John Cusack. What a waste of a good actor. All he does is look either pissed off or bored through the whole movie, I'm guessing he was to lose human emotion now being some kind of cyborg but it doesn't explain him pretty much doing nothing except saying bad stilted dialog to Carmen Argenziano which has nothing to do with the other part of the movie. Switzerland should stick to cheese and clocks, the film industry is trash. I don't know how much this movie cost but since it got back less then five grand I'm guess there won't be a sequel and this spell the end of Swiss film.

I should have known to shut it off then but couldn't find the remote, wish I had looked a little harder in retrospect.This movie felt like a Asylum version of Terminator, complete with crappy CGI, a plot that seems to go nowhere and main characters that you could care less if they lived or died. Basically think of every clich\u00e9 hero/villain, every clich\u00e9 situation those hero's and villains can find themselves and this is what you get.I genuinely tried to like this movie, even though I should no better by now to skip Cusack's movies, his One Crazy Summer and Gross Point Blank days have long since passed, along with his hairline and good judgement when it comes to taking roles.

It feels like a film that had a story and vision at one time, then found itself over-budget and went into turnaround. Over eager Writer/Director Robert Kouba clearly focused on the opening and conclusion, putting everything into the special effects and even a soundtrack by members of The Crystal Method. Suddenly with no money left, and little more than a student film reel in the can, Kouba roughly stitched together some nonsensical plot points with flat characters and even flatter acting to fill out the 93 minute runtime.The ultimate tragedy is that it clearly sets up for a sequel, so it feels less like a complete film than a bloated trailer to some yet-to-come flick.

Argenziano does probably the best job and even his effort is spotty; weak here and fine there.The story itself is the weakest part, naturally. 97 years after a robot apocalypse, this girl well dressed in fresh, clean clothes, is surviving against a massive robot force. They can sit around a campfire with no fear of detection, but playing music instantly summons the machines. Machines without heat detection and that's can't hear a human breathing 10 feet away. Sigh.Even the romantic aspects of the film are just unbelievable. Calia goes completely against everything that has kept her alive, almost overnight.Gah, there's more, but the movie isn't worth the time.

Some of the CGI work is not too bad for a B grade film though it would in many places give the infamous Troma-vision a run for it's money.Overall, a young director/writer who produced his first feature length film, it's by no means the worst film in history but it's far from being the best.Only watch this if you want to become depressed at how bad a film can be, or if you like coma inducing junk.",

It was either going to be a pretty good sci-fi story, or a cheesy romance, exploited many times in Sci- Fi, but rarely touched in romantic movies. Well, they failed to decide so it turned out to be half decent Sci-fi plus half decent romantic story. And we all know that having two halves of different bills is not the same as having a single hundred-dollar bill.The story is not new, but still it could be a very pleasant sci-fi. It unfolded so quickly, that if we remove the romantic part, it could pass for a trailer. Music score was heavily influenced by Blade Runner, acting was pretty bad (Even John Cusack could not save it). Camera guy was still learning, CGI's were decent.They tried creating a huge movie with a dramatic story, set between among the stars. But to create such big thing, you need a lot of money. Obviously they did not have them and now it looks like a low- budget version of Star Gate. If they tried creating a 7-8 series out of this script, it could have had a huge success.",

I do respect the story-writer for conveying an intriguing outlook at the future of human beings.The basic plot of \"Singularity\" revolves around John Cusack , Julian Schaffner , and Jeanine. Cusack plays the CEO of an organization that has developed a supercomputer which forecasts threats to the world and attempts to end all wars. The supercomputer identifies the humans themselves being the greatest threat to the world. Thus , robots are sent to kill all the human beings ; 97 years later, it is shown that a small group of humans still exist. Julian and Jeanine are the so-called \"leaders\" of this group , and they all are trying to find \"the other world\" to live , where their life will not be threatened by the robots.The performances of the cast can be analyzed in the range between mediocre to decent ; some were good , and some not that much. I understand it is not a very big budget movie , but the story needed full development to achieve critical and commercial success. I would love to become a story-writer for movies because I am really excellent at writing interesting, thrilling stories that can achieve critical and commercial super-success.

And this is done and world-wide wars break out all over and humans are killed off. Elias is obsessed with Arora - the last human strong- hold - but he doesn't know where it is, and he sees one human still alive and her name is Calia (Jeannine Wacker) and her purpose is to go to Arora. Elias makes a human machine called Andrew to befriend Calia so she will trust Andrew and take him with her to Arora. Then Elias will destroy it.Elias and his brother Damien (Carmen Argenziano) somehow encase themselves within Kronos and are able to live forever. (How is that possible?) Don't ask, it's complicated. Now 97-years later Elias watches Andrew and Calia travel to Arora. Along the way we see other humans but Elias has no interest in them, but only in Calia and her drive to find Arora.Well, this is certainly upsetting. Is this the end game for all of us? Debate among yourselves. What will Calia do when she learns that Andrew is a human machine? Remember, we were told earlier that even Andrew doesn't know.The only thing I have an issue with is the year that began all this and it should have been started much later than 2020 mostly because of the technology involved. See? (More complications?) Yes. Okay, more issues: If all humans have been killed off, where did Calia get what looked like new clothes? The buildings still standing looked well kept for the most part. ( Hey, remember that in a dream or now in a Sci-Fi movie anything is possible. Stop being so picky.)I cannot go any further without giving all away (There's more?) Yes, a lot more. A really big twist will happen and it surprised all of us. Stop it.

The pallid lighting together with John Cusack's makeup and cosmetic surgery do make him look fittingly non-human, but I think that was only coincidental. Julian Schaffner's performance will make you wonder what casting agent thought he was attractive enough to sleep his way into a role. On the other hand, the with other leading character, it is hard to tell if Jeannine Wacker's performance was consumingly terrible or just poor and struggling against vomit inducing directing and script writing. \"And...surprised look: \"Were you awake just then!?\" ...cut\" The CGI was surprisingly palatable, to those artists; i'm sorry you had to work on this film. I'm even more sorry if you had to attend the premiere only to see your pretty decent work be mixed in with the rest of this cinematic excrement. To give you perspective; I have written and posted my only review ever here since there were none on RT just to save others from being tricked by a popular actor's name into thinking this is a watchable movie. If you like the Walking Dead or War of the Worlds but wished they were more like After Earth and a bucket of poop written by a lazy AI program that strings together movie clich\u00e9s with poor scene cuts; then you will love this film.

The only redeemable part of the movie is the end when you see that they are setting it up for a sequel, which will give you a good laugh because someone could have actually watched the finished product and still thought a sequel could possibly ever be funded or made.",

It also starts with the applied use of a supercomputer to control human beings. But as we know the machines always rise above the humans it is also not an exception. Although many audience find boring to see these type of robotics Sci-Fi as they all share a more or less common idea. The first part of that belongs to the Machines and their domination and the second part reflects the fight back of man. This Sci-fi also goes in the same orbit. But some things are different here. It is more concern with human bondage and it lacks of heavy machinery apparatus that frequently unloads the movie. It has made a good combination of action and slow rising tensions between computer and the survivors of human being..So you will not find the movie as only a sci-fi rather it is a mixture of drama, romance and hardwares and softwares also.Those who like to see Robotics Sci-fi will enjoy it surely. The Terminator series..Ex machina..Blade runner..Robo cop...Cyborg..is these are liked by you then you are the candidate for this movie...Rest of all i am not sure.",

It contains every movie trope played with over the last 18 years. There's a little Hunger Games, a little Terminator Judgement Day, and Salvation, and a hint of Maze Runners. You have a teenage girl falling for teenage boy, running around woods a lot. The movie is set 97 years after \"judgement day\", the day Kconos the A.I. woke-up and destroyed all of human civilization. Yet, the kids look they just picked up their clothes at the Mall. They also find all kinds of neat manufactured things that look and work like they're brand new, not a century old. For example the Polaroid Camera they stumble on, which not only takes perfect instant picture (loaded with film...that's still good), but apparently the battery has stayed powered up for a 100 years to operate the flash. ...amazing.The acting and dialogue were cringeworthy. There were so many plot holes it was insulting. I truly feel bad for everyone associated with this film, but especially for John Cusack, what the hell was he thinking signing on to this project. I hope he was at least paid well. Then I found out that the original film was actually shot back in 2013, all the parts with John Cusack in it were filmed and added years later. This was a crappy movie, that someone tried to reedit in order to make it more marketable. ....swing and a miss....That explains a lot about the choppy continuity errors. This was a hack job. What's more laughable is this movie ended with a set-up for a sequel. What the hell, did they really think this POS was going to become the next Hunger Games or something?It's a shame really.

Here, the dialog is uneven, often predictable, and frequently not well grounded in character motivation. The female lead is rightfully cautious, at first, but then stupidly, (spoiler!) suddenly trusting.Other story elements were poorly conceived. The male lead's dream sequences were awkward. And his real identity was used in the story with ham-handed clumsiness not making the most of its potential for building suspense.Will Smith's After Earth seemed to have a similar \"bad humans\" theme -- humanity messing up Earth -- but the acting and dialog in that movie were far better than this.Hollywood seems to be playing it up to the eugenicist globalists and their \"perfect\" world order. After watching this movie, I just wanna puke. Maybe I can find an heroic oldie to wash this tired filth from my mind.Too often, any more, movies are becoming a real letdown. And of all the movies I've seen this year, this one ranks near the bottom. Can't believe it even has 5 stars. Can't believe Cusack was desperate enough to work on this.

This is countered by the development of robots which fight in place of regular human soldiers and the loss of human life has been too great. Racked with guilt, Elias has been developing Kronos, the first truly artificial intelligence which will analyse the Earth and the human interaction in order to make it a better place.Oops! Kronos determines that humans are the biggest threat and begins to wipe out the human race with its machines... SkyNet much?Humans are forced to live in shelters underground and forage for supplies.We see the life of Andrew Davis and his mother who is clearly ill. Then the title \"97 years later\".Andrew emerges from an underground shelter, looking exactly as he did all those years ago... At this point, the plot is given away. Supported by the \"no food for me\" scene later in the movie.With Katniss, sorry, Calia a survivor he meets on his travels, he is looking for a fabled human safe haven called Aurora.Calia gives voiceovers to advance the lumbering plot, sounding like Sarah Connor in T2.All the while there are cutaways to Elias and another man Damian Walsh (Argenziano) who appear to be controlling things...--O--When you learn that this was originally a low budget movie, you begin to wonder why anyone went to all the trouble of adding CGI FX, scripting for Cusack and Argenziano and then re-tooling the movie.As a low-budget indie, it was probably going to get good reviews although not stellar. It falls between a high school movie project and someone shooting a movie for the first time. It's evident in the acting of the two young leads. I don't know how much of the CGI was original to the movie and what was added later.Some of the CGI is obvious (when the robot chases them towards the exit) , some of the CGI is not bad.The movie nods to too many others in the SF genre and comes up short.Adding Cusack could only have been to make it appeal to his fan base but it didn't appeal to me. His acting was wooden and expressionless. And Carmen Argenziano appeared normal at the beginning of the movie but then was given CGI make up with a white eye and a glowing head.As others have mentioned, the availability of hair dyes, reasonably good clothing after 97 years of no factory output or sources of food - even tinned food doesn't last that long - means many plot holes remain like open sores.It's 92 minutes of your life you won't get back.

I also like \"good\" movies, of course, and in fact I *USED* to place movies into three general categories on a scale: good good, mediocre but not bad enough to be enjoyable, and so bad they're good. This movie has enlightened me to something.. beyond this, like UV rays or a negative number. It has crashed through the floor of my scale like a demonic Great Glass Elevator yeeting itself down to hell. The cursed fourth category of goodness/badness, 'so bad it's beyond being fun, I'm not having a good time, I want to go home, Mom.' I watched this movie months ago and I still just.. think about it every now and then, and how phenomenally god awful it is. So I'm here today giving this rating mostly for my own therapeutic help.The first red flag I noticed about this movie was that the lead female character looked like one of those knock off costumes you might find in a pop up Halloween store, but for Katniss Everdeen. It would probably be labeled \"Sad Braid Forest Tween.\" The second thing I noticed was the acting, or lack thereof. In fact after a couple minutes of what I can quite accurately describe as the worst acting to ever grace my eyeballs, I had to pause the movie and spend MULTIPLE minutes googling whether or not this was a real movie, and not a satire. Another reviewer here describes the main male character as having two expressions, and I'd say that's pretty accurate. I'd label them, 'confused', and 'confused with bigger eyes.' As for Sad Braid Forest Tween, she spends about half of her time melodramatically sighing, making crying sounds and faces but somehow completely tearlessly, and being completely useless. Now at this point in the movie we've met John Cusack, and I'm not quite all the way down the rabbit hole of terror, so seeing a relatively big name gives me hope! Maybe this'll get better! Or, maybe it'll be funny how bad it is! Oh, how wrong I was... in retrospect, hope was cruel.For flag number... I don't even remember what, we get to see what civilization is like after 97 years. And it's.. immaculate! Everything is clean! That bag of chips someone left out almost a century ago are probably still fresh as far as this movie is concerned! Other than that there's the confusingly placed images of burned buildings and ivy encapsulating walls, which seem to appear and disappear all willy nilly. In fact the continuity continues to prove itself so bad that it's break-the-fourth-wall distracting. Well, I say distracting, but there is absolutely NO plot development from which to actually distract. Just... nothing... happening. Eventually they tease out the ever-so-original plot that an edgelord supercomputer built for peace decides to kill humans. It's about now that I begin to lose my sense of reality. There is no now, or then, or here. Nothing makes sense. Everything is nothing and nothing is everything. Honestly I'm pretty sure I started to dissociate by the time they got aboard the spaceship. Which, by the way, is where upon our store-brand duo learn that they can either stay on earth and likely die from evil robots, or take off in a spaceship to the rumored new home for humans, and therein LEAD ALL OF THE EVIL ROBOTS TO AURORA, THE LAST REMAINING BASTION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES, WHEREBY EVERYONE WILL DIE FROM EVIL ROBOTS. Can you guess what they chose? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with shmead all of the shmevil shmobots to shmaurora.I did learn afterwards that the parts of the movie that have John Cusack were added several years after filming for the rest of it was done. I still can't decide if I'm more flabbergasted by the fact that they legit originally just decided that was a whole and finished movie, or that they thought adding all that crap with John Cusack was a going to help it. I left this movie a changed woman. Never before would I have thought it possible to hate a movie so much, and I spent actual money to see Mama Mia in theaters. The credits finished rolling and I was still sitting on my couch, glassy-eyed and re-evaluating all of my life choices that lead me to this absolute eldritch abomination of a film.

Now i can agree with other reviewers that complain about tons of 9-star ratings with no review.The story was dull. Don't get me wrong. I like post-apocalyptic themes, and technology stuff. However, i want a least a vague sense of plausibility when tackling the theme.This movie tries to go into Terminator territory. AI gone crazy, and deciding to exterminate humans. That's just the introduction, there is no explanation not development on that. You have to witness the AI kill humankind and then skip forward 97 years. (why not 100?).And then, the story revolves around 2 novice actors. Novice as in \"they can't act\". It is awful. I've seen best acting in street comedy. The \"old\" actors (Carmen Argenziano and John Cusack) and like they are not convinced. . I can pass that up.\nThen there is the FX. It is BAD. I don't require great FX for a good movie, but c'mon. At least try. Most current games look more realistic.But then i return to the story. And that i cannot forgive. It is boring. The lines are tedious and repetitive. You could guess what was going to happen or was going to be said. I won't spoil the movie. But it keeps on going. It is boring, dull, and tiring. Other movies, with less money, unknown actors, had brilliant scripts, and kept me engaged. I feel this movie will bore you as it bored me, so PLEASE .... Skip it. You can go watch Terminator, and even if you don't really like it, you will be more entertain with the action.",

The male character, Andrew, shows up with a fresh cut and some clean ones (ok maybe I'm embellishing on the ones part), rocking the mockingjay necklace, which happens to match Calia's pendant, signifying a believe in \"Aurora\" (an unharmed city). After immediately winning her trust, they play around in some abandoned houses, messing with radios and Polaroid cameras, all while dodging 50ft A.I.robots, and snuggling like a pack of puppies at night. They were attacked by a gang, where after being tied to a tree, busting out of his restraints and taking down 4 men to save Calia, Andrew learns he has super strength. After being struck by a sword and another night of playing puppies, Calia realizes that Andrew is leaking something other than blood. He isn't human, he's A.I as well. I must admit I lost interest at this point. Calia gets upset and leaves, Andrew learns he's A.I in a human body, and in the Kronos lab. Somehow Calia comes back to save him, lightly taps him to wake him up, where he returns the favor with an uppercut. Unable to give up on true love, Calia kisses Andrew while hes choking her (maybe she's kinky?). Andrew remembers and returns the kiss ( hello Divergent), then carries her into a corn field. I honestly didn't follow the rest. I watched this sans alchohol so it wasn't fun. But, all in all, it was unoriginal with terrible acting, but the plot had potential to be something good.

On one hand, the movie had pretty good production value, a seemingly serious tone, and John Cusack!However, the OTHER hand soon appears; It consists of wooden acting, glaring details totally incongruent with a supposed P-A world, and a nice spoon-fed plot narration by the bad guys... in case you're having trouble following along.I quickly realized that the intended demographic for this movie is the \"Twilight\" generation. The movie takes itself very seriously but is willing to sacrifice realistic aspects for the aesthetics of keeping the main characters attractive at all times... in a post-apocalyptic world. Example: the main male lead has frosted tips in his hair, which no one ever makes a joke or mention of. Basically, if you can laugh at things like that (unintentional humor), the movie is palatable. It never actually gets boring or painful to get through.

When someone brings up Singilarity, you will immediately become friends.This film is told in three parts. The opening with overcrowded Mega cities and robots seemed promising. However, there is no backstory on why wars are being waged or who is fighting whom.The middle part doesn't exactly make sense.The AI kills 8 Billion people over night. It then spends near 100 years and over an hour of story time searching for stragglers and El Dorado sorry Aurora. The AI spends considerable resources on this remnant of humanity. It's never really established why, or what all that other robo-tech used to kill the first 8 Billion is doing.The third phase is that it's revealed that Aurora is a different planet. The heroine has fallen for a Trojan Horse Adaptive Android who was created to infiltrate, find Aurora and destroy the last human city. Welp, the heroine ignores that existential conundrum and says she cannot go to Aurora without the Android. The space ship leaves. Armed with the coordinates to Aurora the John Cusick powered AI sends a fleet to purge humanity. Movie ends.That's the highlights. There is stiff acting, as well as a droning musical score that was likely created in Apple'e Garage Band software. The lighting is spotty. What suckers you into the film is the John Cusack and Carmen Argenziano billing until you realize that Cusack is just mailing it in. Cusack used to be a promising young actor. Now you pine for his sister's IS Cellular commericials. The other atttractive thing is the premise. However the execution is a complete fail.Lastly, I look forward to hearing about the amazing stories Julian Schanffner tells his Uber passengers about his brief fling in acting.

The female lead even has rings on her fingers and never a hair out of place...lol. The male lead always has a stupid wide eyed look on his face.

It didn't take long for me to realize that it largely resembled \"The Matrix\". However, Cusak impressed me in his villain role. The young boy annoyed me with his constant freezing like an idiot when he should be running. Too much drama in unreal contexts. They also \"bit\" some things from \"The Hunger Games\". While there was definitely action and moments of intensity, it came off as a reductive version of \"The Matrix\" to me as so many other movies. If they make a sequel, I probably won't watch it.",

The budget for this trash would have been better spent to send everyone involved in it to a career evaluation seminar. Cusack must have needed to make a car payment to take this role. Even he was trash. Any moron can just stare off into space and give a flat line or two at a time. New clothes, fresh crops, towns and items that certainly do not look 97 years old. No explanation of HOW THE HELL humans discovered hyperspace travel while getting systematically eradicated, ALL IN ONE DAY!!! The movie specifically says that 8,000,000,000 lost their lives almost overnight. Yet they had time to invent hyperspace travel to a planet they just discovered earlier that day? Terrible. Awful. Waste of time. Negative stars. This trash should be used as a form of torture.",

From the story description one might think this is another clich\u00e9 commercial movie and I must confess that I was not too interested to watch this movie because I expected just another special effects circus. However, as I am a big fan of Science Fiction movies, I thought I would give this film at least a chance. I must say that despite the trailer and some other comments here you will discover a very tender film about remaining good despite living on a destroyed world. The young actors Andrew and Calia might not be at A level yet but their performance is good enough to let you feel the basic story of friendship and trust. Cusack and Argenziano play their role well and are a good contrast to the young actors. Overall I would recommend this movie to everybody who is interested in watching a film that is more than just special effects. This is definitely not another Terminator movie but more of a very fine Twilight Episode. My final rating: A+",

I was entertained and it left me wanting for more.The film moves at a good pace, and the performances given by the main actors are believable and engaging. If you want to enjoy a good indie sci-fi you will find this a perfectly pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.There was enough of action and intrigue to keep me focused for the duration of the film, and I was actually a little disappointed when the credits rolled. The actors, who to be fair are mostly a bunch of unknowns gave performances to be proud of, and you could feel the drama in the air, even when they would have undoubtedly been acting against the backdrop of the good old green screen.Would I recommend this film to a friend? Well provided they enjoy movies in the sci-fi arena I certainly would suggest it as a great way to spend an evening.

I am by no means an expert, but, I do have a little bit of an academic background, having taken some film studies courses in college (covering American film and European film). And I've been exposed to some highlight Bollywood movies, and highlight Asian films (mostly Korean and Japanese films, because I spent some time there.) So, I have a good, broad grasp or sense of knowledge of world cinema in general.For the best of the worst in horror / fantasy, there are the American treasures 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and 'Troll 2', and the South Korean 'Dragon Wars: D-War'. For drama, there is Tommy Wiseau's 'The Room'...This movie is enjoyable in the same vein as these aforementioned gems. It is filled with confusing storytelling, inconsistencies, or at least not-so-believable situations or plot, pretty bad special effects, horrible dialogue, possibly intentionally bad acting, and just plain, blatantly ripped-off elements from other movies. And they pronounce 'Gliese' wrong; it is pronounced 'GLEE-zuh' or 'GLEE-suh'. ... I enjoyed writing my clever title for this review. I highly recommend taking an ambien tablet (or whatever your drug of choice may be) and watching this.",

What it feels like is a home project, for the two main leads or the director, as either university study, or just a hobby that grew into a full length film, so don't expect studio quality or the kind of continuity tracking or set design that would go along with this. There are other signs of unexpected growth with jerky plot motion, and filler dialogue by narration. All the scenes with Cusack appear to have been done over a single day shoot, in a darkened hotel room, and for the most part are repeated snap shots of him staring into space, later filled with graphics, done with a regrettable flatness; though it may be he's only done this as a favour.. Carmen feels more involved with the project. The plot and dialogue are a bit sketchy for them to work with though, think terminator universe, with hunger games mockingbird characters, and you won't be far off.However it's not all terrible, you can tell a lot of work has gone into it, and the graphic scenes could be very well done at times. The actors are young and inexperienced, but I thought the female lead at least kept it alive from an emotional stand point.If you're looking for a punt.. just keep expectation low. I don't mind that I've seen it, and it may be just a long way round to getting the attention of a studio to make the second part fully, and although I don't get why it was released as a film rather than handed in at end of term, you may find odd moments it doesn't suck, like I did.",

Don't be fooled. The original Imbd rating was 2.0 but it got bumped to 4.6. This is because they bought reviews. Please do not get this film it is a wast of 50 cents that could be spent on cancer research not making movies that are cancerous. So please have Congress ban this movie and to John Cusak. Why? How could you be so desperate. The movie budget 100,000 dollars. You were played almost nothing. Why would waste your talent on this. Don't even get me started on the non existence of continuity.

Let's do the easy stuff first.Yes, CGI is often horrible. There's no matching the background lighting and colors. Sometimes I've seen a lot worse and from, for instance, SYFY.Acting could have been better. Eileen Grubba isn't too bad as Andrew's mother. And, all likenesses to a certain Katniss Everdeen aside, Jeannine Wacker has potential. Julian Schaffner should, however, attend acting classes more often, though. Being kewt just isn't enough these days. Sorry, kiddo!Some (most) people complain about John Cusak's and Carmen Argenziano's acting (from bad to worse and WTF) and the fact that there's a city with bright lights on in skyscrapers. Some 97 years after Armageddon.How 'bout this! Go back to about 4:40 into the movie and hear Kronos say \"I will feel you. Do not be afraid\" and ponder what that implies. If you still don't get it, fast forward to about 9:20 and watch Elias moving about. Still no response? Well, fast forward again to 36:13 and listen to what Calia says.Cusak's and Argenziano's acting isn't half bad considering the above. It's like they have no real choice. Still don't get it? Repeat ad nauseum! But, hey, this isn't a movie with outstanding character portraits. It's Sci-Fi!Yes, there are similarities to Terminator. Of course there are. And I'm not talking about possible dupes of robots. I mean, if an AI reaches singularity and takes over, what would you expect? Humans are, after all, something to be... dealt with. Perhaps Kronos did the right thing after all?About a year ago, on SciFi-movies.com, the movie \"Aurora\" popped up. A full length feature by Robert Kouba, a young Swiss short film maker. A bit of investigation gave that crowd funded \"Aurora\" had been canceled and, thusly, I wrote to Scifi-movies and had it removed. I thought Kouba would be out of the picture. Check out the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcohH3YG4tMAs you can see from this trailer, it's \"Singularity\"! So, \"Aurora\" lived on and became \"Singularity\". Finally.Have I seen better movies? Of course I have! Have I seen worse? No doubt about that! So, I actually do rate this a 5 despite all the deficiencies.Clear your mind and watch it!",

I see a lot of people saying that it is not worth to see it... They're absolutely wrong. If the film was written by Cristopher Nolan, everybody would say that it is incredible, but everybody is expecting something amazing, not considering that the 90% of the movies made in Hollywood are worse, and rate Singularity very low. That people deserve films like \"Baywatch\" for the rest of their life. Before seeing it, you should consider that it is not a high budget film and the director is young; and I find the idea so good, so I can say the director is very talented; the actors have not a lot of experience (except of John Cusack), but they managed to act very well (ofc they're not Johnny Depp or Emma Stone, but still.). Anyway, The graphics are as good as a Transformers movie, maybe the lights are a little bit strange sometimes, but the work with the green screen is undoubtedly very very well made. I didn't expect something amazing, but the film left me stunned, I believe in the director and in the actors, they have a bright future. I want to give a 10/10 to support, the film himself, considering the whole world of cinema, could be easily a 7.5/10.",

It didn't just fry the computers, the concrete was literally crumbling within seconds of the 'magic kiss'. If the writers had a reason for it, it was edited out.\nJeanine Wacker was ok in her performance as the protagonist but her Swiss accent comes through loud and clear in her first few scenes which really threw me off. This was a dystopian future, 97 years in the future in the US. Why would our protagonist have a Swiss accent?\nJulian Schaffner did a good job, even with some bad lines. He was probably the most consistent performer.\nCusack did a decent job with some bad dialogue. He had a couple of really good scenes that gave me hope for the rest of the film but ultimately the derivative nature made it a bit too predictable and there were too many scenes spent discussing the 'heart of being human' and what it meant to be good. Can the robot become a 'real boy'? Those scenes were the ones with the cheesiest dialogue.\nI have seen worse movies but this was painful at times to continue to watch.

The cast alone should have steered me clear of this pile of filthy entertainment poopoo. The special effects were surly done by a four year old running around with a parents cell phone. How in the world this movie is rated higher than one star is proof of alien life and the Illuminati running a shadow movie industry bent on melting our minds. Usually during a terrible movie I am constantly waiting for something to happen that at least makes my wife and I discuss what we have spent two hours watching. Not this tome. She immediately walked out of the room and didn't talk to me for 36 hours. Which is probably a good thing considering all the name calling and swearing she unleashed on me AFTER she cooled off.

            "content": "A B-movie rehash of Terminator Salvation (with a dash of The Matrix), except the android falls in love, and Helena Bonham Carter's SkyNet is replaced with a deranged Elon Musk played by John Cusack.The production values aren't bad for a B-movie, but the very, very shallow story offers nothing new. I think some of the problem is that the movie is barely an hour an a half long, so it ends up feeling rushed; with all the wasted scenes of Cusack watching from afar, it ends up feeling like an over-long short film instead of a feature-length story.I guess there's a bit of a surprise/twist ending, but when you see it you'll just think \"Uh, OK.\"There were also oddities in the writing that broke immersion. For example:\nWhy would so many things still be functional almost a century later (manufactured clothes, oil in lamps, batteries in cameras)?Why did Elon Musk's brother become deformed?If the AI destroyed humanity without warning in 2020, how did humans have advanced technology hidden around for survivors to find? (avoiding spoilers a bit here)We're supposed to just take it on faith that an android on the humans' side will somehow turn the tide of a coming war with the AI.",
