            "review_title": "Very nearly a wonder",
            "content": "Loved the book, one of my recent reads and one of the ones that really resonated with me. Really admired that a difficult subject that similarly resonates with me was being explored. Like feel good films with doses of humour and sentiment exploring serious concepts. Love 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', also directed by Stephen Chbosky, that 'Wonder' is often compared to. A lot of the cast have also done good previous work. 'Wonder' generally did live up to high expectations. It was not quite a wonder but it very nearly was. Is it as good as 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower?' No, not quite. It is a very good film though, and is also one of the most faithful book-to-film adaptations there is (there are not many of those around). A few changes, but not ones that harm the film at all and it doesn't suffer as much as other book-to-film adaptations at compressing, the impact that the book had and its spirit is very much intact. Not a flawless film. The narration is overused and over-explanatory, there are far worse cases in film but it definitely could have been used less and didn't need to tell us as much as it did when it could have been shown just as effectively and would have not confused the storytelling at all. The ending also goes a little too far with the sentiment, feeling a little too maudlin and contrived.However, 'Wonder' had inspiring, well-intentioned messaging, and even when past my school days it inspired me and made me think how my bullying suffering could have been handled better on my part. It really resonated with me as somebody who has been there, being bullied in school mercilessly for being \"different from the norm\" and my difficulties (physically and socially) and found myself identifying with Auggie every step of the way and admired how he overcame everything. Personally actually bought how he was accepted (it certainly works for different people, and while some will not find it truthful, as someone who actually was accepted quickly when changing schools regardless of my problems it rang true for me). The comedy is not overdone and is genuinely amusing and warm in a gentle fashion, never distasteful, and the emotional elements were very poignant and brought tears to my eyes. The feel good elements had a real charm and warmth and there was a lot to be inspired by. A couple of other elements are also touched upon, including courage in the face of adversity (something that was true for me after leaving school and going to music college) and how friendship and family are portrayed, also very much identifiable and powerfully done. 'Wonder' is a beautifully filmed and directed film, sympathetically written and scored and always involving.Can't fault the cast. Jacob Tremblay once again, after his performance in 'Room', gives a revelation of a performance that is very easy to relate to, it is completely insignificant that an able-bodied actor portrays a disabled/deformed character (John Hurt in 'The Elephant Man' portrayed a heavily disfigured character, as a notable example, and Hurt was far from that) contrary to a couple of comments made.Izabella Vidovic also impresses hugely, Owen Wilson is warmly restrained and one would be hard pressed to find a Julia Roberts performance this gentle or endearing.Overall, very good and very nearly a wonder. With less and more subtle narration and an ending that rang true more, it could have been. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Touching Story with Rock Solid Performances All Around",
            "content": "\"Wonder\" is a touching story about August \"Auggie\" Pullman who is born with a genetic disorder that required numerous surgeries to enable to him to function, not to mention is facial disfigurement. Auggie is a sweet boy who has a loving family who don't treat him any differently, especially his mother (beautifully played by Julia Roberts). While he is home-schooled for most of his life, she finally decides that it's time for him to go to school, much to the initial dismay of his father (Owen Wilson) who is fearful about how he might be treated. Auggie also has a loving, but lonely sister, Via (incredible performance by Izabela Vidovic) who adores her brother but finds herself feeling like she's on the sidelines of the family due to the attention her parents give Auggie.Of course, much of the story is about Auggie integrating into school and the challenges he faces, especially socially. While it works very well, we are given some somewhat \"cliched\" characters here. We have the bully who can only make fun of him. We have the sweet girl (Summer) who likes him but is initially afraid to show it, and we have the boy who is a friend but is peer-pressured into hurting Auggie. The triumph of the performances really must go to Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) and Izabela Vidovic. Both of these actors have bright futures ahead of them. The film is touching and it interestingly enough, decides to use much of the story to share the perspectives of the main characters, telling the story from their points of view. While this was a good way to delve into the mindsets of these characters, and give us some depth as far as they are concerned, the movie ends up missing out on a golden opportunity.It seems that most filmmakers these days are trying to tell touching stories without becoming overly sentimental or being bogged down in melodrama. It is a fine line, but when you are afraid of delving deeper, you risk leaving your story too much on the surface. The movie would have been much stronger had they focused on Auggie entirely, and leave the exploration of the other characters to function and grow through their interactions with him. I found myself wanting more Auggie! I wanted deeper situations with his family, his friends, and the trials and tribulations of integrating into a middle school environment. Movies that do this well are movies that audiences end up cheering for. Still, the movie works, for the most part, and it should be a \"must- see\" for anyone who has been bullied or anyone who has been a bully. Most people still don't get how truly terrible and horrific bullying is.",

            "review_title": "what's the issue, people?",
            "content": "Geez, reading some of these reviews makes me feel sad for some people that they couldn't enjoy this movie.First, I should state that I read the book. The movie adaptation stays pretty close to the book, and definite captures the tone and structure.Second, what the heck is wrong with this being lighthearted? No, it was not meant to be a poster of what bullying is always like. I saw comments along the lines of, \"I was bullied and this is crap bc it's so much worse.\" Please don't compare your experience to this fictional movie/book. It is not meant to be a representation of bullies and the bullying experience everywhere.Third, if you found this shallow or thought it was just meant to talk about bullying you're just plain wrong. Several characters were deeply developed and multi-dimensional. Not one character is perfect (although Summer comes pretty close).Fourth, the point you missed. This story is about a family that struggles with their own personal things as well as an issue with one family member that affects them all in different ways. The friendship storylines are similar. The point of this book (and it was definitely written for younger audiences, that should be noted), is to give kids a broad overview of how bullying affects others and ways they can combat it. I love that the ending raises Auggie up: the point is how a family can support one another and how that can create resilience in a child and then how the larger community can work together (and in some instances, confront and change) to cheer one another on. Is this idealistic? YES. Is it meant to be, to teach and illustrate a lesson on how things can be if we work together, first in our own homes and then in our communities? YES.One final note, because I see people do this over and over again now with movies and literature. To the person who said something along the lines of, \"it's so hypocritical that we're supposed to be rooting for people to not judge Auggie and then he judges people by their shoes.\" Did you just need to feel offended and self-righteous? My gosh. This is real. awe all judge people, if Auggie didn't, who himself is constantly judged, then how would he be relatable at all? The author (and the movie) go on to challenge these assumptions. The \"hand-me-down\" kid is a friend, then messes up, then tries to make it right. The \"crazy\" girl consistently pushes back against the bullying in a way that many kids do (it's less confrontational and more socially acceptable); that's real. And the \"trust fund\" kid continuously pushes his privilege around in often mean ways, that we all sometimes do without thinking. There had to be a bully somewhere for the story to even unfold, right? And turns out his mom does the same: back to the point of it starting at home.Okay, I'm done being annoyed with humanity now. <3Just enjoy the movie and use it to teach your kids to support one another in the home and stand up for what's right when they're not home.",

It was so wonderful to see and feel everything through him. The way he describes everything is so beautiful. Also, knowing the story from the perspective of certain characters made a strong connection between me and them.I read the book. It was awesome too. Some details were changed in the movie but were good changes and there are some details from the book I hoped the movie to show it and it didn't but that didn't affect the movie in a negative way. Everything was simple, clear and on point. The movie has strong messages about kindness, love, appreciating everyone for who they are and true friendship.Jacob Tremblay proves again his talent as an actor. You won't recognize him because of the makeup but his expressions, voice and eyes were really persuasive. All the kids are amazing. Izabela Vidovic surprised me a lot. Julia Roberts is excellent and Owen Wilson was great. He was exactly as I imagined him while reading the Book.Finally, Stephen Chbosky. Great job man! Once again he made me care about the characters and he portrayed them beautifully specially the kids. He let them shine in every scene.I loved this movie so much. I had a great and enjoyable time with it. I laughed and cried. It is pure and heartwarming. This is a perfect family movie.",

            "content": "Have you ever felt like you were the same as everybody else, but you were also different from the world? 10-year-old Auggie Pullman will tell you that while he feels extraordinary on the inside, outside, he doesn't feel like that. He feels lonely, invisible to everyone around him. I guess, maybe we all feel like that sometimes. Maybe we're outsiders trying to leave a mark on the world, just like Auggie. Which is why \"Wonder\" appeals to the underdogs in all of us. This beautiful book, which came from the riveting and honest imagination of author R.J. Palacio, has touched the lives of millions of readers of all ages (I'm one of those readers). Now, with the help of co-writer/director Stephen Chbosky (Author/screenwriter/director of one of my favorite tales, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", Co-writer of Disney's astonishing live-action remake of \"Beauty and the Beast\"), I can't imagine anyone, kid or adult, ever being disappointed with this endearing adaptation of a beloved book that has great messages of never judging a person by their looks and to always choose kind, which is something that we all need to learn from in this day and age. With convincing prosthetics and makeup that makes look nearly unrecognizable, the wondrous Jacob Tremblay from \"Room\" and \"The Book of Henry\" is brilliant as Auggie. He has Treacher-Collins Syndrome (a craniofacial disorder) and has survived 27 surgeries. After being home-schooled for half his life by his mom, Isabel (Julia Roberts. still luminous and radiant as ever), he is sent to public school for the first time, with a little help from her, his dad, Nate (Owen Wilson) and his sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), who has always been there for him. As soon as he goes to school, he immediately gets picked on and bullied because of his appearance. Some kids, including Jack Will (Noah Jupe) and Summer (Millie Davis) accepts him for who he is. Even some of the staff, including English teacher, Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs from \"Hamilton\") and the principal, Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin) cares for him. But some, including bully Julian (Bryce Gheisar), don't like him. As the story progresses, we get to see the different perspectives of each of the characters, family and friends, who will leave an impact in Auggie's life in moments that are good and bad. Only then, Auggie will unlock the power of acceptance and friendship in order for him to truly find his place in the world. \"Wonder\" is a tough-minded film that reminded so much of how I used to love the classic family films I grew up with. A movie that doesn't dwell on special effects, talking animals or a big budget, but has deeper thoughts and real themes that enthralls the inner kid in all of us. It's moving, funny and tenderhearted in an authentic way that shows us that we have to see through the eyes and soul of another person, rather than seeing what that person looks like. It also helps by having a great writer/director and a terrific, well-chosen cast (including poignant turns from Danielle Rose Russell and Nadji Jeter, who plays Via's friend and first love, respectfully and a brief cameo from Sonia Braga as the Pullmans' grandmother) who care for this story that it never goes over the top with the emotions and it never goes down a conventional, melodramatic and saccharine path. Every moment of emotion fits like a puzzle and convincingly flows in every scene. Auggie said, \"We all deserve a standing ovation at least once in our lives.\" I say, we should all give a standing ovation to both book and movie of \"Wonder\", because like its characters that gets their moments of pure humanity and, of course, dear little Auggie, this story is a wonder. I will never forget this movie and I hope that families around the world who have always wanted to stand out from the crowd, no matter how different they are, will do the same.",

Today is world kindness day and a link appeared on Facebook offering free tickets at cinemas across the country to see a special pre-release preview of this beautiful film. Wonder is the story of Auggie Pullman who is born different. Home schooled, his mother feels it's time for him to enter mainstream education and he joins the 5th grade. People can be cruel and kids can be cruellest of all and Auggie struggles in a world where everyone stares and whispers and even bullies. It's not only Auggie who struggles however, as the film progresses we are told the story from different angles, that of Auggie himself, his sister, his sister's friend and his own new friend. All have issues which are both affected and unaffected by the way Auggie looks. This is a heartwarming tale, based on a New York Times bestselling book. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play the parents who love their son fiercely and ache for his anguish and rejoice in his successes as he finds his way in the world of the 5th grade. I urge you to go and see this, easy to watch and the characters are all endearing in their own way, even the bullies. I believe it's on general release at the beginning of December.",

            "review_title": "Cute, but weirdly contrived and confused with its messages",
            "content": "Here's the thing - the film is asking you to see the real person inside, to offer kindness because 'everyone's fighting a battle'.Yet, as soon as Auggie is introduced to fellow classmates, his overly-cutesy narration goes \"you can tell a lot about people by their shoes\". Camera pans down. \"The trust fund kid. The hand-me- down kid. The crazy one\" (cut to clip of the girl being attention seeking, as if to reinforce Auggie's assumptions). The audience is supposed to lol along. How is this fair? Immediately Auggie is stereotyping kids before they've even spoken, something he himself is plagued by. Similarly, it then introduces one bully after another, always 'curing' the first bully (with a message of \"hey - with a bit of kindness, even bullies turn happy and become your best friend!\") before moving onto the next. Of course, despite all this \"see the real person inside\" malarky, the film can't help but introduce some 'super-bullies' (older 7th graders!) who the kids delight in beating up as they 'bond' as new found friends. Then, Auggie receives a recognition prize despite all the other kids being the ones who help him - often having to fight against his negative expectations and assumptions of their agenda. Its very confused and jarring in its messages. Wonder is absolutely your 'safe' family film where everyone bumbles along to happy- plinky-plonky piano music, and any problems are soon solved with a hug. It takes place in an ideal world where anxieties, insecurities, bullies, and all complex human issues are solved via simplistic and contrived 'fixes' (normally involving hugs). I would like to say this doesn't matter because kids and families just want light entertainment - but I think it really does matter. Films have so much more power to inspire and share human truths and complexities, there's no real point in just passing the time with something so shallow.",

            "content": "When you learn that a movie's premise is about a young boy with facial differences, you know it's going to tug at your heart strings, wet your eyes, and put a lump in your throat. On those notes, Wonder delivers in a big way. Wonder tells the story of Augie Bloom (Jacob Tremblay), a 10-year-old boy who attends school for the first time, after his mother (Julia Roberts) had previously home-schooled him. His journey hits all the affecting, though predictable notes. He encounters bullies, a nice kid, an understanding and comforting principle, and a hip young teacher who possesses the wisdom of someone much older. Nothing on Augie's journey's will surprise you, but I challenge you to resist the emotional ebbs and flows along the way. That's the movie's main objective. It wants to make you cry and it succeeds in doing so. Aside from a few occasions in which it resorts to shameless manipulations, you won't feel too terribly about giving in to the feel-goodness. The performances are sincere, even if the actors are more so playing clich\u00e9s than thoughtfully-formed characters. Julia Roberts shines are the tough and loving mother. Owen Wilson plays the dad with his familiar cool guy with a big heart routine. It works. While he plays a supporting role in Augie's life compared to mom, he keys some of the pivotal moments of Augie's growth. Augie's sister Via (Isabela Vidovic) dutifully asks little of her parents, knowing how much work and attention they must give to her brother. The best part of the movie is that we see multiple perspectives, like that of Via. Several times during the movie, a different character's name appears on screen and we see his or her story. Via is one. Augie's friend Jack Will (Noah Jupe, tremendous young actor) is another. Via's best friend's personal story, who inexplicably distances herself from Via this school year, is the most illuminating. Director Stephen Chbosky's makes a wise choice to cover the story from other points of view. From this we can see not only Augie's story, but also the impact that he has on others. Though I'd like to have seen the material speak for itself more often, rather forced upon viewers in a way that feels, well, forced. We're going to feel sorrow during Augie's struggles and uplifted during his triumphs. Additional attempts to emotionally manipulate aren't necessary. Luckily, they don't overshadow the movie's warm moments or its wonderful message. The winning moments outnumber the sigh-worthy ones. And the overall effect is charming. Augie really is a great kid. It's okay to shed a tear and smile.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise and crowd-pleasing treat from director Stephen Chbosky! Ordinarily, if you tell me a Julia Roberts \u2013 Owen Wilson movie is opening, I would experience nightmares of Malcolm McDowell in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE with his eyelids forced open by metal prongs attached to a head immobilizer (Don't expect any other reviews of this film to reference the Kubrick classic). It's based on the New York Times bestseller and it's a throwback to the days of sweet message films that don't require explanations before recommending.\"I can't wait for Halloween!\" exclaims Auggie. While it's not difficult to imagine any kid looking forward to this big day, very few would share Auggie's reason. Through narration, he informs us that he's \"not an ordinary kid\". After a startling birth, he's been through 27 surgeries. Auggie has genetic facial deformities, and it's not the Halloween candy he anticipates; it's the one day with a level- playing field for him, as other kids wear their costume masks and he can simply blend in. Feel the tug on the heartstrings yet? You will.Jacob Tremblay (ROOM) plays Auggie, and Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play his loving parents. Until now, he's been home-schooled by Mom, but it's 5th grade and time for \"real\" school. Auggie's older sister Via is played beautifully by Izabela Vidovic. This is very much her story as well. She carries a burden that few understand, and even briefly finds peace in her fabricated time as an \"only child\". Previously, she had described Auggie as the sun, and the rest of the family as orbiting planets. Not only is it a wonderful performance from Miss Vidovic, but kudos to the filmmakers for casting a 16 year old actress as a high schooler. Typically these roles go to actors in their mid-20's (a pet peeve of mine).The film kicks into gear, and we really begin to get to know Auggie, once school starts. Mandy Patinkin plays the principal Mr. Tushman (a name he embraces), and we get the expected nice kid Jack Will (Noah Jupe), the rich bully Julian (Bryce Gheisar), and the popular girl Charlotte (Elle McKinnon). Some of the characters have various segments of the film named after them, and though these are quite loosely told, they do provide some semblance of structure to the film and keep viewers focused on the diverse personalities. A Science Fair, field trip and school play (Our Town) each provide critical turning points, and of course, most of the film is based on Auggie's impact on those whose path he crosses.Although we are subjected to one of Julia Roberts' patented cackles, it doesn't ruin the sentiment or message that Auggie delivers. Daveed Diggs has a nice turn as a teacher, and the always wonderful Sonia Braga makes a much-too-brief appearance. Director Chbosky previously gave us the gem THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, and this time out he allows us to explore the fragility of friendship and family, and the importance of toughness in an individual. The ending is pure Hollywood, but we should accept the crowd-pleasing cheesiness and be thankful for a pleasant, entertaining family movie.\"We need a renaissance of wonder.

The acting was INCREDIBLE, the story stayed true to the book (they only left out a flew plot points rather than invent their own) and it was overall a great experience. When I got out of the cinema, so many people were crying or said they had cried and I was overjoyed to find out that I wasn't the only person who felt touched. The child actors are fantastic, but overall there wasn't one bad actor. IF you were considering seeing this movie but weren't sure because you thought it might be boring, trust me, it's really worth the watch!!",

            "content": "Firstly, I know there are some people with real facial disfigurements who are upset that the child wasn't played by someone with a real facial disfigurement, I can understand why. But as I have unilateral cleft palate myself which is similar, and that I have faced much discrimination throughout life, I feel that it was appropriate to cast a non disfigured child for the role. Why?As unlike a child actor without disfigurement, he wouldn't be able to clean the movie makeup off afterwards. Therefore other kids and even adults in the real world would assume that the young actor is still in character, and bullied even more for it. The movie would only enforce the focus even more on his real life disfigurement in the real world and less on the young actor who played him. Therefore I feel that it was a wise insightful appropriate move. If it was an adult character then I would question it...Anyway back to the movie.It was...okay. But it didn't nail the true reality. I identified with a few things especially the bullying. But as I suspected this movie would be which is a major problem of what a lot of these kind of movies have, it feels much too sanitised.The kid dealt with it a lot better than I did, a lot better than many do. But maybe it is partly because he has the unrealistic perfect movie parents and idyllic family life, and of course as I also suspected would happen he receives a standing ovation from the whole school at the end and everybody is now his friend. As Gargamel would say \"How sickeningly sweet!\".In the real world quite often the bullying is relentless right to the end where even teachers and head teachers don't do a damn thing, and even victim blame, and that it often continues into adult life with even more discrimination. I know this from hard experiences.Another thing, as somebody else pointed out and I agree, the main character \"Auggie\" started talking about how you can tell someone from their shoes. Trust fund kid, crazy kid, hand-me-down kid.....Why would he judge others on their appearance when he gets similar treatment himself? I realise the narrative is probably there to suggest that everybody can be unfairly stereotyped, but for me in the real world I think we with severe facial disfigurements have learned to be less superficial than that.I for one would like to watch a real hard hitting gritty realistic movie, from childhood through to adulthood where it doesn't have the perfect sanitised happy TV movie ending. Not necessarily a really sad unhappy ending, but at least an ending where it shows that he or she as an adult has learned life's harsh lessons the hard way through the continuing bigotry of others through life. Show the world what many of us still go through.The child actor should again be played by someone who isn't disfigured for real for the reasons I gave, but an adult actor who is more emotionally mature and equipped to deal with the cruel comments in the real world should be played by an actor who is.\"Wonder\" is a sweet movie with good intentions, worth watching the once and it does show a degree of empathy which we need more of these days, but it is still typical TV movie syrupy and sanitised melodrama stuff, that isn't near realistic enough. I hope one day it might inspire a more insightful educating movie and portray the true harsh reality of living with facial disfigurements (and maybe even added speech impairment) even if it alarms and shocks people. It would send a more powerful message and that would be a good thing.5/10",

I didn't even have a deformity and I was tortured by verbal and physical abuse, and the children were relentless and merciless. Not a single one dared have some empathy for me or tried to talk to me. They'd be more and more cruel everyday, and the school's principal didn't give a damn about my situation either. That's because I was only a nerd! Now imagine what it'd be like for a child with a facial deformity in real life.I know this movie wants to be motivating and wants to spread the message about being yourself and respecting other. I also see solid performances by Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson. But this movie is not realistic. Bullying is much worse than that and bullied kids suffer much more than that.",

Middle school is probably the least forgiving environment he could be entering, as anyone who has ever met an eleven year old could tell you, but he has a strong support network with his parents (Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts) and his sister (Izabela Vidovic). If the story had only focused on Auggie it would have been good, but what set it apart was that it branched out. A lot of time is devoted to his sister, Via, as she is also facing a tough transition in her life as she begins high school. She is used to having to take care of herself because Auggie requires so much attention and she is able to put her own problems on the backburner to be there to support her little brother.They also look through the eyes of some of Auggie and Via's friends to see how Auggie has impacted their lives.

            "content": "A Hollywood movie about a deformed boy battling adversities starring Owen Wilson? Yes, it's exactly as predictable as it sounds. I hate to sound like a cynical old man (I'm actually only 22 with the mind of a fifty year-old whoops) but I've sat through my fair share of schmaltz which mainstream audiences seem to lap up. People seem to be completely sucked in by the manipulative tearjerkers which we've seen over the past few decades such as My Sisters Keeper and Marley and Me, but ultimately, they're sentimental nonsense and therefore phony.Wonder is the 'heart-warming true story' of a boy who has a facial disfigurement and affects the lives of those around him. In all fairness, Wonder isn't a bad film. It's well-made and entertaining enough but certainly isn't anything memorable. It feels like an Oscar-bait movie but I have a suspicious feeling that Stephen Chbosky will be winning as many Oscars as he did for his previous debut, The Perks of Being a Wallflower.It's likely to gain comparisons to the superior 1985 film, Mask due to having a central character facing similar issues. However whilst Mask handled the subject with maturity and objectiveness, Wonder smothers on the treacle and treats the audience like children who have an irrational phobia of people whose appearances are abnormal. In that sense, Wonder is a fantastic film for children to see and I was delighted to see plenty at my free screening with their tight parents.So the film basically ticks off every clich\u00e9 in the book. Deformed boy gets bullied, deformed boy finds friend and then falls out with said friend, deformed boy gets new friend etc. but it was nice to see a focus on other characters such as his neglected sister. It's interesting though how the other big character, Julian doesn't get a similar backstory. Maybe it has something with him being a two- dimensional bully?No doubt audiences are going weep and applaud, and the film will do well at the box office. However, I prefer my movies with a sense of Haneke-realism to them. The saddest films I've seen feature absolute zero sentimentality. Requiem for a Dream rips your heart out and stamps on it. If Wonder wanted a similar effect, then it failed miserably. As a children's film however, it's fabulous and carries an extremely positive message which wraps itself in a lovely bow in the finish.",

The less you know about it before viewing the more joyous your viewing experience will be, so I'll just say it's one holiday film I hope will become an annual tradition along with the likes of \"It's A Wonderful Life, \"White Christmas,\" and \"A Christmas Story.\" While \"Wonder\" is not specifically meant as a \"Christmas\" or holiday film, it fits the more joyous and kind themes of the holiday season that are supposedly the core reason we even bother to celebrate them.",

His sister Via (Izabela Vidovic) is dealing with her own issues while feeling overshadowed by his problems. He faces difficulties in the school with scholarship kid Jack Will and bully rich kid Julian.This movie can get a bit overwrought. It definitely tries hard to be a tear-jerker. It pushes a little too hard to get any real tears. Tremblay is great. The movie structure tries to use other characters' points of view for certain sections. That actually provides a possible route to invigorate this relatively standard uplift genre. I would prefer the movie to use that structure completely. It could do one section for Julian and expand on Via's relationship with Miranda. I'm guessing that something about Miranda got cut. Also, Julian has the \"I'm sorry\" line but to the wrong character. That could easily be the ending instead of the crazy climatic fight. That almost took me out of the movie. The best turns come from Jack or even Summer. In general, these are appealing performances and one feels for this family.",

It is based on a novel written by someone who more or less casually interacted (through her son) with a child with facial deformities, and doesn't seem to really have much more insight than that. The story points are fake, with a middle school straight from TV, and mostly upper middle class issues of adults pushed on to the kids. The story idealised, and interactions are stilted and contrived. Ultimately the story always stays outside of Auggie, idealising him, rather than giving him agency or power, while doing the same for everyone else in the story.What is really missing is the feel good story that could have existed, based on the people that I know with similar issues.

I was thinking about the following questions: \ndoes this movie have to be realistic? what if it shows us an ideal to strive after?wouldn't \"Wonder\" be a good title?In my opinion this movie is not necessarily realistic (yet) but optimistic. It does not have to be realistic, because it is (of course) a fictional movie and showing something most people will not have experienced in their lives. Here, I'm especially referring to people that got bullied at school. All too often, those people are left alone and stuck in their situation. Over years, they may get permanently threatened, often with no or very few external help. The reasons for that are manyfold, but often boil down to something superficial. I do know that - not really from the bullied but from the bully side.Back at my school days, it did happen that I was in groups bullying minorities. At those moments, we felt stronger, I guess. But with hindsight, I felt actually bad, knowing that even the slightest participation in such things is bad. Even looking away is bad.Courage is what I was missing at these days, and I regretted it. This movie shows even \"stupid\" people like me that there is a way out and people can manage to act differently. In that sense the movie is optimistically showing an ideal. But people often need to be taken by the hand, to be shown alternative ways of behaving, so they can strive after such behavior. This movie reminded me of that, and it felt good watching it. Even if the movie nowadays has to be titled \"Wonder\", it is a step towards making this wonder come alive. Believe in it!",

            "content": "\"Wonder\" is definitely one of the best movies of this year. It is about a boy named August / Auggie, who has facial differences ; he has gone through 27 surgeries since birth. The movie focuses mainly on the time when Auggie is sent to a regular school by his Mom, against Auggie's Dad's wishes. Auggie faces all types of obstacles / problems that an individual experiences among a group of similar-looking people ; being stared / frowned at , being accepted with doubts and suspicions , being bullied. However, Auggie is a tough-minded and intelligent person, and finally manages to gain genuine acceptance by most of his schoolmates and other people in the community.Jacob Tremblay plays Auggie ; he has really given a very fine, artistic and genuine performance as a boy with facial differences / deformities. Owen Wilson has given a decent performance as Auggie's daddy ; however, he has been denied a fair deal because Owen's role is very limited in the movie. Julia Roberts sparkles in the role of Auggie's Mom. Izabella plays the role of Auggie's sister, and she also excels in her role.The director, Mr Chbosky , has done an inspirational work in this movie. He has captured the sweetness and healing effects of feel-good films like this lovable \"Wonder\". Mr Chbosky uses a round-robin chapter style of story-telling ; some segments of the movie are named after certain characters. He has also managed to squeeze out good performances from all actors in the movie.

It always does a decent job of making its characters and their issues both believable and empathetic, but never manages to get out of the generally generic space we've seen so many times before. On top of that, there is an over-reliance on at times heavy-handed, 'tell-not-show' narration - the oldest narrative conceit in the book, this time most likely lifted straight from the book on which the piece is based. There's also the odd choice to throw up character name title cards as pseudo chapter breaks (more than likely another hold-out from the source novel) but then not adhere to them in any consistent or meaningful way. Still, the feature is enjoyable and occasionally somewhat affecting despite its short-comings and overly long runtime, something not at all helped by its generally unfocused and plot-light nature. 6/10.",

Its lessons and truths are hardly transformative, except maybe for the young readers who were enraptured by the source novel. We know to be kind, and look past surface flaws and deformities. What is especially disappointing is how watered down this is, instead of truly confronting. To cast and then put Auggie up onto the big screen is to force audiences to go through the same thing that all the Beecher Hope kids do, stare down their new freakish classmate. Yet Jacob Tremblay is a ball of cuteness, and you realise you're only grimacing for a second. The makeup is technically excellent but gives Auggie the appearance of a scrunched up puppy, or a half-amphibian toddler. I've seen scarier mascots for insect repellent. It's a Hollywood disability, sanitised for the movie screen. One of the saving graces of RJ Palacio's novel was its carousel of narrative perspectives, outlining how the other figures of Auggie's life are affected by the gravitational pull of his condition, sucking all the attention away from them. This is valuable insight that these sorts of (usually biographical) stories often ignore; the emotional cost and exhaustion of having to be the bigger and better person every single day, and have even slight lapses be demonised by public eye. Voiceovers reveal the secrets and shame behind their seemingly endless pools of patience and empathy, and in a particularly sweet moment, grandma Pullman sees Violet for who she really is: merely a teenager asked to be older and wiser beyond her years, and who has graciously done so. Sometimes playing favourites isn't so bad. This notion is undermined by the rest of the characterisation, which have an annoying tendency to wave off genuine prejudice for fluffy emotional 'growth'. No antagonist is truly an evil person in this story, only misunderstood souls who just need a kick up the empathy backside. The school setting, far from any semblance of reality, houses the usual cinematic bully figures (leaving nasty notes in lockers and so on), and operates under the absurd premise that sooner or later all these bullies will become best friends due to the sheer perseverance and courage of the victim. Bullies can't just be bullies, they all hide a stirring backstory and a lonely voiceover in their minds. Sorry, but kids can and will do much worse to completely normal peers, and to ignore this and spread some naive, happy-go-lucky attitude is nothing but ignorant. Even the dog is an absolute angel; then again, all dogs are, basically motifs for unconditional love. If you ever need some waterworks for your movie, just kill off a dog. Which is exactly what Chbosky does here, after giving Daisy all of two scenes beforehand, for no apparent reason. What grates me most about Wonder is how it comes off as some mandatory information session about workplace bullying and prejudice, with neat, inoffensive scenarios and big, bold instructions telling you exactly what to do and say. The teachers are barely human beings; they act like overexcited robots mimicking motivational speakers, with just the right snappy catchphrase to perk your day up. Sometimes the curriculum is just an excuse for Chbosky to indulge in mystical bird's eye view shots over time lapses. We get it, he's a social outcast. Wonder insists that this is the way the world should work, and in a magical, fictional utopia, perhaps it does, but in the meantime there's a lot work we need to do. Wonder is the safest movie about a socially-ostracising deformity I've seen in a while, with exactly zero risk involved. Write this any other way, and you're basically a monster.",

The cast overall is strong with Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as Auggie's parents, and Izabela Vidovic as his sympathetic sister. Daveed Diggs and Mandy Patinkin are solid as his teacher and principal respectively. While not overly sentimental, Director and Co-Writer Stephen Chbosky and his collaborators don't always find the right note or touch with the dialogue. The script (based on R.J. Palacio's novel) feels contrived at times (and the pop culture references are sprinkled in a bit too liberally at time), but the force of the acting ensemble mostly carries it over some unsteady passages.

The other standouts include Noah Jupe as Jack, his friend, Bryce Gheisar as Julian, his bully, and Izabela Vidovic as Via (Olivia), his sister. Owen Wilson snarks his way though the film with a some decent dialogue and not much else. Julia Roberts is okay and only slightly nauseating as the mother. Again, the dialogue elevated her performance until the last scenes. In the end, \"Wonder\" fell apart like a cheap computer that has just passed it's warranty date. Stephen Chbosky's directing of \"Wonder,\" based on the book by R.J. Palacio, is okay, but nothing special. The writing saves a few scenes, the dialogue at least, but the ending ruined a perfectly decent film. The music was too loud and overbearing, especially during the last unbelievable moments of a film the writers ruined by making sure we were all uplifted by the special moment. In fact, the events in the film for Auggie, a physically deformed boy from birth, pass too easily and with few complications. It would have made a great after-school special, a clich\u00e9 insult that is totally appropriate here. The start of the movie brought us into the drama in an interesting manner by slowly introducing us to Auggie, his issues, and his challenges going to school. Another thing the film does well is show how the drama played just not for Auggie, the child with the genetic disfigurement, but how it affects his sister, his sister's best friend Miranda and his friend Jake. My mom said \"Wonder\" was long. It seemed long, although it was less than two hours. That's not a good sign. If I were to rate the movie from the first third, I would say pay full price. But after thinking about the ending of the film I have to rate it lower. Rating: Rent it. The maudlin ending ruined a well constructed opening. But don't blame Tremblay or the other child actors.

This movie also has two story arcs.\nOne follow the boy and one the daughter. And this Is really annoying and \nthey jump between this very strange unessecary introduction.\nOk first of all Wonder Is about the boy and follow his life but nothing makes sense. No kids speaks like this in their age. I now for a fact NO kids are that much Into science either, no kid in school cared.. Its unrealistic to the point of ridiculus. \nThe arents hush hush at home and neglect the daughter and just keep on whimpering about worrying all the time for the boy. These are the worst kind of parents you can think of if yourself was a kid. Theyre good as explainig to the kid whats right and wrong and how to stand up for himself, all thats good, but they spend too much time not letting him experience anything. And thats why hes wearing hisspace helmet still. Life Is hard, but they just make it harder on themselves and the kids. The story of the daughter Is much more interesting but never leads anywhere really. In the end Wonder feels like the typical disney version of what a family should be. I love jlia roberts also but I found her to be very boring in this.",

            "content": "I was hoping for something a little more original than a Little House on the Prairie episode. First of all, maybe I missed something, but when the future bully Julian was taking Auggie on a school tour he may have said a few insensitive things, but only because he's a kid, not out of mean spiritedness, yet Auggie makes a know-it-all wisecrack about the mispronunciation of a word by Julian and then Julian turns against him. Can't say I blamed him.And why did his sister have only one friend? Her best friend blows her off and then she is completely a loner? She seems normal and nice enough to have other friends. Julia Robert's characterization of the mother confused me. At first I thought she was dressed liked a sister wife and had her hair in braids because she was a homeschooler. But then she became a little more hip looking as the movie progressed. Why? Because she was no longer a homeschooler, but back out in the real world? And what did Owen Wilson do for a living to be able to afford a place like that in what I assume was Manhattan (maybe Brooklyn?) and pay for private schools. We never find out but I was dying to know because he came off as a bozo. Overall, I don't think Auggie had it so bad at school. I guess that was the message. Everyone has it bad. Pretty depressing. He has one friend, and yet his \"normal\" sister only had one friend also. I don't think he didn't have a lot of friends because of how he looked. He just didn't have the kind of personality to become popular. I liked the boy in \"Mask\" because his schoolmates overlooked his deformities because he had a likeable, friendly, outgoing personality. One last oberservation as trivial as it may be. What kind of supervision did this school have? In the middle of the showing of a movie during the field trip, the two boys get up and walk out with no one noticing or saying a word. They could have run off to the lake and drowned. As a parent, I was horrified.",

            "content": "The thing I enjoyed the most about Wonder was how this wasn't just Auggie's story. I would have liked a movie just based around Auggie because of his willingness to keep getting up and trying to roll with the punches. But this movie is told from the perspectives of several characters and I was astounded at how well the movie fleshes out all the people we interact with. We learn about Auggie's sister Via and despite the fact she loves her brother dearly, she is battling her own resentment towards her parents because of the lack of attention that she gets. This is just a sampling, we get some time with a few more characters narrating and telling the story of what they see. I didn't just feel for Auggie, I felt for everyone and there were several moments that had me almost tearing up when Auggie wasn't even onscreen. I can't understate how effective the movie is at showing things from all angles and who would have thought you would get such great character development from a live action movie so obviously geared toward families?Another thing I appreciated about Wonder is that it takes the time to show that not every problem gets wrapped up in a neat little bow. Auggie faces real struggles and sure, he conquers most of them, but it is far from a walk in the park. He faces constant insults and threats, friends turn on him and he has to gradually earn the respect of the rest of the kids. Some of the kids face pressure because they can't afford to be at this school and stepping out of line means having a scholarship yanked. Others have inattentive parents who are more concerned with themselves and they have to overcompensate to hide their pain. This movie is about these kids (and adults like Auggie's mother and father Isabel and Nate) dealing with this plight on a continual basis and other than the movie ending on a sweet note, it pulls far fewer punches than I expected it to.Wonder also does a good job of walking a tightrope when it comes to the tone of the movie. There are scenes that are really funny and warm your heart. Soon after however, there's going to be something that sends you crashing back down to earth. The movie never gets too upbeat to be cheesy but never gets too weighed down to be a straight drama. Much like Auggie's life, we go through the suspected highs and lows and we even have a few unexpected twists to keep things interesting (if you haven't seen the trailer there's a cameo by a favourite Star Wars character).Wonder was able to attract some big names to populate the cast. Jacob Tremblay plays Auggie and he continues his impressive run. He's great for a kid actor and getting the emotion across under heavy makeup would be difficult for a great adult actor. He does outstanding work as Auggie. Izabel Vidovic is also really good as his sister Via. She has almost as enriching of a character and she gets across the bittersweet nature of Via's existence well. Julia Roberts did a much better job as Isabel than I thought she would. She's a great actress but I would have thought she would have been sleepwalking through this. She still oozes charm and she clearly came to work. The same goes for Owen Wilson who gets the short end of the stick with the screen time. He's still does exemplary work though. Credit should also go to Noah Jupe as Auggie's friend Jack and Danielle Rose Russell as Via's former friend Miranda.I had little to no interest in seeing Wonder when I saw the trailer. I rolled my eyes and it looked like a movie that might have been put on the Disney channel if it didn't have big names in the cast. I was completely wrong. This is a great coming-of-age story that teaches lessons about bullying, not judging a book by its cover and how a story changes completely when you switch points of view. The acting was great, the story was involving, the message was good, and it was conveyed in a way that entire families can easily understand. If you had struggles as a kid (bullying, academics, social problems etc.) I can't imagine you won't find something to identify with in this movie, which I know I did. This movie is excellent and if you're not uncomfortable with some heavy drama, I would put this right up there with A Monster Calls as wonderful yet sad movies that families can enjoy.",

I kind of got concerned about that when all of the trailers going into it were for other kids' movies; then when Wonder itself got going, I got the feel quickly that it wasn't for me. That was a bit of a disappointment. Wonder follows a boy with a facial deformity, played by the immensely talented and mature Jacob Tremblay, who excelled in Room and even competently stood out in Book of Henry, though that wasn't his show and the movie wasn't great. He's weaker here; Wonder looks at bullying and conformity in the school system but gets bogged down in children's politics, particularly looking at the other students. Some capable writing here and there, but it gets repetitive. The girl, Via, at one point says that her little brother is the sun and other family members, including herself, are orbiting planets. A few minutes later, she says her house is the Earth and the son is the sun. Seems like we heard this metaphor before. This young actress gives a good performance in a stage play a little later, but as with many films dependent on child actors, the performances are not a strong suit. Trying to compensate, they bring in Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as the parents, who are old enough to be Tremblay's grandparents, and look it.Other things are generic and predictable. A dog dies, the kid gets an award at the end, though it seems at first like they're going down a slightly less predictable path with the kid's friend getting the award. If you're a parent with mature kids, absolutely take them to Wonder. It will be very special to them. If not, you can probably skip it.",

The movie wants us to view Auggie as a whole, dynamic person rather than as a deformed boy, but it gives us little motivation to do so. We do not connect with Auggie. He seems distant and too focused on his own problem for us to relate to him. We rarely see his fun, smart, confident side - the traits that make a movie character likable. The movie has little depth. One would think that a movie focused on exploring the emotional struggle of a misfit kid could provide more heart-rending, memorable conflict, but Auggie only seemed to feel real sadness once - when his best friend turned on him - and even then the movie did not inspect his feelings close enough for us to be truly moved.Wonder had potential to be a good movie, but in the end it never gave us the depth of conflict that we deserved.",

            "content": "Adapted from the work of R. J Palacio and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the story is about August (Auggie) Pulman (Jacob Tremblay), an adorable boy who was born with a genetic syndrome whose sequel is a facial deformity, causing the boy to undergo several surgeries and medical complications from birth. After a few years and studying at home under his mother's teaching, it's time for Auggie to face the world and his first and biggest challenge is going to school where he will have to deal with the fact of being the new and different student. About to start his fifth year at a high school in New York, Auggie has a big mission to convince his classmates that, despite his unusual appearance, he is just like everyone else.The book \"Wonder\" is not just a book about a boy victim of life's circumstances. With a light format that mixes feelings of joy, fun and sadness, the story involves us because it is real and has our feet on the ground, showing that it is possible to face our problems, whatever they may be, but also to understand and respect that each person faces an internal battle that we are not always aware of. That is, on the outside we can be full, but on the inside, a conflict with our own feelings can be silently starting, without knowing the proportion it will take. And if the book teaches us all that and a little more, the film also aligns and faithfully portrays Palacio's work.Even though it has been a reality in childhood and adolescence in Western society for decades, bullying has only become a topic of wide discussion in recent years. In building the theme, Stephen Chbosky makes use of multiple points of view, dividing the film into chapters, each for one of the main characters. In the introduction, as it should be, Wonder focuses on inserting us into Auggie's daily life, introducing us to his family and new schoolmates. Because the protagonist was educated at home until the age of ten, the process of discovering school life takes place together with the audience and the main character.When the entire plot is clear to the public, Wonder bets on chapters to develop his supporting characters. With this, the work is no longer a plot focused only on the point of view of the victim of bullying, betting on other angles. Via, Auggie's older sister, for example, has been lonely since childhood, due to the attention her younger brother needs from their parents. To establish this character's loneliness, there is a focus on the absence of her grandmother, in scenes that show the young woman in the same environment in two situations: in the past (accompanied by her grandmother) and in the present (alone). In these mirrored scenes, there is an interesting differentiation in the photograph, which is more gray in the present, different from the warm atmosphere brought by the presence of the grandmother.The other chapters are also important, but not so well done. His best friend, Jack, and his bully, Julian, end up being the tool of a forced emotional manipulation by the direction, which seeks to exploit the cruelty of the two to the maximum in order to later humanize them and make the audience understand their contexts. Family members, which lead them to be cruel to Auggie. Of course, it's important to understand that bullying doesn't simply stem from human cruelty, but rather from a toxic and oppressive environment that manipulates children, undiscerning human beings with character in formation, but navigating only between the extremes (characters range from angels and demons, just like his parents) is too Manichean, sounding less than human.The use of space is one of the most commendable points of Wonder. In the scene where Auggie visits his new school for the first time, for example, we see the use of more closed shots, with an emphasis on shadows, creating an oppressive atmosphere in the school corridors, almost like a dungeon. As the boy adapts, however, we notice the use of more open plans and with more lighting. The space is also well used in the construction of her sister, Via, who is constantly photographed in open plans that emphasize empty scenarios, characterizing, at times her loneliness, at times her grandmother's absence.In the other characters, there are subtle but very potent elements in the development. Isabel, Auggie and Via's mother, for example, says that she had her master's thesis suspended when she started to dedicate her life to taking care of her son - a thesis that the character, when trying to resume, finds difficulties because the content is contained in a floppy, obsolete technology these days. This adds to the weight of all the time when Isabel's professional life was suspended (and even sacrificed) in the name of love for her son.The script manages to be even more subtle when, in a discussion between the protagonist and a black friend, it inserts a line from the girl in which she says that she \"hates being accused\", suggesting that, if with Auggie the bullying is because of her disfigured face, with she would be for her race. However, the racial issue is the most underused of Wonder. There are two black characters essential to the plot, Summer and Justin (Via's boyfriend), but they end up only being used as a ladder for the characters they relate to - in this case, Auggie and Via. As much as the focus of Wonder is not the racial issue, but the social issue, it should be noted that important themes such as racism arise in an extremely subtle way, so subtle that, apparently, not even the director realized their potential in his narrative.Even if he tries to use multiple points of view in order to create not a vision, but a comprehensive overview of bullying, Wonder makes a point of remembering that, even when the plot adopts different perspectives, the narrative will always be commanded by Auggie himself. The protagonist is, in addition to the dramatic center of the work, the only one who guides the narrative through his imagination. When the character feels safe, for example, there are images of him dressed as an astronaut, or characters from films he watches at his school appear. This helps not only to maintain narrative cohesion (the existence of a protagonist is essential for the plot to work), but also to create a greater emotional connection with Auggie than with the other characters. Even though we have access to the points of view of several characters, only Auggie allows us to visualize his imagination, bringing us closer.It is also interesting how, without even a single line of dialogue about it, a relationship of opposites is created between the brothers Auggie and Via. While the first tries to hide and escape from the world, something that we notice in the boy's desire to always wear an astronaut's helmet (which indicates both his instinct for reclusion and his desire to escape the world - the astronaut, in a simplified view, works \"in space\"), the sister seeks to be noticed - and goes after that spotlight in a literal way, enrolling in the school's drama class.While the choice is an interesting one to better present how the boy's condition affects those around him - like his best friend and his sister - it's also a decision that slows the film down a bit in its second act. Often a story is completely interrupted to tell another, which also takes time to develop. The script, written by fellow director Stephen Chbosky, Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, lacked being a little more dynamic for the language of cinema.Wonder grows when it comes to the main point of his story: coming of age. Both for people and society. Auggie grows up after his initial difficult relationship with the kids at school. They also learn to deal with differences better, realizing that he is a boy like any other. Even his family, so used to protecting him all the time, understands that the boy needs to go alone at times, for his own good. These are difficult learning experiences, which do not happen overnight, but they make all the difference.In the cast, Jacob Tremblay has already proven himself to be the best actor of his generation when he steals the show in 'Jack's Room' and does it again in bringing Auggie to life. Despite being under heavy makeup to deform his face, the actor manages to enchant with an expressive performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. It is he who steals all the scenes and manages to thrill the viewer with few words. Julia Roberts is sensational in the skin of the boy's mother, a woman who knows what her son will go through throughout his life for being different and suffers with him. The sharp dialogue between Roberts and Trembley is delightful, and the pair demonstrate absurd on-screen chemistry.Izabela Vidovic steals the show as young Via, the protagonist's sister who struggles to be noticed by the family while everyone is worried about her brother. More than a sister, Via is a well of understanding and kindness, but at the same time, she is a girl who carries the traditional problems of adolescence. She also has her flaws and battles and teaches Auggie to see that he's not the only one who suffers, despite putting up with a few good ones. Owen Wilson delivers a solid but not memorable performance. Oh, and don't forget to notice Sonia Braga's quick appearance, who in just one scene manages to demonstrate the full power of her performance.Wonder may sound clich\u00e9, but it brings a nice set of analyzes about its characters. Some of them more in-depth, others not so much. All, however, efficiently for the construction of a scenario where bullying is not limited to a victim and a culprit, but to an educational structure that begins in troubled homes and ends with the violence of those who vent their pain outside the home. The director Stephen Chbosky, who had already delivered the sensational 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', knows how to blend humor and drama in an efficient and wonderful way.",

His selfless compassionate Mom Isabel, played by Julia Roberts, home schooled her son, who now mainstreams into private school. Auggie, so weary of the frightened looks of others, cries asking his Mom, \"Why am I so ugly?' This is heartbreaking. Roberts's Isabel tells him that's not what she sees. She sees his wonderful soul. True. Though that holds little solace for the 10 year-old who feels outcast. He is the kid who admits to walking with his head down to spare others the gazes. Yes, the world can be unkind. Even among kids. On his school walk through three students, played by genuine Noah Jupe, Bryce Gheisar, and Elle Mckinnon, meet Auggie either looking away or at their shoes. Unlike adults kids aren't good faker. In spite of all resilient Auggie says that people are extraordinary, \"You just have to look.\" Writer and Director Stephen Chbosky's \"Wonder\" is a wonder. His screenplay along with Steve Conrad and Jacob Thorne based on the book by R.J. Palacio is bold and fearlessly compassionate. Instead of maudlin sentimentality, Chbosky brazenly challenges our prejudice of appearances. Look for the person inside. There are a couple cutesy missteps like the Auggie's joke about plastic surgery. Regardless, \"Wonder\" has a pure heart that authentically touches and inspires. The screenplay based on Palacio book brilliantly portrays multiple character viewpoints of Auggie's story. Izabella Vidovic is the amazing standout as his loving sister Via (Olivia). Via's distant best friend Miranda, played by gentle Danielle Rose Russell, once told her that her family revolves around the son, not the daughter. Via knows that she could have been Auggie in the family genetic roulette. However, she suffers in the shadows of all the love shining upon Auggie. Robert's epiphany of the cost to her daughter is tearful. Roberts and Vidovic viscerally capture love in forgiveness and seeing the other as greater. Owen Wilson as Dad Nate is welcome whimsical relief. Wilson provides surprising gravitas as well. In the amazing scene Dad tells Auggie about that space helmet he used to hide his face. Charming Nadji Jeter plays theater geek Justin, who sees Via's beautiful soul. He sees her. Likewise, Noah Jupe's Jack's eyes widen realizing his cruel thoughtless words about Auggie to impress his friends. Words matter. The way we look at others also matters. \"Wonder\" is both laughter and tears. In the end the wondrous boy with the deformed face and big heart reminds us that people can be extraordinary. A wise man once said that what he was good at doing was looking at things. Not to understand them. Rather he wanted be with. All we have to do is look with our hearts and see the wonder.",

            "review_title": "A well-made movie, but really more for children than adults",
            "content": "I went to see this movie this morning on the basis of a very positive review in the local paper. (I'm 66, so without such a review I would have assumed it was best left to children and their parents.) It is a well-made movie. Jacob Tremblay, who plays the cruelly-disfigured boy, is indeed wonderful, and Julia Roberts, who has filmed such a wide variety of roles so well, is not far behind him. Everyone in the movie does a fine job. Owen Wilson's portrayal of the father reminded me of the child dad in the comic strip *Sally Forth*. If that's the modern dad, I can only say we've come a long ways since I was a child.I can't look at this movie as a fifth-grader would; it's been too long for me to remember what it felt like to be 10 years old, and I suspect today's 10 year olds look at things very differently than I and my friends did 55 years ago. If you were ever made fun of at that age because of something that made you different, I suspect that this movie will awaken some of the pain you felt back then, however, no matter how long ago it has been. Most of the children are very cruel, at least until the not very believable end. Children do not have the defense mechanisms that adults learn to shield themselves from others' cruelty, so it really hurts. Part of learning to deflect such cruelty is to hide its effect on us, as Auggie tries to do. I suspect that just buries it somewhere in our subconscious memories so that it can pop out at odd moments for the rest of our lives. A sequel showing Auggie as an adult who has undergone yet more facial surgery and now has a \"normal\" face but still the internal, hidden scars could make for an interesting follow up.This story takes place in the world of the very privileged, the wealthy in New York City who can afford to send their children to expensive prep schools. That adds a dimension to the meanness. These children must all have well-educated parents and come from homes that afford them the best that material life has to offer. (As we see in the case of Miranda, material comfort does not guarantee happiness.) That they are still so mean to Auggie speaks volumes about what a college education does not necessarily provide. We see that especially when we have the misfortune to meet Julian's parents. As cruel as he is to Auggie, we can dismiss it as the actions of a child. When we see that his parents are equally hateful, we cannot dismiss it at all, and can only wonder that Julian is anything less than a monster. (His \"I\"m sorry\" in his last scene does not ring at all true.) It was clever casting to make his father so handsome. All that more striking to see that someone so ugly inside can be hiding behind such an attractive exterior.This left me wondering how much worse life would have been for a child like Auggie who attended a public school in a less-than- prosperous neighborhood. That would have made for a very different movie, I suspect, and one that would have been far more painful to watch.There are all sorts of nits one could pick with the script. The children sometimes speak very maturely for 10 year olds. Miranda's \"backstory\" tries to redeem her, but does not really explain why she goes from being Via's best friend to completely ignoring her. The sudden turn-around of the rest of the student body is also left unexplained.Certainly this is a good movie to take children, who will not worry about such issues, to see. It teaches important lessons. Will they be learned by every child who sees it? That will all depend on the world in which he/she lives after leaving the theater. No movie can make up for prejudice inculcated at home and on the playground.",

It's probably cliche for me to say a movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen(I say that often due to my high love for movies), but I MUST say that here!This is one of the Top 10 best movies I have ever seen, the most inspirational movie I have ever seen as well!Now what is this great movie about? The realistic fiction movie focuses on August Pullman, a boy with a facial deformity who goes to a public school for the 1st time in 5th grade. While he is there- he faces bullies, stares, and other related issues with his schoolmates. After a while, however, he starts to make friends and gets acceptance for who he is, not what he looks like.That may sound a bit redundant of a message, and sure, it is. However, I think this is the best way it has ever been told. To quote film critic Christy Lemire: \"Director Stephen Chbosky has managed to take a story that could have been painfully mawkish and made it genuinely moving in (mostly) understated ways.\"I must also applaud the movie for this: Wonder is one of the few movies that have ever made me cry. I cried for 4 reasons:1. There were sad moments.2. There were happy cry moments.3. There were moments that were happy AND sad.4. The movie ended. Yes, I seriously cried because the credits rolled!While my face is not deformed, I can relate to August in multiple ways: I too have been teased for being unattractive and other similar aspects like Auggie.I don't usually applaud acting, but I adored Jacob Trembaly's performance as Auggie. Other actors like Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, and Mandy Patinkin, and the lesser know kid actors do a fantastic job as well!If you have not seen Wonder, do so as soon as you can! This is the best movie to be released since Silence, my favorite movie! This moving and inspirational movie really is a WONDER! I can't say enough great things about this great movie!Did I mention that this a must see and one of the best movies I have ever seen?",

            "content": "It's not possible to write a spoiler for Wonder (2017): if you see the trailer you have seen the film. The beginning, middle and end are laid bare and no filmmaker would dare not have a happy ending for a child born with a facial disfigurement. The story has few narrative twists and turns, an absence of rising tension, and very little character development. So why see it at all?The plot line is simple. Smart ten-year old Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) has been home- schooled by his devoted mother Isabel (Julia Roberts) in order to protect him from the outside world. Wherever he goes people stare at his face, so it has been a tough decade for the boy born with the rare facial deformity. Together with loving father Nate (Owen Wilson) and understanding sister Via (Izabela Vidovic), the family has prepared him as best they can so Auggie can attend a regular school. His encounters with the students are predictably human, as is the effect on the resilient Auggie. Every clich\u00e9d scenario we have seen in every coming-of-age film is played out over the ensuing school term: he is isolated in the canteen; laughed at in class; picked on and called a freak. But slowly, people look past his face and see a funny, intelligent, and kind boy who is no different from any other.This could be one of the most manipulative films you will see in a long time. But it is also one of the most endearing. It all rests on the ability of the cast to reach out from behind the screen and squeeze your heart ever so tightly. The film belongs to Julia Roberts. She has one of the most expressive faces in contemporary cinema and the fear, pain and love she emotes as Auggie's mum is palpable. Anyone who has had a mother will love her performance. Owen Wilson is perfect as a goofy but wise dad whose 'tough love' for Auggie is so empowering. Izabela Vidovic does a superb job as the teenage sister who lives in the shadow of her brother's needs but loves him dearly. With extraordinary talent for such a young actor, Jacob Tremblay is a masked persona in the eye of an emotional storm. The story digresses into several character vignettes to show that even his cruellest tormentors have a back-story that merits sympathy for their behaviour. This is heavy-duty tissues territory.Few will escape the emotional ambush of this film but you are sure to leave it on a high. Saturated with positive themes and messages, it is especially relevant to anyone who has ever experienced or witnessed bullying or has been shunned because they are different. It is filmed with a down-to- earth realism and a comedic touch that lightens its load but never laughs at the issues. You will not care about overdosing on clich\u00e9s because this delightful and inspiring film is worth every minute.",

Still disfigured he starts at a mainstream school after spending some years being home schooled by his mother.Auggie like other kids enjoys the Star Wars films, playing with his XBox but at school he has to put up with both bullying and also being isolated as the kids gawp at him or talk cruelly behind his back. Auggie is a bright kid, good at science and attempts to use charm and self deprecation to win people over in what is a cruel time for him out in the open world.I found the film flimsy even though Tremblay gives a winning performance. It just felt a bit too much like a Hallmark film with more famous actors but still keeping the Canadian location filming. The technique of the film looking from different people's perspective did not really work for me, it just padded out the film as you focussed on other characters such as Auggie's sister.",

It seems like there are some movie directors in Hollywood that think they have something to \"say\" and they use their movies to get that message out....but it is just wasted energy, we don't care.Now to the review: Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts are like peanut butter and gasoline....they are completely unbelievable as husband and wife, they don't mix well. Their acting skills kept the movie going but during the movie I kept thinking there is no way these two would ever hookup in real life.And what would a new Hollywood movie be without a white chick and black guy hooking up? You guessed it, this movie does it's part at social engineering....liberal style.This movie is not fun, it is a liberal fairy tale with a liberal message.I gave the film a 4 because of the wonderful acting by ALL of the children.

The message to the movie is great. This is motivational to give you the strength to say, if he can do it, then what do I have to complain about, and hopefully that message is enough. However, after reading some of the negative reviews I can see that people are miserable and their narrow minds do not allow them to see the bigger picture. People do not understand that in order for people to actually learn to accept people who are different, then society and the media have to paint a picture depicting how easy it can be. The same thing can be said for gay people. Without the media painting the picture that it is ok to be gay, and accept gay people, I feel like it wouldn't happen quite as easily as it is nowadays. This movie shows kids that there are people out there who have deformities, or differences, and it is ok to accept them, because they too are people and can be loved. Shame on the people who have reviewed the movie and were not able to realize this concept even if they were bullied and find it unrealistic. Times have changed. And for those who have no tact, well this review isn't going to help you learn tact or be a better person, therefore not for you.

Maybe she's become so big that she can't even remember what humility is anymore.The actress playing Auggie's sister is adorable and does a great job, and Auggie embraces his character, too, but the family just doesn't work.

Sometimes this is inevitable, because what works on paper doesn't always work on screen and there are perfectly valid reasons for this, but it serves to underline why the book should be read before the film, and not the other way round.The book describes Auggie's deformity in such a way that it probably looks and sounds worse than it ever could have done in the film. I will admit I was, not \"disappointed\" as such but I suppose underwhelmed is a better term, compared to the book. But I suppose there was always going to be an element of artistic licence when converting literature to film and you can't please everybody.This is not a bad adaption of a book compared to some I've seen.

The film even used the chapter format of the novel by which the principal characters of the story got to insert their version of events as they happened, although that got watered down somewhat in the latter part of the movie. What surprised me watching the movie was how some of the characters like Summer (Millie Davis) and Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs) were revealed as African-American, you would not know that from reading the book. Now that I've seen the film, I have to wonder why that kind of information was left out of the written story.I also had a sense coming out of the book that Auggie Pullman's (Jacob Tremblay) craniofacial deformity was much worse than shown on screen. In the picture he doesn't appear to be someone you would be afraid of to look at or touch as is strongly intimated in the Palacio novel. I guess I was expecting something more on the order of the 'Elephant Man', which now that I think of it, would probably have been a greater burden than the real Auggie Pullman could bear.As a family friendly movie, this is an ideal one for youngsters to learn the value of accepting others as they are without making judgmental decisions based on appearances. Auggie Pullman had all the interests and desires of any 'normal' kid while trying to cope with a physical appearance that invited scorn and derision from those who didn't know better. The annual award bestowed upon Auggie for his 'quiet strength' and for being an inspiration to fellow students was well earned, a testament to the kind of human spirit we should all aspire to.",

The elder sister felt very lonely because the whole family surrounded augie, but she still taught patiently in the face of her brother's troubles. Because of augie's illness, my mother gave up her dream to take care of her at home. Will, because his family was poor, agreed to be friends with augie, but in order to please the other students betrayed augie, and finally fought with the children for augie. In real life, the likelihood of such a follow-up is small, but isn't the movie dreaming? The people who were touched by the movie at least yearned for kindness.",

W.\nAnd having an ark on the parents too would have been SOOO instructive: how have they been dealing with the pressure? How are they each feeling about the daughter being left out? What mindset do they each have that helped them going through with their son's childhood? And their relationship, what made them keep being strong TOGETHER from the birth?This movie wants to give us some lessons and extend our view ... but ... concerning the bully (you'll know when you watch the movie) OF COURSE he has to come from a wealthy family, OF COURSE the parents must behave like snobs, OF COURSE they must play the card \"With all the money we donate to your school\" ................ Sure ... like bullies shouldn't come from a middle class or lower class family?! I usually don't care that much about that cliche, but in this movie, since they want us to look beyond stereotypes when it comes to people's appearance, why would you make such a series of stereotypes when it comes to that bullying kid's family?? It was a missed opportunity to elevate even more the viewers' mind with demonstrations of empathy, understanding, forgiveness.And the end - i won't spoil - it felt more like favoritism rather than fairness. J. W. Deserved it much more! (those who saw the film should understand what i mean)",

            "content": "Wonder is surprisingly a really good film. It delivers with a powerful performance from Jacob Tremblay and the rest of the cast, it had a well written story, and it delivers emotionally. Sure, this film can be a tearjerker and make you smile at the same time. It has its feel good moment. It is also co-written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the same guy that did the film The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Which was also really good, if you seen it and enjoyed it. You will most like enjoy this as well. Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) was born with a Treacher Collins syndrome and had many plastic surgery done to repair his facial structure. He was always home schooled by his mother (Julia Roberts) and played with his dad (Owen Wilson) and talked about Star Wars which he always reference to those movies. His older sister (Izabela Vidovic) was always there for him until she was feeling unnoticed by her parents. Auggie is being sent to a school which he tries to prepare himself for interacting with other kids. Which some kids will be respectable while others are not. What I like about the film is the direction and it's an emotional story. It is about a child that wants to fit in with the rest of the kids. He would always wear a space helmet when he is at the park or in public. Afraid of being humiliated by the people or nervous to see how they would react. Sure, the world is not always nice. You get those sympathizing people but than there are also those rude judgmental kids that still cause the issue of bullying as of today. But this film works really well when it shows the theme of feeling neglected. Like Auggie's sister (Izabela Vidovic). She is the forgotten child with the parents. Nobody ever paid attention to her when she is trying to seek it. Her best friend is ignoring her and her first day of high school was being alone until she meets a friendly boy that tells her to join the theatre arts class. Then, the narration does go over her best friends perspective on why she was neglecting her. Every narration of these characters works well, it helps build emotional connection with these characters. Even Auggie's friend perspective was shown that his mother was hoping he would do a good deed for a scholarship. Jacob Tremblay did great with the character from the emotional performance as Auggie and the make up work was good. Julia Roberts was great and Owen Wilson has the supporting father and husband. Izabela Vidovic was great and seeing this as her first performance in a movie. Noah Jupe as Jack and Auggies best friend. The music score Marcelo Zarvos and Bea Miller was great. The script was well written and well developed with all the characters. What I did not like about the movie is it can be predictable. We may have seen these movies before. A kid gets bullied for how they look, the emotional pressure of dealing with these problems, and soon he is making more friends. But this film can be forgiven since it is about how he handles these challenges of going to school and how the people around him are handling there every day of being neglected too. Overall, Wonder is a really good film. The acting is superb. The story and direction is an emotional roller coaster and a feel good movie. The script is well written in handling these characters. And it does have its predictableness. I definitely recommend you seeing this film. I rate the film 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "\"Wonder\" is a new American movie that was released just yesterday here in Germany and the cast includes Oscar winner Julia Roberts, Oscar nominee Owen Wilson, almost-Oscar nominee Jacob Tremblay, Golden Globe nominee Mandy Patinkin (Homeland) and a few other faces that movie buffs will definitely recognize. It runs for 110 minutes roughly and tells us the story of a boy whose face is deformed through a genetic defect and how things go when he visits a public school like everybody else for the first time. The beginning sure is rocky, but things get better soon for sure. I believe one of the film's biggest strengths is that the longer it goes the more it is about everyday struggles for teenagers and there is also great focus on the other younger character as you will see by the intertitles. Interestingly enough, the two parents did not get their own chapters, which shows really that this is about the younger ones and at least as much for the younger ones. It may not be a film for the very little ones, but for everybody else it definitely is. And besides you get enough Roberts and Wilson too, even if they may not be in the center of the action. The director here is Stephen Chbosky and he is also one of the writers and with this film he adds another success to his body of work, certainly really on the rise he is. Minor criticisms go maybe to the final award segment that may have been a touch too feel-good and also to the scene near the end when the young bully all of a sudden realizes how wrong he was which did not feel authentic. But these are just really minor criticisms. It is a pretty touching movie in my opinion, funny at times too, and certainly dramatically relevant from start to finish. A powerful statement on tolerance and friendship and discrimination and with all the compassion for refugees these days we should not forget the ones in the middle of us who at least deserve as much of our emotional support.I think it is good that the film can call itself an Oscar nominee, but honestly the category could not be more wrong as really it is all about the one thing that should not stand in the focus in this movie and honestly with all the films with great make-up who did not get nominated they clearly had the disadvantage because the makeup was just there and not an essential part of the story. I really would have preferred a screenplay nomination. Anyway, better than no nomination I guess and we will see if it has a shot at the win, which I doubt. Now back to the film itself. I want to mention one specific moment I really liked about the script, namely the daughter's female friend who takes her distance all of a sudden and in a bad movie we would have had her try to make out with the boyfriend, but here we have her call Tremblay's character and talk about her feelings, which was one of my favorite scenes. There are many other really high-quality scenes though and this is a film that will suck you completely in at times and it will definitely fly by. Glad to see it is getting a great deal of attention and recognition. Tremblay delivers again and everybody else isn't too shabby either from the cast, but also from the crew. The final outcome is impressive and I applaud everybody who worked on this one in front of and behind the camera. This is a must-see, one of 2018's finest and a film for the whole family. I highly recommend checking it out. Huge thumbs-up from me.",

            "review_title": "Poor Representation of Disability",
            "content": "The 2017 film Wonder, based on R. J. Palacio's novel of the same name, follows the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) as he enters the fifth grade. The typical worries of entering a new grade are amplified for Auggie since it is his first year not being homeschooled. The first decade of Auggie's life was filled with dozens of surgeries to address complications due to Treacher Collins syndrome.Treacher Collins syndrome is characterized by facial differences around the eyes, ears, nose, and jawbone. These differences can cause difficulty breathing, speaking, and hearing that can usually be improved through reconstructive surgeries. 1 in 50,000 people are born with Treacher Collins syndrome and 1-2 in 1,000 are born with craniofacial differences.With a fairly large population of affected actors to choose from, many in the disability community were disappointed and frustrated when the producers chose Jacob Tremblay to play the role. Since Tremblay is not affected by a facial difference, he was made to look disfigured with extensive makeup and had to fake a speech impediment. Tremblay did reach out to children with craniofacial differences in an attempt to accurately portray their experiences, but surely Auggie's experiences could have been better shown by someone who does not have the ability the wipe off their facial differences at the end of each day.Ariel Henley, a writer with facial disfigurement as a result of Crouzon Syndrome, explains that she liked the idea of seeing \"someone like\" herself \"on the big screen\". She could identify with Auggie's struggles through numerous surgeries to correct facial differences and the childhood experience of \"trying to understand why\" she \"was different and why\" she \"didn't belong.\" The camaraderie that the craniofacial community could feel with Auggie ended once Tremblay was cast.The film industry has a history of casting nondisabled actors as disabled characters- Dustin Hoffman in Rainman and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump are two critically acclaimed examples. It is surprising that this pattern persists into the 21st century: a time where 'inclusion' and 'diversity' are buzzwords that have received attention across almost every facet of society.Jay Ruderman, the president of the Ruderman Family Foundation which focuses on disability inclusion, makes the point that, \"We no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable\". Currently, disability acting has become a place for nondisabled actors to show the scope of their ability rather than a place to focus on the experiences of those in the disabled community.When a nondisabled actor plays a disabled character, the disabled experience is almost always misrepresented. This misrepresentation can cause the viewer to form stereotypes about people with disabilities and prevents nondisabled viewers from gaining an understanding of the disabled experience.Not using actors with disabilities, especially in a movie like Wonder that is aimed at children, sends the message that people with disabilities are unable to represent themselves. This message can be especially harmful to children with disabilities who, like their nondisabled peers, are still trying to figure out where they fit in the world. A lack of role models can hurt their sense of self-worth. In most cases, the only thing preventing a disabled actor from playing a disabled character is the casting director's preferences and biases.Disabled actors must be cast in order to show both nondisabled people and children with disabilities that disability does not equal incapability. Being part of the disability community should not come with shame but with pride.",

Basically in North River Heights in upper Manhattan, August \"Auggie\" Pullman (Room's Jacob Tremblay) is a fifth-grade boy, he has a rare medical facial deformity called mandibulofacial dysostosis. Auggie has been home-schooled due to numerous surgeries to improve his breathing and facial structure, but he is approaching middle school age, his parents Isabel (Julia Roberts) and Nate (Owen Wilson) decide to enrol him in private school Beecher Prep. At first, Auggie is stared at and ostracized by almost every student, and he is tormented and bullied by some for his disfigurement, but then he is approached by classmate Jack Will (Noah Jupe), and they form a friendship. During Halloween, Auggie intended to dress as Boba Fett, his favourite character from Star Wars, but the dog Daisy threw up on it, so he dresses as Ghostface. Auggie is unrecognised walking around the school and is not tormented incognito, but then he walks into his homeroom and overhears Jack telling bully Julian Albans (Bryce Gheisar) that he is \"only pretending to be friends with Auggie.\" Feeling upset and betrayed, Auggie wants to leave Beecher Prep and got back to home-schooling, but his older sister Olivia, nicknamed \"Via\" (Izabela Vidovic), talks him out of it. Auggie is later approached by classmate Summer (Millie Davis), he tells her about the incident, but swears her to secrecy, Jack notices he has been quiet and distant, Summer gives him the clue \"Ghostface\", he then realises what Auggie heard when dressed up on Halloween. Julian calls Auggie a \"freak\", in anger Jack punches him in the face and they fight, it is broken up by teachers Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs) and Ms. Petosa (Ali Liebert). Jack is suspended for two days and writes a letter of apology to the principal Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin), who understands his reasons, during the winter break Auggie is playing Minecraft, it is there that he and Jack communicate, Jack apologises and asks to be friends again, Auggie accepts. During the rest of the school year, Julian and his group continue to harass Auggie, leaving hurtful notes, then taping a class picture to his locker, with Auggie photoshopped out, Mr. Tushman confronts Julian and his parents, Julian's mother Sarah (Crystal Lowe) proclaims that she edited Auggie out of the photo; she then says that Auggie does not belong there. Despite Mrs. Albans' threats to pull their funding from the school, Tushman suspends Julian for two days, Julian apologizes to Tushman for harassing Auggie as his mother drags him out the door. Meanwhile Via has been ignored by her best friend Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell), after meeting friendly student Justin (Nadji Jeter) she signs up for Drama Club at her high school, during the process Via and Justin develop a romantic relationship. Later Via is selected to be the understudy for the lead role in the school's production of Our Town, Justin is the lead actor, but Via never told Isabel and Nate the play was coming around, Auggie hears Via and their parents arguing about it. Auggie confronts his mother and sister, they brush it off, he accuses them of lying and storms off to his room, then the dog Daisy starts whimpering, Via rushes up to tell Auggie that Daisy is sick, they say goodbye as Isabel plans to meet at the hospital, it is implied that Daisy was put to sleep. It is the night of the play, lead actress Miranda pretends to fall ill, Via takes her place and gives a performance that earns a standing ovation, after the play, everyone, including Miranda and Justin, go home to the Pullmans to celebrate. During a school trip to a nature reserve, Auggie and Jack are ganged up and threatened by a group of seventh graders from another school, several of their classmates, including Julian, come to their defence. It comes to the Beecher Prep graduation ceremony, Auggie is announced by Tushman as the winner of the Henry Ward Beecher Medal for standing out; everyone applauds Auggie, and Isabel calls him a \"wonder\", he receives a standing ovation. Also starring Emma Tremblay (Jacob's sister) as Michelle and Sonia Braga as Grans. Young talented actor Tremblay shines in another moving performance as the boy with the congenital facial disability, Roberts and Wilson are nice as his parents, and there are great supporting performances from Vidovic, Jupe, Patinkin and others. It is a simple story of the difficulties of growing up, not just for one with a disfigurement, but also for well-adjusted children, it is clever for showing the perspectives of the other characters also, including the almost ignored older sister and the lead character's only friend, it is not just sympathetic, it also has some good laughs, all in all it is a touching and likeable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Very good!",

            "content": "Sappy films aren't everyone's cup of tea, but when a film embraces its sappiness and turns it into something emotionally resonant, then I truly believe that they can be some of the best films out there. While Wonder may have looked a little overdone throughout its marketing campaign, making it out to be a film about a kid being bullied for looking different from everyone else, that's honestly just scratching the surface of what the message of this film really is. There is always a feel-good movie that I attach myself to every year, and I believe Wonder is probably the film from 2017 that did it for me. No, it's not going to win awards for originality, but quite honestly, if there was an award for moving your audience to tears, then Wonder would earn top honors. This movie deserves to be seen by everyone of all ages and here's why.Following Auggie Pullman, a young fifth grader who was born under unlikely circumstances, leaving him to deal with looking different than everyone else around him, this is a story about the courage to ignore the bad and embrace the good. I was expecting this film to be strictly about the character of Auggie, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film divides itself into sections that explore each of the characters that surround him and their reasoning for either being nice or mean to our protagonist. I found the construction of this film to be one of the most commendable aspects because the end result only benefited from this.Ever since I first watched him perform in Room, Jacob Tremblay continues to prove that he's either ten years older than he looks, or that he's just a gifted actor that won't let a single movie prevent him from being stellar. This young actor has an incredibly bright future ahead of him. Whether it was narration that dived into his psyche or simply his natural interaction with his friends and family, I truly saw this character as a real person, instead of a generic young actor in a movie. Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts give solid performances as well, along with Noah Jupe and Izabela Vidovic being very solid in their supporting roles. Where this film may turn some viewers off (which I think will be a very slim few) is in its eye-rolling emotional core.Look, you can't go into a film like Wonder and expect something with raw human emotion like a film that has family in and out of prison because this is for families. If you're looking for the most realistic film in terms of realism, then I would suggest looking elsewhere, but if you're up for a great family movie that will make you cry every few minutes and make you want to hug the closest person around you, then Wonder is just about as perfect as they come. This is easily the feel-good movie of 2017 that deserved every dollar it received at the box office.In the end, Wonder explores a story that feels familiar, but not exactly ever told in this way before. We've seen thousands of stories revolving around bullying and looking different, but we see it from multiple perspectives here and watching all of these characters transform around the expense of the character of Auggie was such a delight. For people who want to sit down and watch a movie that will make them feel amazing, I can't recommend watching Wonder enough. Everything about this film is well-done. From its writing that does a good enough job in exploring multiple characters to the direction that focuses on emotion first, to musical cues that will have you in tears, to the very notion that our world can be a better place if people were kinder, Wonder has it all. Aside from feeling sappy at times, I absolutely loved this movie from start to finish.",

They choose a private school. As things develop, he is treated horribly, trying to hold up, but extremely sad. One boy in particular bullies him incessantly. Peer pressure rules the day and Auggie gets the brunt of the reactions. He has a sister who has given up her self because her parents have had to put their attention on the little boy who has had countless surgeries. Her story is as tender as his. There is a scene where she is the understudy for Emily in \"Our Town.\" If you can keep a dry eye during that, you're better than I am. These kid actors are awesome and it is totally engaging. Fine performances by Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts as the parents. Having just seen \"Lady Bird\" and now this, I've watched two outstanding films about growing up.",

            "content": "I remember when 'Wonder' was about to come out in theatres the trailer for it was on before every other movie I went to see, so I got to see it a lot of times. And every time it would come on it would make me very sad. I knew that the full length film was going to be a tough watch and so I put off watching it until now. Sure enough I was right. A very tough watch indeed. But also a rewarding one. It's a feel-good film, but it certainly doesn't have you feeling good from start to finish. The end product though is a very high quality one.I loved that the film specifically takes the time to explore the support characters lives and how certain things have effected them. All the focus certainly wasn't on the character of 'Auggie' as I expected it to be. This was a nice touch, that both worked to break the film up and also give it some depth allowing the audience to see things from different points of view.There are a lot of child actors in this film (who I usually struggle to watch), but they all put forward a great effort and are never distractingly bad. In fact they are surprisingly good. They were likeable (or unlikeable depending on which character you are referring to), charming and genuine. This was a massive bonus to the film.It doesn't matter who you are, school can be a tough time. To see someone clearly struggling and knowing the pain they must be going through is never going to be an easy watch. This is a tough and gritty film subject, but it's one that I'm glad I took the time to sit down and watch. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is on the edge about watching it. Grit your teeth and hit the play button. You'll be glad you did.",

Good job Auggie's sister- as I watched her monologue during Our Town, I realized that I wish I were watching their play rather than this movie- I totally would have been satisfied if the movie had ended right after this scene, however I peeked at my phone and realized we had another 40 minutes of slogging to go- I could even tell the children in the theater were getting restless from all the filler scenes. All in all, it wasn't terrible movie, perhaps even redbox/netflix worthy- did I feel uplifted with its predictable ending?? Yes, I did- however do I feel satisfied having spent 11 dollars for this viewing- not quite",

Meanwhile, Auggie's sister, Via has started school and her best friend doesn't talk to her anymore, and she feels like her family neglects her.

This is a family movie with a message of tolerance and acceptance for those that may look different from themselves. It's based on a book by R J Palacio about a boy that was born with Treacher Collins Syndrome, a facial disorder. Owen and Julia are the parents of Jacob and Izabela. Jacob has TCS and has had multiple surgeries for it but also understands how people can react to seeing his face for the first time. Because of this, he has been home schooled by Julia. Now, Julia and Owen decide that it is time that Jacob started going to regular school-5th grade middle school-and try to lead a more normal life with other kids, at least as normal as he possibly can. There are different reactions from the kids; some curious and some veer more towards bullying. Some, in ignorance, even think Jacob is contagious and that they will catch TCS if they so much as touch him. There are kids that do become friends with Jacob, despite their peer pressure and their single-minded parents. Izabela, who loves her brother very much, also has to deal with feeling neglected, since her parents spend so much time on Jacob. The movie has a message of tolerance, understanding and even acceptance of people that look different. It's rated \"PG\" for language and some bullying and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-maybe for the grand-kids-but I did enjoy this heart-warming family movie and it would be a good rental.",

Auggie was born with a facial condition, that makes him look very different from all the other kids his age. As a result, Auggie has never been to a regular school but, has been home schooled instead. When Auggie turns ten & is about to enter middle school, his parents decide to put him in a regular school. Now, it is up to Auggie to somehow navigate his way through school, for the very first time in his life. Wonder is a mind-blowing movie. Director Stephen Chbosky has given us a heartwarming film that doesn't get too preachy & melodramatic, despite its premise. Instead, the proceedings of the movie are light & humorous, while also tugging at your heartstrings from time to time. The performances are the highlight of the film. Jacob Tremblay is the star of the show, as Auggie. Tremblay gives us another unforgettable performance after Room(2015). Owen Wilson is brilliant as Nate. Izabela Vidovic is spectacular as Via. Julia Roberts is fantastic as Isabel. Noah Jupe is superb as Jack Will. Danielle Rose Russell is great as Miranda. Mandy Patinkin is good as Mr. Tushman. Nadji Jeter is impressive as Justin. Daveed Diggs is effective as Mr. Browne. Bryce Gheisar, Elle McKinnon, Millie Davis & Ty Consiglio are awesome as Julian, Charlotte, Summer & Amos, respectively. Wonder is a must watch, with your entire family. Go & witness this absolute wonder of a movie, as soon as possible!",

            "content": "When I watched this movie, I didn't know what it was about. It started great, made me curious and at the right moment it put all the right pieces together to introduce the story of Auggie. Here I was thinking this movie is very brave to touch such a sensitive topic. Later on, when it started switching characters and telling us the story from different standpoints I was like OMG this movie is perfect. At that step it had everything, the directing, the acting, the story telling. Everything made sense. It wasn't just about Auggie the poor boy with his condition, it was about a sacrificing mother, a daughter who's lived her life in the shadows and a father who's pretending to be strong.In the second half of the movie, everything went to the ground. The other POVs (Jack's and Miranda's) weren't as strong a Via's. In fact, they were shallow and hardly added any meaning. I found it surprising that they didn't make a Julian's POV since he's portrayed as a villain and just decided to make him the bad boy with the bad parents.However, the movie really looses its touch when it starts fixing and perfecting everything. All characters make up and renew their friendships, the community (which is a bunch of elementary school students) suddenly becomes supportive and aware of Auggie's condition and he ends up the most popular kid in the school and even wins an undeserved honorary award. The mother miraculously finds time to finish her Master's thesis after not working on it for a few years. The dad well he turns out to be just the dad with no interesting details.Many people have criticized the character of Auggie being uninspiring and selfish. I'll not go that way since he's a kid and I wouldn't go too hard on a kid with his age and condition. The actor (Jacob Tremblay) did a brilliant job though. Other criticism was about the movie weakly handling the idea of bullying and I do agree there. The movie didn't have the courage to do a good job of presenting this issue that's a a sole part of it.This movie had the potential of being great. It handled such a difficult topic in a smart way and had all the elements of being a masterpiece. However, when things got real, movie makers decided to take the short rode which turned this into an unrealistic feel-good movie that thrives to be aspiring but only succeeds at shallowly provoking the emotions of its audience.",

The film and indeed the boy (played superbly by Jacob Tremblay (Room) by the way) needed some form of closure - a happy end of you will - but did he really need to win an award? He wants to be normal right? I'm sure there were many people watching in tears at the end, but for me it kinda spoilt the film and changed my score from a 7 to a 6. Still, well worth a watch.",

            "content": "This is the adaptation of a book written for children and young adults. The book was a runaway best-seller, and director Stephen Chbosky was determined to keep the movie true to the book. The book was as predictable as an Afterschool Special and there was nothing subtle about the plot. It's manipulative as can be. It's formulaic. If the movie was to remain true to the beloved novel, it had to be all these things.And yet, Chbosky has created a wonder of cinema that kids love and makes their parents and grandparents weep unashamedly. We may know where we are going with this movie, but it is an unforgettable journey. Stephen Chbosky threaded the needle here, keeping true to R.J. Palacios' book, painting the plot, dialogue, and action in vivid colors so that kids will understand and love it, and yet making it intelligent enough that adults love it even more, and on many different levels.The screen writing is brilliant, and the acting ensemble is breathtakingly good. Jacob Tremblay may be a once in a generation young actor. Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts are perfect in their roles as Auggie's parents. Izabela Vidovic takes your heart as Auggie's older sister, who has needs of her own. And Mandy Patinkin and Daveed Diggs hold it all together - brilliantly - while dispensing the wisdom (and Afterschool Special lessons) that we all need to learn, and learn again.Patinkin - as Mr Tushman the Principal - tells the students that Auggie might not be able to change the way he looks, but we can change the way we see. And courageous young Auggie, who has been through so much, reminds us that he's not the only person with needs. \"Be kind,\" he tells us, \"for everyone you meet may be fighting a hard battle.\"This movie is this generation's version of what Pauline Kael called Capra-corn. It is unapologetically sentimental. It manipulates you and plays on your emotions. It's all about good and bad, about the values we hopefully learned as kids, and need to relearn as we become more worldly. And like Capra's movies, the audiences love Wonder far more than the reviewers. That's why this movie had the highest audience testing ratings in Lionsgate's history.Take your car, take the subway, take your family, and see this movie. It's that good. And bring Kleenex.",

            "review_title": "Wonderful!",
            "content": "Hollywood loves to recycle the same old same old, lest we forget some stories are universal to every generation. \"Perks of a Wall Flower\" director Stephen Chbosky's family-friendly feature \"Wonder,\" about a ten-year old lad with facial deformities, reminds us that physical looks aren't everything. Movies about people with malformed faces have been around since the days of silent movies. Mind you, this genre of films can be divided into two kinds: those where the disfigured folks have their looks surgically reconstructed and those who endure their abnormality without the benefit of change. Twenty-nine versions of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" about an ugly soul lurking in a church, have been released hearkening as far as 1909. At least ten versions of the venerable \"Phantom of the Opera\" have been produced, as early as 1916. Joan Crawford made \"A Woman's Face\" (1941) where she regained her good looks through surgery, and Mickey Rourke recovered his looks in the crime thriller \"Johnny Handsome\" (1989). Director David Lynch's celebrated saga \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), a plea for tolerance for the less fortunate, ranks as probably most distinguished. This biographical, 19th century London, England, epic depicted the travails of a horrifically disfigured adult male, John Merrick, who was an otherwise wonderful person. Reconstructive surgery wasn't an option for Merrick. Later, director Peter Bogdanovich's \"Mask\" (1985) dealt with real-life, twentieth-century teen Rocky Dennis afflicted with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia from birth that made his face appear misshapen and bloated like a caricature. \"The Elephant Man\" and \"Mask\" were far more graphic than \"Wonder,\" but each reflected the shock that occurred when normal people reacted to abnormal people. Typically, when we see somebody who doesn't blend in with the rest of us, we tend to alienate and ridicule them. We treat them like circus freaks. Although it boasts a happy ending, \"Wonder\" doesn't conclude with our protagonist emerging from surgery with a new face. He had to endure twenty-seven surgeries to look the way he does.The charismatic hero of \"Wonder\" suffers from a rare hereditary genetic disorder known as Treacher Collins syndrome. The ears, eyes, cheekbones, and chin are deformed, and it ranges from mild to severe. Indeed, August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay of \"Room\") wears a plastic astronaut's helmet in public to conceal his countenance as his parents. Auggie's doting mom Isabel (Julia Roberts of \"Erin Brockovich\") has been schooling him at home. Now, she can no longer adequately tutor him, because she lacks the experience to teach him about his favorite subject\u2014science. Reluctantly, Nate Pullman (Owen Wilson of \"No Escape\") and she enroll him at Beecher Prep School, but they do so with great trepidation. Isobel fears what lies ahead for her son as she watches him enter the school. \"Dear God,\" she pleads to herself, \"please let them be nice to him.\" Auggie has a face that resembles something a demented plastic surgeon assembled from spare parts that didn't match. Nevertheless, despite his horrific appearance, Auggie is just another pre-teen who shares the same dreams and joys of any normal youngster. \"Wonder\" reminds us that just because all of us aren't stamped from the same mould is no reason to estrange those with differences. Initially, when Auggie's parents brought him to Beecher, the compassionate headmaster, Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin of \"The Princess Bride\"), recruited three students of Auggie's age to give him a tour. No sooner has Auggie settled into his fifth-grade class than he becomes the object of derision. \"What's the deal with your face?\" one cruel student inquires. \"Darth HIDEOUS,\" sneers another classmate, while one more compares Auggie with Freddy Krueger. Things reach crisis proportions when Auggie's teacher discovers a classroom photo that Auggie has been digitally deleted from the picture. A note on the back of the photograph reads ugly people aren't allowed in the picture. Gradually, Auggie makes friends, but his first and closest pal Jack Will (Noah Jupe of \"Suburbicon\") unwittingly betrays him during a Halloween carnival. Jack confides in his obnoxious classmates that were he Auggie he would hang himself. Auggie overhears Jack because our young hero isn't wearing his astronaut outfit as he had planned but came instead as a \"Scream\" demon. Jack regrets his treachery. Courageously, Auggie perseveres despite Jack's duplicity. The gauntlet of insults that Auggie runs strengthens his resolve. After Mr. Tushman discovers the culprits who made the youngster's life an ordeal, things turn one-hundred-eighty degrees for Auggie. Predictably, Auggie triumphs over his worst adversaries and emerges as the most popular student.Director Stephen Chbosky and scenarists Steve Conrad of \"The Pursuit of Happiness\" and Jack Thorne of \"A Long Way Down\" adapted R.J. Palacio's bestselling novel. According to Palacio's website, she served as \"an art director and book jacket designer, designing covers for countless well-known and not so well-known writers in every genre of fiction and nonfiction.\" She had spent twenty years putting off writing her first novel until she realized she could dawdle no more. Ironically, she didn't create the cover for her own novel as she had for some many other authors! The filmmakers have adhered faithfully to Palacio's basic premise. We shouldn't isolate others simply because they don't mirror our own image. \"Wonder\" scrutinizes the dreadful consequences of bullying. Ultimately, Chbosby and company pull their punches with their saccharine treatment of the subject matter. Fortunately, \"Wonder\" doesn't degenerate entirely into a sermonizing after-school special because Auggie has a self-depreciating sense of humor. The sticks and stones our young hero endures during his anguish transforms him into a resilient person instead of a hopeless cry-baby who capitulates in the face of a crisis. Jacob Tremblay delivers a sensitive, low-key performance beneath the layers of prosthetic make-up that he sports throughout this 113-minute, PG-rated, feel-good feature. Happily, Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson restrain themselves, too. Sure, \"Wonder\" will tug at your heart-strings, but only those with glacial indifference to this little fellow's labors will leave the theater with a dry eye.",

In particular his big sister Via's story is followed through comprehensively and effectively, and she moved me as much, if not more, than Auggie did.Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play Mom and Dad: neither is tested very much, although both have moments. Izabela Vidovic is luminously warming as Via and Jacob Tremblay, so good in Room, is equally good as Auggie (and I still don't know what he looks like!).",

            "content": "\"The Elephant Man\" was a popular stage play produced in 1977, which was effectively turned into a successful film in 1980. \"Wonder\" draws upon a successful children's story with a decidedly compassionate view about a child with a physical deformity.The DVD version of \"Wonder\" includes a commentary track that is extremely revealing about the film. The speakers include the film's director Stephen Chbosky and the author of the novel, Raquel Jaramillo, who writes under the pen name of R. J. Palacio. Both Chbosky and Palacio simply gush emotion, as they describe the endless sea of sentimentality in this motion picture.The favorite scene in the film for the director was the \"Our Town\" sequence in which Olivia, the sister of the main character Auggie, assumes the role of Emily when her best friend declines to go on stage and turns the performance duties over to her understudy because her family members are in the audience. The entire \"Our Town\" segment was the best part of the film, bringing together the two friends who had had a falling out, as well as the mother and daughter. Everything came together in that scene, including script, performances, and cinematography.Thornton Wilder's classic play \"Our Town\" is simply filled sentimental lines, which are in keeping with the \"precepts\" that fill up the dialogue in \"Wonder.\" A kind teacher at Auggie's school begins each class with a precept, such as \"When given the choice between being right and kind, BE KIND!\" or \"Your deeds are your monuments!\" The precepts carry over into the family life of Auggie, Olivia, Isabel, and Nate. For his first day in school in which he must confront bullies, Augie is given the advice of his mother that \"when someone acts small, you just have to be a big person!\"It is fitting that when Augie is given a humanitarian award at school, the principal quotes from Henry Ward Beecher that \"Greatness comes not in being strong, but in the right use of strength\" which will \"carry up hearts by the attraction of his own!\"With so many thundering emotional taglines, by the end of the film, the audience is swimming in bathos. Despite the fact that the narrative, especially the school sequences, had no bearing on the true nature of bullying, the hearts of the filmmakers were in the right place in offering the wish-fulfillment experience of what a truly caring family, school, or nation might be like when we treat one another with compassion. It is small wonder that this film has been so popular that it is difficult even to find it available for rental in a Redbox machine.",

            "content": "'WONDER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama about a boy with severe facial deformities, who enters the fifth grade at a local school, for the first time, and attempts to fit in there. The movie stars Jacob Tremblay (who first garnered critical acclaim for 2015's 'THE ROOM'), Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Izabela Vidovic, Noah Jupe, Bryce Gheisar, Mandy Patinkin and Daveed Diggs. It was directed and co-written by Stephen Chbosky, who also wrote and directed 2012's outstanding 'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER' (which is also about a young outsider that's trying to fit in). Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne also co- wrote the screenplay, which is based on the 2012 novel, of the same name, by R.J. Palacio. The film has gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been a big (unexpected) hit at the Box Office as well. I (for the most part) really enjoyed it, and I also think it's really well made (for the most part), but I definitely have my problems with it as well. August Pullman, also known as Auggie (Tremblay), was born with facial deformity (Treacher Collins syndrome), and he's had surgery numerous times because of it. He's never been able to fit in with others, of course, because of it as well. His mother and father (Roberts and Wilson) enroll him in a school for the first time, called Beecher Prep. Auggie is of course harassed and alienated by most of the other students there, but he's also able to make a few friends over time. The movie details how Auggie, his classmates, friends, and family are all changed by Auggie's new experiences there. The movie is extremely relatable to me, in some ways more so than any other film I've ever seen. I grew up harassed and alienated by others for looking different. I think the first half of the film does an excellent job of depicting what that's like, and how it affects all areas of someone's life (as well as those around them). My only problem with the film is the excessively happy (and extremely unrealistic) ending. I think it's really positive and inspiring to depict society in such a positive light (where everyone easily learns form their biases and prejudices, that quickly) but life just doesn't work that way. On the other hand though, I think this is still a really positive and important movie for kids to see, because they're the most likely to learn from their faults, and try to progress because of them. Where as adults are much too set in their ways, and are incredibly fearful of change (and accepting their flaws). This film does a great job of illustrating that as well (when it shows how the bully's parents are much more bigoted, and full of fear and hate, than the young bully is). In my experience adults are much worse in their 'looks prejudice' than children have ever been too, and they're much more likely to victim blame as well, like the parents in this movie do ('so called friends' also do this). So while I really loved the first half of this film, I found the second half to be kind of insulting and completely unrealistic. It is still an important movie though, that could help kids learn from their biases and prejudices, and want to be better people because of it. So for that I'll still give it a pretty good rating.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",

Erin eventually sends her son to \"Beecher Middle School.\" In Real Life, Flint, Michigan's Beecher Middle School is considered the very heart of Pedophiliac Repug Party neglect. During the past few months, of course, KGB-controlled Racist Michigan Gov.

I bring that up because it could appear to some people that Wonder does that very thing, as the film revolves around a child born with Treacher Collins Syndrome and the various troubles that his family goes through with a world that doesn't understand the genetic disorder. Naturally a film that centers upon a child constantly being made fun of is difficult to handle emotionally. However, Wonder approaches this subject matter with a certain amount of genuineness that is undeniably endearing. So the problem I have with the films mentioned above, does not apply here at all.I'm not one of those people who go out of their way to deny when films bring them to tears and so I'm going to flat out say right now that I don't believe any film has impacted me this much and at a consistent rate than Wonder did. I can't tell you how many times I found myself clearing my eyes from the rain shower that was about to invade my sight. And I say this with so much respect and admiration to what this film was able to accomplish. Credit should most definitely be given to Stephen Chbosky's directing, adapting, and also R.J. Palacio's book the film is based on. But I was most impressed with the casting and performances of the film.After 'Room', we all knew he was in for great things, and Wonder is yet another example of the prodigy that is Jacob Tremblay's the actor (Auggie). Being the heart and soul of the movie, Tremblay gives a wonderfully poignant performance, and equally balances his innocence at 10 years old but also the inner strength he displays in not giving in to the bullies he faces. I also found the rest of the young actors they cast as his classmates to be impeccably realized. A lot of times when you have a bully(s) storyline it's difficult to portray their antics honestly. It usually feels like they are writing the bully's dialogue to service the arc of the main protagonist. In Wonder, every character of importance has depth and it's understood why the particular person would say or do whatever they were doing in those moments. Heck, there were moments where I felt bad for the bullies in Auggie Pullman's life.This also goes for Auggie's parents and sister as well played by Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, and Izabela Vidovic respectively. It was difficult to adjust at first, because I was so attached to Auggie's story, but I really appreciated this film taking the time to round out his family and friends. The film even chooses to have particular sequences in the other character's perspectives, which brings up an interesting topic the film covers. That is, the idea of equating your problems with those of someone in a different position than you. Auggie, having a facial deformity, certainly goes through a great deal of pain as the grade and most of society doesn't view him as a normal kid. However, the film also provides other characters with their own issues like Via (his sister) not receiving any attention from her parents, Miranda's (Via's friend) parents being divorced, and Jack Will (Auggie's best friend) having to forcibly hang out with him at first. By no means are some of those issues at the same level as Auggie's, but I appreciate this story taking the time to detail the supporting characters and not just show them as people without a backstory, which is what plenty of films do.Overall, Wonder is a film I didn't expect to love so much. My only complaints, which are very minuscule to the ultimate plot, are one particular small plot decision (that I know the book also did) late in the third act which I felt was entirely unnecessary and a little bit manipulative. Aside from that, the film is perhaps 7-10 minutes too long, but there's so many things to hang your hat on that those complaints didn't matter in the long run. It's as endearing as it is earnest in its storytelling, and we need more movies like that these days.9.4/10",

Instead, although it's simple, it's still effective in its themes and the cast is aces. Jacob Tremblay continues to show that he has a true talent, something he showed in Room.

Sadly that's not the case--I really wanted to play along, but so many scenes felt like emotional manipulation and I did not appreciate that.Bullying is such a big issue--not limited to kids who look different from the others--but also regular-looking folks.

Here is a basic summary: A child name August who has a facial disorder must go to school for the first time after being home schooled his whole life. He gets picked on by a bunch of Bullies and the main person the story focuses on changes people from time to time. From Augusts sister to Augusts old friend and so on. Now that that is out of the way let's talk turkey.So, by now you must be thinking \"What makes this movie so bad?\" Boy, will I tell you what! This movie is loaded with product placements. Right now from just watching the movie once, trying (and failing) to enjoy it I found 6 product placements! From Nintendo, Mojang, Microsoft, Acer, Google, and Apple! If they cared about raising awareness (about the fact that everyone is equal I think) they wouldn't litter the movie with paid advertisements! To make it worse every single heartfelt or serious moment is insensitively ruined by a burp or fart joke, the most lowbrow and immature humor out there. This movie is a corporate trap. All the people who watch this movie will think they are supporting a message of equality but they are just filling the big heartless companies' leather wallets with cash. Sad speaking of which, just a little thing to add, the message of this movie is very blurred, is it 'Everyone is equal', 'Beauty goes deeper than the surface', or the oh so classic 'never judge a book by its cover? The message is very clouded. Anyway, I am sorely disappointed with this movie. It even has boring 2d text transitions that a 4th grader could make. This movie did not live up to my expectations at all. Even the fight scenes that are the only parts that I enjoyed, still looked fake. To summarize this movie was a disappointing cash grab. But all the other reviewers will like this movie because they feel like they are supporting a 'good cause' and to that this seasoned reviewer I don't think so! I would not recommend this movie to people like me but all the other average Joes and normies out there: Give it a watch!",

I cried through most of the movie I recommend you have tissues nearby. It reminded me of the way I felt after watching \"Pay It Forward\" but with a better ending. If you know of any kid who is going through feeling different because of a genetic disorder, disfigurement, disability, etc., this movie shows a great attitude on how to handle bullies and deal with people who cannot see past the obvious.

I'm so glad I ignored that. Did I cry? Yes, but only in the very best parts where I was so much a part of the story I could hardly stand the joy of it all. Jacob Tremblay as Auggie is captivating, endearing, Owen Wilson as Nate, his dad is wonderful, charming and amusing, Julia Roberts as Isabel, his mom is perfectly played, and Izabela Vidovic as his sister, Via, will steal your heart. She plays a sibling who dearly loves her brother, but feels left out, ignored and forgotten as the sibling in a family where there is a child of special needs so often does.

Palacio's New York Times best-selling book of the same name, director Stephen Chbosky continues on his good form behind the camera that started with the fantastic The Perks of Being a Wallflower in 2012 and imbues Wonder with the essence of its title and while almost everything plays out as you would expect across a narrative that isn't concerned with going anywhere of great note, the gentleness and kindness that plays out in this tale with great heart will be enough to carry audiences along.It would've been so easy for Wonder to fall into genre trappings and become a well-intentioned but laborious experience but Chbosky alongside his pitch perfect cast members help create a world that feels believable and relatable even if the film and therefore Palacio's novel could be accused of being too nice (if that's a thing), almost as if there are no real stakes for our characters, audience's will quickly become fully aware things will never take a truly dire turn; happiness waiting just around the next whimsical corner.It's an odd criticism for a film of this ilk, a film designed to be a crowd-pleaser, yet it's not enough to stop this tale from succeeding and Wonder is absolutely a film that should be shown to all students (and arguably most adults) to remind them about what it means to show kindness to others and how each and every one of us has a story to tell and all deserve a chance to get to tell it.At the heart of all this is another memorable and impressive turn from young actor Jacob Tremblay, who proves that his breakout role in the Oscar winning Room from 2015 was no fluke.Completely disappearing into his role as the disfigured August \"Augie\" Pullman who has to learn to find his place in this world as he begins his life in the schooling system, Tremblay is faultless in his performance.Backed up by some solid support from the likes of Julia Robert's as Augie's mum Isabel and Izabela Vidovic as Augie's older sister Via, Wonder's ensemble do some fine work together and Chbosky's ability to showcase more than just Augie's story in Wonder's runtime makes this tale more than just a fish out of water experience and a more wholly encompassing look at humans of all shapes, sizes and personalities.Final Say \u2013 Wonder is what it is but there's little denying the poignant and touching nature of its humanly resonate story. Perfectly played out by its cast and lovingly told by Chbosky, Wonder is one of the year's most memorable crowd-pleasers that also harbors an ever important message of acceptance and a reminder to all about how precious each human life is.3 \u00bd extra hairy school students out of 5",

The tempo that is set right from the beginning, doesn't really change but I still found it entertaining, and well written. It's based on a young boy called Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) who is born with a facial difference, which has prevented him to go to school. His loving mother Isabel (Julia Roberts) teaches him at home but she decides to enter him into the local school in the 5th grade. His father, Nate (Owen Wilson) doesn't think that it's a good idea, because he hasn't been around other kids, and he doesn't have any friends but he knows deep down that it would make or break him. At first, Auggie struggles at school with the other kids, and he feels that everyone is talking about him behind his back but he soon befriends his classmate, Jack (Noah Jupe), who helps him tackle the class bully, Julian (Bryce Gheisar). While Auggie is struggling with school life, his sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), is also having problems at college but when she joins the drama class, she becomes close friends with another student, who eventually becomes her boyfriend. After a while, the students get used to Auggie's facial difference, and after a couple of episodes, he becomes close friends with the kids who used to bully him. It's a touching story, which proves that it's really what's inside a person, that really matters, and the fact that it's about a little kid who has a heart of gold, really does pull at the heart strings. Julia Roberts was great as the doting mum, and the chemistry between her and Owen Wilson was realistic. With that aside, it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again, and you do have to be in the right mood to watch it but it's still worth a watch and I'm sure that audiences will feel entertained. Watchable!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Stephen Chbosky, who also brought you the Perks of Being a Wallflower. He certainly got the best out of the cast, especially Jacob Tremblay who also starred in Room, alongside Brie Larson. For such a young age, 11 to be precise, he certainly put a lot of adults to shame but the storyline felt like there was something missing. As it was made from a book, I can understand that the director was trying to stay true to the original story but it would have been good to see a twist at some point. Anyway, I enjoyed the film and I would highly recommend it to people who like there emotional movies but don't expect the tempo to change.Budget: $20million\nWorldwide Gross: $300.5millionGenre: Drama, Family\nCast: Owen Wilson, Julia Roberts, Jacob Tremblay, Izabela Vidovic, Mark Dozlaw, Rukiya Bernard and Mandy Patinkin. 6/10",

            "content": "As an avid watcher of dark dramas tackling depression and suicidal tendencies, the thought of experiencing Wonder wasn't one that rushed to my mind. Light mainstream dramas, notably those adapted from best-selling novels, tend to be overly sentimental in an attempt to make the audience weep. Whilst I did find this adaptation to share some unnecessary sentimentality, the inescapable warmth and heart that it exhumed surprisingly overwhelmed me. To a point where I nearly, emphasis on nearly, shredded a tear towards the end. Not because of the overabundance of melodrama, fortunately that was kept to a minimum, but due to the personable characters that make the family worth investing in. A young boy named August with a facial deformity attends a public school for the first time, having been home-schooled by his mother, and must overcome the social anxiety of entering the real-world.The true wonderment to behold here is the script, and really is the prized possession of this film. It handles a delicate situation like this without succumbing to over exposure, melodramatic sentimentality and unnecessary plot details that purposefully forces the viewer to cry. It earns its tenderness by being, well, earnest. August could've easily been portrayed to be this overly sympathetic boy whom of which we all feel sorry for, however the writers intelligently transform him into a symbol of optimism. Occasionally August falls into the trap of being selfish by remarking on his deformities when things do not necessarily go his way, which unfortunately is executed in a rather heavy-handed way that inadvertently decreases his charm.However the segregated narrative structure, which follows the viewpoints of specific characters during the same time duration, keeps the pacing fresh and represents a sense of unity for this family. The story might be wholly focused on August, but it shows how the lives of others around him are also affected. Some of these perspectives work really well, particularly his sister and new friend at school. Some of the other hand do not, especially Miranda, which deters the intent focus away from August and acts as a filler rather than constructive character development. Still, this accessible structure retained the film's light tone and certainly threw me off guard (for the better!).Another winning aspect is the cast, and what a perfectly rounded cast it is. Roberts and Wilson make doting parents and fortunately get plenty of time onscreen to support Tremblay's central performance which was a resounding masterclass. He has been one to watch since 'Room' and he is really proving himself to be a capable actor. The perfect balance of childish behaviour whilst maintaining maturity to convey those all important themes, to put it simply I was amazed. The makeup used to showcase August's facial scarring was exceptionally realistic and assisted in elevating Tremblay's performance. Loved Chbosky's various directing flairs, particularly his visual style when August is talking directly to us. The astronaut segments mixed in with the 'Star Wars' elements were a nice touch at portraying August's vivid imagination.My last nitpick would be with the third act. I felt it could've ended after Via's play, instead of showing the nature reserve trip which essentially repeats the same plot details as before, particularly the bullies now standing up for August. It just would've made the film tighter and less drawn out, keeping that wondrous warmth safe. I also found the ending to be somewhat sentimental, with the award being given to the wrong person (I shan't spoil it...).Yet, from someone who doesn't usually enjoy these fluffy sweet dramas that come packaged with the word \"nice\", I found this to be a pleasant story. Beautiful characters, resonating story and pure heartwarming. Wonder is, get ready for it, wonderful.",

            "content": "Although I haven't read R.J. Palacio's best-selling book, it's pretty easy to see why \"Wonder\" has caught on with kids and adults alike. Its message is clear and simple, conveyed in a way kids can understand with some of the nuance that will resonate with adults. The film follows suit in the hands of someone who knows what to do with a beloved book, Stephen Chbosky, author of \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" and director of that big-screen adaptation.With \"Wonder,\" Chbosky proves his deft storytelling ability across written and visual media. He recognizes the deep connection readers have with this story and its emotional roots, and makes sure each element of the film channels that in some way. So much of \"Wonder\" is contrived to tell a story about compassion and kindness, but he finds ways to bring in authenticity to every moment.\"Wonder\" appears to focus on Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), a fifth grader with Treacher Collins Syndrome who enters school for the first time after having been homeschooled his whole life due to fear and insecurity around his facial differences. Yet, to use the film's outer space metaphors, Auggie is but one bright light in the solar system of his family and community, who are also impacted by Auggie's situation and have their own unrelated struggles.One of the story's most admirable qualities, in fact, is the way it doesn't simply pile on sympathy for Auggie scene after scene and tries to impart the lesson that just because his struggles are more external and obvious to others doesn't mean they always deserve priority treatment. The approach is more holistic, presumably because Palacio's book is as well. By taking moments to follow the perspective (with narration) of characters in the story beyond Auggie - sister Via (Izabela Vidovic), friend Jack Will (Noah Jupe) and others - the film beautifully teaches its audiences to consider perspectives outside of their own.Another admirable quality of the screenplay and Chbosky's direction is the way he steers clear of melodrama. That doesn't mean the film is devoid of clich\u00e9s (is there ever a film about young boys that doesn't involve a schoolyard scuffle?) but the conflict never erupts in a showy way. Strangely, everyone's reasonable and resolves conflicts normally. A scene in which one character has lied to another, a lie we know will be uncovered eventually, the revealing of the truth doesn't lead to some jarring clash between the characters followed by the person who has been lied to overreacting. There's actually some empathy involved.Sometimes, the characters in \"Wonder\" do manage to have the perfect things to say; the kids are sometimes overly eloquent and the parents (Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson) are sage-like. That said, characters are still given flaws and fallibilities, though some more than others. The school bully's parents, on the other, are painfully the opposite of perfect to balance it out. A scene in which the principal (Mandy Patinkin) confronts those parents strikes a nerve and proves one of the most memorable scenes because it exposes a sad reality. The writing of the principal's response and Patinkin's performance are gracefully done and part of what makes the movie special.\"Wonder\" has a lot of wonder-full moments and Chbosky is a more than competent architect designing and constructing them with substantial emotional payoff. The source material clearly lent itself to a higher-caliber mainstream family film, but the execution follows suit.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",

Kid with facial irregularity struggles to find himself when he attends school for the first time. Seems like the kind of movie to tug heartstrings. And yes, it does. Of course it does. But this movie isn't just about Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), it's about everyone in his life. And I don't mean it's about the people in his life and how they react to him or that their lives completely revolve around this wonderkind (pun intended). It's about how their lives are affected, sometimes in quite subtle ways, thanks to the attention paid to Auggie. Tremblay himself gives a grounded, loving, and mesmerizing performance as Auggie, better than even his performance in Room, but he's not the only star on the screen. Izabela Vidovic, who plays his older sister Via, is stunning in a strongly written, emotionally packed role. You see, people love Auggie, and they want him to be happy. And sometimes, when someone in the family has special needs...well, the others in the family are moved aside, unintentionally, so that Auggie can best deal with the hurdles life throws at him. This isn't neglect by any means - it's just a sort of reality. And Auggie, being all of ten years old, doesn't comprehend that other people aren't just sacrificing for him but that their personal growth is being shunted, because people don't know (from his perspective) the troubles he has. Having said all of that, this movie still could have devolved into a slew of treacly lumps of well-meaning banality, using Auggie's impairment as a shield or at least an umbrella covering and overshadowing everyone. And it doesn't. This isn't a disease-of-the-week movie. This isn't about Auggie's parents doing all sorts of research to find a 'cure' for their son.

            "review_title": "VIEWS ON FILM review of Wonder",
            "content": "Wonder is my latest review. It is for the most part, a \"wonderful\" movie. Now granted, Wonder is not quite Academy Award-worthy. However, if you like your dramas syrupy sweet and filled with plenty of cinematic saccharine, then Wonder will give you your fix.Wonder is distributed by Lionsgate and is based on a 2015 novel. It's what I like to call, a manipulative tearjerker. Every scene is displayed for maximum effect as you the viewer, loosen up the weepy ducts and reach for that big box of Kleenex.Wonder's story involves one August \"Auggie\" Pullman (played by an unrecognizable Jacob Tremblay). \"Auggie\" was born with a facial deformity and has been home-schooled for most of his young life. After reaching fifth grade, his parental units decide to enroll him in private school so he can experience more human interaction while making new friends.Now does all this sound a little familiar? Well it should. Wonder sort of resembles 1985's Mask (starring Eric Stoltz). In fact, if you look at Wonder from an extent, it almost feels like a combination of Mask and a distant cousin of Forrest Gump (the early years). So yeah, Mask is more accomplished than Wonder. It has more heightened performances (from the likes of Stoltz, Cher, and Sam Elliott), stronger production values in terms of scope, and a deeper characterization of its scarred subject (Roy L. \"Rocky\" Dennis).Still, Wonder is highly recommendable. It's a small, little film with a big, bleeding heart. I liked the unexpectedly good casting of Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as \"Auggie's\" sympathetic (and supportive) parents. I also liked the way director Stephen Chbosky includes fantasy elements (hello Chewbacca), separate narratives involving the flick's adolescent co-stars (\"Auggie's\" best friend, his sister, and his sister's best friend), and an unforced interpretation of bullying. This gives Wonder a level of originality and earnestness not seen in most kid pics.Bottom line: Wonder doesn't always elaborate on what makes \"Auggie\" tick, or how he became so smart, or how he got those birthing marks on his face. Oh well. This vehicle somehow works anyway and every kid and/or parent should see it. In my brief review of 1982's E.T., I remarked, \"if you don't elicit an emotional response while viewing this film, you might as well not be human\". Well that same statement applies to Wonder. Rating: 3 stars.",

WONDER, tells the story of Auggie, a boy with facial issues on his first year going to school is a funny, heat-melting and enjoyable 2-hour ride. The story follows Auggie into his everyday stuggles, the life of being different and overcoming it. My favorite part: the story takes narratives from different characters in the movie, which goes more detailed in how something happened, changes in people, and their real personal motives, that therefore develops more meaning into the story. What I regret: they could've gone a bit deeper on explaining characters since there's still time for that. I also recognized a few flaws and plot holes. However, thumbs up for the multi-messages and that special story-telling method.",

            "content": "I watched this film with a school group, and while it has a good lesson in it, the lesson feels very forced. The screenwriters seemed to pick out the best quotes from the novel and squeeze as many as them as they could into the screenplay. A lot of the narration was unnecessary, the film tells you what happens instead of showing. The chapter structure seemed unnecessary as well; it was not unusual for a character's chapter to give said character five minutes of screen time at the start, but forget whose chapter it is halfway through. The last forty-five minutes of the movie is Miranda's chapter, but she is only mentioned shortly in the start, barely being developed while the film expects us to sympathize with her. The jokes are dumb, and August's character made me wince. There were a lot of clich\u00e9s in it as well, but there were some unintentionally funny scenes, such as the scene where Miranda stares into August's window for five minutes creating a hilariously campy shot. I could also add the hilarious group Minecraft session to this list as well. However there was some good cinematography, with nice shots of Coney Island, and Jack blocked behind a statue of an angel to signify his kindness. Overall, the movie is clich\u00e9, annoying, and boring.",

            "review_title": "Insightful Story Told From Different Perspectives",
            "content": "Adapted from the novel by RJ Palacio, Wonder guides through the year long journey of a young boy named Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), who's diagnosed with Treacher-Collins Syndrome, going from years of homeschooling to in class learning as he deals with the trials and tribulations kids normally deal with when walking into the classroom. From bullying, to acceptance to adjusting and finally to getting respected, Auggie not only found his way around the classroom, but also touched the lives of the audience being that no matter how different you are, we are all unique in some way and that one's physicality should never be judged.Under the direction of Stephen Chbosky, his adaptation was handled with extreme sensitivity and succeeded by keeping the themes mature, but not over-the-top by way of melancholy. The makeup effects by Arjen Tuiten were well-crafted and are in full detail to give the viewers a visual indicator of the physical condition Auggie faces everyday in his life. From the sad looking eyes, to the facial linings to the little stubs of skin for the ears, Auggie no fault of his own, will likely have to deal with facing the cruel world as he will be bombarded with stares, belittling and discrimination for the way he looks. But however, Chbosky who also co-wrote the script along with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, succeeded in making the viewer realize that Auggie is going through the same issues any normal kid goes through during their school years and that his issues are no different than anyone else's. His love and passion for things are also very normal. I mean what kid doesn't like \"Star Wars\" or \"Minecraft\"? He seems very bright in science and has an eccentric sense of humour and an imagination that gets him through his days. And though this movie seems to be more idealistic as opposed to realistic, it's neither distracting or cringe inducing.When it came to performances Jacob Tremblay was absolutely stunning here as Auggie who provides an electrifying blend of kindness and intellect even when he's hiding his face under a spaceman's helmet. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson were perfect as the supporting parents who helped Auggie on his journey to find social acceptance by those around him. The real standout comes from Izabela Vidovic as Auggie's sister Via who lets herself take a backseat to let her parents look after Auggie due to his condition. Even though she may not have her brother's medical condition, like every other teen, she has personal problems of her own.Auggie's mother, Isabel (Roberts) sacrificed her own career path to look after Auggie and even homeschooled during all his difficult times which included having 27 surgeries. But now Isabel and father Nate (Wilson) enroll him at Beecher Rep in a normal class where he will learn to socialize with other students and to adjust outside the sheltered life he's been accustomed to all his life. Though understanding they're doing the right thing, they both know this new life for him will be a rough road ahead as Auggie will have to deal with bullying, staredowns and isolation. And when his parents let him go on his new path of life, all the kids' conversations are stalled as they stare and snicker at him. Chbosky sees this a normal thing as kids go through those phases unaware that through all the staring and putdowns are hurtful and that it's better to accept a person for who they are and not what they look like.Like a lot of these underdog stories with an anti-bullying message, the usual stereotyped characters are eventually shoehorned into the narrative. There's the hip, level-headed teacher Mr. Brownr (Daveed Diggs) who gives assignments that are educational and innovative. Then you have the tough bully named Julian (Bryce Gheisar) who eventually softens up to Auggie later in the movie. Then there's the introverted girl Summer (Millie Davis) who becomes his friend. But the best scenes are when Auggie befriends an outcast named Jack Will (Noah Jupe) who accepts him in spite of his working class status.What stands out from this movie is that \"Wonder\" doesn't focus on the trials and tribulations of Auggie alone. Other characters have personal dilemmas that also are featured here. There's many scenes involving Via, a shy teen who meets up with an attractive teen named Justin (Nadji Jeter) and eventually enrolls in the drama club at school and auditions for a part in the musical \"Our Town\". We also look into the strained friendship between Via and her friend Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell) who turned against her during the school year.Like in his previous project \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", Chbosky tries to handle the various issues involving teen angst in a very professional and open manner. This kind of measure assures the audience to try to imagine what it would be like if you were the character/s we're following in the narrative. Everyone has a problem in life and most times it can't be fully solved. Even though Owen Wilson's character Nate might be comic relief does deliver the most uplifting quote in the movie being that tears don't just provide sadness, they also provide joy.If there was one weakness in this movie that makes me cringe every time is near the end of a movie where the climax emanates at the auditorium and Auggie gets an award for his bravery and courage throughout the school year. I mean I'm proud of him that he got that, but it just feels way too cliched that the movie has to end with a nice ribbon on top. It would've been okay if he just felt better about himself and didn't need the award to prove his point.Other than the cliched ending, it is a great feel-good movie that delivers a powerful message of acceptance and compassion.",

            "review_title": "Definitely Worth It!",
            "content": "Wonder is based on the children's novel by R.J. Palacio about a normal 10-year-old named August \"Auggie\" Pullman. He likes video games, Star Wars, science, and family. His biggest concern is that he has a rare facial deformation known as \"Treacher Collins Syndrome.\" TCS (its not worth looking up the super long scientific term for it) is where just about everything with a human face is deformed, caused by the child being born without certain bones in the face. As a result of this, people constantly stare at him in fear whenever he's in public. He's had almost thirty surgeries in his decade-long life. (I saw a news story about a child with TCS; the boy was eleven and had gone through 53 surgeries.) Because of so many surgeries and an unusual face, he's been homeschooled. Now he must face grade five in a regular school with other people.If there is one thing wrong right off the bat, it's how they made Auggie's face. It does look impressive and should be remembered for Oscar time, but he doesn't display the general shock that a normal child with TCS has. I don't mean to sound rude or anything, but it would have been better if we got the regular degree of what TCS looks like. Minor deduction.My next complaint (a pretty small one) is that they're making fifth grade part of middle school. That simply did not work for me. Another minor deduction.Wonder is about bullying, friendship, patience, and looking different. All of these are handled very well, despite the predictability factor being intact throughout all of these themes. It's totally not a big deal that this is predictable. Ever watch a movie more than once? You'll know what happens, making the predictability factor intact then. And the movie is also pretty sappy. Fortunately, there's not enough sap to make the view dopey.I am in my early 20's, so I definitely remember bullying and peer pressure and dealing with other special children. Only there was nobody with TCS were I'm from. My thing was dealing with Down syndrome. I was around Auggie's age when I befriended a boy with Down syndrome. But enough about me! We are taken into the life of Auggie and his struggles to people and the world outside his house. We laugh, we cry, we care. We also get the perspective of a few others. Auggie's sister's old friend gets her own little subplot that lasts a scene. Surprisingly enough, it worked!There was no surprise that this would be a wonderful film. Julia Roberts is an excellent actress, Owen Wilson needs to do more serious roles, and Jacob Tremblay is the best child star in the world today. And the whole deal with physical differences and bullying have not been done enough times to be \"cliched\" or \"unoriginal.\"If you like this, I highly recommend the 1985 film 'Mask' with Cher and Eric Stoltz. Wonder is basically 'Mask' with a child. 'Mask' is indeed the superior film. It's director, Peter Bogdanovich, is a masterclass filmmaker and a key player in the rise of up-and-coming film makers of the early 70s alongside Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Francis Ford Coppola. Something I with Wonder had done that 'Mask' did was have scenes where the kid embraces his look and goes along with others. When people would stare at Rocky Dennis, he'd say \"What? You've never seen anyone from planet Vulcan before?\" People would laugh and get to like him. I wish Auggie had more of those moments.Wonder may have flaws, but they're all subsided and outweighed by its positives.3/4",

But, it's warm, tender, and intelligently thoughtful too! Movies and TV have become so cynical and ugly these days that it's often all too easy to forget the importance of being reminded - just how essential human kindness remains. R.J.Palacio's perceptive novel has been transferred to the screen with professional production values - inviting us to look back and recall a gentler attitude and how important balanced human relationships are - especially to those less fortunate than most.It's broken into segments that invite us to understand the motivations of many of its main characters and the complex intertwining relationships they have with each other - this is done cleverly and without feeling episodic. Some may find it too saccharine (and at times it might be) but, it still made for a refreshing change and was good to be moved to tears by an encounter with human goodness instead of human trash. This suffering world certainly needs more, and looking at the HUGE box office returns the suffering patrons agreed!Top performances from youngsters Jacob Tremblay ('Room' '15) playing August (who, along with another child actor Jaeden Lieberher -'The Conformation '16) bring a professional innocence to their screen characters. Lovely Izabella Vidovic is marvellous as his patient but emotionally suffering sister. Most adult roles also add to this movies special appeal.

            "content": "So Wonder\u0085isn't that bad\u0085 I know, that's not exactly a ringing endorsement, but considering I am so far outside of this films' particular demographic, it's actually kind of a miracle that I didn't walk out immediately thinking someone played a depression era song with my heart strings. This movie is (thankfully) not the 2010's answer to Powder (1995) or Mask (1985). It's actually more like The Sandlot (1993) meets Flipped (2010) only instead our protagonist uses his middle school science class instead of the baseball diamond to ground him.Wonder stars Jacob Tremblay as Auggie Pullman, a fifth grader with facial deformities who takes the leap from the comfort of his mom's homeschooling to a New York City prep school. While there he gains a few friends and allies, leans heavily on his family and navigates the unique difficulties of being an extraordinary boy put into an ordinary situation.Part of the reason why Wonder works has a lot to do with its characters. Auggie, his friends and his tight-knit family are all given a chance to lead interesting lives outside of each other. For the most part they all adapt to earth-shattering changes, explore new interests, conflict at times, comfort each other in times of strife and then grow from the episodic, shallow but not wholly pointless lessons they've learned. It's all about the characters which is, at least to me a surprising and welcome subversion of expectations.Of course, this looking at character as \"characters\" is a double-edged sword given the film's twee tone. We're never given the forced melodrama of something like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011) but the film also never crescendos into anything worth shedding a tear over. What results is a film that doesn't pull at the heart-strings per se but rather awards you the gooey, \"daaw\" feeling you get while searching for cat videos online.Wonder is based on a novel by R.J. Palacio, and for the most part keeps the multiple perspective narrative from the book that worked to give the story depth and character. Here however, the multiple perspectives are a distraction. Every time we're given a chance to really internalize Auggie's struggles with bullying or being accepted by his peers, we're suddenly brought into the mindset of his mother's (Roberts) struggles with finishing her dissertation or his sister's (Vudovic) struggles with being the invisible girl or his sister's best friend (Russell) being\u0085her for some weird reason. It all kinda-sorta services the film's larger themes \u2013 which is nice. But it all adds up to feel more like a quaint episode of 7th Heaven (1996-2007) than a movie worth our full attention.Thankfully, despite its episodic structure, Wonder does have one big asset in the form of Jacob Tremblay. While Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson treat their parts with the same reverence any professional actor would give to a fat paycheck, Jacob Tremblay seems to want to leave his mark as a child star. He's not just acting; he's reacting as evidenced by his interactions with best friend Jack Will (Jupe) and his exasperated conversations with his doting sister. Here's to hoping this movie washes away the memory of watching The Book of Henry (2017), a movie Tremblay participated in but thankfully walked away from it unscathed.So Wonder isn't the most effective film in its class. That said, it showcases a decent child performance, keeps its story going at an even clip and respects its audience enough to not be trite and saccharine. While it would have been nice to approach the new chapter in Auggie's life with a better sense of the stakes, the film's even tone is reward in of itself for mainstream audience to walk away feeling like they've experienced something.",

Palacio, Wonder is a wonderful family drama in which the entertaining story contains enough humorous moments and enough tear-jerking moments to outline a heartfelt and emotional tale. Jacob Tremblay, Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson are the lead stars who supply significant personalities within the well-written characters. The emotions all characters deliver are compelling and end delightfully. These performances are enough to grip you into the story, which is very pleasing itself, and take you through it's heartfelt moments.One component that Wonder would be incomplete without is the noticeable, note-worthy music. The soundtrack in the background contributes to the targeted emotions including joy and sorrow, being the stuff that'll easily make you burst out in laughter and free those tears. But the performances and soundtrack of the movie, as well as the entertaining story aren't the only main elements that make this film a bit triumph.Like the book, you have to give credit to the fascinating perspectives within the structure featured throughout this movie. It takes the story of each of the characters very welly. It can definitely be predictable, but that doesn't stop it from being an entertaining film on acceptance. Every family should see this rare kind of movie.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

Great to see Julia Roberts back on screen playing Auggie's mum,she's an actress who rarely disappoints and isn't interested just in glamour roles ,hers is a warts and all portrayal of a loving Mum who has to juggle a lot of balls to give equal time to all her family while trying to shelter her son and at the same time trying to gently introduce him to the world he will have to survive in.Standout performance again from Jacob Tremlay as Auggie,remember, him in The Room ? (that was also a superb performance) This is a very different role for him and it could have got lost with all the prosthetic make up but Jacob's personality shines through. The whole family Owen Wilson as his dad and Isabella Vidovic as his sister give lovely performances.Yes it's emotional but not saccharine and you'd have to be very cold not to shed a tear at times ,it's also a great reminder with all this talk ,mostly inane prattle about having Safe Schools programs to help stop bullying in Schools. Certainly something needs to be done to educate children that there are differences physical and emotional with their classmates and that we are all valued humans and should celebrate our differences not mock them. This film certainly demonstrates that if the parents of bullies are intolerant themselves of differences ,they only pass their intolerance directly to their children.Mandy Patinkin also gives a good performance as the School Principle who encourages and appreciates Augie's development and insists on a no bullying policy at his school,I wish I had teachers and a Principle like him.",

It simply gives us insight into other people's problems which are all unique but also common. Bit too subjective focusing on such stuff as character, relationship, feelings, believes. But too ordinary. I expected something more extreme like intervention of doctors, specific person from family or friend, and more action and brutality. Meaning if this was just bit less drama and more action and other genres like thriller. Good that unlike in most movies kids are actors, and they did good job, all look realistic, and everything looks like typical childhood school days. Could be more deep and more extreme and more objective. Emotional, but only barely on multiple occasions. Not good for those not liking subjective and negative movies, or for those who do not like kids.",

            "content": "\"Am I ugly dad? Dad: No son, the world is ugly.\" Just realized that this quote was not in the movie.So I saw this quote a lot, and I wanted to check the movie out. A solid drama about a kid with facial deformity and how he dealt with school. What I liked the most was how the movie was not only about the kid, but also the impact that he had on others. Things were complicated because there were actually people who cared and were affected by him. The relationship between characters within the family was endearing and heartwarming. I loved how they supported each other and never gave up on the others.Julia Roberts as the mother was amazing. Her character was more involved and the way she supported her kids made her a great character. Then, the kid's friends characters were also pretty good. I was invested in their relationship, although I have to admit it was a bit predictable. It sucks that Owen Wilson's character wasn't involved nearly as much as Julia Roberts's character although he was great in his role.Although it definitely put a smile on my face, I still see more potential that this movie could have gone for more impact. The sister character's friend had something going on but the movie kinda rushed it over. There's also another bully character that could have been developed more to create a more interesting plot.Overall, it's a solid movie with an inspiring message that still hit the mark, although it could have gone further. 8/10.",

            "content": "Wonder is a drama film based on the novel of the same name by R.J. Palacio and starring Jacob Tremblay, Julia Roberts, and Owen Wilson. Directed by Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower), it is a touching and well-acted story about a brave little boy, his adventures out into the real world, and the family and friends who support him along the way.In Manhattan, August \"Auggie\" Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), a young boy born with severe facial deformities lives with his loving parents Nate (Owen Wilson) and Isabel (Julia Roberts) and his older sister Via (Izabela Vidovic). After being home-schooled for several years, Auggie's parents decide to enrol him in fifth grade at a private school. While there, Auggie is bullied and teased by the other students due to his unusual appearance but over time he makes friends with some kids who learn to like him for the person he is inside.While the film does feel predictable at times, there's no denying its good intentions and heart. Director Stephen Chbosky, best known for his 2012 hit \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", injects the same amount of drama and quirkiness into this film, except this time with a more family-friendly vibe. The solid performances from every child actor, including of course Jacob Tremblay in the lead role, help the audience feel sorry for poor Auggie during his difficult time at school and his attempts to feel like a normal child. Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts were also great as Auggie's loving parents, who accept their son for who he is no matter his appearance and as a result we, the audience, are inclined to feel the same way.I rate it 8/10",

The film single-handedly redefines the feelnig of being 'warm and fuzzy'. It's brilliant family fun and suitable for youngsters, in fact I wish this film had been around when I was a kid. Chbosky reaches deep inside each of his viewers to rekindle our childhood and those amazingly fond memories. He reteaches us to love our family, our friends and most importantly ourselves. The narrative is spectacular. Beautiful and inspiring with excellent life advice as well as psychology to live by. It makes me rather sad to know I never got to see this on the big screen but now I have it on DVD it's certainly not one I'm ever going to let go off. It is incredibly re-watchable and I could really personally recommend it.As a film watched by the whole family it certainly moved us all, reminding us how much we really mean to each other and to value every day that comes and goes. Most importantly the story does not shy away from being true to life. Yes, childhood is dramatic at times, friendships can be hard, love can be testing and family does sometimes get in the way. But Auggie's story makes us realise that by fighting for what's right and what we love, we can never lose. Smiles are not hard to come by in 'Wonder', but tissues may be advisable. The acting is stellar and believable from all the actors young and old and the film plays out like a complete filmed page out of someones life-book. The film just generally gets the human race spot on. Additionally another thing it gets spot on is our ability to love and feel - especially the warmth and fuzziness of show-stopping cinema. One for the books and immediately on of my top #10 favourites, a family film that is just that, a wonder!",

With a script that tells the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), a boy of 10 years a facial deformation, and after going through 27 surgeries, the same still tries to integrate to a normal life of a child, going through prejudices, difficulties and obstacles, the film becomes very interesting from the point of use of several points of view to tell the story of Auggie, even if it slightly lessens the impact of Auggie's drama, but with these diversity of views , other points are discussed, such as the formation of friendship versus the loss of friendship, and as friends may be escape valves, such as family participation, are beautiful points and very interesting, do not come to have extreme depth, but are well crafted, pity that in some moments the film disbands total to a story any good vibes with an ending that passes a generic message of union and love. the film has an \"Okay\" direction, it works well at the camera angles, it has a bluish photograph, but in technical terms, we do not have anything that jumps to the eyes, the pace can sometimes fail, but the film trail compensates with its quality . The first thing everyone wanted to check out was the performance of Jacob Tremblay, the young promise that charmed everyone in \"Jack's Room\" had everything to steal completely the scene here, which does not happen, but the young actor does a very good performance , changing his way of walking and talking, but we can not feel the drama of the character just for his acting, we also have the great Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson who make a couple of chemistry and always entertains and enchants the viewers, even being their fantastic performances, are two good actors that work well together, and the biggest highlight in terms of acting for me is for Izabela Vidovic, because even the character apparently having more \"silly\" drama, is the drama that we feel the most, much because of his performance that is great. Finally, \"Extraordinario\" is more for an ordinary film, not in the complete pejorative sense, but in the sense that, we have seen this many times before, and even though it is nice to see, it is the kind of movie that oscar likes give indication to the best film, even if it is not a work of art.",

This film goes straight for the jugular, in that, you spend a sizable amount of this movie with a lump in your throat.

You get to feel the feelings of the people in the movie. The script is well written. Someway a bit too perfect. Acting was great, from all people in this movie. I really loved it.I saw this movie with my 8 years old daughter. The only thing I struggled with, watching this movie, is that if you are different, you have to be very smart to stand out. Irl this does not work that way. So maybe this is the magical dream of Hollywood that makes this movie have the feeling of a dream.I hope Hollywood will guide Jacob Tremblay better than many little kids who began an amazing acting career and ended up downhill. He is a special kid, like Owen Wilson is a special man. Thumbs up for this movie, might be the best of 2017. At least it is my favorite.",

It was undoubtedly heartwarming and I'm glad Hollywood invests in films like this which generally are left to the independents and become sleeper hits via Subdance . The star quality of Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson will draw in the crowds and it's already taken $70m against a incredibly low budget of $20m taking into account the stars and prosthetics .The casting was very good , all actors made you believe in their roles , the daughter was particularly good and you felt more empathy for her rather than Auggie . Which is where the film should have focused ultimately - it didn't really draw you in and you never really felt an emotional attachment , if anything you wondered why people reacted so severely as his facial disfigurement wasn't that severe . But what made you love his character was his caring towards others and his ability to rise above the haters - he excelled in everything and won everyone over through his own positivity . His constant space fantasy added to the plot line . It was good that the film took time to develop the back story of a number of characters and it's exposure of rich parents instilling their prejudices on their children was handled sympathetically to expose them for what they were , the principal was an extremely endearing character with his fairness and ability to do what was right morally rather than financially It's a good family film and moral compass and teaches you never to judge a book by its cover , ultimately it's a great story however stories like this should make you cry and I never felt as emotionally attached as I would have expected to , meaning it was good but not exceptional , it's certainly not Oscar material . 6.5/10 Pad.A",

            "review_title": "For Tremblay and a Simpler Moral Order",
            "content": "Julia Roberts, one of the outstanding actresses of my generation, is in this movie. But, playing a Mother of a somewhat unusual child, this isn't one of her outstanding roles. Roberts, nominated for four leading or supporting Oscars (Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, August: Osage County, and Steel Magnolias) won the Oscar for her leading role as Erin Brockovich. We know Roberts as a beautiful and talented performer who plays strong and sometimes vulnerable women. Her performance in Wonder is important and, at times, critical to the story. But at every turn she is overshadowed by her son, Auggie. 'August' is played by Jacob Tremblay, a fine young actor who isn't even 12 years old as I write this. He has starred in a few kids movies starting in 2013, but had his breakout performance as a dramatic actor in Room, the 2015 movie which takes place, almost entirely, in a room no bigger than a shipping container. There Tremblay plays Jack, Brie Larson's son who was born and lived nearly a decade in a single room. The movie brought Brie Larson a Leading Actress Oscar and I was surprised that Tremblay did not receive an Oscar because his performance was so precisely effective. I surmised that we would see him again, and I haven't been disappointed. (He has also appeared in two other movies since Room, Before I Wake and Book of Henry, neither of which I have seen). If Julia Roberts isn't enough reason to see Wonder, then see it because of Tremblay's performance - you won't regret it.Tremblay and Roberts receive support from Owen Wilson (Oscar-nominated for writing the Royal Tenenbaums), and Izabella Vidovic, a young actress primarily known for TV roles. Wilson plays Nate, Auggies dad and devoted husband to Roberts character, while Vidovic is Via, Auggies sister who has problems of her own, but still manages to be a hugely positive influence on her brother's life.And Auggie's life is more than a little difficult. Born with a rare genetic disease, his face was horribly disfigured. Even after multiple plastic surgeries, he still presents a disturbing visage. The story is about his first year in public school, fifth grade, after being homeschooled and relatively sheltered from the cruelties of prejudice and fear of the unknown. Predictably, many of his new classmates react with revulsion and disgust. But the story is how, over the course of multiple interactions, Auggie develops his own special character and how that becomes evident, and accepted, by his peers.The story is based on a book, which I haven't read, by R.J. Palacio, who also co-produced this movie. The screenplay was written and directed by Stephen Chbosky who has written mostly for TV, but was senior writer for another movie out this year, Beauty and the Beast (with Emma Watson). He also wrote and directed another Emma Watson movie, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, however I haven't seen that one. Other than those two movies, Chbosky isn't particularly known for a whole lot and it isn't surprising that Wonder wasn't nominated for any 'above the line' artistic awards. The movie is solid, but outside of Tremblay's performance, there isn't anything outstanding about the writing, directing, or acting.The only Oscar nomination Wonder received was for Makeup and Hairstyling. And, as to be expected, this was for the makeup and prosthetics applied to make up Auggie's face. The artist was Arden Tuiten who, although not receiving Oscar nominations for his previous work, was instrumental in creating the appearances for Pan's Labyrinth, Maleficent, and Unbroken. In Wonder, he creates an face that masterfully conveys the intended effect that is immediately distancing, but at the same time has enough humanity, especially in the eyes, that allows for the possibility of seeing through it. Auggie is definitely ugly on the outside, but his face hints at the beauty of the soul inside. He could have created an effect much more off-putting, i.e. 'uglier', but didn't.There are a couple of other 'Oscar credits' in this movie. Some members of the sound team were nominated for Blade Runner 2049 and Life of Pi. The Cinematographer was nominated for his photography in Forrest Gump. And the costume designer was nominated for the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnussus. So there is some recognized talent working on this movie.Wonder works for what it is trying to do - it is a family movie attempting to message against bullying and prejudice. And it is a very effective tear jerker - the characters it creates are more than sympathetic and the situations become very effective lessons for school age children and the kinds of problems they face at that age.For adults, it will definitely pull tears while you watch it - I don't know how you cannot cry, given the suffering and triumphs of Auggie and his family. But the next day, I realized that I had been manipulated - my emotions got played for everything they were worth. There might be help for school age children dealing with pre-adolescent kids. But none of this translates very well to my world. There is nothing here telling me how to deal with a President who throws childish tantrums and bully's reporters as if he were in grade school! No, it would be nice if goodness triumphed like it does in this movie. But I don't see that happening - it isn't that easy in the real, adult, world.And maybe that's the only reason to see this movie - as an escape to a simpler moral order where good always triumphs over bad, mature feelings transcend childish ones, and people actually grow-up as they get older.",

Dad Nate ( pleasant Owen Wilson) and 14 yr old sister Via (Izabela Vidovic)are reluctant and scared for Auggie but supportive. Auggie tackles being shunned by others in his school but manages to draw lots of attention because of his intelligence and because he is lovable. Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell) who is Via's best friend pretends Auggie is her brother to be cool and to be accepted by others. Screenplay is terrific and everybody did a great job at acting. Noah Jupe as jack Will, Bryce Gheisar as Julian , Elle McKinnon as Charlotte did very well as Auggie's first acquaintances in a new school. Millie Davis as Summer helps Auggie to let go of ill feelings and become friends again with his buddies. Daveed Diggs as Mr Browne , a caring and compassionate teacher is touching. Julia Roberts is awesome as a mom who loves both her kids. As a mom, she is worried about world accepting Auggie and prays for everyone to be nice to her son and at the same time makes time for her teenage daughter . Love the movie. Superb parenting and caring siblings. So much to learn from all characters in the movie. Definitely Oscar worthy for acting and for great screenplay.

The reason for him being home schooled, is that he was born with a deformed face and his parents were afraid of him having to deal with other children.

It doesn't feel like there are too many feel-good movies like this made anymore, and I didn't realize how much I missed them until I watched this. These days, heavy topics - like a boy with facial deformities going to public school for the first time - tend to veer towards the dark and sad. This one has enough sadness to be realistic but it also imparts important lessons on the viewer without being preachy. It will leave you feeling inspired, grateful, and maybe... full of wonder! (And it's always nice to see Julia Roberts in a new role)",

I was almost immediately drawn in, and found I was on the edge of tears the entire film; good tears! This film got just about everything right. I loved the way the film was told from each major characters point of view. I think it was a tearjerker in the best sense, because I don't think it was trying to be overly cloying. Jacob Tremblay was virtually unrecognizable in his excellent makeup. But for me, the highlight was the boy who played his friend, Noah Jupe, who was so believable and real, that by the end, I was more impressed by him than Tremblay. Having worked with special education children my entire adult life, I found this film to be the most involving film about elementary age children I have ever seen, and purchased it immediately. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson were good in their supporting parts, and a second viewing was even better than the first. It is about kids, but is more for mature adults who want an intelligent and sensitive picture, a rarity in this day and age.",

The special effects in this movie are a joke, there is a part where kids are joking that Auggie looks like Darth Sidious and then he imagines some guy in a homemade-looking Palpatine costume. The plot is boring. It is just 5th grade, only it's with a kid who looks like a cross between Hillary Clinton and the scared half of Harvey Dent's face.

            "content": "Intro:I heard \"Wonder\" was a good movie, I was expecting to call it passable and go to the next film. However, \"Wonder\" surprised me with how much I liked it. It wasn't amazing, but I found it charming and a descent watch.Pros:I liked every character in this film, as none of them are treated like the villain. They all have their reasons for what happened to them. August, the main character, is played by Jacob Tremblay, in a spectacular performance. The character was born with a deformed face, and when forced to go to school, he has to adapt, make friends, and deal with normal kid stuff. And speaking of that.All the kid characters are interesting, as I feel they are real depictions of kids. Simply at first when kids mess with him, they are just playing, but then they take it too far. Like saying August has, \"The Plague\". I also like the bond August and Jack Will form over the course of the film. As at first, Jack could care less about him, and hangs with him for attention. But later realizes that he's a good person, and that if he doesn't look at his face the way most do, he can look exactly like a normal everyday person.The subplot of the film were also okay. If a little weak at points. Overall, I think the writing of the film really works.Cons:Well, I think my real problem with the film was the use of narration. I think they could've found a way to tell the story visually, as narration is used a little more than it should. Literally having characters explain exactly who they are, and their problems. However, the narration doesn't take away too much from the film.Conclusion:\"Wonder\" was a good movie that shocked me with how good it was. It's not super amazing, but I still appreciated it. I like the films themes of looking beyond the surface, I liked the characters, I found the movie entertaining. And I just enjoyed the film.",

I went into this expecting the full focus to be on the young boy and his struggles, but instead the film decides to explore the minds of several different distinct characters and manages to get you to care for and understand every one of them.The description of the film leads you to believe that the subject matter would be heavy viewing, but they take a surprisingly light approach and you just end up enjoying a well made coming of age film that focuses on a boy who suffers from the struggles of a facial deformity as well as the friends and family that support him.The film's choice to follow different characters throughout the narrative is what ended up hooking me. Many films like this tend to stretch the plot thin, not knowing what to do with their run times, but this one fits so comfortably into it's run time without feeling like it's overstaying or understaying it's welcome, and does so through exploring each character so elegantly.If given an opportunity to improve the film, I would only ask that they actually went just a little bit further with the brutality and hardships of school life, but I can see why that would be rather difficult given the tone of the film as a whole.",

An adult may not say it explicitly, but since being a child, we used to judge others. Augi, the hero in the movie, was judged by other 5th-grade children since the beginning of the school, because of his born ugly face. Augi, is not a normal child, he is born ugly in his face. The life for he is hard, and he knew it. He rejected to go to the school and was all the time being home-schooled until his 5th grade. He made a brave decision that he would try the public school. The story line is about facing discrimination, overcoming school challenges, making friends and changing people. I love this story. It is touching. Everyone in the movie is lovely. People learn to take care of each other although life has thrown problem to everyone.The story of wonder is telling us a wonder happened in our society. It is a wonder because people can always choose their attitude towards others, and this makes up for our society. As the dean of the school said in the ending: \"Be Kind, as everyone has its battle.\" This movie reminds me a fight between one of my old friend and me. He always likes to argue about being right. Now, our friendship has broken thanks due to our debate on righteous. After the movie, I wrote to him with a quote said by the girl named Summer: \"When choosing between being right and being kind, choose to be kind.\"Yes, choose Kindness, it will always shift our perspective on how we see others.

            "content": "This is the most feel good movie I've ever seen - and I mean that in a good way. It really made me feel so good!Put differently, this was one of the most optimistic movies they could make about a kid with a physical deformity. The adults (with the exception of one lady) are all trying to be kind and supportive. The kids are all dealing with their own problems but they are each trying to figure out what's the right way to behave. They're kids; they mess up; but they try to be better.It was nice to see the focus on the older sister too, who is also dealing with her own issues and not struggling with feeling resentful towards her brother for capturing all of her parent's attention. But at the same time she wants to be there for him as much as she can. She sympathizes with him, but she also teaches him to recognize when others are genuinely dealing with problems and that not everything is about him. And the parents also make an effort to make sure they're not forgetting their daughter in their preoccupation with their son.Basically, this is a movie, where people do the right things. In so many movies people will do the wrong thing and then are too afraid to correct the mistakes and then the mistake will come crashing down on them for dramatic effect. It was refreshing to see this movie veer away from that.The performances were great. Julia Roberts is of course great. Owen Wilson doesn't have a heavy role at all, but he just plays the awesome dad role. And Jacob Tremblay is of course AMAZING. I don't know how a kid can be such a good actor. But honestly, all the other kids did a fantastic job too and they all acted exactly like how kids that age would act and had exactly the dynamic kids that age would have.But this really is a feel good movie - one where things ultimately end up how you wish they would. Real life, I'm afraid, would be far crueler than the events of this movie. :'(",

Why are they watching horror movies at such a young age? Another problem I have with the movie is Julien.The book,(If it had Julien's Chapter)Conveyed problems Julien had,and trouble fitting in.In this one Julien is clearly the villain,which detracts from the experience of the movie.Auggie is one of the only 3-dimensional characters throughout the movie.My final(and biggest)criticism is that everything works out for Auggie in the end.This is completely unrealistic,and the movie ends as if the entire conflict was completely resolved when Auggie won a single award.Life is not like that,and that was one of the harsh realities that made the book so moving.In the movie,everything wraps up perfectly for everyone,and That annoys me.I would have felt a lot more emotion if there was still SOMETHING unresolved.But overall,It was a pretty good movie,and you should watch it if you have time.",

            "content": "Wonder includes every clich\u00e9 that could possibly have been included (and probably quite a few more on the cutting room floor). Many trite lines of dialogue are also handed out. And yet, none of that matters. An expert cast sails right through it all with ease. Director Stephen Chbosky shows that The Perks of Being a Wallflower wasn't a one-off hit. He makes it all work again, in spite of being one of the three script writers. (In fairness, Chbosky wasn't Wonder's original director. He replaced Paul King, who withdrew to accept another project. Perhaps King realized what a challenge the script would be.) The cast is a knockout, most especially the kids, whom of course other reviewers are disparaging. (I'm always amazed at how many reviewers have it in for child actors.) Jacob Tremblay as Auggie shows his range, being able to present the very real boy behind the disfigured face. Remembering him from Room, we expect no less, and he does not disappoint. He shows how really normal this looks-challenged child is, falling victim to the same biases and cruelties that plague all children trying to grow up. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson turn in predictably reliable performances as Auggie's parents. (They are less significant characters than their star-billing would lead you to believe.) But it is the supporting role kids who really shine, as they first follow the crowd, then reach out to Auggie, stumble as they try to still fit in, then struggle to recover. Noah Jupe is brilliant in his reluctance to befriend Auggie, then screwing up his success in doing so and coping with the backlash on both sides. Just as good - maybe even better - is Bryce Gheiser as the sneering bully - a little p**** who revels in his meanness, and he does an excellent job of filling in the blanks that the script leaves unfulfilled. His redemption - another clich\u00e9 to be sure - probably ended up on the cutting room floor, because it is virtually non-existent. Gheiser does everything he can to compensate for that in his final scene. His wordless reactions alone are telling. Isabela Vidovic as Auggie's older sister Olivia is the somewhat-overlooked normal sibling who has her own story to tell. It's an important subplot, and she gives it just the right significance without demanding undue attention. Danielle Rose Russell struggles with her very much under-written role of Olivia's bff Miranda, who finds herself torn between Olivia and her \"new friends.\" Her resolution is somewhat poorly scripted. In fact, the film's entire ending is thrown together for a hasty conclusion. Several of the events would have been much more credible if they had been handled less predictably. The cast saves the film. I would give the director far more credit were he not one of the writers. But wait - maybe that in itself gave him the inside track in overcoming the script's problems.",

Forgiving is so personal. Forgiving and letting go for our own peaceful mind.Thumbs up for Wilson and Roberts. Well done portraying imperfection in loving & caring parenthood. So human, so natural.The only thing I believe as goof is on graduation day, Jullian character is sighted. Perhaps I miss one plot.

In my case, in Brazil, it was quite a stage where I was younger than the class I ended up in 8th grade, which had many teens who flunked and they were there to do it all over. Back in those days, if you flunked three subjects you would have to take the whole year again. Stupid school rules at that time. That was 33 years ago and I still see that some things never change. Students will pick someone to be bullied. Cliques will be all over, tribes, misfits, these things don't change people are what they are everywhere: insecure creatures looking for answers to their existential issues. They are not sure and the way they handle them is by picking other people to blame. Is it going to be over? I am not sure.

Cinema is a visual medium; as the cliche goes, \"show, don't tell\". So why do all of the characters explain the entire story to us? Is it because Chobsky is incapable of properly adapting books? Did he forget to take out the dialogue and written exposition?It certainly seems like it.The reality of this film is that whatever message is hidden behind the screen, is explained SEVERAL TIMES by each of the characters. Just, for example, when I thought we were going to get a subtle neglected sister side-plot, BAM, she explains it right into our ears. Three times.What is the point, then, in this cheery, beautiful, stylistic, but ultimately shallow piece of work? What we see and hear is all that is.Where's the wonder?",

I have not seen a film in a long time which left me with such a feeling of derision, not because of the subject but because it was a complete steal from so many other films of a similar nature, and not as well made as the best of them, - Mask - (starring Cher among others).\nAs Mask (a well-earned 7.2 rating) was made in 1985, I must presume that a lot of those so impressed by Wonder simply haven't got the experience of better films to judge this one by. Anything above a 5 is so absurd that it makes me think that people have currently lost such a sense of discernment that it is no wonder Trump became president. The people who gave this film top ratings must also have been willing to vote for THAT disaster!\nThe only thing I liked about Wonder was that it gave a bit of time to each of the other children so that you could see how and why they were reacting as they did. But other than that, all the rest has been done and seen before, often better. The make-up was ok, but Mask's hero (with the same genetic ailment as \"the Elephant Man\") was truly horrendous to see in a way that the Wonder boy is simply mildly ugly. The dialogue was often stilted, and personally I thought that Noah Jupe as Auggie's best friend was a far better, more natural actor. The second best was the girl who played his sister. The rest of the cast seemed to be going through the motions, including Julia Roberts. It is depressing to know that she actually accepted a role in what is in short a highly flawed, clich\u00e9-ridden film. The ending - which I will not divulge - was so predictable that the entire element should have been completely cut out of the film; only a five-year-old MIGHT have been surprised by the phony suspense and predictability of it.\nTo anyone who is incensed and disagrees with what I have said here - please - I beg of you to go find and watch Mask, and then tell me that you still think this plagiarized version of every Hollywood clich\u00e9 ever written is a truly better film!",

It's a weeper that's for sure and for me, a good portion of the movie was a little blurry because I was watching it through a constant tear in the corner of my eye. Here's a warm film with outstanding performances across the board. The biggest surprise: Owen Wilson, as I've never seen him before (and haven't always been that much of a fan to begin with), turns in a dead straight performance as the dad who tries to bring a sense of humor to the party, but without the Owen Wilson schtick. Although Julia Roberts, as the mom, gets top billing, Jacob Trembly (the kid from The Room) is the star, as Auggie, the young boy with Treacher Collins syndrome which, even after 27 surgeries, has left him with facial deformities. Trembly's performance is Oscar worthy. His emotional and character arc have a maturity far exceeding his age. The performances by the kids who play his classmates are the kind that would want to make the kids who see it want to become actors. In order to protect him, Auggie's been home-schooled by his devoted mom who is one not to be crossed. Roberts' performance is pure perfection filled with brilliant subtleties and is sure to get her an Oscar nom. She maintains a beautiful balance of fierce protection, strength, tenderness, love, care and support. Isabela Vidovic deserves mention as the often overlooked, but understanding older sister who has always taken a back seat to Auggie's needs and her parents' attention. We get to see her touching story as she discovers her own identity and self worth. Mandy Patinkin as the school principal and Daveed Diggs as one of Auggie's teachers, also do excellent jobs. It's a movie about facing obstacles and how we choose to overcome them. It's about courage, the true meaning of friendship, loyalty and the fact that kindness costs the giver nothing, while it is beyond value to the recipient. It's a must see for young kids to learn tolerance for those who may be a little different. Score: 9.5. GO! It's Wonder-ful.",

            "content": "Oscar-season is upon us and, as with every year, December/ January is the time where the big Oscar contenders start to come up (along with the obligatory Christmas films \u2013 and Star Wars\u0085). These films often tackle fairly tricky topics with either depressing or uplifting outcomes. Wonder falls into the latter category, giving us a reflective look at how our society views people aesthetically and inspiring an audience perhaps to change their views and certainly to feel happy and positive. Though these sorts of films are annual and inevitable, ones like this (especially when appropriate for families of all ages) are an absolute joy and always welcome.One of the main positives of the film is the fact that it doesn't solely focus around Auggie. While he is the main centre of the film, he isn't the be all and end all of the film's story and the movie's so much stronger for showing us how Auggie's experiences affect his family and friends. Whilst we start with Auggie, soon we go to his sister Via's (Izabela Vidovic) experience of having a brother like Auggie, then we have Auggie's first friend Jack Will (Noah Jupe) and even his sister's best friend Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell). While it's a very nice touch that doubtless strengthens the storytelling it does noticeably leave out the point of views of father Nate (Owen Wilson) and mother Isabel (Julia Roberts) \u2013 especially strange as they are particular highlights. It would have made a lot of sense to have incorporated the parents' side into the overarching narrative and it's a shame that this is left out. Still, having the story progress from different points of views enriches the film and makes it more interesting and enjoyable.On the other hand, it also highlights the weakness of the film's structure. While they might clearly signal we have one character's point of view, this doesn't necessarily last long and isn't clear when it ends. On top of this, the film's structure is wobbly at best, with no specific climax; rather what we instead have is a series of scenes that make up the story. Whilst enjoyable, it results in the film seeming longer than it really is and feeling as though we are robbed a climactic endpoint. Building on from this, despite it being heart-warming and uplifting, the story itself is extremely predictable, each and every plot point easily guessed and giving us no surprises or plot twists, which furthers the occasional feeling of staleness the film can suffer from. With such a great story and message at its heart, it feels as though the plot and structure could have been stronger to match.Of course a pleasant story from all sides is nothing without a great cast to tell it \u2013 and this is a cast brimming with charm. It's wonderful to see Owen Wilson as a big-kid, 'cool' dad and to have Julia Roberts as a committed lovable mother who'd do anything for her children. As you'd hope they're delightful scene-stealers whenever they appear and honestly they deserve more screen time than they get. Still, the rest of the cast perform brilliantly that we don't miss these two stars when they're not on-screen. Noah Jupe is great as Auggie's first real friend, Izabela Vidovic excels as the selfless, endlessly understanding sister and Bryce Gheisar is delightfully detestable as bully Julian. On top of this, Mandy Patinkin's headmaster Mr Tushman deserves a special mention for being the kindest and wisest bearded on-screen headmaster since Dumbledore. Jacob Tremblay though is the stand-out in this film. Sporting very impressive make-up, he fully embodies the character of Auggie, charming us and helping us fall in love with the boy behind the face, and fully selling the very important message behind the whole film. From Room to Wonder, it seems that Jacob Tremblay has proved himself to be a force to be reckoned with and surely has a bright future ahead of him (particularly in films with one word titles apparently\u0085).This is just the sort of film we need occasionally; one that questions and examines our society, but ultimately gives us faith in humanity with an inspiring, uplifting and heart-warming film. Despite a rather iffy structure and not giving enough screen-time or focus on Wilson and Roberts' characters, Wonder absolutely delivers on what it should do, resulting in an enjoyably sweet film for all ages with a special message that can't fail to warm your heart and wet your eyes.",

I give this movie 7 stars because it's sensitive subject matter that deserves respect and because the filmmakers successfully hit the cheesy mark they were going for. This movie is about a young boy who struggles with a facial deformity, which affects not only him, but his family and classmates. The subject seemingly has a lot of flavor, but what the filmmakers delivered was a healthy serving of vanilla ice cream. This is a movie that was sentimental, self-righteous, and overly compassionate. All of the information is spoon fed and the viewer is left with no room to come to their own conclusions. To bring home my point, at the end of the movie, Julia Roberts turns to her son and says, \"You really are a wonder.\" The son then goes on stage to accept an award, while all of his classmates applaud him. Appreciators of fine cinema won't like this movie, but the story itself can reach a wide audience.",

            "review_title": "An emotional ride of Auggie being a Wonder",
            "content": "Wonder is movie that deals with the perspectives of characters that revolve around August \"Auggie\" Pullman like planets in a solar system and how their lives are not only linked with the protagonist but provides the scope of self -introspection amongst themselves. Auggie is a wonder kid who is a diagnosed with Treacher Collins syndrome,a genetic disorder characterized by deformities of the ears, eyes, cheekbones and chin with potential complications leading to breathing problems, blind vision, cleft palate, and hearing loss. He was home-schooled by his mother Isabel till Grade 5 and the story primarily is devoted to his experiences in being a part of the normal middle school life.With that being the central pivot, the movie also focuses on his elder sister Olivia who many times is sidelined due to the attention and care Auggie receives and how situations test her relationship with her friends and her family.The biggest success of Wonder is its light-hearted humor and its emotional moments that are executed brilliantly. The emotional sequences resonates particularly well and is not done over the top. Though the strenght of the film relies on the hypothetical setting of an understanding family for Auggie, it might also remain as a slight aberrant from reality considering the fact in real-life the moments are going to much more tense and a calm composure as espoused by the movie may not possible every now and then.The actors have done a fantastic job, starting from Jacob Tremblay as Auggie, to the ever-talented Julia Roberts as the mother, Owen Wilson as the father, Izabela Vidovic as Olvia the sister and the everyone else starting from Auggie's schoolmates to Olivia' best friend and boyfriend. Each cast member brings in the perfect proportion of emotion palette to the celluloid that the entire proceedings does not boring even for a moment. The only drawback was with Owen Wilson being cast as Julia Roberts' husband as he at times looks like her son.Auggie's story does a familiar template especially with the school episodes and eventually the climax where he is felicitated for his achievements. The character development is something we have observed earlier but what makes it different is the acting and the presentation. I, however liked Olvia's story much more, especially her relationship with her boyfriend Justin and her best friend Miranda and how she often-times felt lonely at home and still remained understanding. Olivia character emotes the raw emotions of longing and frustration perfectly and it is a character that will leave a big impression on the audience even after the movie is over. To be honest, Olivia's story will make me more teary-eyed than Auggie's story and there are several instances of that in the film.I have limited knowledge on the Treacher Collins Syndrome and am no expert to comment on whether the film's portrayal has been true or not. However, as an audience who wanted to enjoy a good emotional family drama, I must say Wonder surprised me beyond expectations .Catch this movie and you will not be left disappointed and there is a chance you might have a stronger set of feelings towards your family.",

            "content": "It's so nice to get an excellent movie that touches its social issue with care, and respect, and it's aimed at KIDS! So all the terrible cash grab kids movies that are coming out, have no excuse for being bad! I think the demographic for this movie would be 5th Graders, or kids that are 10 years old.What I love most about it, is the way it handles the school bullying subject, and facial deformity issues. This movie is based off the book 'Wonder'. I was actually a little bit concerned, because while the book is one of my all-time favorites, it could get a little too graphic at times, and in this movie, a few kids (in 5th Grade) said the \"C' word twice. But I don't think that's too much of a bother.That being said though, this movie does have two problems:1. The pacing. This movie tries to do the story of 'Same situation with different points of view'. However, while I really like this trope, it does make the story feel clunky, and poorly paced. Which leads into:2. No focus on the bully, Julian. There is a scene where it heavily implies that his parents are very overprotective, it feels very one- sided; I did wish Julian got his own side of the story, to make him and his family feel more fleshed out, and not cardboard cutouts.Despite the two problems I have, the performances, the writing, the production values, and the dialogue are all TOP. NOTCH. This is 2017's new masterpiece, in a year where both live-action, and animated films, (With a few exceptions) have been rather terrible.",

Palacio (novelist), Jacob Tremlay (Room, The Smurfs 2) stars as August 'Auggie' Pullman. \nWhen his Mum Isabel (Julia Roberts: Pretty Woman, Notting Hill) thinks he needs more than home-schooling, she and his Dad Nate (Owen Wilson: No Escape, Zoolander 2) decide to send him to mainstream elementary. On a tour of the school organised by Headteacher Mr Tushman (Mandy Patinkin: The Princess Bride, TVs Homeland), Auggie meets three new children, Justin (Bryce Gheisar: A Dog's Purpose, TVs Walk the Prank) a spoiled bully, Charlotte (Elle McKinnon: Travelers, Once Upon a Time) who only likes to talk about herself and scholarship student Jack Will (Noah Jupe: Suburbicon, TVs The Night Manager).\nOn his first day, his sister Via (Izabela Vidovic: Homefront, TVs Supergirl) advises him to let the other children stare because 'You can't try and blend in, when you were born to stand out,' but with Justin and his gang (Amos - Ty Consiglio: Woody Woodpecker, Thirty-Seventeen, Miles - Kyle Breitkopf: Parental Guidance, TVs The Whispers and Henry - James A. Hughes: TVs Hit the Road) determined to bully him, he struggles to make friends. His sister Via, meanwhile, has just lost the only one she had, Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell: A Walk Amongst the Tombstones, Aloha) who has returned from Summer Camp no longer wanting to know her. Will drama geek Justin (Nadji Jeter: Grown Ups & 2, The 5th Wave) persuade her to join in auditions for the school play?\nAuggie's teacher Mr Browne (Daveed Diggs: Zootropolis, Ferdinand) tries his best to help, but it takes Auggie's prowess at science to gain him a new friend in Jack, but will it last?\nThis was a beautiful feel-good movie. Yes it was sad as I expected, and yes you will need to take a large pack of tissues but it also had some wonderful strong messages about kindness, true friendship, love and appreciating someone for who they really are - there are some adults out there that could learn from this, let alone children. There were laughs too but tears will be plentiful as many people in the audience were coming out crying, so I don't think I was the only person touched by the emotion in this endearing film.\nIt stays mostly true to the book which is always a plus point for me and all the adults and child actors were superb, as well as those mentioned above, the character of Summer (Millie Davis: The Best Man Holiday, TVs Orphan Black) was spot on. The Pullman family journey felt real, as did those of each of the other characters.\nA story of friendship, perseverance and most of all, kindness. Always choose kindness.",

How can you expect him to have any sense of pride in himself. Then like the father says \"throwing him into the lions nest\" is correct. I'm shocked really, where I am from the boy goes to, plays with, and interacts with his peers from the get go. This creates acceptance that we are different. And gives the boy( whom, if would have walked the streets here, you would not think twice about) confidence. There was like nothing wrong. He behaved like a kid his age, liked the stuff kids like, he would definitely get flack for being smart though. I was flabbergasted that there are people that act like this. And the parents of the one \"bad bully\" were almost better than the parents of August or \"Auggis\", almost. \n \nIt's not perfect here, bullies are worldwide, but children get to mingle with all sorts of children that can function by them selves. I don't know. Left a bad taste in my mouth realising that there are people like this. Almost everything bad the boy met on the way out in the world was the parents fault. On a positive note, it had some wholesome moments and enjoyed it for what it was, but those parent and the everybody around them. Little dude was no monster. I was expecting a Joseph Merrick type deformity. Overall i was more annoyed and kinda shocked that people like this are the norm somewhere",

But hey we are supposed to play on with the eternal apocalyptic battle between good vs. Evil where the \"evil\" \"mean\" \"bully\" is the bad guy where the kid laughs at the end when volcano malfunctions to trumpet good conquering evil. Ho hum.I actually hated that Via's character. (Nothing against the child actor. Heck she even did a fine job of playing this frustrated, sourpuss girl who seems to hate everything in life and is only concerned about herself -while wink wink- at the same time remembering to couch with love when giving advice to her brother.I GET IT. They wanted to show the dynamic of a caregiver or rather the neglected child too... but the character just came off plain unlikable. Again maybe because of her mean spirited comment.On the other hand, Miranda character was refreshingly 'healthy' in terms of her outlook, mindset and everything.Having said that... I LOVEEEEEE Owen Wilson's character. This guy continues to impress me from the lovable hippiesque JC lovin character in Little Fockers... It is so refreshing to see him in his 'mastery' phase of life. Heck the way he portrays himself he comes across as genuine and sincerely 'at ease' and happy person in life itself.As is Julia!! Loved her character. People are not talking about these two... and taking their performances as 'granted' but this is what happens when you have two masters in their field who take on roles in their craft. Julia's smile is so genuine and you can also tell she found peace. (By the way not gushing over her like a fanboy because I actually hated Eat Pray Love.. lol!)Finally, the main character. Amazing job. Amazing portrayal. But as a reviewer pointed out, he susses out his three 'friends' in the beginning by judging them and yet we are supposed to sympathize him all the way? They could have shown more nuance where it's not always black and white and good vs evil where the big evil villain is the mean school yard bully.But I am willing to overlook it. Hate to repeat myself, but look at the clunker of trash Tenet is from a 200 million dollar budget. When you have garbage like that and Unhinged coming out, you are bound to like Wonder as it shows PURE CLASS. (I also recommend the movie Gifted for anyone interested.)Finally, the principal. FANTASTIC performance. He sort of looked like a wise old Thoreasque type of person...soft spoken but teeming with understaning and wisdom where at one stage of the film he even empathized with the mean kid. Loved it.All in all great film and much needed. Many reviewers who gave negative reviews will point out we are being swayed by emotion. I absolutely agree. But then again what is so WRONG about being swayed by emotion or pathos?Isn't that the whole purpose of a movie after all?",

            "content": "Let me preface this by saying I did not have high expectations for this film. I went in to the theater expecting to see a mostly faithful to the book, kind of charming, 8/10 family movie. This is not what I received. What I got was far worse. Now this is definitely not the worst movie I've seen, not by a long shot. But I think that it is just so unfaithful to the book to the point where it completely missed the main conflict and emotional moments in favor of Apple product placement and Minecraft. There are some thing I thought it did right, for example when Jack realizes Auggie heard what he said to Julian. I thought the editing and cinematography in that moment was very good. Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good on this one. My main problems were the acting (particularly the child acting,) and the writing. The lines for the kids are just things no kid would ever say. It could work if the kids delivery was perfect, but it isn't. Now for my final, and main problem with the movie. How unfaithful it is to the book. There are so many things they did wrong I can't grasp all of them, but I certainly will try. 1. Summer. Summer's character is completely ruined. They get rid of so much of her she no longer has a personality. 2. Daisy. When Daisy dies we don't care at all. In the book they establish how Daisy always is there for Auggie no matter what which is why it's such a big deal when she dies. In the movie you barley remembered she's there until she dies, and the family moves on in one scene. 3. The side characters (Particularly the dad, Amos, and Charlotte.) They dumb them down to such a level that they resemble the original characters in name only. The dad (Owen Wilson) Doesn't act. Amos (Ty Consiglio) barley has a personality, and has almost no impact. And Charlotte (Elle McKinnon) is completely changed and, honestly, an obnoxious character. So those are my problems with Wonder. It's not the worst movie ever, and it does do some things right. But it is so unfaithful in an attempt to modernize the book, and cram it in to a 2 hour run time it loses the original charm and message.",

This is one of the few that does, and not because it does something new, but because it tries to stick to the source material as much as possible. There are very few moments that are added just for the movie. In fact, there are actually a few things that were removed. This can cause a bit of confusion in the storyline (like when August says on the phone that he started the summer names club, but it wasn't brought up earlier when he was at the table with Summer) but that's only a very minor issue. There are also some major plot points that are gone, like the whole plot point of Auggie's hearing aid, but thankfully it's not a big deal. The acting overall is pretty solid and the characters represent who they were in the book. It can really capture some powerful emotions! It can also have some cheesy moments but it's clear that the heart is in the right place. Since it is based on a book from 2012, it could feel like a few things in the film are dated but they're just small scenes and it's only following the book so it shouldn't be a big issue. And since it is a story about fifth graders, there can be some immature moments, which may throw some people off when the tone would change drastically from a powerfully emotional scene to a few minutes later has the characters making burps. Overall though, the film was very well done. It may have several minor issues but it is still a well made adaptation that successfully captures the emotion of the book it was based on.",

The film switches between key characters, obviously Auggie, Via (Izabela Vidovic), Jack Will (Noah Jupe), Miranda (Danielle Rose Russell), by showing each key characters background it takes the lime light away from Auggie, not to take anything away from him but the whole film revolves around him as he features in everyone's backstory and own story, the back stories of each character shows the personal trials they are going through, while they are sometimes shared outside of the back story Auggie manages to link everything back to himself, when it is not always because or due to him as Via says: 'not everything's about you Auggie' Via is the caring, protective, understating sister and daughter she is like Auggies guardian outside the comfort of his own house, when Auggie links one of Via's problems back to himself she snaps and says that not everything is about him, this causes Auggie to go into self pitying himself and trying to convince Via that only bad things happen to him, while in his mind this is true because he was home-schooled up until middle school he doesn't know any better, Via diffuses the situations and makes amend by taking Auggie trick or treating as it his favourite thing to do other than Science in which he is a mini Einstein. The moving story of Auggie and his struggles deepens when a fancy dress day a school for Halloween disguises Auggie and he over hears his so called 'bestfriend' Jack Will saying he 'would kill himself' if he looked like Auggie which leads to the break of their friendship, but don't worry not all is lost they make up over Minecraft and become the best of friends once again, their true friendship is seen when some older kids begin to pick on them in the woods on their residential trip, they target Auggie and Jack Will literally fights back, they are soon joined by more boys in their class and they become the victors. This is also seen earlier when Jack Will punches Julian (Bryce Gheisar) for making fun and bullying Auggie. Over this film was an awakening into human kindness and human wickedness. It is a reality check in how we judge and treat others that do not look 'normal'.

It handles it all quite well with each of the characters getting little story arcs of their own to show where they all fit in the big picture.\nStrange why the mother left it till middle school to suddenly send her son into the world, kids are more accepting at a younger age, she should have sent him to nursery then primary that would have stood him in good stead.However he makes friends and becomes for confident and pretty much wins everyone over, it is a standard feel good film and does kick you in the feels. Not a film I'll go back too but appreciated it for what it was.",

            "content": "The 21st century has been all about materialistic possessions and the aesthetic value of everything, including humans. On the face of it we may be going with the now accepted notion, but deep inside we feel a sense of shallowness in judging it all from just its exterior. This feeling occupies a tiny space in our heart, of wanting to go beyond what is displayed. Wonder simply reaches out to this deep kept feeling of ours that we have been ignoring.\nWonder is based on the 2012 novel of the same name by R. J. Palacio, which centres around 10-year old August \"Auggie\" Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) with Treacher Collins syndrome. He is nurtured and loved by his parents (Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson) and an elder sister (Izabela Vidovic), who have home-schooled him, but as he approaches 5th grade they feel he now needs to step out of the well protected bubble his parents have created from him. With a heavy heart and fear they enrol him in Beecher Prep, a private school. Auggie mindful of his peculiarities is himself scared and tries to fit in. Initially he is secluded but then makes a friend or two. The movie follows his attempts to blend in and the issues he and his family face along the bumpy journey which they expect it to be.\nThe story seems rudimentary but it is unquestionably portrayed in a distinctive way keeping in mind the vision and thought process of R. J. Palacio the writer of the novel it is based on, for which director Stephen Chbosky should receive thorough credit for. In our modern miscommunicated world full of assumptions and expectations, the movie follows a unique method of playing the story through the perspectives of the main characters.\nTremblay's portrayal of Auggie is mere perfect, which is helped by the unbelievable job done by the make-up department. Unless otherwise the viewer informed about, Tremblay playing Auggie, no viewer in a million would guess it is Tremblay under the make-up, such is the job done by the make-up department, which is commended with a deserving Academy Award Nomination. The pairing of Wilson and Roberts as a couple may seem a poor choice, but with their effort in acting mellows all the questions a viewer could have had before viewing the film.\nThe story could have been stretched out, but the brevity of it works in favour of the film. The film rarely gives any for the viewer to be dissatisfied and keeps us wanting for more. The movie hits the right nerve and brings out the emotions in our heart making us weepy with a smile nonetheless. Wonder can be a great holiday watch for the whole family. If you are feeling down or remotely dejected pick this movie up and it surely going to make you feel better.\nActing- 9\nCasting- 9\nCinematography- 8\nDialogue- 7.5\nDirecting- 9\nEditing & Effects- 8\nSound & Music- 8\nStory- 8.5\nStorytelling- 9\nRating- 9",

            "content": "\"I wish everyday could be Halloween. We could all wear masks all the time. Then we could walk around and get to know each other before we got to see what we looked like under the masks.\" August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) wore an astronaut helmet to cover his face around others, which was also fueled by his love for Star Wars and outer space. Soon, he must learn to take it off. He was born with a facial deformity, a combination of Treacher Collins syndrome and a I4 microsomia characteristic, that prevented him from having a normal life... up until 5th grade.\nThe film Wonder was created based on an award-winning novel written by R.J. Palacio, however, it is not a true story. It is, nonetheless, inspired by real people. This tender-hearted movie has a tear-invoking story that overwhelms people with sympathy and acceptance. It's an inspiring tale on the effects of kindness and how Auggie Pullman overcomes his insecurities with the help of forming friendships.\nHis facial deformity caused him to be home-schooled, up until his 5th grade year. His parents Isabel (Julia Roberts), loving mother, and Nate (Owen Wilson), affable father, are filled with love for their unique son. He also has a sister (Izabela Vidovic), Via, who is always his friend, and looks out for him, although sometimes feels under appreciated. One day, Auggie's mother, Isabel Pullman made the stressful decision to enroll him in the Beecher Prep fifth grade class. Principle Tushman, (Mandy Patinkin) assigned four kids to help show him around and was initially the reason Jack Will (Noah Jupe) felt obligated to befriend him. Auggie faces personal battles with being made fun of, stared at, and targeted by a bullies.\nThroughout the film it takes a look at the different perspectives of the characters and how they are interpreting the situation. It starts out with Auggie's perspective and then moves on to his family and friends. The perspectives of the different characters add variation to the film where we, as viewers, get to hear and see how other people interpret life with Auggie.\nThe film focuses on Auggie numerous times, such as eating alone at lunch or walking through the courtyard alone, to show the loneliness he felt as an outcast. The director best shows this with his close-up shot focusing on Auggie's face to clearly show his deformity as well as using tracking shots as he moves through the hallway and the courtyard alone to show how others stared at him. How could director Stephen Chbosky not creatively add in special effects of Star Wars characters with Auggie's love for outer space? Adding in the extra ironic scenes where Auggie imagined Star Wars characters added humor and imagination while connecting it to another successful film.\nThe film mostly focused on the reaction of others to Auggie's facial deformity rather than going deeper into what he has to go through, medical wise. This is a huge part of the condition and the film should've gone deeper into what surgeries, expenses, and scares the family had to go through through the process of his facial reconstruction and difficulties.\nWhat is truly remarkable about Wonder is that for two hours, we are not rooting for superheroes or the sporty guy to get the perfect girl. We, as strangers, are rooting for the underdog, and want others to treat a helpless child with kindness. This film shows just how important it is to be kind to one another, even if it takes you a while to get there.",

The only fights are between children, and they never get truly violent. This is a heart warming and inspiring story of a boy and his family, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I want to read the book this is based on.Jacob Tremblay, who I remember from the movie 'Room' gives yet another excellent performance as August Pullman (Auggie), though he looks very different here. The makeup artists have done a good job of making him look 'different' but not scary or repulsive. Other child actors have provided good support. The school scenes are well done. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson are very good as the loving parents. Izabela Vicovich as his elder sister Via is a great new find. She is beautiful, but seems a little older than what someone who is just 4 years older than Auggie would look like, but that is a minor point, in my opinion.There is a message of embracing diversity in subtle ways throughout the movie (Via's boyfriend, and Auggie's new friend are both African American), and Auggie is of course very different from those around him. The movie does not become preachy about diversity, which is good.The story is told by different characters, but mostly by Auggie, from the time he was born, and the effect of his cranial disease on his family is described in his words, and later in scenes. The different relationships between the family members, and friends are well portrayed.This is a feel good movie, which is perfect at this time of the year. I really enjoyed it.",

            "content": "This was a very beautiful story with many realistic themes. Augie is a normal kid with some facial differences, who is not as ugly as everyone says he is. When he starts fifth grade, he has a hard time adjusting to the other students. Many people claim it is unrealistic how a kid like Augie made friends. For those of you who have been bullied, I'm sorry. I know how horrible it feels. As someone who grew up with a mental disability, I know how difficult school can be for people who are different, specifically if your disability makes it harder to socialize, presumably harder than having a physical disability. Not everyone in school was nice to me, but I managed to make some friends.When Augie starts school, he has no friends. He notices kids making fun of him. He becomes friends with Jack Will after letting him cheat off his test. Who wouldn't be friends with someone who would do that? Jack is an outsider too, as he is not that smart and only in that school on a scholarship. Jack eventually gives into peer pressure and unknowingly makes fun of Augie to his face. This temporarily ends their friendship. Augie makes one more friend and eventually forgives Jack, after he stands up to school bully Julian and apoligizes to Augie. At the end of the movie the kids are on a feild trip, where they encounter some older bullies. Augie stands up to them, and hence, becomes the class hero. People finally see Augie for who he is, not what he looks like.Unlike most kids movies I've seen, the adults in this movie are not horrible selfish people and actually care about the kids. Augie comes from a loving supportive family. The school principal is fair and takes bullying very seriously. I know not all schools are like that, but this was a private school with better teachers and more student support.I don't have a lot of criticism for this movie, but there are some ways they could have made it better. Focus more on Augie and less on the other characters. The sister and her friend had little to do with Augie's story. Give Julian a backstory. I know Julian was the main school bully, but at the end he seemed truly sorry for what he did. He was strongly influenced by his horrible, possibly abusive mother. He did not deserve the ending he got. I wish the movie could go deeper into that.",

This is a story about a boy named Auggie (August Pullman) who has a different appearance on his face to others due to a congenital disease. The shy boy faces multitude of difficulties but he goes over them, and breaks his bubble throughout the story. \n What I liked about this film is that the story revolves around the protagonist while shedding enough light on other characters, such as Auggie's sister, Via (Olivia Pullman), his best friend, Jack, and Auggie and Via's best friend, Miranda. They are given an entire persona and treated as main components of the story rather than just as side-characters. Usually, when I watch a movie, I inevitably focus on a protagonist and do not pay much attention to the other characters. I hardly imagine how they grew up or why they behave the way they do. However, this movie reminded me of the fact that everyone is a protagonist of his/her story. I know this is a cliche, but when you hear Auggie or other characters tell their honest thoughts, they would definitely hit you in the deep bottom of your heart. Indeed, there are so many phrases that I loved. \n I believe this film will leave your heart warmer after watching it.",

There's certainly a fair amount of food for thought, as it were. Unsurprisingly, it is quite sad and sentimental, although I'm glad to say that I didn't feel it was unnecessarily piled in sugary sweet emotions - it focusses on the childs difficulties starting at a public school and his reaction to being made fun of for his looks. I suppose it is perhaps a little predictable but I thought that it wasn't as tacky as it perhaps could have come across and also I thought that the main cast did pretty well in their respective roles, especially Jacob Tremblay as the main character, August aka Auggie and Julia Roberts as his mum. It deals with bullying, fear/shame and so on - important topics for adolescents certainly.Would I recommend it? yes I would.",

            "content": "The book isn't perfect, I feel the author either isn't too realistic about life or is using how Americans love a little diversion to make ourselves feel better about how we'd act in place of those mean bullies. But she does do something unique which is get at the story from multiple sides. The movie does the same, but movies are just too short to character develop to this extent.The main thing though is how the boy looks. In the book he is described as like having a melted, burned type face as well as strange eyes and ears. The way this kid looks he's going to have trouble in high school and college dating, but not everyone would get freaked out by him. The seventh graders in the book are legitimately freaked out when they see him and I find that premise interesting- was it really fair to have the other kids have to attend with August? Yes we encounter different looking people in real life, but the character described in the book is like a one in a million deformity that most people would never encounter. But the way he looks in the movie its kind of a ridiculous argument to make. The end of the book ends on an up note, but I'm inclined to think August's only chance is in a small town where everyone gets used to him- the author is so convincing on how literally everyone gets freaked out and unintentionally so. It's like making a movie about the difficulties of short men and the main character is 5'7. Okay yes he has some of the problems a short guy has, but not at all comparable with a guy below 5'.So I'm carrying on, but the point is by using a normal actor and a little makeup indicating a moderate birth defect just doesn't get the point of the novel across. It changes from a story about lookism and human nature to one about middle school bullying. August's story could have been any kid who was especially small for his age or fat or whatever and add a little social awkwardness along with middle schooler's tendency for cruelty and following a crowd and boom, thousand if not millions have experienced this. And the acting doesn't make up for this. Owen Wilson is a comedic actor, Julia Roberts generally seems to be a poor actress for Hollywood A-List, the boy who played August did a pretty good job I thought, but doesn't make it worth watching for adults.A good movie of the type would make us question ourselves and how we'd honestly treat August and how we'd possible deal if we were in his shoes. The more normal looking they make him the less interesting the question becomes.Oh and the school environment is so unrealistic. 5th Graders are not morons about Science and wouldn't be that impressed with someone who was good at it, sports and social skills are way more important. And they are way too well behaved. But I guess they didn't want to digress on the script too much. One thing I think they could have tossed was the Astronaut helmet, it wasted a lot of time and we already know how he feels about himself.So I might have enjoyed it as a fifth grader being bullied for being small and wearing hand me downs, not at all the same but I think I could have identified with the character. As an adult, with a poor script and weak acting, I wouldn't waste your time.",

There are many different stories and perspectives told, and it really makes the characters shine. There were many moments where I cried or got emotional, due to the sheer honesty and emotion in this movie.The one complaint I have with this movie is that some characters, such as Summer and Charlotte, got left out of the narrative. I understand, however, that this is due to movie length. Otherwise, the movie is perfect. I feel that this is the kind of movie everyone needs to see. It shares many important and relatable messages.

It's a feel-good movie and that's exactly how I felt at the end.The most important thing this movie needed in order to be good is that you're rooting for the characters, that they're cared for...and this movie has quite a few with Auggie being the central character. This movie manages to pull off a very difficult task as it cycles through backstories. I managed to be rooting for most of them by the end of it, so amazing job there.Message for the viewer who's probably checking to see if they should watch this or not: \"It's a tear-jerker about a boy and his world.

Directed by Stephen Chbosky, Wonder explores the story of a young boy with a birth defect as he navigates the life of a 5th grade boy. The film, however, is so much more than this one overarching story. Using clever film tactics, the film shares the story from several different points of view. With each of the character's view, you gain more perspective on the story and can find at least one character and story that you can relate to. Chbosky plays to everyone's emotions as you take yourself back to your own time in grade school desiring to be accepted. Based on the book by the same name, this film has several layers to it. From acceptance, being \"seen\", bullying, to making tough decisions, this film explores several life lessons that we all need to hear right now. Everyone, young and old, can find one layer that tugs at your heart and makes you empathize with the characters and what they are going through. It was masterful writing and the \"perspective\" tactic was pleasing to watch. When you think about the character development and the acting, you can go ahead and just give Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) an Oscar for his role. He is likable, smart, and plays the heck out of this character. Some may not like seeing Owen Wilson (Nate) in another \"serious\" role, but Wilson plays it very well. I appreciate Wilson stepping out for what he is known for and he is a very believable loving father alongside on-screen wife, Julia Roberts (Isabel). The character development in this film was well thought out and helps push the story along. Overall you will leave this film filled with a lot of emotions. It makes you recall your own upbringing and your desire for acceptance from so many in your own life. At the same time, it requires you to also ask the question of whether you are accepting others while also desiring the same. Wonder is worth your time and money and was a great life-lesson picture. Go see it!",

Who you are on the inside is affected by the outside and can boil over into sometimes painful and sometime beautiful circumstances.The movie starts with voice over exposition, which could have been done better, but the end product achieves its goal. It beings with a whimsical tone, with the boy August (Auggie) stating that he is a ordinary boy who loves star wars and minecraft. Wearing a astronaut helmet throughout the opening scene, it is removed to shown that Auggie has severe facial deformities. With Auggie going to school for the first time in the fall, he (or more accurately, his father is nervous) and rightly so. The first act sets the table for a story of bullying, but as the second act comes, it turns into so much more. With a black screen and a characters name in script, the perspective shifts. The film explores the affect on others when one person who for better or worse gets far more attention than them. This is rightly noticed, and calls Auggie the Sun for the others are just orbiting around him. How this then affects those in the orbit is the strongest aspect of the film. The film portrayal of emotional conflict of other characters around Auggie is done very well. Auggies face gives him by default special attention and that can cause jealous among others and frustration for Auggie. In the being voice over, Auggie states that he is just a ordinary kid, but as the film nears its end, he and those around him see that is not ordinary. And then, by extension, neither are the lives of those close to him ordinary. But that is not always a inherently bad thing.That is overall biggest issue with this movie is not the underline message but the shifting style or tone. From whimsical to an emotional relationship drama to a strange fight scene near the end. (Why the fight was needed instead of finishing some relationships arcs is beyond me.) The drama portion was by far the most prevalent portion of the film and easily the best. But the changes make the film slightly uneven and push you out of your immersion. Or out of the its orbit if you will. But a slight turbulence in taking off and land is no reason to complain. Wonder is a movie that while it's flying you to high places, it's also taking you right into the heart of the matter in an authentic and meaningful manner. And the human heart and its interactions and relationships with others are a very meaningful thing to explore. It's where we all live, after all.Also there's Owen Wilson, WOW\u0085 sry.",

But I absolutely love this movie, every single character played an important part to make the movie complete and the actors/actresses who played the characters were just simpy amazing! (Yes! Even Owen Wilson & Julia Roberts too!) The storyline and moral of the story add good value and actually taught me a few important lessons to use in life.I usually don't write reviews, but this movie made it so worth it I have to share with everyone so you can enjoy the movie just as much as I did.

            "content": "The film opens promisingly, with our disabled protagonist strugling at a new school. This is my first qualm with it. Instead of using an actor with Treacher Collins syndrome they put makeup on a famous child actor. Not too bad so Ill let it slide. Then we see that the sister of our protagonist is being neglected as the family only cares about their disabled child. There's some character development with her and her grandmother but that thread goes nowhere. The family keeps treating Auggie better than her. We also get a storyline of the sister's friend that suddenly turns a cold shoulder towards her for no particular reason, later stating it was because the sister ignored her in the first place even thought that isnt the case. Any character development with the sister is just ignored and at the end of the film nothing changes for her.Auggie is being bullied in school but one of the bullies becomes his friend. Which is a nice story telling device but later in the film Auggie and his now friend begin the become bullies themselves when they laugh at a pair of children in the science competition who failed. So all of Auggie's character development of being bullied is suddnely null and void.The entire film builds up towards a big summer camp where Auggie is being bullied. He runs away into the forest and meets some bigger, badder builles but him and the people who were bulying him before fight them off and become friends. He goes home and meets his parents and they all live happily forever after. Auggie having lots of friends and his sister being painfully neglected by her parents. Now without any friends and lacking a supportive family.All in all I gave it a 4/10 only because Owen Wilson shines as a parent and could do nothing wrong in my eyes.",

            "content": "Based on the New York Times best seller, Wonder the incredibly inspiring story of August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), he was born with facial differences that has required him to go throught surgeries and many medical treatments.Auggie is a \"regular\" kid in every other way, he loves Star Wars (who doesn't?!) and Minecraft, he has an empathy for science, a big sense of humor and an active imagination, that helps him with incomfortable situations. He's been enterely home schooled by his parents.Director Stephen Chbosky managed the story in a understated way, it probably would have been painfully and boring in a other way. He showed us the sweetness and intelligence of Jacob Tremblay (Auggies actor), a little boy that is just eleven years old, with his awesome interpretation since \"Room\" the movie. Beforehand, Julia Roberts, his mom, she put her heart into this, she is still luminous and radiant as ever. Roberts is as \"watchable\" as ever, her ability to prove complex emotions with a brief look undiminished.Have you ever felt like you were the same as everybody else, but you were also different from the world? Auggie, well..tells you that while the feels extraordinary on the inside, outside he doens't fell like that. He feels invisible to everyone around him.Wonder is a machine for creating empathy. This movie breaks the rule into pieces, showing the importance of educational value, the positive impact on people outside the immediate family. Wonder does the hard, it's really worth the watch. It shows the importance of being kind, is the kind of movie that should be shown to young and old as a life lesson about how to deal with people who appear to be different. It has a wonderful message about tolerance, acceptance, understanding and respect. How we help and treat each other is what defines the humanity in the world.",

            "review_title": "Wonder: Hollywood's Lesson of Love and Kindness",
            "content": "Hollywood has become an expert in distorting reality and creating a world that's only problem is to fight the aliens from outer space. This is why movies have such a grand audience. People can escape reality and escape the world of pain, violence, and hatred. This time, however, Hollywood takes a different approach to one movie. Unlike the usual action, horror, or romantic theme, the movie Wonder has a deeper meaning of love, friendship, family, and hardship. \n \n Auggie is a 10 year old boy that suffers from Treacher Collins Disorder, a disorder that does not allow some of the facial features to fully develop. He was homeschooled for all his life, until now. Wonder takes us through his journey of fifth grade at a regular school. Not only do we get to witness the point of view of Auggie, but also of his sister (Liv), his friend (Jack), and his sister's best friend (Miranda).  In today's society, the face and the physical appearance is the main focus of the people. We are so quick to judge those who are not equally looking as the rest of us. One must fit into a mold in order to be a normal person. Wonder takes a step back from the common views of society and instead gives us a new look of the people around us. Auggie was judged harshly everywhere he went. To make him feel better, more normal, he wore an astronaut mask. Once he started school, there was nowhere to hide. He couldn't run from the person he was. He had to learn to embrace his face. He also taught others to change the way they view each other. Auggie's mom once told him, \"We can change the way we see.\" This is so relevant to the theme of the movie. We should change the way society views beauty. We should pay closer attention to the inside than we do on the outside. Auggie is such an amazing character full of love, joy, and mercy. This is what should attract others, not the fact that he looks different. Wonder did an amazing job challenging the views of society and giving everyone a mission to love and respect everyone we meet. \n \n Wonder also gives us an insight to the importance of family. Whenever something bad happened, it was always the parents or the siblings to help guide the way. Both Liv and Auggie had their problems at school, and when they felt most alone, they turned to each other and their parents. More than not do we see broken families and hurting children who lack a home. We see this present in Liv's best friend, Miranda. When her dad gets a new girlfriend and her mom is constantly working, Miranda feels pain and hurt because of the family she doesn't have. She turns to Liv's family and they call her their own. She longed for the love of a family. In a way, we all do. We would be nothing without our family and often times we take them for granted. Wonder helps us revert our attention to the significance and influence a family has on a person.  Wonder is such an inspirational film for all to see. It teaches important moral lessons as well as entertain the audience with its cute and innocent comedy. Scoring an 85% on rotten tomatoes, this movie pulled in a large audience ready for a change in the Hollywood style. We were able to witness the impacts of disease on a family, as well as the journey of hardships and happiness in one's life. We should never forget the dignity of a person and respect them to the fullest. Wonder gives us so much hope for the future and the way we view each and every person on this planet.",

            "content": "This time, Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Jacob Tremblay and Izabela Vidovic worked together to bring into life Augguie's family in WONDER (2017). Inspired by the literary work of R.J. Palacio, this moving film reveals all the struggles faced by Auggie, a 10 years old boy with a facial disfigurement produced by a rare genetic condition, and his family while taking care of him. The story is told using polyphonic techniques so it shows the same events of the story from different perspectives. This allows us to have a better understanding regarding the character's personalities, reactions and moods. Everyone has his own version of the events and that makes the story even more interesting. The plot of this story begins when Auggie, who was home-schooled his whole life, is about to start fifth grade in a real school. During this transition, Auggie and everyone who is around him learnt important lessons about frienship, family support, the harm that bullying can cause, and the importance of overcoming your fears and being brave in order to achieve your goals. With no doubts this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not only because of its incredible cast, the amazing plot or its hybrid genre which is a mixture of drama and comedy, but also because of the message it conveys \"When giving the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind\".",

It is so needlessly depressing from start to finish. Not only that, but it's attempts at humor all fall flat on their faces. And when it is not sad or trying to be funny it is just boring. All in all it is a terrible movie that you should not watch whether you like emotional movies or not.",

I also loved how all of our characters realised that Aggie is not a weirdo,he's actually just a normal kid.this really resonated with me since I'm autistic and is very odd to others when they see how shy and nervous I am. Jacob tremblays face was perfect and the romance,comedy and reactions people had to Auggie were all genuine reactions.the only thing that bugged me was how much was left and yes,I know there are about 310 pages in this book but so much could have been adapted,such as the pullman's getting a new dog called bear or talking more about auggies three best friends,Christopher,Zachary and Alex but it's just a minor issue. besides that this film is a great and must-see movie.",

I had to admit I just saw a pure art MASTERPIECE which deserves to be recognized as one of the best of films of 2017.The way the plot elapses and the pure acting of every kiddo, makes the film special. Plus, the way their lives are related makes the audience perceive they are actually reading chapters of the book, making them feel identified with a childhood or parenthood stages.Wonder is a true lesson of life, that unveil those masks we use to wear at some point in our life, those moments when we decide to hide behind a Halloween mask, instead of showing who we really are. It only takes courage, kindness and friendship to make the difference in this world and -at least -once in your life- receive a standing ovation from the crowd.Beautiful and inspiring!",

I'm not sure how this MAJOR goof was missed.\nGoof: When Auggie gets off the bus, his mother is worried because he's bleeding after seeing his jacket torn. Well, Auggie's fight was the day before, and this is shown by the movie before sitting on their sleeping bags, to night time fireworks AFTER fighting, and spending the day together until home the next day. Why is Auggie bleeding!!? Unless extremely ill with a condition, his cut shouldn't be bleeding.The only downside is not knowing what comes of Julian once his terrible parents pull him out for the next year. This seems to shake him into feeling bad, realizing his actions. After this scene, he's never spoken of again. Was he taken out? Did he maybe get his mom to let him stay? Auggie befriends Julian's friends, so is he cut from his friends? It leaves it dangled, perhaps it was just unknown, though personally I'd of tried to think of something to put. At least a wave \"bye\" to a secondary or main character.Other than that cliff in someone else's life, the movie is with no pun intended, very moving. Happy, feel good ending. Life isn't perfect, but when you've made even just one good friend, life becomes, well, life.",

            "content": "I have watched Wonder in the Student United Building at the University of New Mexico for 2 dollars, I have heard that the movies were good and it is nominated for OSCAR, Jacob Termbly, who also played Jack in the Oscar-winning movie Room, played the leading part. Wonder is based on a book that has the same, it tells a story about August, he is like any ten years old kid who loves space stuff, eats a lot of ice cream, plays Video Games, loves Halloween costume and a Star Wars fan but, he is not like the other ten years old kids, August has a medical condition that affected his face since he was born, he wears an astronaut space hamlet to cover his face, the kid has been having several surgeries since he was a baby, the movies also describes the struggle that his family, especially his mother, is going through both psychological and physical ways. August did not go to school like the other kids his mother has been homeschooling him since first grade school but, now she thinks that his ready to go to a middle school. Wonder it is kind of similar to the movie \"Elephant Man\" it talks about not to judge people based on the way they look and how to prepare an unusual kid for the outside world. When he goes to school other kids assumed that he does not know anything about school or school supplies that one of them told him\"this is an eraser\". For a movie that has been based on a book, Wonder pretty much sticks to the original story, unlike other movies that were based on books where they change a huge amount of the story so that it can get as much viewer as it can. Although the movie is sending really great massages it sometimes conflicts with these messages , Wonder says not to make assumptions to people based on the way they look and yet when August goes to the new school he looks down at student shows because he thinks that you can say a lot from people's shows. In Addition, it says that we should not make fun of people's appearance but, Jack. August's friend makes fun of Julian the bully look The movie could seem not realistic sometimes like, how come that a middle school has only one kid that is been boiled on and been making fun of, also how could a bully become your best friend.\nThe movie does not just focus on August and his mother only it also contains some side stories like his sister and how she feels neglected because all of the attention from her parents is going to her brother beside her problems with her best friends. And, August's friends and the impact he does on their lives.\nIt is hard to say that Wonder is just an emotional sad movie it is more than that, you can shed sad tears from seeing August struggling to make people just accept him and you can laugh tears when Mr.Tushman the school principle introduces himself to August.\nYou can learn a lot from watching Wonder it is such an inspiring movie for kids who struggle to fit in the community and find it hard to get acceptance from their peers it gives them an idea about what to accept from the outside world and what kind of comments and interactions you would get from all kind of people. It also helps the mothers of those kids who are trying to make their children feel normal and loved. In addition, it is a teaching lesson for parents who get busy with their kid who struggle the most and have big issues and forget their other kid like in Auggie's sister. Also when it comes to friendships Wonder shows how friendships can be difficult that sometimes you have to invest in it and work hard to make it work.\nWonder is a family movie that all family member can watch and enjoy, it has been released on a holiday season but, it is barely a holiday movie it does not have a Christmas vibe just a few scenes about Halloween, and Christmas.",

            "content": "A conventional story at its core, but one heavy on heart all the same, Wonder utilises its assets and winds up being a far stronger film than one may be expecting. One may shed a tear or two, as this inspirational story tugs at all the right heartstrings. Wonder is a sentimental family film.\nWhile it's not devoid of clich\u00e9s, these are offset by solid performances and a winsome, uplifting story told with tenderness. Its one of those few movies which is capable of cheering anyone's day up.\nInitially the story revolves around the story of a boy born with facial differences that, up until now, have prevented him from going to a mainstream school, Auggie Pullman becomes the most unlikely of heroes when he enters the local fifth grade. As his family, his new classmates, and the larger community all struggle to discover their compassion and acceptance, Auggie's extraordinary\njourney will unite them and prove you can't blend in when you were born to stand out. But as the story goes on we see that the story not only revolves around him, but also the characters around him. Stephen Chobsky successfully presented all the different perspective of different characters in a time span of 113 minutes.\nThe story portrays the fact that no one is born a bad person, its his/her company that carves him/her for the life ahead. Every antagonist in the story had a successful closure, no matter the extent of ill deed they did, finally they did realise their fault and were truly sorry for that. While, the\nmovie was based on Augie and his upliftment, Chobsky made sure to make everyone realise that not everything in the movie was about him.\nThe way they portrayed issues like bullying was very mature. Overall the movie is appropriate for children of age 10+.By the end of Movie, We truly\nunderstand the statement as said by Augie ,\"Everyone deserves at least one standing ovation intheir life\". Which came to be my favourite dialogue of all time. All the ups and downs, make us go through an emotional rollercoaster. The Journey of Augie, his family, his friends truly uplifts a\nperson and fills his heart with optimism.",

Bullying, for example, is addressed in the school environment, even showing that the child who does these acts also usually has emotional problems. But everything is extremely light, in a way that works in the book but needed more weight when shown in theaters. With such interesting and current themes, the film could go deeper into the issue of prejudice, provoking those who watch the film to an internal questioning. By choosing the simple path, the film becomes enjoyable to watch, but misses the opportunity to be more than that.",

The whole time while i was watching 'Wonder' the only feeling i had was excitement. Excitement for the pain in the difficulty of life, the joy in the flow of emotions and a hell load of other emotions. It was all for that place in the heart that still says \"cry! cry like a baby.\" and be a Man.This movie was a little bit of unexpected, my thought were i will love the movie at the end and will most likely feel like crying (which i never do;)) Instead I felt like crying throughout this heartening film. It motivated me in a way that is Involuntary, meaning I don't feel motivated but still I am. weird huh? The stars are for sure not worth missing! how can I miss Julia Roberts in a movie so good! flattering, it was. The energy in almost all characters was amazing to watch! it was lovely to be a part of such movie, even when in audience. Ahhhh.. i Want to watch more of the boy and his life every thing was so perfect! If you are still here online reading this then take a break and book the tickets for wonder now! (do come back :P)Oh Man I feel so nice after watching this movie that i just couldn't stop myself to write my first ever review. I am Honoured to present you with my first probably spoiler free review. I hope you like it. Oh I do :) PS: let me know if I opened up about something from the movie.Jay Kay \"No movie is a bad movie\"",

It made me mad, it made me cry and it made me extremely happy all in the span of one hour and 53 minutes. The whirlwind of emotions I experienced during this movie was impeccable and I completely fell in love with the character Auggie and his sweet soul. He was even a bit humorous which made me like him that much more. Auggie was such an inspiring character by wanting to attend public school and still persevering even after he was bullied and talked bad about by his classmates and most importantly by one student who he thought to be his friend. He had such a positive attitude throughout most of the movie and the times that he did get emotional really touched my heart because the way the actor displayed it and the mother's response was so realistic. The way the daughter was feeling in the movie made me a bit upset, however. She was so understanding and loved her brother so much but she did not receive a lot of attention from her parents which she suffered from and it showed. I liked how the maker of the movie showed the movie from each prospective, however, the way he switched the scenes to show which child the perspective was from reminded me of The Diary of A Wimpy Kid movie writings. I do not have a different suggestion on how to better transition to a different perspective and I do not believe this took away from the dramatic, moving, and entertaining aspect of the movie though.",
