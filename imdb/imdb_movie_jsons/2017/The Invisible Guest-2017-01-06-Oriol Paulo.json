Jose Coronado always steal the show since I see him for the first time in another great Spanish thriller, \"El Cuerpo\". For one moment, you think you have all the pieces of the puzzles but the director of this masterpiece persistently change the answers and the questions. By the way, the director and writer of \"Contratiempo\" is the same one of \"El Cuerpo\". That's not a coincidence, Mr. Oriol Paulo can write. If you're a fan of thriller movies and you're having a hard time trying to find a good movie, this is the one. I say it's better that the 85% of the Hollywood thrillers these days. Another Spanish film that beat a lot of Hollywood movies without the promo and a gigantic budget. What a masterpiece!",

However, when it comes to thrillers, I tend to be very selective and delicate because there are a lot of elements to take into consideration.The Invisible Guest accomplish almost all the elements in any checklist of a perfect thriller-suspense movie. The script forces you to think quickly, you can't get distracted for a second because you'll miss an important detail.The story is told in a puzzling-kind of way, letting you feel like you finally know what is going on, just to tear your expectation apart with a new shocking truth.Some of the actors did a pretty good job. A remarkable performance was the one from Victoria Goodman.The music is absolutely engaging. The twisted feeling you get with the melody traps you into the story. The different tones and volumes of the music actually happen in agreement with the intensity of the sequence.100% RECOMMENDED.",

It is masterfully directed n exquisitely written by Oriol Paulo. Superbly acted by everyone that appears in it. It also contains beautiful cinematography, great pacing n skilled editing. The plot- a powerful businessman stands accused of murdering his lover. He was found with her dead body in a locked hotel room. The twist ending will leave you with ur hand on ur head. The director's debut film, The Body has been on my radar for a long time. Fans of Jagged edge, Primal fear, Usual suspects will definitely enjoy this.",

            "content": "I haven't seen many Spanish movies so far, but I can honestly say that Contratiempo/Invisible Guest is about to be brilliant. I am not familiarized with the actors from the cast, but I can say that their acting is a very good performance and all the filming crew made a good job with this one ! Filming angles, soundtrack, story line, cast, plot, etc, all of them are a lot above the average thriller/mystery clich\u00e9s that Hollywood got us used to, but still it has some minor issues that, in my opinion, of course, I would have changed. Those 'little problems' made me to decide this movie is a 9, not a 10, a 10 would be a perfect masterpiece, however, this one approaches perfection somehow. 1 hour and 46 minutes are surprisingly enough for this film, even if it may seem too little for a 9-rated movie, for the entire time I didn't get bored or badly surprised, it was just very thrilling and full of action and mystery. Contratiempo is, in my opinion, a must watch for thriller/mystery enthusiasts and legal movie fans.",

I'm glad to confirm that it will not be my last, because this movie was incredible. It was the type of film that I like more than any other type. A mystery thriller that is guaranteed to have a twist. It's also a type of movie that Americans don't do overly well. They always seem to think that a movie needs endless car chases and shoot-outs and that the story should just be there to facilitate those. The Europeans seem to understand that the true brilliance in cinema comes from the writing side of things. The intricate webs they weave never cease to astound me.It's always a little hard to judge acting in a subtitled film, but I'm pretty confident in saying the acting in this film was superb. The entire cast found a perfect balance of charisma and mysteriousness to surround their character. The story is crafted exquisitely and has a lot of rewatchability factor. In fact it's almost a must to watch it again, knowing what you now know. I love films that do that.It's very hard to find any negatives with this film. In fact I've just spent 5 minutes trying to come up with some and failed. That should indicate just how good this movie is. I hope films like this never stop being made because they are an absolute delight to watch.",

It's never boring, with plenty of twists and turns. All you want to do is know how this story will end. It keeps your attention from the first second till the last one.

That's why you stay tuned and glued to the screen not wanting to miss out on what is being acted out or presented. This is the first time I have come across this type of thriller. You see not only does this movie entertain but it also challenges you to take a side and share a point of view that when done is doubted because of the next scene and what takes place. Just when you think you have a reasonable explanation for what is and has taken place, a new fact enters in making you say \"what is going on\" in a good way. At that point, you are wholly committed and don't know that you have been captured and the movie now has you in its grasp. This is quality entertainment. Kudos to the story teller, the director and actors for pulling off a nice memorable movie that you will want to not only discuss but recommend as well. I always watch Netlfix with subtitles because I have learned so much goes on in movies that one may miss and the sub titles make little comments like wind blowing or so & so is speaking or car door slamming enabling the viewer to become intimate with the flick. My wife and I read every line and even rewound a couple of scenes to see if we were \"getting this\". All and all a good, decent ride. Highly recommend sunflower seeds or popcorn so you don't chew your nails to shreds and forget about any and all distractions (cell phone) too. Give this movie your time and it will give you a nice return on that time guaranteed",

            "content": "It's a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma how this movie got such a high rating.\nIt doesn't contain goofs. The movie as a whole is one big endless goof. The plot is full of holes so it looks like a fisherman's net. Let's start with the obvious ones.\n-The movie begins with Adrian calling his wife and telling her that he's in Paris. His lawyer supposedly falsifies the hotel and flight records (which is highly implausible). However, investigators definitely checked Adrian's home phone record and could easily establish that the call was actually made from Spain. That means the movie ends here.\n-Then the investigators find out that the call was made from a hotel where Adrian parked his car. Adrian claims that his car was stolen from the parking lot. Since later Laura drives that car which was serviced by Tomas Garrido, this implies that Laura was the thief?\n-Daniel's car didn't hit any obstacle, didn't turn over, the air bags didn't pop up, and its windshield stayed intact. How in the world could Daniel be fatally injured in that accident?\nLaura says that his belt was not buckled. But what difference does it make if Daniel's \"corpse\" didn't move an inch from his comfortable position in the driver's seat?\n-Just looking at Daniel, Adrian and Laura decide that he is dead. Later Adrian reveals that Daniel was actually very alive. Didn't two lovers mention that Daniel is breathing? Why didn't they check his pulse?\n-There was absolutely no sensible justification for getting rid of Daniel's body. The lovers didn't do anything wrong. If they didn't want to reveal their affair, Adrian could just walk away. Anyway Laura stayed alone in his car.\n-It is impossible to sink a car in the water by just pushing it from the shore. To do that one needs to push the car from a cliff or a bridge.\n-Laura transfers a big amount of money from the bank where Daniel worked. Where the money was transferred to? The investigators could easily check the internet IP address from which the transfer was made. And that would lead them to Laura.\n-Adrian pulls out of his account 100,000 euro in cash and in small bills. Any bank in Europe would report it, especially, when the account owner is under investigation as a major suspect in a murder. Police would immediately bring him for interrogation.\n-The hotel room where Laura's body was found immediately becomes the crime scene. Anyway, a hotel employee not only enters the crime scene but she also succeeds to lock the window (a critical evidence) in a room filled with police officers.\n-The false lawyer Virginia Goodman talks to Adrian for a couple of hours while her face is getting very close to him. She is wearing a silicon mask, and Adrian doesn't mention that? That's childish.\nI give this movie just one star because it insulted my intelligence. At these days many movie producers are working to entertain unscrupulous viewers without paying attention to the truth and with minimum care about the details.",

Hidden motives and questionable conduct come into play, and it can get a little hard to follow, but when the twist ending occurs, you realize than any of the alternate theories put forth by Adrian and Goodman become moot. I don't want to give it away, because the thrill is in the viewing and trying to figure out where the picture is going. Because this is a Spanish film, it's not surprising that it wasn't on many viewers' radar when it was released in 2016, but with a wider audience and kudos offered by IMDb viewers, it now makes the Top 250 list, and similar to Korean Oscar Winner \"Parasite\", I wouldn't be surprised if the film continues an upward climb in the viewer ratings.

A successful business, being accused of murder, hired a defense attorney as both tried to figure out how to win the case.The storytelling was mixed between the conversation and the flashbacks. The majority of the movie was just talking, and still it was an intense thriller because the attorney was trying to figuring out the whole story behind the businessman.After the first half, I was still curious because I wanted to see how this would end. I thought that I was picking up the clues, and had some ideas of how the story would end. Indeed, for most of the second half, there was a lot of twist and turn, and although some were expected, I felt intense and my ears were glued to their words. And when the final twist hit, I probably had the longest gape since the Red Wedding. I was completely fooled. It hit me so hard that I got emotional.Overall, this thriller mystery needed to be talked about more. I was still recovering from that ending when I was writing this review. 9/10.",

I mean, the accident wasn't his fault so he would probably walk easily, not to mention that the kid wasn't even dead after all (noone thought to check his pulse?).\nOther than that, it was adequately made, and ok to watch on a night in, but for anyone that is a little accustomed to crime thrillers it is, unfortunately, pretty bland.",

This film reminds me of the Futurama episode where it spoofs twilight zone and there is just twist after twist and Bender finally says at the end \"I saw it coming.\" At least Futurama's Twilight Zone had interesting, unique twists. In this movie, however, the twists were painfully obvious, and more importantly, painfully mediocre. The only one I was slightly surprised about was that the kid was still alive when the main character pushed him in the water. Then I quickly realized \"oh yes the idiots didn't check whether he was alive or anything because who would?\" The only twist that worked for me only worked because I was operating under the assumption that they weren't completely incompetent, and unintelligent. If I wanted to watch a show about idiot criminals I would watch Trailer Park Boys (also, no thank you). It is kind of upsetting when I realize how poor this writing was now that I think about it more. Then the final reveal worked cinematically. It honestly was a beautiful scene. The music was great and the lighting was great and it was properly dramatic how she peeled off her face, but it didn't make it a good twist. It was painfully obvious this woman wasn't who she said she was. It isn't a twist when it is a simple misdirection \"oh this lady of obvious nefarious intent is actually the wife, okay.\" It had decent enough acting. I'm a big fan of carefully crafted, natural, and engaging dialogue, but I will not go there because it is a second language and I doubt the translation more than I doubt the writer; I can possibly extrapolate, however, because if this series of twists is what the writer(s) passes off as good writing then I can only imagine that the sometimes poor, cheesy, unnatural dialogue is what they imagined as proper writing. Three stars because the music was good and cinematography was decent (nothing groundbreaking to reason any higher). One more thing, well it's a question really, was the fact that the male lead was actually the lead perpetrator supposed to be a twist or something just assumed, and then they confirmed as a nice nod to the audience? As they nod to us and say \"see our writing truly is as shallow as you think it is.\"",

Decent, suspenseful plot with a great twist. Quite engaging as we see the full picture emerge.Not brilliant though. The best thrillers keep the twists to minimum, to lull you into a false sense of security, and then hit you with a massive twist at the end (e.g. The Usual Suspects). The Invisible Guest seems to have a twist every 5 seconds they come so thick and fast. This means that when the ultimate twist comes it's not a shock as you've become accustomed to them.The rapidly changing narrative also means you're hardly had time to digest the latest version of the chain of events before the next change comes, making it hard to figure out how the new change to the story fits in.The plot isn't completely watertight either, and sometimes feels contrived, largely as a result of the twists-for-twists-sake narrative.That said, it's an entertaining, thrilling roller-coaster of a ride.",

There aren't that many actors in this movie but all of them draw you in for this wild ride of a movie. To keep things spoiler-free here all I'll say is that the performances in this movie change flawlessly over the course of this movie with the actors keeping the audience on the edge of their seats guessing. The standouts for me are Mario Casas and B\u00e1rbara Lennie, who plays Laura. Speaking of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, the story for this movie does it flawlessly. Except for one aspect of this movie you never fully know where the story is going to go and what's true and what's not. The pacing for this movie is pretty fast paced and once the inciting incident happens that's when the story starts going fast. Now, this usually wouldn't be good for a movie this length but actually, it works in its favour. This movie is only one hour and forty minutes long and due to how intriguing the story for this movie is and how you want to follow along and see if you can solve this case before the movie ends. I also wanted to add to the aspect of this movie that you can easily figure out by saying you can figure it out but in order to fully get it you need to pay close attention. Also, the cinematography for this movie is just gorgeous and adds so much to the story for this movie. The specific element I wanted to touch on is the lighting for this movie which adds to that feeling of what's true and false. The last thing I want to mention is the musical score and how it helps bring you in for this mystery journey. In the End, The Invisible Guest is a satisfying mystery movie that is definitely worth your time. I give Contratiempo aka The Invisible Guest a 10/10.",

Later, upon searching on Google for more information about the movie, I came to know about the remakes and all. That's how I heard about The Invisible Guest and after watching it, I haven't watched Badla to this date.\"Contratiempo\" is one of those rare films which happened to take a place in my all time favorites, right after the first viewing. The story structure and storytelling are simply top notch. It gave me an unusual vibe of great blending of 12 Angry Men and The Usual Suspects. But, the movie is nothing like those two, except for too non-obvious similarities. The way the story unfolds is really great. This movie thrills you in a loop. You will obviously know what is fake and what is real, but you are still listening to what the characters have to say. The different aspects and the concept of collateral thinking (as suggested in the movie itself), gives you a story and then another and then another. There's a whole lot of tension being built all around the stories being shown in the movie and you won't know what will happen next. Then, after something seems alright, there's another thing ready to mess things up. All of this makes the movie totally unpredictable, which is the main plus point for this movie.The final twist was too awesome. It wasn't something that had not been done before, but was done very well. It gives you a complete satisfaction in the end. Speaking of characters, you are quite misguided. You feel something for one character. Then, it was supposed to be for some other character. But, the way you feel is the same and it is just the characters being switched. The one you sympathize might (or might not) turn out to be really bad. The one you thought was a villainous person might not be all that bad either. These aren't spoilers at all, and I don't want to dive into spoilers for this movie at all. Give it a watch, it's totally worth your time. As a huge fan of crime thrillers and murder mysteries, I was totally satisfied with this movie. This movie gave me more than I needed in a great movie of the said genre.The actors have done a really fantastic job. I won't mention their names, that's because I don't remember their names. I don't even remember the names of their characters. But if I watch it again, I will definitely recognize who is who. And, that's kind of a problem for me. I am an alien to Spanish language. Watching films with subtitles are tedious. An English dubbed version should've been available for such a great movie. Some subtitles changed so fast that I had to rewind the scene many times. That's all the negatives I have for this film.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+",

Records the entire conversation in a Pen, around 3 hrs, and makes him admit that he killed Daniel as well as Laura. ( Can that be admissible as evidence in a court of law? Pl see below)\nIn the film's climax Virginia Goodman, as Adrian believes, transforms into Elvira Garrido. On seeing that, Adri\u00e1n gets completely appalled and becomes hopeless. And the very next moment.....The real Virginia Goodman arrives. Tom\u00e1s Garrido, Daniel's father, calls police. And the film cuts to ending credits.......\nSo, what happens next?What the director wants:- He wants us to believe that there's no way that Adri\u00e1n can come out of this case and he's gotta pay for what he did. i.e. he's gonna end up in jail.What could happen:- The moment real Virginia Goodman arrives, Adri\u00e1n can tell her everything that had happened and do whatever she says. As she had never lost a single case in her entire career, she could easily save Adri\u00e1n. So, what's the point of the film?\nThe voice recording can easily be killed in court of law by Virginia Goodman. Coz there are only two voices in the recording: Mrs. Goodman's and Adrian's.\n1.

            "content": "'The Invisible Guest (2016)' essentially plays around with the nature of truth, retelling the same events from slightly different perspectives to slowly unveil new information that may or may not be totally accurate. With its retrospective framing, the flick is able to funnel all of its events through the lens of its characters, who each have their own agendas and, as such, can't quite be trusted. This isn't immediately obvious; instead, the picture plays around with our expectations to deliver its small yet potent subversions. It's a really entertaining time that manages to keep you guessing throughout. It's engaging and well-conceived. It is also, however, somewhat forgettable. Once its ending occurs, there's very little left to ponder. While that does make for a potentially more satisfying conclusion, I feel that some ambiguity would have gone a long way in making the movie more memorable. However, it's a distinct choice and the picture's last few moments certainly don't disappoint. 7/10",

            "review_title": "a perspicacious morality caution tale",
            "content": "The second feature film of Spanish writer/director Oriol Paulo, THE INVISIBLE GUEST is an entrancing whodunit opening with a straightforward frame story where a young and successful businessman Adri\u00e1n Doria (Casas), embroiled in the mysterious murder of his mistress Laura Vidal (Lennie), meets Virginia Goodman (Wagener), a silver-haired defendant lawyer, who arrives earlier than their appointed time in his penthouse apartment to discuss the case owing to the impending surface of a new witness.Hard-nosed and cut-to-the-chase, Virginia browbeats an evasive Adri\u00e1n to lay bare the truth to her so that she can bail him out, this is her last case before retirement and she will not allow it to taint her impeccable winning streak (never lose one single case before). So here goes Adri\u00e1n's story: it all starts three months earlier, there is a road accident during Adri\u00e1n and Laura's covert assignation, a young man Daniel (Gastesi) is killed (don't text when you are behind the wheel and strap that damn safety belt!), although technically it is not their fault, but for fear that calling police would expose their affair, they decide to cover it up. Adri\u00e1n goes alone to dispose of Daniel's body and vehicle, whilst Laura is in Adri\u00e1n's stalled car, and later meets Tom\u00e1s (Coronado), an automobile engineer lives nearby (sheer luck!!), who is more than willing to help her out. But soon Laura discovers a shivering truth that shatters her to the core when she arrives at Tom\u00e1s' and meets the latter's cancer-ridden-but-hearty wife Elvira, guess who is their son?Both Adri\u00e1n and Laura agree to sever their ties completely in the aftermath, but a blackmail brings them together in a remote hotel (later the plot reveals that Elvira works there), where Adri\u00e1n claims to be knocked out by an unknown attacker and when he wakes up minutes later, Laura is dead, yet the killer just vanishes from the thin air because there is no trace of break-in-or-out in a room locked from inside. Under Virginia's lawyer-smart suggestion and postulation, the narrative pans out like a RASHOMON-esque jigsaw, details are being reshuffled and reconstructed to tally with various possibilities, to make Adri\u00e1n look innocent against all odds, meanwhile, it is also a mind- game between Virginia and Adri\u00e1n, since the former has to milk the truth out of the latter by earning his trust, yet, can he trust her 100%? At one point, Virginia almost loses her professional dispassion when Adri\u00e1n reveals another twist which would change the essence of the crime forever (whenever a deer pops up, it heralds a test of his morality), is she too much invested in the case, or is there a hidden agenda behind? Or, a more tantalizing question, who is she?First of all (spoils alert!), Ana Wagener is masterfully Janus-faced in her dichotomous roles, even genre-savvy viewers are dangled to the possibility that the two characters might be played by the same actor, their sheer disparities between appearance, utterance and temperament can often successfully disabuse that idea before it being nudged again when the plot thickens, which leaves the final make-up removing revelation more inclined to a compelling justice-is-served stimulation than a complete shock. Mario Casas, dutifully downplays Adri\u00e1n's boundless selfishness and understated wiles, often brings about an innocent air of apathy when he can casually shift the responsibility to the one who is pushing up daisies, his golden-boy look effectively leaves the first impression of ingenuousness, a camouflage of his rotten core underneath. B\u00e1rbara Lennie, also competently jumps between two different modes of personalities (scheming/perturbed) apropos of the raconteurs' motives.Substantially, THE INVISIBLE GUEST has some glaring plot holes (e.g. what about the blood dripping from the car in the accident scene, that must be traceable even if Adri\u00e1n and Laura have tried to cleanse it, which the plot fails to mention, how come the police never find that out?), and sometimes, the tug-of-war verbal fencing loses its momentum due to the repetition and over- simplification of the revelations and their collateral damages, but, at any rate it is a commendable thriller buttressed by a perspicacious morality caution tale hitting the right mark, a stunner of storytelling with editing job par excellence (from Jaume Mart\u00ed), and a capable cast too.",

From this point, it was difficult to climb up, however, the plot gets here throwing a little bit of light.The film takes too long to actually happen until it starts to twist the story, due to its failing at creating any kind of \"time is running out\" feeling or danger. It feels as if the interview has all the time in the world and her stopwatch is just a lousy magician's trick. I would highlight nontheless the different paths the plot goes throughout the end of the film, that's the most interesting and thrilling part.

I did not knew anything about this movie prior seeing it - only that it was a drama / thriller and it was on IMDb 250 list. After seeing it I can only say this - watch this gem if you have at least a small spot in your heart for Agatha Christie's works - and i believe that everyone has at least a bit of it. This picture puts all fancy Hollywood detective stories seen in years to a shame. This movie is a pure detective driven story heaven.\"Contratiempo\" is like \"Knives Out\" but 100 times better because of its focus on story and because it is stripped away with all off fancy and eccentric characters who belonged more in a cartoon then in real life - \"Contratiempo\" is a pure detective. But made with such a breathtaking pacing and a skill in writing, directing, editing and acting that it makes its running time 1 h 40 min simply disappear - i was caught into this movie from its opening till closing titles - you hardly can get better then this.Overall, \"Contratiempo\" is a simple yet such a skillfully done detective movie that sucks you in from a get go and never lets you off its hook. And the ending is a kind reminder of why \"The Usual Suspects\" was such a memorable story. I can't recommend this movie any higher.",

As with his other works it's shot beautifully and he does manage to get consistently excellent performances from his cast. But this one seems a little more heavy handed and forced. It's essentially a twisty whodunit but the thing about twists is that your audience needs to be unaware of the twists for them to work. This film lays on the twists so heavily that no new revelation proves that surprising, especially the final one which is very obvious from the start. Having seen this and The Innocent in the same week I can definitely see the progress the director has made. He pulls back on his tendency to be too clever and his new work is better for it. This could have been such a better film with a slightly lighter touch and less self-indulgence from the director. Still though it's solid enough and worth a watch.",

There is higher tension culminating to the amazing moment the couple finds the phone in the couch. The movie does level off to some extent. It becomes a bit too complicated. One needs to really feel for Doria but that character is ice cold. It would have been more compelling for him to be good rooting material and then have the twist turn him. Still, I do like this noirish mystery thriller. There is some fun darkness to this story. As for the final twist, it's a little too obvious too soon.

I have no idea why does it have so much positive reviews because it was super predictable, it was forced in twists and it has ended with actually no logic - recording the evidence and whole story WITHOUT police surveillance. It only pointed out to the thing we didn't see at the end - culprit was released because of lack of evidence, since such collected evidence is considered illegal in whole civil law and guilt can not be based on it. Maybe that was post-ending twist?Also pointing out on a map in newspapers where the car was pushed in lake but main villain can not guess from the pictures was it or wasn't it there? I can't recall when was main character made a cartographer expert - but after one drive, during the night he hit the spot like a champ, real pirate x. Super dumb actually.Thank you but next time ask actual lawyer or judge or prosecutor before actually hitting on a justice card. I'm giving it 2*s because there are worse movies.

Performances are good enough to stay out of complaint zone. The score shines best in the final moments, which in itself is immensely satisfying in retrospect and aptly ties up all loose ends.Overall, The Invisible Guest flirts with the absurd at times and takes slight leeway with the plot to make itself work but the journey is worth it. A thrilling, suspenseful & consistently engaging example of its genre that only gets better & more involving with time, and finally concludes with a thumping finale, Oriol Paulo's sophomore feature comes definitely recommended.",

            "content": "Let's admit it. The great generation of great Spaniards actors died with Alfredo Landa. And yes, Javier Bardem can convince you at times, but here comes Penelope Cruz to trash the party. But what made Spaniard actors good was the fact that they knew what they were good act, which is to reflect the society where they grew up. Watch Antonio Banderas in an American action movie and then in an Spanish film and you will understand fully what I am talking about.I would not say that thrillers are something that Spanish is famous for. And yes, I was amazed by \"Los cronocr\u00edmenes\", but I place that one on sci/fi, and yes, I loved \"REC\", but again falls under the sci/fi umbrella, and yes, there is a myriad of great Spanish-speaking thrillers (\"El secreto de sus ojos\")...but they are not \"made in Spain\". So when you heard about an Spanish thriller made by Spaniards and with Spanish actors...well, I raised my eyebrown but wanted to give it a try.And boy was I glad I did it, and you will, too. I watched mine (as always) in original Spanish with English subtitles and love it. Most of the actors (I will come to that later) were just great, completely believable. The plot, that would made Hitchcock proud, is so open that only at the very end you really know what is going on. You have a story line, a few levels of complexity, and your final twist. What else could you wish for?Well...there are some, minor things, that I could have wished for. I don't like when events on a movie are forced so the actors follow a certain path. Don't worry, I don't do spoilers period, but here I am going to take you to the edge of one to explain what I mean: You cannot go to any decent hotel and check into a room that has been booked by someone else, unless your name is somewhere around there. I know so because sometimes my name has been misspelled by the booking agent in my company and I almost could not use a room booked for me. So when this happens in a movie that does not require for me to suspend disbelief...well, it breaks the spell. And worst still, these are things that could been easily fixed.Then is the actors. It seems that Jose Coronado is some sort of Spanish washed out and flushed Robert DeNiro that recently has been used to add weight to a movie. Coronado has been on great movies, but recently it seems to me he is a bit more than a token to get Spaniards to watch a movie. Same happens here. Mario Casas and Ana Wagener steal the show. The rest are good too, but I felt that Coronado could have done so much more with his role. I felt a missed opportunity there.And the plot, while truly great, could have been even more. It gets predictable towards the end, and it didn't need to be. There were some lines that could have been expanded but didn't, and that would earn the full marks that the main actors so much deserved.But still this is a fantastic movie and, if you love thrillers as much as I do, this one will not disappoint.",

Several wonderings may arise in order to explain these obvious loose ends. Why should Mr. Doria hire a witness expert lawyer to \"save\" his life and clean up his name without deeply investigating in advance who she is, where does she come from and so on? Have Felix and his client (Mr. Doria) been in touch with Virginia before the meeting? Are they aware about exact meeting date? Does Tomas Garrido's wife have the ability and astuteness to supplant a brilliant lawyer without looked suspicious for not even a second? You can see real Virginia showing up at his door two or three hours later than the fake one(so late), which is hardly difficult to understand and explain.In general, entertaining inspite of the poor acting and loose ends.

            "content": "Going into this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The audience ratings were solid, yet the critic reviews were a little underwhelming in comparison, which only goes to show - always trust the PEOPLE over the critics! Thriller movies that fall under the mystery/suspense category are often hit-and-miss. Many of them miss the mark, particularly these days. This is why it's all the more satisfying when you stumble upon one that truly hits the spot, and manages to find that magic formula. 'The Invisible Guest' is a perfect example of that.The best thing about this film is it's ability to combine plausibility with unpredictability. Often, when Thriller/Mystery movies fall short, it's usually either a result of their inability to keep the audience guessing, or their excessive use of 'dramatic license' which frequently results in glaringly obvious plot holes and all too predictable 'plot twists' that feel forced and lazy. The truly captivating thing about this film is that much of the mystery comes as much from the minds of the characters as it does from the overall plot. It doesn't need to resort to far-fetched storylines or ridiculous twists to be shocking - because the nature of the conversation that takes place between two of the main characters - Adrian Dora and the excellent Virginia Goodman - naturally takes you on a journey (or several journeys) that ultimately leads you down blind alleys and into intensely dramatic territory, without ever having to compromise the believability of the plot.If you're a fan of those classic unpredictable and tension-filled Mystery Thrillers that keep you sat and guessing on the edge of your seat throughout - such as Seven, Gone Girl, Zodiac etc - then 'The Invisible Guest' is a must-see for you. The more the storyline develops and the mystery builds, the more compelling and captivating it becomes. Plus, just as with any great Mystery Thriller, the ending or 'final act' will leave you just as shocked and gobsmacked as you were after witnessing the climactic final moments of 'Seven'... (\"what's in the box?!\")All in all, I give this film a solid 9/10. The only reason it isn't higher is because the 10/10 scores should be reserved for those movies that very much fall into the 'among the best of all time' category. Whilst 'The Invisible Guest' doesn't quite make it into that category, it remains, in my opinion, one of the most captivating, mind-blowing, well crafted and truly shocking Thrillers to reach our screens since David Fincher's 'Gone Girl'.Do yourself a favour - cancel any plans you may have this evening, stay home, and watch the truly exceptional 'The Invisible Guest'...You can thank me later.",

The complexity of the plot rivals some of my favorite films, such as \"Courage Under Fire\" and \"Basic.\" Unfortunately, much of the complexity and plot reversals involve improbable coincidences, which detract from their dramatic impact. The performances are believable, particularly by Wagener and Coronado. However, the central character is depicted as selfish, self-absorbed and remorseless. The film might be stronger if we were to see a positive side to his character. Similarly, we don't see enough of the femme fatale to understand the central character's fascination with her, particularly as we see two widely different perceptions of their relationship. The basic story concerns a murder committed inside a locked room. That mystery is set up very well and believably. The cinematographer successfully sets up a dreary, grey, cold setting. The clothes are grey. The mood is grey. The cars are grey. The only visual element that contrasts is the vivid white hair of one of the characters.",

The answer i believe is the details, and showing them even before you unfold the real thrill. You show the details even before starting to unfold the mystery and then the same details appear again just to make you realise that how you overlooked them in the first place. The Invisible Guest is a complete and a detailed study material for thriller lovers. It shows how to add sense in the thriller and just not letting it get away without human emotions. I have seen many mysterious films having revenge theory involve just because it should justify the overall plot and the Revenge should look mandatory. And it works because the culprit must be punished as we all believe. The Invisible Guest is about parents Revenge against a rich freak who got away using his powers. They plan a thrilling revenge to destroy him and then film keeps revealing shocking facts which were hidden since forever. In 106 minutes this film lacks loo breaks, it lacks loopholes (except for one or two emotional ones), it lacks slow pace and i hope you're getting what I'm trying to say non-affirmatively. It has everything set up nicely and most importantly clearly because cleverness is essential in modern thrillers otherwise we have option of lot of retro classics to enjoy on repeat mode. Spanish Cinema shows how to make a mind boggling thriller with implausible storyline to the world cinema. I have seen better revenge dramas, even more brutal than this but that doesn't take away anything from this film's status. The Invisible Guest triumphs in every cinematic aspect whether is it Acting, Writing, Technicality, Direction or Impact. A Classic thriller which should be remade again and again.RATING - 8/10*",

I lave the main actor Mario Casas was great in this movie. Also I can mention that the acting of all of the characters was great.The invisible guest, as any detective movie, has to be very precisely analyzed by the director and all the details has to be perfect in order to avoid plot holes. Here there are some, and one of them is when they take a train, we can see that it was an electric trail, but a few seconds later, we can see the characters standing near that train and in the background we can hear the sound of steam whistle. Allover, the film was great.Also, this is one of the few films, where you cannot get distracted even for a second as you will miss a very important detail.Loved this film very much !",

There's so much going on in places that you really need to be paying attention. But it's written in such a way, that it sucks you in quickly, so your concentration naturally follows. When the twists start arriving, they each hit you like a tonne of bricks.The performances here are fantastic as well. Mario Casas has become my favourite Spanish actor after previously enjoying him in \"The Photographer of Mauthausen\" too. Some of the film locations were stunning as well.I generally think I'm alright at picking twists or solving these kind of films - but not this one. The incredibly intelligent way it was written kept me hopelessly guessing until the end. Probably not the best choice of film to watch when you're tired or wanting to switch your brain-off. It's best just to surrender yourself to it at the start and go along for the ride.I loved the ending and found it so satisfying! A must-watch for those into foreign language films and those who love a good twist or two!",

            "review_title": "Lies, infidelity and the power of the rich create a fantastic thriller",
            "content": "Directed by Oriol Paulo, \"The Invisible Guest,\" or \"Contratiempo\" in its original language, is a fantastic Spanish film which combines suspense with a complicated puzzle that is both visually and intellectually stimulating. The film was released on January 6, 2017 and has a \"MA\" rating, most likely for the depicted scenes of violence and some language throughout. Themes of infidelity, lies, the power of the rich, and the fight between the rich and the poor are prevalent throughout. It's not a film you watch once. It's a gripping, suspenseful crime thriller that you must watch more than once to catch all of the small details.The movie starts off \"in media res,\" or in the middle of action. The main character, Adri\u00e1n Doria is being accused of murdering his mistress, Laura. Doria is played by actor Mario Casas, who recently starred in the Netflix film \"El practicante\" (2020) and does a spectacular job in both films. A renowned prosecutor, Virginia Goodman, has come to \"save the day\" and it is said that she's taken this as her last case before retirement. Doria's lawyer, Felix, hired her to help them win the case once and for all, making a dramatic entrance at the final hour. She tells Doria that they have 180 minutes to start over, and to figure out how he can win the case. But first, he has to tell the truth- the whole truth.\"The Invisible Guest\" is dark. Not only in its themes but also with the cinematography. That's not a bad thing, and I think that it pairs well with the film as a whole. The lies throughout the film make everything darker and more confusing. I think this is a film that needs to be watched more than once. In the first run through, the ending is shocking. Then, as you watch it a second time already knowing the twist ending, you're able to pick up on the small details that make your really appreciate what Paulo put into making this film. At times, the twists can get confusing, which is another reason why it may be necessary to watch more than once. After getting past that and once you realize how all of the puzzle pieces fit together, the film comes together beautifully.The film has an interesting take on modern society, not just in Spain but throughout the entire world. The overarching theme, in my opinion, is the fact that the rich hold power over the poor. Doria is able to buy his innocence with a sketchy lawyer who makes things and details disappear. At the same time, Tom\u00e1s, the father of a dead son, suffers with his wife who almost dies from the depressive state she's been put in. They struggle to get justice for their dead son, who was killed in a car accident by Doria and his mistress prior to his mistress being killed. Doria becomes \"businessman of the year\" and it is evident he has no money troubles. He's able to cover up the car accident and thought he would get away with it until him and Laura were \"blackmailed.\" It's an interesting take, and a bold one at that. In the end, though, Doria get's what he deserves. But I'll leave you to watch the movie and see for yourself.As a college student majoring in Spanish, this film is perfect to watch and aid in learning the language. It's engaging and suspenseful, while also depicting the upper-class society of Spain. Overall, I do not have any huge complaints about the film- it's pretty solid all around. If I had to be picky, I would say that I wished Doria's wife, Sonia, played a little bigger of a role. I think there was a lot of potential to add to the mounting pile of lies, but it just fell a little short with that storyline. If you are a student looking for an interesting Spanish film as an aid to learning the language, this is the one for you. If you are a movie buff looking to add a solid crime thriller to your favorites, then this is the one for you also.",

He has to do that because he was found by the police in a mountain hotel room with the corpse of his lover and was arrested. After that, he has to reveal all of his dark secrets to his lawyer in order for her to be able to help him.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazing plot with many surprises and many plot twists too. The direction which was made by Oriol Paulo was absolutely perfect and I wouldn't change anything about it, it had plenty of suspense and drama moments. Regarding the interpretations, I liked very much the interpretation of Mario Casas who played as Adri\u00e1n Doria the wealthy and successful businessman and I have to say that he was the biggest surprise in this movie. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were B\u00e1rbara Lennie's who played as Laura Vidal and of course Ana Wagener's who played as Virginia Goodman.Finally, I have to say that \"The Invisible Guest\" was a very big surprise because I didn't expect it to be such a great movie.

The entire film industry seems to only concentrate on superhero, sci-fi or romcom dramas.The Invisible Guest starts off slow and then quickly picks up pace as all the pieces of the puzzle are slowly laid out and put together. While it isn't perfect by any means, it is an excellent and even emotional mystery drama at times.You could easily make a ten episode TV Series with this in the vein of True Detective and therefore it gets a solid 9/10 for delivering the same impact in a running time of under 2 hours.Must watch if you like thrillers.",

The first issues i see with it are the same ones i found in oriol paulo's \"el cuerpo\": a whole bunch of flashbacks to tell the story (here they're a bit more justifiable), a lot of twists and turns to trick the viewer some make sense some not that much, and again a car being crashed. I also didn't like much how they introduce the plot in the movie, they needn't to do that in such an obvious way. but anyway, these movies are not very different in form: again he can engage the viewer while the whole movie is almost only based in one location, again the pace is on point - and the views of bierge are pretty stunning.The second problems here...well a lot of \"what ifs\" first of all. He wants to trick us based on possibilities - and that's how he wants to keep you engaged - pretty much by guessing. the movie also requires a bit of suspension of disbelief but i'm kinda fine with that. the main problem is this: he's too focused on the ending that he doesn't care to make one or two narrative holes in order for the sotry to flow. again, i can understand but i don't think the ending is only what really matters in a movie. still it's a fun way to get there.now the ending...it's kinda predictable. ok you might not see it coming directly, but it's not hard to predict the last 10 seconds of the fim. not even the main revelation which is slightly before, but the last 10 seconds. the main problem of a lot of thrillers is that because they don't have that many characters you have to start guessing. that's not a bad thing per se, but since i saw el cuerpo recently i aso thught this one had a trick - i wasn't wrong.contratiempo is a good movie ,that but i dare to say a lot of people that were jawdropped when the finale was revealed probably are the ones discussing inception's ending - when it was pretty obvious nolan just wanted to play with the viewer. there are a lot of filmes where i was pretty stunned by the end - mostly because it makes you see the movie in a different light. this one made that but still i don't think it was thaat surprising.I'm going to give it an eight because it's indeed a good movie and a bit better than el cuerpo. plus it keeps you entertained while not being the best thriller in the world. being in top 250 imdb best movies doesn't make much sense though. i'm still going to see more oriol paulo's movies because get engaged with this type of films - even though this one is pretty much \"el cuerpo\" from another perspective. more believable none the less.",

Almost at every turn there is something so wicked that you gasp at the revelation. It was a lot of fun.I usually don't go for this sort of whodunit type of film.

It have also some big revelations , suspense moments, make us think and let us pretty confuse in the middle . The only thing that i predicted its was Mrs Goodman: i knew at some point that she didnt was the real Mrs Goodman . And at the end , i really understand that i was right after some revelations before the big revelations . Please watch it until the end because i wanted to stop watching from the start because i didnt feel anything at the beginning . And it seemed pretty classic plot at the beginning but the complexity come after and i enjoyed the way they did it really. The theory of the main character about the father who tell that his girlfriend was murdered by him and itt woork pretty well . The magic scenes at the end where we see that the father spy him in front of another appartment and we saw also the father and the fake Mrs Goodman who give hime the location of his son on a map . I mean that was brilliant too . And i enjoyed the risk that they took with that movie . And just for that it deserve the nine stars . Very good movie anyway.",

While I have become more adept at reading subtitles and have found many foregin language films enjoyable, this one had dialogue that was coming rapid-fire at times. I kept missing lines, and because it is a mystery, I was afraid of missing anything that might be a vital piece of information. This isn't a detriment to the film, but perhaps a warning for those who also have difficulty with reading subtitles that are only on the screen for a few seconds. Aside from that I was utterly enthralled by The Invisible Guest. The plot is written so well, and is constantly revealing new layers of the story as you go. Perhaps the smartest move they make is having every single flashback scene reflect what is being said, even if there is some falsehood in it. This allows us to revisit key moments from a new perspective when the main character revises his story.It's hard to say much about The Invisible Guest without spoiling things, but I can say that I thought the cast was amazing. There was a lot of emotion that came out in the performances we see here, and Mario Casas was particularly brilliant. He plays a heavily-layered character that is reluctant to put his guard down, so it's intriguing to see the stages he goes through in this film as he is forced to tell the truth. Ana Wagener is the other notable actor in the film. Her determination is perfect for the role, and it was great watching how she was always a step ahead of Casas in every scene. I will say that I started to suspect what is revealed at the very end somewhat early on, but as with all the best mysteries, even when you figure out one piece there is still more to discover. I can't say much more about The Invisible Guest for fear of spoiling things. I would highly recommend that all fans of mystery/thrillers give this movie a try. It was completely satisfying for me.",

But the film ended and... it wasnt.

            "content": "***spoiler alert***\nUpdating Hitchcock is always a tempting and daunting task, in every moment, it seems. The temptation is, i suppose, easy to understand: Hitchcock's movies exist in a world of film. His stories (even when adpated from cheap novels) are always tailored to his camera, his camera to his eye, and his eye to his brilliant visual intuitions. In terms of narrative, his \"stories\" are always a game which invites several players on screen to participate, and always you, the spectator. But the secret is never in the facts of the story, never in the words, but in the image itself, in the movement of the camera. His camera is much more attached to character than, say, Welles', but much less than Scorcese's. Space plays a role, tells a story, the story is (admitedly) a McGuffin, in itself a useless device, that nevertheless grabs us. The game has the rules the storyteller defines, and once we the spectator enter it (that should happen even as the initial credits are still rolling), we don't have the possibility Not to play.Now we have Oriol Paulo updating Hitchcock. So far his best student had been De Palma, and for the moment it will remain in that spot, at least to me. But some things are interesting.Paulo understands the spliting of the space of the action. First we have the apartment room, overlooking the street, windows (eyes) on the other side. Remarkably old fashioned in its decoration, and even the objects (pen, chronometer, lighter, etc) are oldfashioned, a blink to Hitchcock's age. In the apartment the game is between the lawyer who must extract the truth from the ambiguous client and the client, whose sincerity (or lack of it) we don't get.The telling, re-telling, correcting and speculating of the story of what happened is where things get interesting. Through flashbacks we leave the room, and almost in Rashomon fashion, we watch over and over again the same bits of the important sotry elements. Who's right? Who's lying? Who is playing us, the audience? Most of those flashbacks are clumsy in how they are shot, they don't breathe well, they don't sit well in our ability to constantly re-create and change the memory of past events. That's a cinematic flaw. Most of the tension that we feel In the apartment room is gone when we move to the mountain roads or the hotel. I suppose that Hitchcock's feel of tension is often achieved through the physical limitations of the spaces where we are (think Vertigo, Rear Window, Rope, Strangers on a Train...) and thus the moutain, the open space of the flashbacks (with the obvious expection of the Kubrickan hotel) just won't do it. Where this also falls apart is in the main actor. He is so weak that the ambiguity of HIS character which should be central to this game is lost. He reveals everything as he thinks it is in each moment. Hitchcok never required a great deal out of his actors in order to make his films work, but he did need at least that they didn't get in the way. In a certain way Casas's character is the self-designated manipulator of the events, at least the character thinks he is. ***BIG SPOILER*** But he justs allows us to think too much, and follow the true master manipulation (the director of the apartment scene, whom we find out to be the fake lawyer).Anyway this is a relatively mechanical tale of suspense (tension through camera, expectaction, space), with bits of a game of spies (who is who, the biggest manipulator wears literally a mask). The sense of noir is all around, the sense that we are being played around, the coincidences (that the father of the dead kid is the one who picks up a co-conspirator). I want to see more of this director, this one is a nice exercise, i want to see him taking risks, i hope he does.",

But nowadays its just extremely hard to find a truly good detective story; either all of them are filled with clich\u00e9s, or are too unserious and \"jokey\". But \"The Invisible Guest\" is an overlooked detective masterpiece.One of the few Spanish movies I've seen, it has the grim atmosphere of \"Gone Girl\" and story quality and complexity worthy of Sherlock. I obviously cannot tell much about the plot without spoiling everything to oblivion, but in general it's a story of a man falsely accused of murder, who has only a couple of hours to prove his innocence. The multilayered storyline demands your attention every second, and plot twists will leave you with you mouth wide open. A modern detective story that still manages to stay classy.

Wrong decisions are made leading to guilt and fear while the mystery of what really happened thickens and changes at each turn until it spirals down to its climax. I said spirals, there are so many plot twist in rapid succession that the film ends up spinning. The film is structured in an almost \"Rashomon\" style where different possible solutions to the mystery are shown in flashback. Ideally the viewer should be trying to work out its own solution as well before the final plot twists are unleashed on us. Once a thriller becomes predictable it looses its appeal and The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo) by Oriol Paulo seems on a mission to baffle us till the very end.",

            "content": "A quite intriguing, fascinating film that kept me at high alert at many points and I felt true agony and anxiety. Using a downplayed and somewhat gloomy photography, as light is not prevalent in the film, combined with the dark atmosphere of the events, the uncertainty and many illusions of the film are excellently projected. Its great use of winter and forest surroundings adds special colour to the film, something like a countryside taste which could fit any European country. Corruption and social variations form part of the support means of the plot, creating a contrast between the middle-aged couple with a comfortable but quiet and conventional living style and the glamorous world of modern business and art, mixed with conspiracies and secrets, supported by unscrupulous lawyers and magistrates. The film uses elements of Agatha Christie novels, such as the many twists of the plot, and also themes from Hitchcock epics, for instance long, prolonged, scenes filled with uncertainty and fear. It deserves viewing and I hope to see even better from the director, as I suspect he can make an even subtler, scarier and nail-biting crime mystery- thriller. I am sure he still stands on the middle steps of the ladder, having though already accomplished honourable results.",

I noticed that the lady lawyer and the mother are the same person, I mean, how come nobody saw this? I asked my brother about this and he fell silent LOL. And halfway through the movie, you can kinda see the plot twist coming.I rarely venture out of english speaking movie, aside from asian movies, I could count by hand the number of foreign film I've watched before. Last time I watched 365dni and I regret it. But this movie was very good, the structure and the unreliable main character was the selling point here, the way they build the web of lies and the deconstructure of those lies are very compelling. To me, This wasnt a thriller movie, this played out more like a detective movie.\nThough from the title 'The Invisible Guest' I thought that this was a horror/ghost movie.\nAnd there are some moments where it feels\na bit dragged out, I understand that it was to build tension and suspense but to me it was just a bit too long and unnecessary.\nThe plot twist to me wasn't the revelation that our main character is fooled by the lady lawyer or that laura wasn't actually the mastermind behind it all but rather the fact that the young guy wasn't actually dead when he was about to be drowned. Now that is cold blooded. This moment right here was the true unmasking of a human nature, how low can you go to cover your tracks, even when you think you've hit your lowest point, the thing you tried to hide wasn't actually the worst thing that you could do. How far can you go? Apparently even further down.Well, Expectations exceeded and this movie deserves major props. Most definitely would recommend this movie to other people.At the end of the movie, gave myself a pat on the back and a note for myself to check more foreign movies from spain.",

But, the decision he made not to call the police was quite weird for me at first sight, which may indicates a classic impression of rich alpha males.So, as compared to all the follow-up uncovered, what would happen if police knows of the event at the outset? Since the venerable mom didn't refer to the accident itself, we could take it as a true condition, based on which it is reasonable for the boss to insist his innocence and blame the deer. Another detail backing this approach is the unnoticeable dent on the front of the car, which leads to the fact that there is no direct clash between two cars, though the boss' reaction toward this emergency definitely results in what then happens to the poor boy.But, from the perspective of the boss, this cover-up may seems quite reasonable. Given that he unswervingly believe the positive consequence of a cover- up, which means no disturbance from the police and, more important, no harm to the promising career of an upstart entrepreneur, every otherwise plan just doesn't offer enough benefit to pay off the cost. Therefore, it is indeed, according to the mom, sheer foolishness about his control of the world that leads him to this fiasco. Sad!

            "content": "Although out of the Hollywood style with explosions and fierce pursuits, and even without being inspired by some classic literature, the modern Spanish production, \"The invisible Guest\" (2016), takes your breath away every minute during the time you are watching it, and even after.The plot revolves around the preparation of an iconic and respectable businessman for his trial after being accused of the murder of his paramour. With an innocent, yet unbelievable and full of \"holes\" story, the details that are questioned and explained to successfully fill them in the future trial are the beginning and the middle of a new and complex web of facts and lies related to another unfortunate crime.Focusing on a single and luxurious apartment that serves as a place for various memories and flashbacks, the narrattive of just under two hours in length takes you constantly to an infinite number of paths, hypotheses and opinions. All surprising and questionable, but without loose ends.The movie is a gradual and incessant suspense. The absence of action scenes is filled by the lack of any kind of monotony, either by the great script or by the alternation of expressions of its actors. Filled with doubts and reasoning, the work is no purely intellectual questioning, but rather, a thriller that makes you frantically look at and exchange targets of hatred and sympathy as the plot progresses or makes you think you are moving towards an imaginable or simple ending.After the conclusion of the work, perhaps one or another idea that appeared in the viewer's mind during the course of the plot is similar to some of the various assumptions that the story makes you raise. However, the intensity of the surprise and anxiety it generates will leave you with a tightness in your chest and a round of applause for the production.'The invisible guest\" is a movie that makes you want to advance in time to discover its end soon, but that prevents you from doing so due to the uninterrupted increase in the quantity and quality of discoveries and plot twists.",

In this movie (released in January of 2017), we find Adr\u00edan Doria, a sucessful businessmen who is arrested for the suspected murder of his lover, Laura Vidal. Adr\u00edan hires one of the best defense attorney's, Virginia Goodman to help prove his innocence.\nThroughout the movie, we find out that he is involved, along with Laura, in a cover up murder of a man named Daniel Goodman. Adr\u00edan hides details from the events that transpired from Virginia in order to try to save himself. During the movie, we are informed of the real truth regarding all of this, but are still left hanging of the edge of our seat till the very end. Just when you think you have figured it out, Oriol will throw another twist at you that you did not expect.\nThe music during this movie conveys a message of suspense as well as mystery which makes you want to keep watching. The cinematography is dark shots which adds to the suspense even further. I believe that the central message is that you cannot hide from your past and in the end justice will be done. Adr\u00edan is trying to cover up his past throughout the movie, but Virginia is able to piece the story together and we learn the truth.\nI believe that there are few mistakes in this movie, and overall it is one that you must watch over and over agin (Similar to inception) in order to fully understand it.

The movie almost turned sci fied because of this.If Doria did not know how Tomas wife looks like until the end when she reveals her truth identity works much better for the movie.",

            "content": "The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo) written and directed by Oriol Paulo, is a Spanish thriller starring Ana Wagener as lawyer Virginia Goodman, and Mario Casas, as businessman Adrian Doria. The film is strategically delivered in the inverted pyramid style - the crux of the story is made out to be the most crucial and most telling, but all it is is the straw that broke the camel's back. Businessman Adrian and his lover Laura are found by police in a remote hotel room in Spain. Adrian has been knocked unconscious by an unknown intruder and Laura has been bludgeoned to death with a very heavy concrete sculpture. None of the other hotel guests see anyone leave or go into that room, so the police pin the crime on Adrian. He claims he is innocent. This is not the pinnacle of the plot though. Everything that allowed Adrian and Laura to come to the hotel room is. Enter Lawyer Virginia Goodman (Wagener) who is highly regarded in her field. She hasn't lost a single defence case yet. Inside Adrian's apartment riveting dialogue between these two characters unravels, and it is questions after questions after question. Answer after answer after answer. It is interrogative, engaging and fast moving. With this dialogue, viewers are given the backstory. We know Virginia is good - she is the lawyer who will get Adrian off the hook. While she tests him for holes in his story she too is being tested - can he trust her and is she smart enough to pull off his defence in a court of law? It is here when the perspective of the movie is shifted, and the perspective on the facts of the case change, at the desires of Virginia herself. She verbally puts Adrian into the jury's shoes. She shows him what they will see and she presents his case back to himself in a way that has the potential to suggest he is guilty of murdering his lover. He is enraged - his guilt has been discovered by his lawyer and he doesn't like it. It is at this point Oriol Paulo has masterfully played with angles and perspective, and has allowed us to realise we have been deceived. We have been deceived this whole time. How stupid we were. We thought Adrian was innocent! When dialogue is that quick, crafted, and precise, many outcomes are plausible. Many facts of a crime can be skewed and delivered on a different silver platter and still be plausible. At this point we are completely entranced, and want to know more. We thought he was innocent. Could he really be guilty? Guilt never crossed our minds. How blind we were. Screenplays and the facts of a crime have one thing in common: anything can be twisted and changed and still make sense in the end. Oriol Paulo knows there's more than one way to skin a cat. Ten out of ten. Amazing, thought-provoking and definitely worth watching, again and again.",

Even the \"block of ice\" thing, yeah they've done exactly that before as well.Now, this is a reasonably entertaining little movie with a smaller budget (but still looking good) and decent acting, but nothing too special and nothing spectacular. Certainly not something to give 10 stars for, when a popular weekly anime series has twists and reveals of similar calibre pretty regularly. And that anime is itself heavily influenced by \"Sherlock Holmes\", so it's just an example of such a \"whodunit\" type of content. So if you think this is some groundbreaking, jawdropping stuff that warrants a 10/10, maybe you haven't seen as much of this kind of content yet, otherwise the rating would end up being far more level-headed.",

This film did not become an exception. Initially, \"Guest\" may seem boring and slightly tightened, but soon enough the story begins to add to the dynamics and does not let the viewer go until the final credits.

            "review_title": "A Spanish David Fincher?",
            "content": "Though the story can be difficult to follow some of the time, flashback within a flashback, the director - and screenwriter - of this movie shows great talent for telling a suspenselful tale with twists, turns and revelations that you might not have expected and that will leave you wanting more-The color palette reminds you of David Fincher. The tempo, story and rhythm reminds you of Christopher Nolan and the setup of the film reminds you of an old noir.Watching this movie I was quite excited and on the edge of my seat for certain parts of the film. The director shows great control in working with suspense and at hinting details for the characters, and for the audience, to pick up on. It's a great ride trying to figure out who did what along with Adri\u00e1n Doria and Virginia Goodman. The story is well constructed and the characters are very well written. All of them are three dimensional and as we get to know them better for each minute we understand their reasoning and motivation.The color palette reminds you of Davin Fincher, but I do sometimes wish that the director, Mr. Oriol Paulo, would have turned down his visual style in turn for focusing on the plot since it often took me out of the story a bit.The feature is well crafted, but it could be occasionally be challenging to know exactly where a certain scene would take you - but I guess that's the point as well, to make the audience feel confused. This does just not always work very well as I could feel myself trying to figure out what is up and down instead of following the story.I did not know much about this film before watching it and therefore it also took me sometime to figure out what the plot was and who the important characters were. There were many and it was troublesome to keep track on them for the first half hour of the film, also because it jumped back and forth in time and what not.It is an entertaining movie with a super interesting premise and it is a film that will make you think as much as it bewilders and shocks you. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.It is clear that the director is inspired by the classics as well as American film directors, but I am looking forward to seeing him develop his own style and discovering his coming films in the future.If you are in the mood for a time-jumping, unpredictable movie with twists and turns, I can recommend this one.//A humble fan of films",
