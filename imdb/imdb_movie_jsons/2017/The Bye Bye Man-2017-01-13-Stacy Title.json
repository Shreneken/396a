With that in mind I won't exactly be harsh on the movie it had it's good and bad ideas. I think what it suffered from the most is that the Bye Bye Man wasn't exactly scary because you never knew what he'd do once he got you and it's never really explained. He's just like a guy with a dog that rides a train and leaves coins or something. I dunno he's just not a scary enough character.",

Like why did they take a 4 year old to a college house party. Why does the man character constantly say the name that he shouldn't be saying. It felt slapdash.The acting is pretty awful and one of the actors is clearly English doing a horrible American accent. It makes the film slightly entertaining as it enters into like disaster territory but I was just so bored that I struggled to actually focus enough to pick up on things.Also this movie is not scary in the slightest. It has terrible CGI and it's just bad.Don't waste your time with it.",

Years ago it seemed a similar type of film would be hitting the big screen on an almost bimonthly basis, now when we get a horror, it always feels as if something is missing somehow.The Bye Bye Man begins well enough, and has a fairly interesting concept, trouble is the direction is so poor, it fails almost entirely to so the basic premise of a film, and tell a story, it's lazy somehow, we get no backstory, no real conclusion, and certainly no real tension.The acting was fair I guess, but none of the cast were treated well in terms of script.Overall, a total disappointment, some wonderful ideas, just badly realised, and way too predictable, you always seem to know what's coming next. 4/10",

            "content": "There are moments when you watch a trailer for a movie and think to yourself \"Well, the trailer is pretty bad, but maybe the movie is better.\" And, sometimes the movie does actually turn out to be better, making you pleasantly surprised. I did not have that feeling as I watched the trailer for the Bye Bye Man. After the trailer ended, there was not one ounce of me that thought \"OK, maybe I should give it a shot.\". I watched this movie with my best friend, who also happens to be a horror fan, only because we have literally seen everything else that was out. I personally found three major issues with the movie. 1. The characters: Not one of the characters were particularly likable, so who really cares if any or all of them get hacked to bits? They don't really have any back story. The only one you feel any emotion towards at all is Elliot, and even those moments of emotion are sparse. Of course, he's the only one who has somewhat of a history to him. 2. The acting: To put it simply, the acting is horrendous. It's downright laughable. The writing can only be blamed for so long. It felt more like a high school stage production (and a bad one at that), than an actual movie. The women who played Kim, and Elliot's girlfriend, are by far the worst out of the whole movie, the latter being slightly worse than the former.3. The worst thing about this movie is there is no mythology about the Bye Bye Man. There is zero backstory into who or what this creature is. All we know is that he is a creepy man with a creepy dog, and that's it. We don't know why he's terrorizing and killing these people, other than the fact that they say his name. WHY?! Where did that lore come from? Even the most psychotic icons of horror have some backstory into why they are that way. This movie offers you none of that. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie; I wouldn't recommend renting this movie; I wouldn't even recommend watching this movie for free on Netflix. This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and I've seen some very bad horror movies.",

So, part Freddy Krueger, part Bloody Mary, part The Babadook, and part Candyman, with that entity from It Follows thrown into the mix for good measure. Clearly, there's very little originality on offer here. This probably wouldn't be such a big issue if director Stacy Title had managed to conjure up lots of effective scares or deliver some gross out gore, but her film is light on fright and strictly PG-13 when it comes to content.The plot is also very sketchy in terms of exposition: who is the Bye Bye man? Where does he come from? What is his purpose? Why does he hang around with a poorly rendered CGI dog? Is he a metaphor for mental illness or the product of mass hysteria? (or is that expecting too much from a popcorn horror aimed at a teen audience?). Just a few of the questions that the film fails to answer. Perhaps these issues will be dealt with in a sequel, but I won't be in a hurry to find out. I'm happy to say 'bye bye' to The Bye Bye man. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.",

            "content": "'THE BYE BYE MAN': Three Stars (Out of Five) A horror flick about a supernatural entity that can possess anyone that learns it's name, which terrorizes three college students. It was directed by Stacy Title, and written by Jonathan Penner (of TV's 'SURVIVOR' fame). The script is based on a chapter of the 2005 book 'The President's Vampire', titled 'The Bridge to Body Island' (by Robert Damon Schneck). The film stars Douglas Smith, Cressida Bonas, Lucien Laviscount, Jenna Kanell, Michael Trucco, Carrie-Ann Moss, Leigh Whannell, Erica Tremblay, Cleo King, Faye Dunaway and Doug Jones (as The Bye Bye Man). It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and fans alike, but it's done really well at the Box Office (so far). I thought it was OK.Three college students (Smith, Bonas and Laviscount) move into an old house, near campus. Once there, they learn about a supernatural entity called The Bye Bye Man (Jones). They also discover that the Bye Bye Man can possess anyone who says or thinks it's name (and make them do horrible things). In order to try and stop the creature, they investigate it's origins. While doing so, they desperately try to stop others from learning about it. They also frantically try not to kill each other, in the process either.The movie is a great concept for a horror flick, and The Bye Bye Man is definitely a frighteningly memorable slasher film villain. I'd like to see a sequel, or maybe more, and hopefully the potential franchise keeps getting better. Penner's script isn't bad though (he also plays a small part in the film), and Title's direction is decent as well. I also can't believe the producers got such an awesome cast for this (Whannell, Moss, Dunaway, Jones!). I'd still recommend seeing it, if you're a fan of horror movies.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/niTBUpMl3sQ",

            "content": "I actually liked this movie. It has some good scares and in my opinion it is fairly creepy. I am an avid horror collector, mostly indie horror, and indie horrors almost always out do Hollywood made horror movies. The bye bye man, though, is one of the better recently made big budget movies. It is pg13 so i don't know what all these negative review people were expecting. I was able to get a copy of the unrated version on blu ray a week before it is actually released in stores. I have not seen the original theatrical version, but oh my was the unrated version good. It had genuinely R rated feeling scenes. It made for quite a surprising experience for me, as i was expecting the typical teenage ghost story where nothing is showed and nothing is scary. The bye bye man has a similar set up to the newer movie \"Satanic\". Although bye bye man is much better on many levels, both movies kind of deal with the whole aspect of finding out about the entity or whatever the antagonist may be. There's no big filler or after sequences of action in this movie. It was devoted to the set up and creepiness of the huge house the college friends buy, and just the idea of the bye bye man with out ever reealllly exploring his origin. Its fast paced, douglas smith is a good actor and is actually in his early thirties!! Lol. AND there's a special guest appearance by Leigh Whannell, who is a horror maestro himself. Personally i am impressed and pleased with this movie. The setting was really creepy and the movie was overall refreshing. It really freaked me out When eliot's neiss wanders up into his bedroom while at his party. When she opens the door in the wall, what happens behind her is super scary. The synchronization of it all is terrifying. I give it a 7. Trust my review. Not the fakes",

This is a movie that you would see on the Chiller network (not a knock on the network). Its a completely generic, non-entertaining, ridiculously stupid waste of time. I went in with a clean slate (apart from thinking the title of the film was laughably dumb) and came out feeling like I really should have known better.The film is about a group of friends that seem to be haunted by a presence known as The Bye Bye Man. This monstrous being has history connected to previous grizzly murders and now this group need to end the Bye Bye Man. Sounds dumb enough, and it is. The three lead characters are terrible. You want them to die. There are shallow, generic, infuriatingly boring and bland. Sometimes you get that with horror films, but I at least want to get behind the characters. Some of the characters and actions are so stupid that I was praying for their characters death. And when it came it was well deserved because of how dumb they are. I'm talking about a specific scene with a train at a railway crossing.The film has nothing amazing going for it visually. The scares (if you can call it that) are so manufactured and tried that even if this was your first horror movie, you still would see it all coming. You want to laugh at how stupid the concept, name, and presence of the being is. Its not even in the so bad its good territory which is a shame because with something with a title like this it should have gone all out in the cheese department.I've been very hard on this film. Its a January release, which is basically the graveyard of Hollywood films. Pretty certain that no one had any faith in this film, and I can see why. You can give me a pen and a pad and a camera and I can write you a more convincing horror film that this. At the very least we have memes of the catchphrase for this film. if anything, its going to go down as a giant joke. Its what it deserves.4/10",

Perhaps people are just obsessed with the lousy \"found footage\" atmosphere or the Ouija boards possessions. I thought it was a rather refreshing considering all the other flicks these days. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it I just put it on for background noise and I thought it was going to be a random crazy fellow killing random people.

Not a new idea by any means, but the psychological aspect of the movie kept me entertained. The directing was good. Some shots were pretty cool and some jump scares were actually clever. Depending on how you look at it, one of the jump scares was either a rip off or was inspired by a James Wan jump scare. The movie had the potential to be good and they just dropped the ball. Some people have mentioned how the shot gun deaths were one of the reasons it was a \"bad\" movie. These people are over dramatic. That scene, while head scratching is not going to ruin the movie.

The Bye Bye man is one of the better ones I've seen.More of a thriller than a horror,I found the acting solid and felt their was a great chemistry between the three main characters,Cressida Bonas did particularly well in her debut movie and I really enjoyed her performance. The plot was a tad loose but not too bad,tending to concentrate on the three main characters story line rather than boring the watcher with a long drawn out back story,the movie got to the point early and stayed there,which I personally loved about it.

Could have been better though if it had more frightening & graphic scenes and if the story was explored a bit more. Going from an R-rating to PG-13 is never good.Douglas Smith (who played Elliot) gave a really good performance as did Michael Truccoand who played his older brother. I didn't even recognize Leigh Whannell lol. Carrie-Anne Moss was also good in her brief role as the detective. If a sequel is planned I hope she returns.

If you have half-decent character development, a semi-plausible plot line, average actors or better, good FX and AT LEAST one or two \"gotcha\" moments, or some combination thereof, I'll give it a good recommendation.Sadly, The Bye Bye Man has none of it.Let's start with back story - there is NONE! (apart from some journalist encountering BBM 30 years before the story takes place). We do not know who BBM is, where he came from, how he came into existence, or why he terrorizes people. This is the biggest flaw that sinks the movie. Perhaps the filmmakers thought if they tell you NOTHING about the boogieman, it will make him more scary. It doesn't - it's disingenuous, at best.Half of the actors give wooden performances, and the other half overact grandiosely. I was particularly distressed to see Carrie Ann Moss and - GASP! - Academy Award winner Faye Dunaway, as they are so much better than this material. I got the impression the producers wanted big names to attract an audience (and maybe Ms. Dunaway really, really needs the money). It was difficult to care for any of these characters.The plot is ludicrous and revolves around the single notion \"don't think it, don't say it\" which, if you analyze it, is antithetical to how people behave. You've got a supernatural boogieman after you, intending to kill you, and you're not going to think about him?!?! C'mon...I did not have one single, solitary moment when I felt tense or ill at ease. There were NO \"gotcha\" moments for me throughout the entire picture, which I found all too predictable. For example, the filmmakers conspicuously place a robe in the bedroom of the two central characters and make it the main focus of the camera angles in several scenes, so that when it comes alive as the BBM, it's simply a yawning moment. In fact, the few times BBM was presented, I was appalled at the lack of creativity in trying to make him anything close to menacing. Makeup and costumes were extremely lacking, as if the filmmakers chose to chop those expenses to meet budget.The only injustice I can think of would be to make a sequel of this mess.",

            "content": "Low budget horror films like Get Out and Lights Out, have been successful both critically and financially. The Bye Bye Man however, has not quite garnered these accolades. What a shame. \"Bye\" (my latest review) may not be the pinnacle of epic fright or the echelon of monumental creep shows. Regardless, it's as good if not better than the two flicks just mentioned.Recently released on DVD and possibly too intense for a PG-13 rating, The Bye Bye Man is a consuming affair. You revert back and jog the ghastly events in your head just as the closing credits come up. Granted, it's no M. Night Shyamalan circa 1999 but heck, what is. This head-jogging notion is similar to the story of \"Bye\" and at the same time, it's also the opposite. The main characters in The Bye Bye Man aren't supposed to think about their ghostly villain (named The Bye Bye Man naturally) or say his name. They'll either die or become possessed with the intent of harming others.Three things to consider before viewing \"Bye\": Don't see this thing alone or in the dark (it's a clich\u00e9, I know). Also, try to realize that it's only a movie and that The Bye Bye Man is not in your reality-based vicinity. Finally, know that you'll never look at raincoats, falling coins, or train tracks the same way again. In terms of direction, well helmer Stacy Title carefully plots the film along. She builds scares to a slow creep, uses minimal gore, and adds decent cameos in the form of Carrie-Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway (where the heck has she been).In jest, \"Bye\" is gnawing psychological terror that only suffers from the occasional, layman acting and an abrupt ending that's barely the sum of its parts. Still, \"Bye\" steadily brings to life the dormant, urban legend of The Bye Bye Man himself (first in 1969 and now in present day). He's hideous, he'll make you hallucinate, and he will feed off of any cancerous attention. Starkly original and worth a look, The Bye Bye Man gets a \"hello\" and a three star rating from me.",

A creature, ghost, entity, whatever, is not defined; He is still a horrifying thing. The first half of the movie gets into it very quickly. We get a decent introduction to all the characters, and then right there everything just starts going down. As the movie progressed I was honestly very gripped by it and the overall feel of the movie was amazing. One of the coolest parts of the movie is how the Bye Bye Man not only affects the characters but the viewer in many ways. I was completely shocked by how well down this movie was honestly. it was a refreshing take on the idea of a boogeyman-type character. Yes this movie may be full of clich\u00e9s, but hey, that hasn't stopped some movies from becoming amazing. The clich\u00e9s actually, in my opinion, worked and helped the story line of the movie.I really recommend anyone who's a casual or big horror fan to watch this movie. Don't go into it thinking it's going to be some amazing Nightmare On Elm Street level horror movie. Go into it with a fresh mind and just experience it. You will not regret it.",

In the present day, several millennials move into this house, which is just off campus, and begin to experience mysterious events that freak them out. They too become aware of the existence of 'the Bye Bye Man', and learn if they even think or say his name, they will be inviting death upon themselves (gee, at least with the Candyman it was five times. And even then you had to look in a mirror...) The Bye Bye Man wasn't even the Say Hello Man, appearing out of nowhere in theatres in early January before saying 'bye bye'...almost immediately. And after watching this execrable dreck, it's not hard to see why. It's a January film all over, one to usher out without much fuss in the early part of the year while everyone's still recovering, that sadly invaded my eyes and my senses, even after it had been on DVD for a while. It's just a typical low rent effort, with slightly glossier production values and cover design, that made it to theatres while a tonne of similar Z grade trash was released straight to DVD.It starts quite intriguingly, however the promising opening fails to tie in coherently with what transpires on screen, which just descends into a load of meaningless guff. No connection is established between the man committing the murders in the house and the kids moving in, other than the whole 'saying or thinking the Bye Bye Man' thing, which they could have done anywhere. At no point is it ever scary or thrilling in any way, and at any rate, all of these youngsters are typically unlikeable, a load of SJW types, the sort who wear t-shirts of bands that were around before they were born (in this case, Joy Division...not even an American band!) and look like an everyday triviality would frighten them half to death, never mind a supernatural monster.I really don't think a horror franchise is going to be established with this one, unless it's an endless stream of straight to DVD non-events, which is really what this monstrosity should be defined as. *",

It's about this creature (or whatever it is, it's never explained) called The Bye Bye Man who plays with your mind when you think of him and gives you all kinds of hallucinations and makes you go crazy. That's why you mustn't even say his name so it doesn't spread.Now the main characters are, obviously, not very smart teens. The acting is one of the worst I've seen lately. Porn actors deliver Oscar-worthy acting compared to the actors in this movie. The lead actor was the only one who looked like he was trying and deliver some more emotion, but then in the second half he just goes full Nicolas Cage and it starts to feel like an overacting contest. At least it will give you plenty of unintended laughs, so if you're going into this movie just for that, you picked the right movie. Now, back to the beginning. The movie opens a bit clich\u00e9d, but actually pretty well done. The opening is surprisingly very atmospheric and intense. But then it all just goes worse, and worse, and worse. The premise is really not bad. This really could have been good. But the writers made zero effort in explaining the story and ignored the logic or sense. Also, they pretty much copied The Ring in some moments and seems like enough horror movies these days already do that.I hate seeing good ideas wasted on terrible movies, this is obviously one of those cases.

He said that it predicted that the Cheese State's Progressive LaFollett Strong-hold would give rise to horrible Fascist Monsters who would outlaw Unions in Wisconsin and bulldoze millions of America's Medicaid Poor into Mass Graves when they seized national power. Though he recalled that some in his audience were cart-wheeling down the aisles with laughter over such unbelievably Gloomy Prophecies about the Infamous Future in store for a pair of teenage boys then amusing themselves by setting cats on fire and pulling off dragonfly wings, and their Twisted Destiny to sign Pacts with Satan and wreak such Evil in the World, we kids weren't laughing.

As a fellow movie-goer yelled: \"Move that damn coat!\" Watch out for coins that drop at inopportune times, a laughably-bad CGI blood dog, and the Bye Bye Man himself, who might be a mute cousin of the Emperor Palpatine.What's the biggest enemy? It's a nightstand. The nightstand has the name what you should not think, nor say. Don't say it, don't think it, don't think it, and don't say it.

The problem is, The Bye Bye Man never quite develops itself nor does it explain a lot of avoidable mistakes. It's one of those films that is so painful to watch that you wonder, did they make it this bad on purpose? The film with the unfortunate name, is just as unfortunate plot- wise.After moving into an off-campus house with his best friend John (Lucien Laviscount) and girlfriend Sasha (Cressida Bonas), Elliot (Douglas Smith) finds bizarre writing on the inside of a drawer. Etched beneath the lining is \"The Bye Bye Man\". When Sasha expresses her concern that a presence may be in the house, they perform a seance with the help of her psychic friend. It is during the seance that Elliot speaks the entities name out loud, thus unleashing the curse among those who hear it.The supernatural creature quickly gets into their heads, making them see things that increase their paranoia, jealousy and fear. Possessing them in a way that encourages them to commit acts of murder. Which seems to be the only way of stopping others from saying The Bye Bye Man to anyone else.THOUHGTS One of the most prominent flaws with this film was apparent from the start. That is the very unassuming name for this terrifying monster, The Bye Bye Man. It's not frightening at all and it frankly is so ridiculous, it's hard to take the characters seriously when they're saying it with fear in their voice. The character is portrayed by the excellent Doug Jones (Hellboy, Crimson Peak), who is an amazing creature actor. So while his efforts could have potential to create a spooky demonic ghoul, the rest of the film completely ruins all hope.The plot of the film moves fairly quickly. A little too quickly. The characters are so self-aware in an instant. It makes you wonder if they only moved into this creepy old house so one of them could claim it's haunted. Which in itself makes no sense because the house itself is not haunted. It's only by saying \"The Bye Bye Man\" out loud that he gains any power, yet the characters experience a couple supernatural occurrences before anyone sees or mentions the name.Another thing that was so painful with this film was its inability to be serious. One of those rare films you see where you're confused if you're not in on the joke or not. The script is disastrous for a studio film. The amount of cheesy lines, or just set-ups that make no sense was something the entire audience seemed to not be able to get over. It's also very poorly acted, the actress portraying Sasha appeared to be in more of C- student film, rather than a film with a $7.4 million budget.It's hard to be so harsh to a film that tried to be original, but it's flaws were just so glaringly apparent that it's difficult to understand how anyone would give the okay. The very few jump scares this film had, were instantly negated by something ridiculous and comedic. It never quite found it's footing, which could entirely be blamed on a poor script and terribly set up scenes.Don't say it. Don't think it. Don't see this movie.",

            "content": "This one is certainly better than the 4.2 rating here at IMDb. Oddly, the immediate competition is Slender Man (2018) which only rated a 3.2, and I for one thought that the scarier movie. Slender Man had a more complicated story, and more complicated characters. That's not to say the The Bye Bye Man is sub-par. It's an excellent horror movie. Where Bye Bye differs it is because the myth spirit is not summoned as in Slender, but takes root thanks to an old creepy house being rented after many years of being empty by a trio of pals. It's very, very bad luck for the trio. Bye Bye is also like a couple of other movies I've seen, Grave Halloween (2013) and The Possession of Hannah Grace (2018), as well as Slender Man, in that the angered spirit aroused is so powerful that very early on you realise everyone is going to die and there is no stopping it. I like this new wave of horror, this wave of no stopping it. All four films mentioned handle this dimension really well, coming up with clever storylines, surprises and character traits that ensure we keep watching and enjoying it, even though we know the outcome. It's all done really well, and in all four cases good special effects really help, as well as overall excellence in filmmaking technique. The actors were very good, and the script believable. I docked Bye Bye a couple of points for the behaviour of the best friend, whom definitely knows what he is seeing is not real but choses to ignore it, or at least, the writers decree that he does. Some will say that's the power of The Bye Bye Man and I've got it backwards. For me though, it didn't make sense and coming near the end it was a bit of a let down. Other than that I really, really enjoyed this horror movie and hope others do too.",

He turns up at an aquatints house with a shotgun, with the main intention of killing those who know of the said name/film title. He repeats the same lines over & over. This is also the film's tagline too. \"Don't Think It. Don't Say It.\" Apparently it's said to keep \"The Bye Bye Man\" away! So, in the present day, a group of friends move into an old home & find a table night stand which has 2 coins inside, with the base of the drawer having the tagline wrote in a spiral fashion, so the main protagonist not only peels the base away to reveal the name of the film, but he says it later on while the group have a seance in the house. You know he & his friends are f*#ked as soon as he says \"The Bye Bye Man\"! They then throughout the rest of the film, try to find a way to defeat the said villain as the have dark twisted visions & hallucinations. I found the film to be above average. It wasn't really good but it wasn't really bad either, so I'd say it was above average considering the effects used & the twists in it. It was an interesting watch & had some sinister moments here & there! The film was an alright watch & I have seen worse horrors than this, but I have seen better also. But it wasn't a bad film to be fair & had some really great visuals, especially The Bye Bye Man himself who looked real sinister!It did lack a few things here & there like gore, but like this film as a whole, I didn't expect too much or expect it to be great or amazing. It was a decent & interesting watch.I would give this one a 6/10. It wasn't amazing, but it was decent enough for a watch & an alright film to start off 2017!",

This isn't necessarily praise, but overall I felt that it was a passable flick, a decent rental. Entertaining for sure, and not just to laugh at. The premise was interesting, and the basis of an idea itself being too terrible to fathom, and spread like death, was intriguing. There was one line, a bit of a monologue, by the main character, that was actually very good. Most of the acting was meh at best, and Carrie-Anne Moss was good but little more than a cameo. The \"scares\" had barely any substance, although I wouldn't say the movie wasn't without a creepy atmosphere.

The concept of the Bye Bye Man is pretty cool (Although I think it is similar to the Babadook). But they spend zero time with this character. They never explain the backstory of this character or his motivations. There is also a lot of train imagery that makes no sense at all. I believed that a portion of the movie is missing from the film.Anywho, don't watch this film. Don't even watch it to have a good time.

            "content": "Negative impulses can be a real challenge to control, while controlling negative thoughts can seem impossible \u2013 a very unnerving prospect. The simple act of trying not to think about something probably means that you are still thinking about it \u2013 or that the undesirable thought is lurking just beneath the surface of your conscious focus. That's what makes the premise of the supernatural horror thriller \"The Bye Bye Man\" (PG-13, 1:36) interesting. If an evil entity will appear or gain control of your perceptions of the real world, and your will, if you merely think his name, then you're probably fighting a losing battle. And you can't even warn others about the danger because saying his name is just as bad as thinking it.In an otherwise quiet suburban neighborhood on a sunny day in 1969, a man continuously repeats the words \"Don't think it. Don't say it,\" as he retrieves a shotgun from the trunk of his car. He proceeds to shoot several family members and neighbors in order to \"save\" them from an unseen entity known as \"The Bye Bye Man\". The ordinary-looking gunman feels that he has to eliminate those who have learned the name or spoken it to anyone else. After his bloody rampage, he then puts himself out of his misery.Jump to the present day in that same neighborhood. Three college students, boyfriend-girlfriend Elliot (Douglas Smith) and Sasha (Cressida Bonas), and their mutual friend, John (Lucien Laviscount), move into an old, rundown house that they have rented off campus. As they move the furniture which comes with the house up from the basement, they fail to notice that inside the drawer of a small end table, someone has written \"Don't think it. Don't say it,\" in concentric circles. The students do notice that a coin keeps falling to the floor and spinning and that the house is always cold. This leads Elliot to go do some research at the library where a helpful librarian (Cleo King) helps unravel the house's forgotten past. The students also ask a \"spiritual sensitive\" friend named Kim (Jenna Kanell) to conduct a s\u00e9ance.The process of learning about this mysterious \"Bye Bye Man\" results in his name being thought about and spoken out loud, which makes him appear \u2013 and allows him access to the minds of those who know his name. The Bye Bye Man is a gaunt and ghostly man dressed like the grim reaper (and played by Doug Jones) and is accompanied by a ghastly hellhound. When inside the heads of his victims, he makes them see things that aren't there, prompting them to do things they weren't normally do\u0085 with horrifying results. A police detective (Carrie-Anne Moss) becomes involved when things get out of hand, but it's nearly impossible for her to be of any help when those who know what is going on can't tell her about it.Unfortunately, \"The Bye Bye Man\" fails to live up to the potential of its original and frightening premise, the whole thing seeming random and inconsequential. This movie is based on one chapter of Robert Damon Schneck's non-fiction book \"The President's Vampire\" and is supposedly a true story. With that kind of background, screenwriter Jonathan Penner should've been able to set up the plot more effectively \u2013 and written action and dialog that makes sense. And director Stacy Title should've been able to make the movie scarier. And the acting could've been a lot better. And if someone suggests that you come along to see this film, just repeat the main character's name back to them and walk away. \"D\"",

January at the movies; when theaters exude the hangover of Christmas leftovers, Oscar hopefuls and a small number of vacuous lackadaisical new releases that weren't good enough to get a release in the other 11 months on the calendar. This has become the spawning ground for your average negligible PG-13 horror movie, the kind of lazy nonsense guaranteed to play an empty theater. The burnt offering for 2017: The Bye Bye Man, a movie so forgettable that large chunks of the film have already left my brain as I struggle to write this review.The movie is too uninteresting to be terrible, yet so unoriginal as to be almost cute. It has a plot that feels like a patchwork quilt, sewn together from the pieces and parts of other horror movies and, worse, a PG-13 rating that is so in force here that when a person is shot with a shotgun, there is no blood. What blood exists in rest of the film is dyed black for no reason. Added to that, the movie's sole sex scene is edited so badly that we can only deduce that sexual congress is in session because we hear a second or two of moaning. Who was this movie made for? Throughout the movie I got the feeling that maybe I accidentally got a television edit. Surely not one would intentionally make a movie this choppy and nonsensical. I have too much faith in mankind.Not that you give a rat's ass, but there's a plot in place here. It opens with a flashback scene to 1969 wherein a panicky man runs around his neighborhood asking neighbors if they've said a particular name out loud. When they confess that they have, he produces a shotgun and goes on a rampage.Cut to the present day wherein in we meet three uninteresting college students, Elliot (Doug Smith), Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and John (Lucien Laviscount) who are moving off-campus to rent a house so spacious that their parents must be shelling out wads of cash to provide. The kids can barely get in the door when weird things begin to happen. Sasha develops an alarming cough; Elliot finds money that seems to disappear and reappear; and John finds a nightstand with the words \"Don't Say It. Don't Think It\" scribbled inside the drawer. The trio begins seeing things, such as a bizarre cloak in the corner of the bedroom that could easily have been shoved in the closet or thrown away but is, instead, left around because, hey, this movie has to have its fake-out. Right?Standard to the formula Elliot does some research in the library, but he does it via the weakest search engine in the history of mankind. Seriously, when he types in \"Bye Bye Man\" he gets 0 results. How many times have you gotten 0 results for anything on search engine. Even more quizzical is that when he types \"Don't Say It. Don't Think It\" he gets 1 result. What search engine is this?Anyway, he unearths the information that if you say the words \"Bye Bye Man\" it will summon a demon that will alter your perception of the world around you. It's one of those things where you're so scared by the illusion that you end up doing something tragic in real life. Yeah, it's that old dodge.Late in the film The Bye Bye Man does show up. He's a tall, zombie-like being with bone white skin and long fingers. What he does when he corners his victims is a real head scratcher. Apparently, his MO is to walk up to this intended victim and . . . wiggle his finger in their face. Trust me, it makes even less sense when you're watching it. And of course, the major question mark about The Bye Bye Man is that he's played by Doug Jones of Pan Labyrinth and Hellboy and the mother ghost in Crimson Peak. What is he doing in this movie? Heck, what am I doing in this movie?I never knew 98 minutes could feel like an eternity. The movie has a trajectory and it goes there via a lazy screenplay that is hammered together with the bare minimum of effort. But its harmless. PG-13 harmless. \"Goosebump\" harmless. I won't be able to bring myself to put it on the list of the worst films of the year next January. It would be like kicking a puppy.",

The Bye Bye Man is a horrible supernatural horror film that has a direction that's not sure if its trying to make the audience laugh or scared. It has some dull acting, boring direction, and the scares are nonetheless not there. Bye Bye Man has that folk title of a fiction character that once the name is said, he will come with his demonic hound and the people involved would be delusional, see things, makes them want to hurt each other as their weakness is revealed and even kill each other. The plot follows Elliot (Douglas Smith) and his girlfriend Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and friend John (Lucien Laviscount) moving into a house together. They find some old furniture in a basement. And a night stand that constantly drops coins. Once they find a carving of a title The Bye Bye Man inside the drawer and accidentally saying it. Elliot, Sasha, and John will have to do whatever it takes to beat this supernatural force. They have to follow the one rule, of don't think it, don't say it. This film feels like a shadowed version with horror ionic characters like Candyman, Boogeyman, etc. I am sure there are better horror movies that will provide scares than this. This film does lack scares, thrills, and its not even exciting. From the opening moments, of 1960's seeing a man yelling out loud \"don't think it, don't say it.\" And killing people. I love how characters are written to be as dumb as they just stand right in front of the threat as it happens. It gets worse, and more annoying especially when the tagline of don't say it is mentioned quite a lot. Not sure, if its either terrible acting or just cheesy to see on screen. Lets talk about the acting. The acting was horrible and every character is written as one- dimensional. The actors definitely looked like they are reading straight from the script without even building their characters. Elliot may seem like the reasonable caring character, which loves his girlfriend and friend and his brother and niece. Especially, when his brother and niece come by their house a lot. Even at midnight, when Elliot is trying to keep his family away from the bye bye man being noticed by them. One main issue I had was who takes a little girl out to visit their uncle after midnight. Seems kind of late for visiting. Also, I feel like Carrie-Anne Moss talent is wasted here, as she plays a detective trying to figure out these strange webs of murders. She comes and goes on screen. The Bye Bye Man may seem like a creepy character that stands in the shadows in a dark room. But its nothing scary about the guy besides making everyone around him go mad. Besides the movie having a boring direction that does not provide scares and just a bunch young adults trying to survive against this evil figure. Overall, The Bye Bye Man is horrible. Terrible acting, no scares or thrills, and a boring direction. I do not recommend unless you're really bored.",

Unfortunately it becomes glaringly obvious who the veteran actors are because the detective and big brother really shine despite the small screen time they were given. Other than them all the other side characters deliver their lines pretty badly imo (especially the librarian). And the actress who plays the girlfriend is glaringly bad. I was also a bit confused by the scene where she goes to talk to the owner of their rented house and asks about the night stand that started it all because they make you think it would go somewhere but it doesn't and never gets brought up again. The entire scene could've been deleted from the movie and it wouldn't change it one bit. The upside though is that you do get to enjoy a really awkward exchange between her and the house owner, a close up of her wooden facial expression as she delivers her lines and her hilariously bad fake sneeze. She literally says \"achoo!\"Overall if you don't take this movie seriously then it can actually be quite funny and I think that is its saving grace.

TBBM bravely explores insanity, discovering that nobody ever suddenly commits evil deeds on a whim or due to being intrinsically evil but is driven to those heinous acts by a bored boogeyman who has nothing better to bloody do than have people kill each other. Don't those silly demons have a life? (Well, no, they're dead...) No proper hobbies? (Isn't killing random people a valid, \"proper\" hobby? An interesting philosophical question.) All they seem to know how to do is harass humans, trapping them into inescapable curse vortices that lead to blood devastation horror and scream bloody gore.Insanity doesn't exist, at least not the natural, genetic variety. We know that now. (Shrinks will be out of jobs. Finally!) The movie told us. So through this fact alone TBBM is a classic that transcends cinema, actually overlapping into great scientific hence by default also historic significance.In other words, Ellen Degeneres and Barbra Streisand aren't truly insane. They just said the name \"Bye Bye Man\" (and what a dumb name it is) one too many times - which means at least once, because once it all it takes to go cuckoo.Speaking of kooky celebrities, right after I finished the movie I googled \"insane celebrities\" (for the review you're reading right now), and the first result I got is a list of 25 crazy celebs. Guess who starts off the list?Faye Dunaway. I kid you not. Google what I googled and you'll find out I'm not lying.Faye Dunaway. She is in this movie. Talk about weird. Hell, this kind of absurd coincidence can't be explained by science! I must be mad! The Bye Bye Man has cursed me for daring to type his name on my laptop! Sure, his rule clearly says \"don't write it\" i.e. it never said \"don't type it\" but I guess The BB Man isn't a stickler for detail and for rigidly obeying rules - even his own bloody rules. (Typical sociopath.)Faye is an awful actress. But just as it's not her fault that she's crazy (it's BB Man's doing), it's also not her fault she can't act anymore. It's her plastic surgeons. They did such a number on her that she isn't capable of showing emotions anymore - any emotions. This kind of cheapens the film (further), because she makes an appearance just as things are really heating up plot-wise. Douglas Smith goes to her house to talk to her as the mass-murderer's widow, but there he finds Faye, not looking like a widow so much as looking like a duck beak was slapped on her with permo-glue. (She can only play Howard the Duck's widow now, but (un)fortunately that franchise snuffed it a while ago.) The same glue by the way that the casting director is a fan of, especially before making the final decision as to who should play various widows in boogeyman-based horror films. If he likes ducks so much he should direct Disney cartoons instead.The blonde love-interest looks hundred times better than Faye but acting-wise she isn't that much better. She is in real life Prince Harry's ex. He must have married the wrong actress because this one might not have cut off his ties from the golden goose, the way his current wife has. Oh well, Princess Diana was no Einstein either... Inbred blood is thicker than inbred water.Anyway... this actress is some sort of British royalty, just like silly ginger Harry, hence why she is a model, actress... The usual elitist nepotism that Hollywood loves to practice - while pretending to be equal-opportunity working-class communists. Remind me again how many working-class people get to work in Hollywood? Except as carpenters I mean.But the movie's biggest flaw, by far, isn't the cast, not even the overall clumsiness in the dialog and some rather silly situations. It's the lopsided battle between good and evil, the biggest disease of modern horror. Bye Bye Man (I feel damn silly writing his name, I feel more cringe than fear, to be honest) is so utterly powerful, literally like a god, whereas the students are so hopelessly powerless and overwhelmed, unable to perform any magic tricks whatsoever, so that it's pretty obvious from the get-go that they have zero chance in winning this war. In fact, between the three of them they didn't even win a single battle against the boogeyman. Modern horror films are so drenched in nihilism i.e. hip pessimism/cynicism that almost 90% of them have \"downer endings\". This by now almost traditionalist zeal for ending films this way has lead to a level of predictability that's never existed in cinema before. Why would you expect a viewer to get involved in the protagonists' struggle if the struggle is doomed to failure nearly every time? This is one of the several key reasons why horror fans are getting increasingly bored with American horror films. Start giving the heroes a fighting chance and the audiences might be complaining less of being bored.Towards the end, when BB Man approaches Douglas Smith (1:25:30), I had a stark sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu with heavy doses of \"Star Wars\": Douglas Smith resembles Hayden Christensen and the boogeyman is a dead ringer for a Sith lord. It was a bizarre moment. Though not nearly as bizarre as the illogical behavior of Douglas's brother and his daughter in the final scenes. Or the fact that this young girl was brought along to a student party, around the beginning of the film, even allowed to roam unsupervised. What was that all about? Was she offered beer-bongs then?",

            "content": "Don't say it; don't think it \u2013 a piece of advice uttered and repeated ad nauseum by the year's newest batch of disposable teens in this year's newest disposable horror; The Bye Bye Man. Question: If I repeat the words \"don't think it, don't say it\" as if it were a mantra, aren't I still thinking about it? I, mean anyone who's been through a terrible breakup will probably tell you when you say \"don't think about it,\" your mind automatically wonders back to one who broke your heart. Also, are the people cursed by this year's newest disposable apparition aware that \"bye-bye, man,\" is a fairly common turn of phrase? So does that mean everyone who says that at any point in their life is affected by the curse or only after they've discovered it exists? The Bye Bye Man is the name of this year's newest disposable horror film apparition. He appears when you say his name, his influence spreads with every utterance and he can be challenged once you've become wise to his game. So he's basically a hybrid of Freddy Krueger, the Candyman and the \"It\" in It Follows (2014) only with a look and feel stolen from a Lab Rats music video. Truth be told, the setup does have possibilities. A minor character refers to him as a reaper so perhaps something salient could have been said about the specter of death and how it can warp our behavior. Or perhaps The Bye Bye Man could be a parable of forgotten history. Another minor character makes the point that once you bury the story, \"It's like it never existed.\" The movie could have been an exploration of mass hysteria, a project exploring groupthink, exploring mental illness, exploring the never-ending march of time\u0085It could have explored a lot of things is what I'm saying.But no The Bye Bye Man is essentially about a group of university students who stumble onto a haunted nightstand and barely grasp its implications. We get our macho jock (Laviscount), our pretty and popular female lead (Bonas), our creepy outcast (Kanell) and our pale-faced protagonist (Smith) who fights his fate while wearing band t-shirts that are far too old for him. Veteran actresses Carrie-Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway also make appearances in contrived, unnecessary scenes that are there to point out the filmmakers didn't properly utilize their shooting schedule. Thus we're pretty much stuck with our fresh-faced meat-sacks for the duration of this film.And while we're stuck with them, our group of heroes seems to be hopelessly stuck in a plot that is actively working against them. They start the obligatory parade of clich\u00e9s by having a housewarming s\u00e9ance. They then immediately fall into false frights, unexplained phenomena, and a second act investigation requiring one or more of them to rummage through library records. All the while, any chance to flesh out our characters is eschewed in favor of everyone yelling \"who did you tell!\" The only time we're offered a respite from the painfully expected and familiar is when we get heavily edited flashback scenes of the Bye Bye Man tormenting a reporter (Whannell) who got a little too nosy for his own good. These scenes approach the quality of mediocre dinner theater.At one point early in the film, Elliot yells from the other room \"Let's watch something stupid,\" to his girlfriend who is distracted by haunting noise. We then cut to them sleeping. That in a nutshell is The Bye Bye Man. It's a lazy, boring and predictable movie that at times feels edited beyond comprehension.

You can't stop yourself thinking of something, 'Inception' taught us this! Regardless, this was utter rubbish.

Just one or two jump scares and some kids rapidly going insane shouting \"Don't say it! Don't think it!\". The characters had as much development as the antagonist's name (hint: none) and the acting was truly awful, particularly Bonas. It was borderline TV movie standard. The \"scares\" were just loud noises or plastic stunt dolls unexpectedly getting demolished by an oncoming vehicle, that's it. They even CGI'd his skinless hell hound, badly may I just say.

He defies the laws of physics, drives his victims mad, and has been spotted in old photographs, observing ominously. To make a long story short: Doug Jones reprises his role as Slender Man (Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story) albeit with a far sillier name and an actual face to show. I wish I could say that that's the only film The Bye Bye Man derives ideas from, without any aspiration to subvert or freshen them up, but here we are.On top of its cookie-cutter script and remedial horror film tactics (Do I even need to say the word \"jump scare\"?), the film offers porno-level performances and characters that explain to each other who they are in a manner that's, well, whatever the antonym of the word \"seamless\" is. We mainly follow a trio of youngsters (Douglas Smith, Lucien Laviscount and Cressida Bones) who stumble upon the origins of an evil entity known as The Bye Bye Man after one of them develops an inexplicable cough and weird scribblings are found. Again, totally not a Slender Man movie.What we (and the protagonists) soon learn is that The Bye Bye Man has influenced the evil of mankind for several decades, as there are several documented cases where teenagers have committed mass murders and left notes behind reading \"The Bye Bye Man made me do it\". Even though we finally have an explanation for all the shootings and hate crimes that have taken place in recent memory, provided I've understood the premise of this film correctly, I am also to understand that The Bye Bye Man has only existed since the 1960's. So I guess he wasn't around during The Holocaust or the Dark Ages and cannot be blamed for all of the world's horrors. Just a couple.Also in on the fun are Carrie-Anne Moss as a generic hard-ass cop (who is astoundingly quick to buy into the main characters' \"It wasn't me, it was the tall ghost dude\" routine) and Faye Dunaway as Cameo #2. At least these two are watchable, which is more than I can say for some of the lesser-known actors. I can recommend watching Jeremy Jahns' review of this film (even as I've come to regard him as more of a \"dude who loves movies\" than an educated critic like Mike Stoklasa or Adam Johnston), in which he includes an anecdote about how he watched it at a special screening hosted by the cast and crew, and how the viewers would laugh whenever Cressida Bones said or did anything - whilst she was most likely in the theatre with them, mind you. Ouch.In other areas, the film is similarly amateurish, to the point where I must question if it truly belongs on the big screen and not on the same hard drive as some of the embarrassing student films I made in 2013 before I became (relatively) more careful with what I upload to YouTube. I suppose it technically has better sound, visual effects and editing than that, but the cinematography and writing are pretty down there.Still, the film could have worked in the hands of someone else, or perhaps even these same people if the budget wasn't so low. I liked the shot where Doug Jones' character appears as a silent silhouette in the main character's bedroom (even if a mandatory pop scare kills its effect) and I'd love to see the repulsive hound that occasionally turns up, done with better CGI.",

Hurting people he loves, and perhaps, more likely, hurting himself.This will be familiar to anyone who has ever known someone who suffers from mental illness. Wilson's portrayal is close to heartbreaking.I was surprised that \"The Bye Bye Man\" never opens the door to that kind of ambiguity, never suggesting that the spectres within it could be evidence of a fractured mind, and not supernatural in origin.What we have here, nevertheless, is a superior horror movie with a stand-out performance in the lead.

Legend of the Bye Bye Man goes that if you say his name or even hear it, then you are his next target. The reporter is next and then the college kids. What happens when you are BBM's target? You kill anyone that has said or heard the name and then you kill yourself. The Bye Bye Man does not actually do anything! All he does is make people see things that are not there! He doesn't physically do anything! Douglas, Cressida and Lucien are the college kids and Doug is the Bye Bye Man. Oh yeah, people keep repeating the phrase, 'Don't say it! Don't think it!' a lot.

And after finding out that this was supposedly based on a chapter from a book about urban legends, and reading the legend, I really, really wish the movie makers had gone into more details about everything!Instead, there were just some references and appearances about possible connections to something more interesting, while we watched three people's insecurities about relationships get the better of them.Questions that I wanted answered in the movie:-- What was the deal with the train?\n-- What was the deal with the clutter around the train track?\n-- Where did all this begin?\n-- Why didn't he burn the end table instead of just tossing it into the woods?\n-- What was the dog? WAS it a dog?\n-- Was it all in their heads? Or was the Man real?\n-- Why does his name make people go nuts and kill their loved ones and themselves?\n-- What was the deal with the coins? Why couldn't they stay on solid surfaces like desks and in drawers, but didn't fall through floors?\n-- Why was Trinity in this? Why was Faye Dunaway??On and on and on.There was a really, really cool story that could have been explored here, and I'm very disappointed that it wasn't. :/",

For starters, the evil force in this particular movie hardly makes any appearances, believe it or not. Most of the horror instead comes from the various characters having hallucinations. While I guess this could have been a successful approach, it doesn't work here. After the opening scene depicting a (small scale) rampage in the past, the movie for the next fifty or so minutes can't come up with anything that is all that terrifying, at least if you don't count the second flashback that happens. The so-called scary stuff that happens in this first (slow) half of the movie is just people having mild hallucination - hardly terrifying, if you ask me. Although the second half of the movie does start to try and deliver the goods (it really pushes its PG-13 rating, by the way), it's still not all that involving, one reason being that there is no real explanation as to how The Bye Bye Man originated and why he does what he does. In the end, the movie is simply unsatisfying in any angle you can think of. Let's hope this franchise wannabe doesn't spawn any sequels.",

With help from the only survivor of the massacre (Faye Dunaway), Elliot sets out to stop Bye Bye.Badly acted in both eras by actors who don't deserve the title, this inept adaptation of an obscure work of crypto-fiction is amateurish at best - the villain is derivative and the scares are nonexistent.

This Bye Bye man was not fully developed. His presence wasn't very strong which made the plot a bit loose and ill formed. The movie was really safe, no real climax, no real solution. The plot nor the characters evolved. A lot more could have been done with the characters. The emphasis of this movie was on The Bye Bye man but seemed to focus more on the main character Elliot's struggle to beat this thing who had little screen presence.The actors were all great.For a horror movie there weren't any scary scenes that i could think of and the cgi hound really ticked me off. It wasnt realistic at all and made The Bye Bye man a bit laughable . I'm sure they could have created a more realistic hound.I will say the concept of this dark, powerful, supernatural power causing people to murder is a great idea and feels relevant to the nonsensical murder suicides that we see today.",

It's basically saying our intention is to scare you, but we are going to handicap ourselves in the process and likely fail for this reason. And shock horror, 'The Bye Bye Man' is one of the tamest horror movies out there. Not only is the action that does occur either very bland or happens off-screen, even then there's barely any of it. About 45 minutes into the film I was asking myself why exactly I was supposed to be a afraid of this creature considering it hasn't actually done anything yet (other than confuse a few teenagers about what they were actually seeing).Every flaw that modern horror movies tend to have is evident in some respect in this film. The characters are completely generic, unlikeable and unrelatable. The frights (though to be fair there were very few of them) are simply jump-scares which often have little to do with the story at hand. The biggest annoyance for me though was the implausibility. Now to be fair, very few horror movies don't have any implausibility, it's kind of a given. But when your story is as far-fetched and contrived as it is in the 'The Bye Bye Man', you have to wonder what the point is. How anyone could be made to feel uneasy about a subject as completely illogical as this I will never know.There's really not a lot of good things to say about this film. It achieves in absolutely no area. The fact that this film made it to cinemas is beyond me. Even with today's incredibly low standards of horror movies, 'The Bye Bye Man' is terrible.",

It's a horror film so I would expect all the ills of society to come out and play, unfortunately the film tires quickly leaving me wanting much much more. The main characters are not fully defined and have the personality of warped wallpaper; granted they summon this evil spirit that resembles the grim reaper from Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, twenty minutes later.

I'm not a fan of when the monster/demon/ghost etc are revealed fully right off the bat. You had to pay attention and actually what is happening to the characters and why. I can kind of understand a bad review if you prefer everything just be laid out for you. I like the ones where you have to wonder a little. It wasn't painfully predictable either. I mean, as far as horror movies go, people lost their minds over the Paranormal Activity movies (which honestly still blows my mind). But this is the kind of movie i feel would do well with a sequel.

The friends must try to save each other, all the while keeping The Bye Bye Man's existence a secret to save others from the same deadly fate.Plus Points:1)First 10 minutes: The movie started interestingly with a person going on a killing spree those who know some mysterious name.It raised hopes on film.Minus Points:1)No scary scenes,Terrible Screenplay and Flawed Direction: Still I couldn't know the reason how this movie got a theatrical release.Director Stacy Title failed in every aspect of making a horror film.There is not even a single scary scene even when they tried lot of jump scares.Mystery element is dragged beyond the limit and that too shown in a pathetic way.The movie is terribly staged and poorly edited. Literally, scenes don't match up, with action being cut off and having nothing in common with the next sequence. It's odd.It's mainly run-of-the-mill jump scares and predictable haunted-house shtick that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre.Its a common act that we make fun on horror films while watching with friends but while watching The Bye Bye Man,I made fun remarks even watching it alone.So,The Bye Bye Man is a terrible horror film with literally no jump scares,pathetic screenplay and flawed direction.One of the Worst films of all timeAs referred in film, Don't Think It Don't Say it....I would add Don't watch it too..My rating 3.5/10",

            "content": "The Bye Bye Man, once supposed to come in September of 2016; There's a reason it's been once pushed to December, and now to January. The Bye Bye Man lingers so heavily to the point of where many of it's elements make it simply fall apart.We pretty much follow the story of Elliot, Sasha, and John, three college students who rent a home for themselves, only to be provoked by The Bye Bye man, after the past comes to haunt them, as part of the house they've rented. First off, really, if you're looking for a horror film that breaks down the whole origin of this entity, by no means will you get it. The Bye Bye Man / entities' origin, and reasoning behind all of the events it causes is truly never explained in the film, honestly coming off as an unexplained collection of scares, and movie fillings toward the characters. Throughout this entire movie, the characters all constantly get into ordeals with the entity, only giving the audience more of a want / wonderment toward the entity himself, only to be let down when the whole situation of the entity is never explained; The entire movie centers around this Bye Bye Man, and in the end, he, nor his doings and origins is never explained, and left out completely. Throughout the film, we get the characters figuring out pieces to the entities' puzzle, honestly the typical, and clich\u00e9 \"Old / dead document that can't be found anywhere else until now\" gimmick seen in many, many other horror films. The characters all search, and find ways to stop temporarily, and prevent shortly the entity from provoking them, but really that's just about it. Time, after time until another character just randomly dies from this entity, these characters are all running around solving pieces of this entity, for what seems to be fill time; Absolutely no reasoning, really. Overall, really just a ton of, in the end, pointless doings toward an entity the film is entirely revolved around, yet overall never explains, nor goes in depth with such entity / entities to even begin with, rendering pointless, truly. Continuing, the acting in this movie was honestly a split. The character of Sasha honestly didn't fully live up to emotional showings, overall at a good chunk of lines sounding flat, and not truly in the zone of what specific scenes called for, the actor of Elliot, and John, surprisingly, however pulled a solid job with such emotions, and overall acting toward their situations. Moving even further, the films' displaying of events. There were parts where a character gets shot, or injured, and that character would sit, and absolutely no blood would be shown. There would be parts too reliant on CGI, coming off cheap looking, and blatantly fake, and out of place looking, for example a scare tactic that looked so out of proportion, it left a good amount of the audience in complete confusion. And as said before, there'd be happenings where the audience has no idea what to make of due to a major lack of information on the entity, example being his doings, and actions toward the characters.In conclusion, this films' plot, story-line, and in-depth execution was extremely flat, and extremely incoherent when given deep thought. The Bye Bye man, and other entities that built this films' hype up was shown, but no background prevailed, and overall would seem as if these entities were just thrown in for scare tactics, and story fillings. The story executed in a clich\u00e9, and overly done matter that didn't differentiate itself from what's been done before, the characters, for the most part did pointless actions that amounted to nothing story / plot changing with the exception of some scenes; Which is one of the very few things that can be said. And overall the CGI, and some shots shown looked quite off, and questionable that lead to an audience- wide reaction. To wrap things up, there's a reason, again this was pushed quite a few times. The Bye Bye Man, overall had extremely low redeeming qualities such as a twist or two, but overall amounted to nothing, quite literally, and even more so executed some of the most pointless actions that lead to, once again, nothing. I'd recommend seeing this when it's out of the theaters, The Bye Bye Man wasn't worth the push back wait, overall, and was a disappointing start to horrors' 2017.",

There's a reason for the killer to be so crazy. Not here. We're told of a guy that killed a bunch of people for speaking the name of this entity. That's it. That's all the backstory we get. Well, not exactly. There's a librarian who later on is only there to provide exposition. In a less clunky movie they would have found a better way to provide this to the audience. A bunch of college students move into this house because it's close to campus, it's cheap and they want to live together. They find an old nightstand and in the drawer is written over and over again the lines don't think of it, don't speak of it over and over again. Ripping that paper away we see the title carved into the drawer. It had to be because otherwise there literally would be no story.And once the name is spoken weird things start to happen and that's basically the movie from then on. It's not coherent as to what is happening, it's just stuff. The man that killed the people at the beginning is just there with no real connection to the supernatural killer. At no point is this scary or thrilling or anything other than you want these kids to die because they're so annoying. This is one of the best examples of a January movie. It came out after the holidays. It's dumped into theaters because they need to show something. It's a PG-13 movie to get all the kids to go see it. And it's just something to be avoided.",

Easy to follow the characters and the story. Though from the beginning itself, it was very intentional. A decent cast and the filmmaking. It could be scary for some viewers, but I found a little edgy and well paced narration. But sadly it did not miss any of the usual horror flick formula. One of the most overused, not just in this film, but any horror films is that those film character interviewing the one of the survivours from the past.

I am not big fan of horror movies but, after watching this i Can there are lots of dark elements like the hound, Bye bye man itself mystery and almost everything.. I definitely want a part II. I don't know why people hated it but, this movie is pure gem with great acting and story line. Love to see what will happened next. I think after james wan I can proudly say this director is next BIG THING. wow, Just watch it think some stupid rating can bring this movie down because it awesome..

I enjoyed it!!!If you like the older horror genre of Jeepers Creepers, the Ring, The Grudge, Hush, 6th Sense etc - you will enjoy this flick. I appreciated the fact that there wasn't over the top partying, random sex and drugs. Something that is PG clean but rated PG13 for the scare thrills. Oh!

There a lot of problems with this film, but I'll point out the worst in my opinion:1. It actually starts pretty good and creepy. Gave me a good first impression and my expectations rose, but then the leads enter, and the first thing that hits you are extremely hollow and stereotypical characters. The female lead is really bad and awkward to watch, and the lead guy's friend is just a caricature. The lead guy is fine, but sadly, Carrie-ann Moss is sadly just a cameo. I really wish she and Douglas Smith would be the leads, which would be far more interesting.2. The plot is all over the place. It seems like they had a good idea to begin with, but completely lost its way during production. There's no real explanation of anything, and it just makes everything pretty dumb. When you're glad leading characters are dying to stop watching them act \u2013 it's really bad.3. Clish\u00e8s after clish\u00e8s.... Seen it all before. The trailer was much better than the movie itself. 4. Bad special effects. There is a computer generated hell's hound in this, and it looks like something out of an old playstation game.

            "content": "This movie came to me, recommended by IMDB, in their \"Movies like this\" section, as well as I'd seen it on another site as being highly rated. So, I looked it up, found it on Netflix!!\u2714 I then I pulled it up on IMDB and saw it had a great cast!! \u2714 You have an up and coming actor who looks like a young Shemar Moore(be still your hearts ladies!), Carrie-Anne Moss, Faye Dunaway, & one of my ALL - TIME FAVORITE actors, Mr Doug Jones!!! Doug has been in SO MANY movies, like Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth, but many people don't realize it's even him, because he's Hollywood's Master of Disguise!!! Add in Douglas Smith, who was in Percy Jackson, a favorite of my son& mine, and you have a recipe for a great movie!However, somebody didn't follow the recipe right, and burnt the cake! The Bye Bye Man is - to put it simply -a rip- off of every horror movie with a baddie that shows up when you awaken him and he comes after you either when you're sleeping or when you speak his name or something of the nature. The babadook, Nightmare on Elm Street, and there's a lot more I could name they've all been ripped off to make this movie. There's a lot of movies exactly like this going around right now. The only unique thing that I can see is that the bye bye man had a dog creature, and confoundingly enough, there's something to do with 2 gold coins which aren't really gold coins when you look at them they're silver, but apparently when they show up so does he. I say confoundingly enough because there's no real explanation in fact for pretty much everything in the movie there's not a whole lot of explanation! There's no back story as to who the bye-bye man is, where he came from, why he's doing what he's doing, why people feel that they have to kill everyone who knows his name or his heard it, it's just very bizarre! Now I'm not saying it's a bad movie, there's just so many frayed Ends sticking out there is that it's frustrating when a movie is a rip-off to begin with, but to not have any explanation as to the things that are going on, it makes for a really rough watching. Quite honestly I kept checking the time to see how much more I had to sit through, several times I considered just quitting, and that's not good. A movie should be entertaining and you shouldn't have to wonder how much longer you had to sit through a movie!Now my positives and negatives. Positives would be there's a great cast, I think they did a real wonderful job of picking who they did and the whole group was quite believable! I would have liked to have seen more out of Doug Jones, I don't think he in particular had enough time on the screen, but he sure was terrifying! That's why he always does best! The camera work was good, no complaints there! The outside of the house was quite beautiful and the yard was scenic and absolutely the kind of place I would want to live! Now to the negatives. I was trying to force myself to come up with positives cuz there's just so many negatives. And this is going to be hard to try not to give things away cuz I don't want to have to say their spoilers here. The script was just awful. It was a total rip-off of the genre, could they not come up with something more unique? At the very least put some unique spin on it so it's the same genre but in a way that no one's ever seen it before? I think the writers ought to be flogged! The house was just unbelievable. It was beautiful outside, but inside it was a disaster! It had the same wallpaper from the 70s? Things were falling apart and in extreme disrepair? It just didn't match it made no sense! Plus, from the outside you could see a bunch more rooms then when you're showing the inside, there aren't as many rooms as there should be by looking at the windows from the outside! So somebody did an oopsie! Some of the plots smaller side plots we're ridiculous too, like the librarian going home and killing her children, why would she do that? She didn't have to tell her children the name, and I don't understand this whole thing of If someone knows the name you have to kill them. Why? Why do you have to kill them? I can understand the desire to kill yourself, but why do you have to kill someone else? Again another proof of this whole plot being absolutely ridiculous! I think someone just wanted to throw together and move you real quick to try to make a bunch of money. It fell flat on its face. This movie is a stinker! That's why I only got three stars! And out of those three stars, all three of them are only there because of Doug Jones! I would give this movie a0 if it weren't for him!Now I'm not saying don't watch the movie, because I honestly think that some people might enjoy it, and if you don't try to think, and just watch it and go on with your life, maybe you'll get some kind of enjoyment out of it that's up to you not me but to me it was pretty awful because I had to force myself to watch it.

But then I started wondering what happened to scenes--it cuts from the middle of a fight to people in bed like they left the rest of the fight on the editing room floor. I became gradually more aware of the bad acting, and not long after that, it sunk in that the writing was pretty awful too. From there, it became laughable: lingering shots on unimportant things, undetectable character motivation, truly terrible dialogue, and a villian that just wasn't frightening. And let's not forget, one tiny section of wallpaper comes alive and growls even though there's no character there to observe it, as if the audience will feel menaced be a wallpaper dog. Seriously.

In the present day, Elliot, his girlfriend Sasha, and his friend John move into a house off campus. Kim leads them in a seance where she goes into a trance repeatedly telling them, \"Don't say it. Don't think it.\" It's the Bye Bye Man. Detective Shaw (Carrie-Anne Moss) investigates with the bodies piling up.The idea that the boogeyman exists only due to the stories that we pass on to each other is an intriguing one. It's an idea filled with great possibilities. Sadly, the execution is poor and any potential is squandered. The start with the flashback is fine although it could use more tension. It may work better to start with a victim's point of view. It's generally fine. The first real problem comes with Elliot. He's a douche. It's more than simple rooting interest deficiency. These young people are supposed to deteriorate with delusions and mania as the hallucinations take hold. Elliot starts as a douche and the delusions don't change him that much. He needs to start as the hero or at worst neutral. He shouldn't be a douche. The other issue is presenting the premise with an easy progression of expositions. I'm not sure how Elliot or anybody is able to figure out the movie's central premise. The lead character should be a literary expert or folklore student. It needs to be an ancient myth or connected to present-day superstition. They can't just come up with the premise out of the blue. Aside from that, this horror is rather derivative. The intensity is low. The characters aren't compelling and the young actors aren't charismatic enough to excel. The movie deteriorates into uncompelling horror action.

            "review_title": "This film is worse than",
            "content": "Everything about this film is wrong. It is terrible in every single way.\nFirst, the writing: The three central characters are not characters. They are puppets, simply existing to further the \"plot\". Frankly, the dialogue is a mockery of the English language. At one point, a character says \"you know I can't read in the dark, I'm not a flashlight\". NOBODY TALKS LIKE THIS. The plot is derivative, and is clearly just a set up for a potential sequel, that will never happen if there is any justice in the world.\nSecondly, the direction and shot composition. Admittedly, the shot composition in this film is at times, competent. However, the director seems to think that just because you put in a long shot or a tracking shot, you are the next Kubrick. Additionally, the budget of this film should not allow it to look like a cheap, lazy student film.\nThirdly, the acting: Doug Jones is a fantastic actor. Carrie Anne Moss and Faye Dunaway are fantastic actors. But even the best actors have to be given CHARACTER to act well. There are no even half decent characters in this film, only cut outs that are made even blander by the cast. This film is not a character driven piece. The actors in this are absolutely atrocious, and I continuously question how they ever got past an audition process. The main actor isn't even a bad actor in everything, there is one scene in this where he is actually pretty good. This really does show that the director of this film has no idea how to work with humans.\nThe Scares: Barney the Dinosaur is a scarier villain. Barney is creepy, the Bye Bye Man is just an excuse for jumpscares, all of which are predictable and almost patronising in their blatant. The CGI in this film is also terrible, only ever used for gore and the Bye Bye Man's horrendous looking dog. You can practically taste the pixels on that dog. It isn't scary. This film would be a lot more interesting if the Bye Bye Man wasn't called that, and if you never saw him. EVER. His presence is not creepy. It is not disturbing. It is goofy and distracting. If I wanted to watch a creepy talk guy appear in random places to scare the main character, I'd watch Sinister instead. At least the villain from that film doesn't look like a de-shelled turtle man.The constant switching of characters through the Bye Bye Man's powers ISN'T CLEVER. The internal logic of this film does not hold up at all, in fact. Several times, the viewer is left wondering \"so what can the Bye Bye Man actually do?\" and \"why are there seven Elliots?\". There is no thought or effort put into this film. None. None whatsoever. I'm actually offended that this was released in cinemas. Nothing matters in this film. There are no consequences for anyone or anything. The main characters all die? We don't care! There is nothing to make us care.This film is actually one of the worst films ever, people complain about horror films these days and I can see why when they produce such garbage like this. The only reason this film gets more than 1 star is because it is so much fun to sit back and mercilessly mock this film. I have legitimate hatred towards the people that directed and wrote this film. It's not suspenseful. It's not scary. It's not interesting, and most importantly, it isn't purposeful. This film has no point to make. Maybe there's an allegory for mental illness in there somewhere, but this is a worthless film deserving of no praise from anyone.

The acting was OK, seemed forced in some areas. I did like to see another movie filmed in Cleveland.",

After having seen The Bye Bye Man, I am now convinced that also the opposite is true: some of these bad reviews must have been written by competitors trying to steer viewers away from this solid film toward their own teams' efforts.My rating of 8 is probably biased upward because I personally love the overlap of psychological and supernatural in my horror. Probably it only really deserves a 6 or 7, but the concepts and execution are leagues better than most of the films of this genre that make it to the theater, and certainly better than at least 80% of the horror on Netflix.I'd been wanting to see The Bye Bye Man ever since the previews came out. It looked interesting, as previews often do, but of course we've all seen previews that make the film look way better than it ends up being. Especially as a horror fan, I have developed the ability to control my excitement and be ready for intriguing looking films to be awful. The Bye Bye Man far surpassed my moderate expectations. Of course it's not perfect. (How many perfect films have you honestly ever seen?) There were a few bits I rolled my eyes at. But it's still easily one of the best horror films I've seen in the past five years.Maybe people are forgetting what horror means. Maybe they want nonstop blood, guts and boobs.If you are a fan of actual horror, at least give this one a try. It's obviously not going to be for everyone. But it definitely deserves more than the 4.8 that it has at the moment I'm writing this.",

When I read a review from someone that says \"this movie sucks\" and then compares it to The Haunted Castle, that's not really a comparison. You can't compare movies from yesterday to today. This movie wasn't created for the fans of The Haunted Castle or fans of H.P. Lovercraft's Reanimator. This movies sort of reminds of the the Ring with no story. The stuff just happens in his movie. There wasn't any time to waste in this film, The Bye Bye Man had an agenda, he was busy scaring the heck out of people. And due to to this, there isn't much of a story and for me that was awesome. This movie is 100% shock value, not bore value. The CG was good and so was the acting. I don't know why people expect Tom Cruse to be in every horror movie, it's not going to happen.If you need a good scare I highly recommend this film.

Turns out there is a bogeyman called the Bye Bye Man and, once you speak or even think his name, he will turn up with his huge bad-CGI dog and mess with your head and people will die. The trick is to kill them and yourself before anyone else learns his name. Or before they write it on a piece of furniture in the house you're renting.Candyman did this, of course, years ago, with minor differences. No mirrors are involved here, and you only have to think the name, which explains people endlessly saying \"Don't think it, don't say it\" and endlessly writing same on walls, furniture, curtains etc. Though this doesn't explain writing the name in full on the bottom of a shelf first and then not crossing it out.So remember, kids, don't just throw that nightstand into the woods, make sure you burn it first.The three youngsters are all fine, and are mostly believable as they try to find a way to thwart the hooded Bye Bye Man and his flayed-bulldog-looking pet, which gnaws contentedly on the corpses of your friends after you've killed them.In truth, the Bye Bye Man's modus operandum is lacking a few bits of essential explanation - does he actually kill you? Or just fool you into killing others? Do you only kill people who have heard his name? - and also has some illogicality about it - if everyone gets killed then how is his name going to be disseminated so that he will have other to kill? He needs a bit more mythology in place before he makes his second outing, methinks,My comments might be somewhat disparaging, but this film succeeds fairly well, albeit it draws heavily on Candyman and the more recent It Follows in creating the same sort of dread. The idea of a horrible but unavoidable fate which follows inexorably gives you immense sympathy for the protagonists: you hope they find a solution. The fact that it happens once you have innocently stepped over a line which you didn't even know was there means that you howl at the unfairness of it.Faye Dunaway cameos: I wondered who it was.

The idea was neat. Not revolutionary if you have seen the Boogie Man movies. While Boogie Man had much better cinematography, for some odd reason I found The Bye Bye Man to be much less boring. It could be because of the mediocre acting that made me role my eyes once in a while. The lead actor was not bad, but the girl and the black guy went on my nerves. The story was good. The cinematography and acting were mediocre. The story kept my attention and I managed to sit through the whole thing and not regret watching it. What sent chills down my spine was not the jump scares (which didn't even work for me) but the one thing the lead actor told the female police officer \"You really think the truth, honesty is the best policy?\" and also when I was asking myself whether or not the little girl was going to say the name of the Bye Bye Man and start the cycle all over again. The twist at the end of the movie was rather good. I honestly didn't see that coming. I think this is worth watching once and it was better and less boring than some horror titles I've seen recently, even though the title of the movie might suggest that it's going to be garbage, which it isn't.

You say his name, he comes for you, but he doesn't kill you, he just... makes you see things? And you kill yourself? And what's with the coins and the train? And the awful CGI dog? I believe the filmakers wanted to start this urban legend where people would spread their theories around the internet and such, but they fail to make it interesting or scary enough.Also the acting is embarrasing, the editing is amateurish and the directing feels rushed and sloppy, like the director wanted to make this as quickly as possible and the editor tried to make a coherent product but he also failed.But i would be lying if say i didn't have a good time, it's an interesting experience, it's kinda amusing to watch and be constantly asking yourself if they were serious about the decisions the makers of the movie made.

This was not one of them.So you already know what the flimsy story line is, so I will just comment on it. There is no explanation of what this entity, or his very poorly computer generated demon dog, is or how they came to be. The guy himself does have a certain air of menace but he doesn't really do much. The acting of just about everyone is sub-high school play. I mean really, did they pick up these people at Walmart, give them $20 and ask them to be in a movie? In all fairness, the movie did have some OK moments they would have been better with better actors and perhaps a director who took some time to flesh out the story. It just seemed almost like random events tied together by this very silly named entity. And I got really tired of the heavily repeated \"Don't think it, don't say it\" nonsense. I did like the cameo by Faye Dunaway and was surprised she was in this sub-par cinema, but she is in her sunset years so a little frivolous role is acceptable.And when the anti-climactic ending came and the credits started, I then saw why this may have been a crock. 'Screenplay by Jonathan Penner'. Really, the guy who was a Survivor contestant? I thought that was him earlier in the movie, he has a very distinctive voice. But I guess if you appear on Survivor you can suddenly be a screenwriter. But then I see his occasional credits extend before Survivor, though I don't recall that ever coming up during his time on that show.And sure, the movie did well at the box office opening weekend, but it's only because they played their cards right. It opened on Friday the 13th and there really weren't any other scary movies out there. So hooray for them for good game play but I expect this will drop like a stone during subsequent weekends. The movie may be OK for younger kids (and trust me, there were lots of obnoxious little monsters in the theater we were in who wouldn't shut up) who don't necessarily need a story line to follow and just like a modest jump now and then, but for anyone looking for an ounce of substance, look elsewhere.

We sat in the theater and the movie began. Almost immediately I noticed how horrific the acting and the way they presented the \"spooky\" atmosphere was. After spending far too long getting to know everyone and why they are in the movie, the \"scary\" bit began. I say scary very loosely as throughout the movie, I felt no sense of fear or tension. Most of the scares that I noticed were jump scares meant to get a cheap reaction out of you. There was only one jump that was at least a little creative, involving a character who wakes up after seeing \"the bye bye man\" and it catches you off guard because it takes A few seconds too long to actually jump, putting you off guard.

Some may say this is one of those horror movies that are hilariously bad, but the real problem is it failed at even being that. This would contain some of the most terribly written stories to ever be made for a horror film. The story is absolutely hopeless that it makes the film anything but interesting. Both the acting and the characters are a bunch of ego lunatics. The visuals look laughably terrible. And the scares and horrors that are nothing but jump scares. The most movie would do just for the scares is you see a character seeing things and you see the three to five seconds of imagery. Not to mention with the horrible ending since let us just say that we knew that moment would be coming since the beginning of it. This is one of those horror movies that I recommend you avoid unless if you want to see an example now a horror movie can be produced into a complete train wreck.

I think it is the unrated one has it, and saying that makes me want to buy the unrated one on Blu-Ray.Don't Think It, Don't Say It! Over and over again.

As it stands they both have ratings near 3/4 out of 10 on IMDb. They're at least somewhat creepy with certain bits of ominous imagery and I would honestly consider them middle of the road to decent gateway horror films. I would definitely at least give them a lower 6 out of 10. And the critique for both films is never in depth or logical. All I ever see is \"garbage trash dumpster fire not scary\" almost in carbon copy fashion. I mean at least if you're going to rip something apart and call\nIt the worst thing of all time give me some actual plausible reasons to believe your extreme statement.

This movie left me very tense most of the way through (the 3rd act always slows down a bit). It's very creepy and eerie. Most people's complaints were pertaining to a lack of backstory on the Bye Bye Man. This is an unfortunate side effect of being raised in the millennial generation and the newest generation. Everything needs to be explained and handed on a silver platter. Some of the scariest, creepiest things are often left unknown. It's the unknown that is scary/interesting. It's with all horror movie franchises. They give more and more of the origin until everything is overexplained and dull. Michael Myers was scary because he went around killing people and we didn't know why. Then Rob Zombie goes and explains how it all came to be and ruins it. Was his version scary? A big fat no. It makes me think of the episode of Doug where he can't finish watching a horror movie cause he gets too scared. It's this creature that you never see, only a shadow and you hear it. Finally he sees it and laughs at how ridiculous it is. The unknown is scary. See the movie for yourself.

It's like watching a really strange dream with weird acting and dialogue, and no well thought out plot - a weird dream I would have, on rare occasions. The acting was straight up laughable - I couldn't understand any of the characters. It was so obvious the actors were reading off a script, and some of them didn't put any thought into it.The story, too, didn't have any thought put into it. There was no backstory for The Bye Bye Man. We're given an opening scene during the 1960's or so where a man asks others if they told anyone of \"the name\", which obviously refers to \"The Bye Bye Man\", and they said they shared it with others, which results in the man killing these people. The name is basically a virus, and in order to get rid of it is to commit suicide or homicide.

The Bye Bye man could have focused more on the antagonist and given much more life to the myth. This just might have put that little bit of edge on the film, which is so desperately needed.The good news is that the film doesn't lag like a lot of horror films when they have to drag out the suspense or heavily build up the character development.There are quite a few clich\u00e9 moments in the film. And many moments make you cringe out of the sheer stupidity of the characters. A girl runs in front of an oncoming train as if she is completely oblivious to the sirens, flashing lights, and her general well-being. A woman stands in the middle of the road in the dead of night as if she is also oblivious to any oncoming traffic and gets run over by a car. You get my point.I'll be straight out honest, and say the prologue could have been done much, much better. If you think the opening will grip you and pull you into the story then you are wrong. It's a bit corny, and not the least bit absorbing. I felt that it was funny rather than its intention of being serious or shocking.The Bye Bye Man (Doug Jones) was a sinister-looking character and I just wish they did more with him. I wanted to know more about his origins and just think that he should have been utilized a whole lot better. His hound, however, was so blatantly CGI that it was not nearly as effective or intimidating.The s\u00e9ance in the film was completely random and not needed. The coins were a nice touch but had very little connection to the Bye Bye man other than you are meant to be aware that he is near or coming for you.People who have either said his name, hear his name, or even thought about him are vulnerable to having vivid, troublesome hallucinations. It seems the Bye Bye man doesn't actually kill anyone physically but instead gets into people's minds to make them commit these horrendous acts.The acting was fairly below average. I would say except for Elliot (Douglas Smith) who was the only one I felt had somewhat of a decent, or interesting personality.The Bye Bye man won't go down to win any awards. It's fun enough for a bit of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. But it's not scary and it is very predictable. There was one little twist near the end which was quite unexpected but you don't care enough for it to impact you. While the ending of the film itself was just bland and insipid.5/10.",

            "content": "I'm a avid horror fan and anybody that's a fan of the horror genre will know that we have to trawl through at least 10-15 films before we find one we actually enjoy. I didn't have any expectations of 'The Bye Bye Man' and expected it to be another one I'd add to the average and forgettable, or damn right awful, pile, but I really enjoyed it.The concept of 'The Bye Bye Man' is interesting, the atmosphere is eerie and suspenseful, the plot is engaging throughout and there's multiple decent jump scares. How the Bye Bye Man is incorporated into the story means you never quite know what's real and what's not, which builds the suspense a lot.I've seen another reviewers make comparisons to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'It Follows' and I have to agree. The concept of The Bye Bye Man is similar to the entity in 'It Follows' and the idea that there's an evil that attaches itself to you and is devoted to killing you mirrors both 'It Follows' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Despite sharing similarities with other films in the genre, it's quite an original concept and isn't your typical slasher horror nor your typical supernatural horror.The only element of the film that lets it down is the acting. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not good either. I'd describe it as mediocre. This means that the characters themselves feel very one-dimensional and lack in any real personality, but that's a common trait of a lot of horrors, and it's not so bad that it ruins the enjoyment of the film.Overall, 'The Bye Bye Man' is an enjoyable viewing experience and definitely worth more than a 4 star rating. With a different cast I believe it could've been as popular and well-received as 'It Follows' (personally, I prefer 'The Bye Bye Man' to 'It Follows') because it has all of the other elements there to be a horror classic. My advice would be don't be deterred from watching based on the bad reviews and ratings, because they're misleading. On the same token, don't go in with high expectations, just enjoy it for what it is.",

It's almost seems like a parody of these wussy PG-13 money-grubbing horror movies that have been released in the last few years, but sadly it takes itself way to seriously to be a parody.The acting is absolutely terrible from all the main characters and it's actually pretty hilarious at some points. The effects are also just as bad, seriously the dog looks like it belongs in the first Resident Evil game, and the main villain isn't intimidating at all. And as usual in horror films, the teens are all complete idiots that constantly do stupid things to move the plot forward. Like why would you put a hammer that you're going to use to kill someone in plain view of said person WITH FREAKING BLOOD STILL ON IT!!??! The scares were all extremely predictable and cheap jump scares that aren't even scary because the The Bye Bye Man looks like he belongs in a retirement home.It's obvious this movie got a lot cut from it when it was downgraded to PG-13. The movie constantly brings up trains in relation to the villain but never explains its significance. Not to mention the three random naked people on the train tracks that aren't ever mentioned again. But anyway this movie is a passable piece of garbage that isn't scary in the slightest, do yourself a favor and save that hard earned cash for something actually good. Hopefully once the studios realize these PG-13 crapfests don't sell, we'll get some quality R horror films to replace this trash.",

The first weird part is that among all this abhorrent work, Douglas Smith actually does a really good job! The other weird part is how the script continually goes from mind blowing stupidity, to way above average in seconds. Sometimes you want more, some times you just wanna turn it off. Also, often times, movies like this start off great or at least okay, and then just nosedive around the 45-minute mark. This one does the opposite, it starts off absolutely terrible and then gets better and better, albeit somewhat schizophrenically, with every passing minute.So yeah, don't expect a masterpiece, don't even expect a good horror film, expect the kind of film you would have loved if you saw it as a 13 year old with your best friend Saturday night in your parents basement, and you will be decently entertained as an adult.",

Everything about it is just plain bad, from the acting, to the plot, to the effects, and especially the scariness. But what truly launches it into so-bad-it's-good territory is how weirdly pretentious it all is.Here are a few standout scenes that really showcase the awfulness of this movie.One of the first scenes in the film is of our incredibly boring main character, Elliot, discovering the words \"don't think it, don't say it\" carved onto a nightstand. When he turns it over, he sees the name of the titular villain. Now, one of the most important plot points in the movie is that after reporting on a case of a teenager killing his family (allegedly because the Bye Bye Man told him to do so), the previous owner of the protagonist's house did everything in his power to erase the Bye Bye Man from existence. He literally committed mass murder on a bunch of his neighbors just for this purpose. But, apparently, he was so lazy he couldn't even be bothered to check around his house to see if he left the name anywhere. Honestly, it's all so entirely contrived that it is quite hilarious.Later, Elliot investigates the Bye Bye Man further, and eventually comes upon a dossier about him in his local library. Again, I must point out how incredibly, impossibly stupid this reporter was. Honestly, you didn't even bother to get rid of all copies of your article before going on a bloody rampage? Really?And we come to one of the final scenes in the movie, which is also hands down the most ridiculous. As you might expect, the Bye Bye Man comes to kill Elliot, but just before he does so, Elliot proclaims his love for the Bye Bye Man. I mean, do I even need to explain the problem with this? The film has suffocated itself with its own self-importance so much, that it barely makes sense anymore. Forget Elliot; the film itself has lost its mind.Oh, but that's not the end of the stupidity, as the film manages to pack in one final, dumb punch. Basically, the house is burned to the ground, but one of Elliot's roommates who was witness to a bunch of Bye Bye Man stuff lives. As he's being taken out of the building on a stretcher, the investigator working on the case asks him the name of the person that caused all of this. And the roommate just... tells her. Again, the dumbness of this should speak for itself, but I'll spell it out anyway. Despite all the murders he's witnessed, the chaos he's endured, the madness he's experienced, he still gives up the name to the investigator for literally no reason. What's the matter with these people? Erasing a name from existence in the laziest way possible? Falling in love with a supernatural murderer? Purposefully condemning at least one more person to death for no reason?The Bye Bye Man is a stain on the careers of all involved. I don't know how Trinity from the Matrix and Faye Dunaway got roped into this catastrophe, but they certainly couldn't have appeared in anything worse than this. Unless you're looking for a hilarious comedy, avoid this film.Final Score: 20/100.",

It does not go beyond \"A guy that murders people that say his name, and his pet (and there are also trains I guess)\", which in turn makes it generic. This is probably the result of poor story conversion, as there is an actual backstory that would have made this so much more gruesome than it was.It also lacks interesting characters, and to an extent a good cast. Doug Jones was amazing as the titular character, I'll give them that. Virgil and Hat Girl were OK. Elliot wasn't awful; properly scared, and it was definitely a step up from Smith's role in Ouija. But the rest did not deliver. In particular Sasha was played by someone who is obviously a model and not really an actor.Furthermore, it suffered from pretty poor editing; a lot of scenes ended abruptly, even when they show something that gets referenced later, which makes you lose focus and as a result confuses you. The main plotline has quite some holes and situations that simply make no sense, even if you caught all the important details.On a positive note, it was quite entertaining, be it more in a fun way than in an actual scary way.

While Smith is somewhat reliable in this role but he delves into hammy waters often enough that it becomes hard to take him seriously. Bonas, on the other hand, is almost never believable and her delivery is almost universally terrible. It makes me wonder how a director can watch a performance as bad as hers and consider it to be acceptable.This is particularly jarring when compared to the performances of Lucien Laviscount and Jenna Kanell. Kanell's part is comparatively smaller than Bonas's, but the quality of her acting is so markedly better that one cannot help bu think their roles should have been switched. Laviscount seems to be a reliably effective actor, conveying genuine emotions where Smith is more hit or miss. The discrepancy between the male actors is not quite as pronounced,, however.The movie also should have been a bit longer. They characters seem to jump to conclusions not based on their experience within the film, but rather because the plot demands it. Better writing would have helped as well.In the end we have a mediocre horror film that occasionally shows what could have been if only a few small changes had been made.",

And kudos for not making the title character just a cheap cgi monster, and we instead get a nice makeup job. Certainly not the scariest of boogeymen, but definitely unique. The flaws mostly exist in the characters and performances, particularly the lead actress, who does her best I'm sure, but just doesn't quite sell it. The way the characters are portrayed and the cheesy dialogue is at times impossible to get behind, but this is to be expected in a movie like this. No, this isn't a major horror masterpiece.

Plot is simple, yet some things have been left vague. I'm guessing it's due to budget restraints or because the team behind this was afraid that audience wouldn't appreciate detailed backstory to the creature. In all honesty, leaving it up to thin air made the movie creepier for me, since the monster lacked the fear factory in appearance. It was just plain weird.I wasn't aware that there was a real legend behind this before I came to IMDB. Had the team written it in, I think it would have made the creature too much human.With all the flaws in it the movie managed to entertain me, even puzzle me momentarily, and as a fan of 80's slashers I would recommend this to anybody who's still watching Freddy, Jason and Michael butchering teenagers.

It's so bland that trying to guess the tone is impossible, it's not serious because of all the dumb, unintentionally hilarious moments like when this guy in the opening shoots all these people.Bad Things:It sounds scary enough, but what ruins it is 1) It's shot during the day, so all hope at a scary setting is lost, if it was shot during a sunset or at night, then it would be forgiven. 2) The whole thing is shot in one take, so the already mediocre actors look even worse at their job. If they just shot the scene normally the whole scene would look and be acted more competently. 3) The writing is awful, so even if they did all the things I suggested, the scene would still be bad.The effects look like a TV show or something, I don't know what the budget was, but this got released in theaters and it looks like a TV miniseries or something. If you were to come across this on Netflix, it would fit right in, you would think this was another cheap Netflix horror movie, that's the level of quality were talking about. Especially the dog thing, it looked like a PlayStation game.The acting is pretty bad, it's not the actors fault, the garbage script they were given didn't really help them.It has a lot horror clich\u00e9s like jumpscares, psychic goth girl, seance and magic thing that really works, scary library scene, claims to be based on a true story and so forth.Good Things:The idea is good, I think the idea of an entity that spreads through thinking about him and knowing his name is pretty scary, they should have chosen a scarier name than the Bye Bye Man though.While the acting is bad, there is one scene with Trinity from the Matrix (I don't the actors name) and this one guy who looks like Dane Dahan where the acting and writing are pretty solid. I really like that scene. I think the Dane Dahan guy can be a good actor when he's given good material and good direction and I guess that scene they accidentally got good acting.While all the digital effects are bad, the practical effects are solid.Overall, I think if the idea was given to a more competent person, this could have been a decent horror movie.",

This is easily one of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time. As I type this review, my head is still spinning from the sheer stupidity I've witnessed. If you notice terrible grammar and poor sentence structure in this review, it's most likely due to the amount of brain cells this movie extracted from me. The film is about three teenagers who've recently purchased a creepy old house that Elvis Presley would sing about in his song \"In the Ghetto\". When our protagonist finds a nightstand with \"The Bye Bye Man\" sketched on the inside, paranormal occurrences begin to happen all over the house. Basically if anyone says or thinks \"The Bye Bye Man\", he and his poorly rendered CGI Rottweiler will kill them. I realize that was a terrible synopsis, but it was a terrible movie and I just want to tear it apart now. The acting in this film is absolutely dreadful. All of the written dialogue and onscreen chemistry resembled a film you would see on the sci-fi channel on Tuesday night. The plot is equally terrible if not worse. For example, there's a scene where the main character wants to research the bye bye man to find out what exactly he is. Well since the film takes place in 2017, he naturally goes to the library.....the library. There is literally a shot earlier in the film displaying an iMac. Apparently the film wants to be set in the 50s. There's also a recurring nuisance in which the characters say exactly what they're thinking while they're performing an action. And by \"recurring\" I mean literally all the time. I also think it goes without saying that we never learn anything about the bye bye man. His story, motive, high school years, favorite ice cream flavor at Ben & Jerry's, none of it is revealed. On the bright side, the terrible acting, scares, and effects can be so terrible that they're laughable. If you ever find yourself hanging out with a bunch of friends and you're in the mood to just ridicule a god awful film, this is definitely one to check out. But if you're looking for any other reason to watch it, the best advice I can give is don't see it, don't think it.",

These types of movies seldom give the actors anything they can really sink their teeth into.The girlfriend played by Cressida Bonas, this was her debut and really, what could she do with the part she was given? It's basically a walk through just be yourself role. There was no challenge to it.It's been said that a good screenplay brings out the best in A+ actors, A+ actors can take an average screenplay and make it seem better than it actually is because of their talent, but a bad screenplay will make even the best actors look bad.If you're a fan of horror it's watchable. If you're going to watch it like a movie critic you'll be disappointed. Movies regardless of genre are subjective.

            "content": "First of all: I've seen far worse movies than this one. Giving it 1 star would just not do the other movies justice. Yes, the actors aren't good, the story is pretty weird at times (read on!), the whole movie isn't played out great. Still it has a creepy atmosphere, most viewers may relate to the characters' emotions. In general it's your average horror flick to watch with easily creeped friends. You should just not think about it too much.The biggest failure of the movie is that it had a great back story and missed to implement the main plot:\nIt just never tells you who the bye bye man is! It rather tries to create another \"Candyman\" while it would be so much better sticking to it's origin \"the bridge to body Island'.Spoilers!The actual back story is about a man who gets scorned and tormented so much, he seeks revenge, which then it turns him into a serial killer who travels through the states by train rather than being a \"hallucination\" that no one but Elliott, who has visions of trains for no good reason, can see.The dog is actually called \"Gloomsinger\", and was sewed together by the bye bye man himself to help him track his victims after turning blind himself. It needs dead bodies or it will decay. The bye bye man has no intention of turning students mad so they start killing each other. Also, why is not a single person in the movie questioning the dog who eats dead bodies?!The bye bye man is said to be pale (albino) with long hair, tattooed and wearing glasses and a hat. He's carrying a sack of organs. So it's not that bald funny dude in a scream-costume that can be seen in this movie. Also, why is no one in the movie ever mentioning that robe standing in their bedroom, turning into a vision of a hallucination of the bye bye man.Also, why do the characters never talk about their hallucinations but beat around the bush, taking about the bye bye man all the time without actually figuring out anything (like his dog, the train, the coins?) at all.The writer of the bye bye man may have misunderstood or just glanced over the original story or, and we know that's more likely, did change the plot in purpose, knowing that pseudo mythical events do buzz on most algorithms these days.\nThe original story of the bye bye man would have ended in plain old slasher movie.\nBut most of us would have loved to see that slasher movie!",

            "content": "I just saw The Bye Bye Man this past weekend and all I have to say is this had potential to be fairly solid but fails in almost every aspect. I went in not knowing much about this film, and I left with a lot of opinions to say the least. Let's organize this with pros and cons, because I just like to be organized.Pros:-There are some creepy moments to the film. It's nice to see a new horror/thriller use some suspense for once.-The Bye Bye Man has a ridiculous sounding name, but is a cool looking character. Props to the costume designers for that one.-A few performances were actually pretty solid, the guys who play the Bye Bye Man, Elliot, and John all do a consistently solid job.-It's obviously trying to be something along the lines of Slender and A Nightmare on Elm Street, which I think is interesting enough. I love classic horror, and The Bye Bye Man gave me feelings of not just Emperor Palpatine, but Freddy Kruger as well. He's an entity that doesn't really exist but is claiming victims through their minds.Cons:-Anything with significance is left completely unexplained. I left the theater with a lot of unanswered questions. Where does the Bye Bye Man originate from? Who the hell is the Bye Bye Man? Why does the Bye Bye Man have a dog or hellhound type thing? Why is a nightstand the most significant thing about this entity? What do these coins that keep dropping everywhere have to do with anything?-The film is only 96 minutes long, which I felt could have totally used another 15 minutes to just explain some things.-Although I was pleasantly surprised at the beginning with the suspense, it gives up on any suspense after the first half hour or so and relies heavily on jumpscares the rest of the way through to get any sort of audience reaction.-The Bye Bye Man's dog/hellhound type thing should have just been scratched on the whole. There's no explanation as to why it's there and the CGI is laughably bad.-Besides the characters I listed in the pros, the rest of the acting performances are kinda meh.-The film loses all of it's tension after a bit. Eventually I found myself laughing more than being scared.-The premise is kinda...meh. Doesn't make a lot of sense because you're not supposed to say or think his name, but how do you not THINK it? There's no real plot twist or anything to make the story interesting, the ending is a little flat and overall just didn't step out of any boundaries to be original. Basically meaning the whole movie is full of clich\u00e9s.-Severe lack of transition. Remember when I said it could've used an extra 15 minutes to explain things? Tack on some establishing shots to that extra time. Scenes jump from one to another with no transition which makes the first half of the film retardedly confusing. We were a half hour in and nobody had any idea what was going on.-This was CLEARLY watered down last minute to try and fit a larger audience, nearly being rated R but released PG-13. There's a flashback in the beginning where people are getting blasted with a shotgun but there's zero blood to be found. It should have taken the chance with an R rating instead of trying to hang on to PG-13 guidelines, which probably explains why there's nothing that steps outside of the boundaries for originality.So, yes, The Bye Bye Man should have just been a straight to Netflix thing. Anybody who liked it in any sense can't give it more than a 6. I had to give it a 4, it's nice to get a refreshment of classic horror but the negatives greatly outweigh the positives. Would I watch a sequel? If it's done right and explains some origin or backstory maybe. It had the potential to be solid on the whole, but it never really makes an effort to go anywhere outside of it's comfort zone, or even explain anything that's significant to the story, not even the title character for Pete's sake.",

From the makers of the instant classic Oculus: Devil's Mirror movie, this masterpiece seems to enact once again plot twists worth the wondering. One of the funniest things in this movie is how, the character of another race looks extremely similar to Timbo, from the Oculus movie, adding this movie some extra ironic element and approach into it...

This entire movie is tainted by this, and removes any possibility of viewers remembering it with anything other than laughter.While this movie is conceptually decent, it fails to deliver over and over again as the 'plot' unfolds. What seems like a concept with a lot of potential for tension and lore ends up being a badly executed version of something we've seen over and over again, 'demon causes spooky hallucinations before driving its victims over the edge'. The movie seemed like it was going to give some sort of exposition or explanation of the villain, but ended up giving absolutely nothing other than what we learn from the trailer.The acting has one or two moments that pleasantly surprised me, but for the most part it was either lifeless, over the top, or just strange. If there were any reason to suggest watching this it would be so that you can witness the trip that is the acting in this movie.The movie looked good, and, with the exception of a terrible CGI dog that played no significant role, the villain and the scares were probably the most entertaining part of this movie. Doug Jones portrays the awfully named antagonist with an air of originality, and looked great while doing it.If you want to see what the fuss is about, be my guest. But don't say I didn't warn you.",

All we know about the character of \"The Bye-Bye Man\" is the repeated ad nauseum mantra \"Don't think it, Don't say it,\" but that's it. Apparently, it leads to your death, and the only way to get rid of him is to remove any mention of him anywhere. However, the only people who die are killed by other characters trying to remove any trace of the supposed villain. And in the end, when the villain actually has a chance to deliver some form of payoff...\nHe does nothing. \nNothing in this film is engaging. The colors are muted, the camera work is sloppy, the special effects are not effective. But on top of it all, it's not fun.

The 4.1 review on imbd (as of me writing this) is way to high. There is only one sorta of good scene in the movie, and by that I mean the acting is talarable, the scene itself still makes no sense, don't watch this movie.",

The one thing that this website did not include on the parent guide is that there is a few sex scenes. Normally I look it up to double check it's OK to have my kids watch. I went and saw it (thankfully without my son) and was surprised what was in the content. Besides that the movie did have a few jump scares but I think they could've done a lot better with the whole thing. Story line was interesting but the way they set some stuff up just left you with more questions than anything was answered. It honestly wasn't the worse horror movie I've ever seen but it definitely wasn't the best either.",

            "content": "This film The Bye Bye Man was directed by a Stacy Title one of many female directors in the film industry. She is known for her films Let the Devil Wear Black, Last Supper and Down on the Waterfront. The Bye Bye Man seems to be Stacy's first horror film. \"When three college students move into an old house off campus, they unwittingly unleash a supernatural entity known as The Bye Bye Man, who comes to prey upon them once they discover his name. The friends must try to save each other, all the while keeping The Bye Bye Man's existence a secret to save others from the same deadly fate.\".\nThe Bye Bye Man consisted of many different symbols that constantly occurred. Some symbols that occurred in this film were a coin and trains. All these things in the film that essentially brought upon the demon/evil spirit. The coin could be a symbol of having two different sides of you. It could also symbolize taking chances because like everyone does as you \"flip a coin\". Trains where a constant symbol in this film because the train would be something those who knew the Bye Bye Man's name would see trains in their sleep. This symbolized the that he was coming The Bye Bye Man was coming for you like a train just chugging along looking for his next stop/victim.\nA major motif that I found in this film that occurs in many other horror films were the steps or signs of this demon or monster. In The Bye Bye Man, some signs that the Bye Bye Man was coming/haunting coin flip, trains, dreams, the dog, hallucinations, \"don't say it don't think it\", psychic, and Ouija board. In this film, the main characters Elliot (Douglas Smith), Sasha (Cressida Bonas) and John (Lucien Laviscount) moved into this house on near their college campus. Once settled Sasha began to hear the sound of a coin flipping and doors slamming shut by itself. She was later told that the sound of the coin flip means that the Bye Bye Man is coming. The trains like mentioned before were another sign that the Bye Bye Man was coming because you see it in your dreams. Then that is another sign you start having weird dreams that just keep getting realer and realer every time. When finding out the history of house and Bye Bye man the students were told that if you hear or see the dog the Bye Bye man is also near the dog is the Bye Bye Mans evil side kick. Hallucinations is another motif that occurs in this film the Bye Bye Man starts to get in the student's heads and makes them see things that aren't real and going after what their weakness. There is a saying in this film that is repeated \"don't say it don't think it\" which is how you somewhat control the Bye Bye Man haunting you. A major motif that appears in this film is a psychic and use of Ouija board these two things are known for antagonizing the evil, awakening the evil and making the evil stronger. Many films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Babadook, Conjuring, and many more. All these films talk about signs and how the evil entity will appear and haunt you. For example, in the Babadook the story explains how the Babadook would haunt you. In the Conjuring the \"demon experts\" explained to the family the steps of how the demon attacks you and begins to possess you. The Bye Bye Man did the same it explained how the Bye Bye Man appears.\nThe Bye Bye Man was overall a decent film. It was good for it being somewhat of a low budget film. This films budget was approximately $7,400,000 this is kind of low budget for most films. The only thing that really bothered me about this film was the special effects. There were many parts of the film where the demons pet dog would be walking or eating people, and it looked super computerized. If I were to rate this film it would be a 6.6/10.",

            "content": "I only have 9 minutes to review this film so I will do my best. To begin, it is troubling to see a film like this, with decent production value, end up being such a huge disappointment. The cinematography for this film wasn't groundbreaking but it can at least be considered 'solid'.As for the premise itself and the painfully unrealistic script, the same cannot be said.The Bye Bye Man is so devoid of anything that can be considered even remotely realistic. The plot is simple - which isn't necessarily a bad thing - but the plot points that fill out the storyline are just...dumb. The circumstances that motivate the characters to act are questionable in and of themselves and the responses that the characters have to their issues are boring and, once again, unrealistic.I can forgive a movie with wooden acting, stilted dialogue, and embarrassingly stereotypical characters if it is, at the very least, fun. Sadly, The Bye Bye Man is the farthest thing from fun. I will admit that I laughed at some of the serious parts of the movie, but not in an enjoyable way. Half of the time I found my eyes rolling into the back of my head because of corny dialogue or weird, unmotivated character actions.All in all, this film was just...not fun, not smart, not entertaining, and hardly original. If 2017 was the year when horror movies took a nosedive in artistic value, this was the film that helped to sink the ship.3/10 extremely generous stars...",
