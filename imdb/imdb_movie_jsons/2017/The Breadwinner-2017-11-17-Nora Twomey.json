            "content": "Have been a lifelong fan of animation for as long as can be remembered, with Disney and Looney Tunes being my earliest exposures. Loved it from an early age, actually love and appreciate it even more now with broader knowledge and taste, encompassing many directors, animation styles and studios of many countries.'The Breadwinner' first came to my attention when it was nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, losing out to Pixar's 'Coco' (another amazing film that is slightly preferred by me). Can totally understand the appeal and award attention with it being one of the most deserving nominees in generally one of recent years' better award seasons, 'The Breadwinner' is a stunning and truly accomplished film, so much more than entertainment. It is one of the year's most emotional and unique films and no other film has moved me as much as 'The Breadwinner' did in some time now.For one thing, 'The Breadwinner' looks stunning. Being rich in detail and atmospheric, as well as beautifully drawn. The ambient sound has much authenticity, which thrills and makes one feel they are there in the setting without being intrusive. The writing is genuine and sincere, like the rest of the film, with an unfussy and never dumbed down or preachy approach to facing harsh realities and adversity in a way that feels realistic.Loved the storytelling and really along with the emotion it is 'The Breadwinner's' biggest strengths. It is always captivating, has a lot of emotional impact, made me feel and has something that not many films this year had, soul. It tackles serious and heavy themes that one does not usually see in an animated film and deals with them gently and sincerely yet with full impact. It is intelligent and in some ways educational, and what could have easily been heavy-handed isn't (especially the political element). The characterisation has depth and interest, with a lead character that is instantly relatable due to her spirit, innocence and willpower. The voices also endear and the ending compels. In summary, simply fantastic and a must watch. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The beauty about discovering independent animated films outside of America is that you discover gems that could never be made here. In the case of today's film, it comes from the Irish studio Cartoon Saloon, known for making The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea. Although the film did go under the radar outside of getting an Oscar nom and premiering at TIFF in 2017, it's still regarded as a beloved feature amongst critics and film fans. What could have easily been done in live-action ends up working well in the other medium to really bring to life the turmoil in Afghanistan through pure artistry.The Breadwinner focuses on a little girl named Parvana who lives under the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. After her father is arrested without charge, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to support her family, whilst working alongside a friend of hers named Shauzia. As a lead, Parvana helps drive the film forward so she can save her loved ones, and the stakes that come from living in such an oppressive country make us sympathize with her. That being said, there is a sense of optimism displayed through both her and Shauzia, as they cleverly trick the hierarchy who view them as boys. It's also neat how the filmmakers made Parvana feel relatable by displaying her home life that shows as many sibling rivalries and issues as the average family.It's neat how even though the film details many hardships, it also has several moments of sweetness and levity. The film sporadically showcases a story told by Parvana that ends up connecting to all the events happening to her, and it does it in a way where we want to know how it all ends. In terms of dark content, the film does not shy away from displaying the violence, evil from the order and even bits of war to heighten up Parvana's desperation and risk taking. However, there are still moments of soothing relaxation, especially whenever Parvana tells her story, allowing the viewers to digest the severely tense moments. While they can interrupt the main narrative's flow sometimes, it's still cool to see the contrast between the harsh reality and uplifting fantasy displayed in this film.Cartoon Saloon outdid themselves with their previous features in terms of animation, and this film is no exception. The overall Middle-eastern inspired designs of the film create a very stylish and angular hand-drawn feel that's become so rare to find nowadays. In addition, another notable contrast is how the film emulates reality in Parvana's state of being. In contrast, the stories she tells are presented in a more abstract and storybook illustrative aesthetic that gives one the impression they are viewing an ancient narrative. Where the real world is murky, grainy and filled with bright lights and grim shadows, the surreal worlds of the story display a very versatile amount of colors, designs and characters to utilize the much needed creativity from a storyteller.Although by no means a happy go lucky film, The Breadwinner succeeds very well in telling a narrative through the harsh realities of growing up in a dangerous country filled with oppression and prejudice. If you haven't seen this film yet, definitely check it out. It works as a story of feminism, it works as a blend of differing mediums shown throughout different states of reality, and it especially works as a biting tale on surviving in a country filled with tyrannical cruelty. This is the kind of underrated gem that demands a larger audience, so it can go on to become a cult classic and then a beloved film by more than just animation buffs. If Cartoon Saloon keeps pushing themselves to making more unique and great content like this, I think they're in for a wonderful future.",

            "content": "This movie gets a perfect score for me, but it's not for everyone.Recently I saw many movies and even animated movies. But they were all made to impress in cheap ways such as huge stakes, awesome CGI and well known actors. The Breadwinner for me does so much more with so much less.This movie however is about characters you wouldn't normally care about. About a story so far from your living room that you wont bother to check. And yet, this is why it touched me. It's a realistic take of a distant world. The characters and situations are as down to earth as possible, even compared to live action movies. The soul this movie has, with the small stakes of a poor family and even how a girl copes with the loss of her brother, is what most directors and writers fail to deliver. The movie gives many cultural elements of how an Afgan family lives, how men differ from women and how the whole city works. I had to check and see if everything depicted in the movie was real in some way. This was a fictional story but so well crafted that left me stunned. I thought it could be a biography like the 10 year old cartoon movie Persepolis (which has similar style and setting) but it's not.The description of this movie \"an 11-year-old girl who cuts off her hair and dresses like a boy to support her family\", put me off at first because it reminded me of Mulan. This may not be a blockbuster but it is a superior film made by a smaller company.",

In a lot of fields, this film surpasses a lot of other films that are being celebrated in 2017 for exactly those fields.",

            "content": "In the Taliban-controlled city of Kabul, Afghanistan in the early 2000s, Parvana (voiced by Saara Chaudry) is a pre-teen girl who must disguise herself as a boy in order to earn money for her family. As females are forbidden to appear in public without an adult male, she must also shop for the family as well.\"The Breadwinner\" is an animated film co-produced by Canada, Ireland, and Luxembourg and is in the English language.The story (from the book by Deborah Ellis) can be highly praised for focusing on Parvana's struggles while also involving related subplots that add richly to the story without ever creating the feeling of overwhelm or confusion. The most fascinating is one that begins as Parvana (as a boy) is approached by an illiterate man who needs to have a letter read to him.This film pulls no punches in the injustice against females by Taliban zealots. One of the ways this is exposed is when Parvana walks outside for the first time dressed as a boy and the viewer can easily sense her great feeling of freedom.Two other strengths add to the greatness of this movie. One is unexpected humour. It truly works despite the grim situation overall and is neither facetious nor unbelievable. The other is the beautiful visuals in the animation. This is especially apparent in a parallel mythical story - one that matches the main narrative - which Parvana narrates to her baby brother.The finale is open-ended leaving the viewer wondering what will happen to Parvana and her family. It's a rather perfect ending as it gives us just the right amount of information for us to imagine in different ways what could happen next.Make no mistake: \"The Breadwinner\" is a winner in many ways. - dbamateurcritic",

            "content": "In the 21st century, we're used to animated features being escapist, often the sorts of movies that nine-year-olds will find entertaining, and always based on star power. That's just one of the things that makes \"The Breadwinner\" such a breath of fresh air. This story of a girl in Taliban-era Afghanistan forced to pose as a boy to provide for her family shows that an animated feature can be just like a live-action feature; after all, animation is simply another type of moviemaking. Realistic plot, no famous names (except for executive producer Angelina Jolie) and no over-the-top musical numbers. It certainly doesn't paint a pretty picture of the Taliban.I think that this should've won Best Animated Feature at the Oscars. \"Coco\" had an interesting story, but this focused on a more important topic. I understand that there was a movie called \"Osama\", which had a similar plot. In the meantime, definitely watch \"The Breadwinner\".Another movie that focuses on a girl's childhood in a fundamentalist regime is Marjane Satrapi's \"Persepolis\", about her coming-of-age in 1980s Iran.",

And it _felt_ very authentic. I'm no authority on whether it was authentic or not, but it's the attention to detail that lends to the feeling of authenticity. Details about life, the clothing, the accents, the marketplaces, the politics, the culture, etc., add to the richness of the movie. It's an animated movie. So of course you expect it to all end well at the end. But as you near the ending, you start to wonder how could it possibly end up all well. And then you get to the ending. And then, I don't know. Of course, I won't spoil it. But the ending was not a conventional ending. It wasn't a sad ending; it wasn't a happy ending. I guess it was an ambiguous ending. And even though it leaves me without a fully satisfying ending, the journey it took me on was fantastic!",

He's a former teacher and they're harassed by his former student Idrees turned Taliban. Idrees feels slighted and falsely accuses Nurullah. With her father in prison, Parvana has to dress as a boy to buy food and earn money for the family. Her writer mother is beaten for being in the streets without a male chaperon. Parvana is befriended by Shauzia, another girl who dresses as a boy and mentors her in the ways of the streets. To please her little brother, she tells him stories about a young boy on a quest against the Elephant King.The animation is beautiful. The story is compelling. Parvana is an empathetic character in a real apocalyptic world. The fantasy tale is slow at first but it pays off by intertwining with her real world story. There is a real intensity in the build up and in the climatic reveal. The only drawback is that I hoped for a real Parvana to tell her own story. No matter how sincere the writing and how well the telling, it is in the end a second hand tale.",

            "content": "\"Women should not go outside and attract unnecessary attention. If a woman shows herself, she will be cursed by Islamic sharia, and should never expect to go to heaven.\" Male Islamic tradition has been \"placing the onus on the victim\" as an element of female enslavement. Only if you are a boy can you go anywhere. We have the Taliban in the Hindu Kush mountainous region of Afghanistan enforcing that precept. In our story eleven year old Parvana is forced to provide for the family because the father has been jailed. An eleven year old girl with an older sister, infant brother and mom all rely on her to secretly venture into the streets to get food & water for the family under the threat of the Taliban. My only negative thought is to have seen the fabled horse tale (haha) finished as well as that of the father. Animation in the French minimalist style (in this case mostly Irish & Canadian) is great attention to detail. We see the arid dust swirling from the wind; the exhaust of cars; the paleness of the females confined indoors in contrast to our Sun tanned Parvana. Music adds authenticity & movement. Then we have a different animation style to fit still another, and more ancient moral fable within this girl's story. We see the thousands of years of conflict that have been waged in this fulcrum of civilization. Still leaving their remnants of war, which to the children are toys of death. As an aside, it is through the education of females in Afghanistan & similar countries that the equality in being human, a threat to male dominance through sharia, is to be realized which is why the Taliban, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, & Boko Haram kill to prevent it.",

Having said that, this film is beautiful and uplifting. I would definitely recommend this film for young adults on up.This story shows the effects of war, fundamentalist religion and poverty and how it affects a Muslim family living in Kabul. It is a more honest depiction of Afghani culture than many purely adult films as it has many aspects they don't contain, as it was made to also appeal to children (the violence is all implied, but never shown).This is a great family film - I watched this with my girlfriend who has had little to no exposure to Middle Eastern culture or Islamic culture. She asked \"Do you think this is an accurate depiction of this culture\" and I responded: \"for some people - families like this, yes\". This is a film that talks about the struggles of these places without it being from an American or European viewpoint (as is often the case in the last decade), but it WILL appeal to people from American and Europe as the messages are about a struggle for survival, freedom from oppression and the journey of childhood through uncertain times.This is by far the best Animated film coming from North America in 2017. Adults will be able to connec the dots here to see the connections to modern politics and current events in the last 20 years.",

All they want is their father and a good life. Why must their lives be in danger just for wanting something so basic? This film's portrayal of these issues is very frank.",

The \"Mulan\" character, Parvana, is just a small girl. Instead of the Huns, she fights against systematic oppression, unrelenting poverty, and fanatic soldiers who would shoot children down for not abiding by the Sharia law. There are mines in the fields on the way to work. No budding romances, no fun songs to train to, no cathartic final battles of glory. It's just survival day in and day out.But the strength of an animated film is that even in rather dire scenes, the animators can still illustrate a quiet beauty in those war-torn towns and fields. As Parvana and her family try to keep each other in good humor with make-believe fables, the inner lives of these people can come alive in the fullest, brightest colors.The family in this story act like a real family, and every other character is just as deep and flawed as real life people anywhere. Some of them are good, some are selfish, but they are all very afraid and unsure of their futures. While the system of their society is shown as evil, very few characters are actually evil. And even for the most distasteful character I kind of felt pity for at the end. I appreciated the nuance and subtlety in the writing.",

The answer is that it highlights strength and hope, especially in Parvana's brave actions, and her family, despite its struggles, is ultimately able to stay together and reunite with their father.

Yet that's precisely what makes it a pleasure to watch, just not in the absent-minded \"how do I entertain my kids for a couple hours?\" way. Simply animated, softly spoken and not trying to crack jokes all the time, there's an endearing purity to \"The Breadwinner\" that becomes rather immediately apparent. The drawing style lack gritty details, and yet the characters are all extremely expressive, especially the big green eyes of protagonist Parvana (Saara Chaudry), a young girl living in Kabul, Afghanistan whose father is jailed by the Taliban for more or less talking back. Of course, losing your patriarch in a strict Muslim patriarchal society in which women must stay indoors or be accompanied by a man (and covered head to toe) is a problem, especially for Parvana, her mother, older sister and baby brother. Without any means to provide for themselves, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to sell goods and reading/writing services at the market, while also trying to make cash on the side to buy information about how she can rescue her father from prison.Interspersed throughout the narrative is Parvana telling a very long, traditional-sounding fairy tale, first to little brother Zaki, then to a girl her age who is also disguised as a boy and lastly to herself. The story of Sulayman, who went on a quest to retrieve his village's precious seeds from the evil Elephant King, gets told in a paper-cut animated style but is actually the most sophisticated element of the movie. One expects the tale of Sulayman to reveal an obvious moral parallel to Parvana's story, but this side narrative has much deeper and complex relationship with the main story.Despite the animation's technical simplicity, director Nora Twomey (\"The Secret of Kells\") builds an extremely vibrant Kabul. The film is never lacking for setting or context and certainly offers more of an authentic perspective on life in Afghanistan under the Taliban than any contemporary American war film audiences are used to. The realities of living under terrorist rule and being a Muslim woman are also extremely accessible to children Parvana's age (11) and older.Focusing on a traditional story of familial struggle, \"The Breadwinner\" manages to hit all its emotional marks and immediately root itself in viewers' hearts. It's so genuine, authentic and not flashy, which makes it an ideal tool for the emotionally mature child, not so much the easily distracted, younger variety.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The violence and hatred towards women is shown in The Breadwinner but in a way that isn't as graphic or realistic as in Osama. Because there is violence I don't recommend it for kids younger than 10. I'm actually confused as who the desired audience is. If it's not for kids, then why not show the absolutely horror tht is the Taleban? If it is for kids then why not make it a bit less frightening?",

            "content": "There were some pretty good animated movies that came out last year, like Coco, Loving Vincent, and The Lego Batman Movie, but there were some that were on the worse side, like The Emoji Movie and The Boss Baby. And The Breadwinner definitely falls into the better side.Along with unique and impressive animation, this movie delivers an interesting story that is told very well. It is certainly not the happiest movie, with the main topics focusing on sexism and war, but it is not trying to be happy, rather, it tries to be hopeful and enlightening. It treats these topics with respect and dignity, and seems to know what it's talking about. The music is used appropriately and is honestly fantastic.The only negative things I could say about this film are that the voice acting is okay and the ending could have been executed better, with it ending maybe a little too abrupt. Also, it feels a bit short and the pacing is a bit fast at times.Sadly, The Breadwinner will not win best animated picture at the Oscars, because both Coco and Loving Vincent are better made movies and are more popular. But, this film deserves a chance to be seen, as it is not only one of the best animated pictures of 2017, but is one of the most underrated movies of that year.",

In a country considered to be one of the most dangerous places for women, Parvana disguises herself as a boy in order to provide food and money to her family.Despite the violence being not explicit, the emotions and the message in this film are still very strong. It touches people, or at least it touched me. The production and editing were very good, I could hardly get bored. The saddest thing is it didn't win the oscar for best animation, which of course is understable because the oscars often focus their attention in films with an enormous budget but not so interesting story.This is the best animation film I have seen in two years or so, I will proudly have it on dvd if I see it.",

Basically set in 2001, in Kabul, Afghanistan, while it is under the control of the Taliban, eleven-year-old Parvana (Saara Chaudry) helps her father Nurullah (Ali Badshah), who lost one of his legs during The Soviet-Afghan War, with selling goods in the market. Nurullah is unjustly arrested after Idrees (Noorin Gulamgaus), a volatile young member of the Taliban, thinks he insulted him, leaving Parvana's family without an adult male relative, her elder brother Sulayman died years ago. Parvana, her mother Fattema (Laara Sadiq), her elder sister Soraya (Shaista Latif) and her baby brother Zaki (Lily Erlinghauser) are not allowed to go out without a male relative, so they have no means to support the family. After Parvana tries unsuccessfully to procure food going out as a girl, she decides to dress as a boy and pretend to be Nurullah's nephew, \"Aatish\" (meaning \"fire\") to support the family. During the time she is doing this, she often entertains her baby brother telling the story of a young man on a journey to defeat the evil Elephant King and help his village. The ploy works, Parvana is able to get food and money, and she befriend Shauzia (Soma Chhaya), another young girl dressing as a boy to support her family. On Shauza's advice, Parvana goes to the prison where her father is being held to try to bribe the guards into letting her see him, but this plan fails, Parvana is driven away. She starts saving money for a larger bribe, working hard labour jobs with Shauzia, who is saving up to get away from her abusive father, meanwhile Fattema is forced to write to a relative in Mazar, offering Soraya up for marriage in exchange for shelter and protection. Parvana also meets Razaq, who was with Idrees when her father was arrested; he is illiterate and pays her to read a letter, it says that his wife Hawla was killed, he befriends her and continues to meet with her so that she can teach him to read and write. Parvana and Shauzia take a job, Idrees is there and recognizes Parvana, he tries her as they both flee, they manage to hide and Idrees is abruptly called away to fight in the War of Afghanistan. Parvana returns home, Fattema pleads with her to stop the dangerous ploy, her relatives have accepted Soraya and will be collecting them the day after next, she agrees on the condition that she visits her father in prison to tell him where they will be living. Parvana says a tearful goodbye to Shauzia, promising they will meet again in 20 years from then, but the cousin expected arrives early and forces them to leave without Parvana, as the war is starting, and roads will be blocked. Fattema eventually stands up to her cousin, refusing to let him take them further, and he leaves the family stranded in the road. Parvana arrives at the prison, where she finds Razaq, after she reveals she is Nurullah's daughter, he tells her he will retrieve her father, as the prison clearing out of the weaker prisoners who cannot fight, some being executed. A terrified Parvana gathers her courage to stay by finishing the story of the boy, who she turns into Sulayman, who is revealed to have died when a land mine exploded. Razaq is attacked while rescuing the weak Nurullah, he is wounded, but the father and daughter are reunited, Parvana takes Nurullah away, where they will soon reunite with the rest of the family. This is an accomplished example that the animation genre can be so much more than entertainment, the story is not one I could see being done in live action, the colourful hand drawn animation is superb, the young lead character is the emotional draw, and the film is not afraid to tackle hard subjects as gently as possible, a compelling and inspired animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!",

It's probably just back to basics good story telling as the little details give us not only a rich sense of time and place but also give us characters that you feel like you could meet.I know it's sanctimonious to say that the unsugar-coated vision of social injustice and misogyny will make you angry but this stirred within me a visceral distaste for the culture I was witnessing along with a deep want to do something about it that I usually only get from Orwell.The protagonist is a lovely little girl who is not too much or too little in her seemingly futile attempts to navigate a world where the odds would be stacked against people much more influential than her. her voice actor endows her with spirit and anger without making her annoying.The use of a story within a story that the characters use for various purposes (distraction, not giving up hope) enriches the picture with a great heaping of culture and stylized animation that makes you truly feel you are at the centre of this turbulent period for this fascinating nation and the universality of what is happening as well as being beautiful and exotic in its own right.A complex but not convoluted story of the wrongs and tragedies we do to each; I could even feel empathy for the very people I hated in the first act, where the apparently evil are themselves humanized.This is a movie that is often radiant and enthralling but also left me in a very sobering state of mind, thinking about my own capacity to hate or apathy. The picture manages to avoid settling for easy answers or being remotely close to the \"feel good\" experience, while allowing to endow a sensation of hope and goodness in an otherwise crushing world.",

The girls are told fairy tales and religion, why would they need anything more than the material to indoctrinate their future sons?The virtuous old man is actually a governmental leech: once a school teacher, now he has lost all his government pension.The virtuous old man does not bother with the small details like:\n* his culture produced his tormentors\n* his education produced the culture that bread his tormentors\n* he is one of those who raised his tormentors\n* he is going to sell the girls like the tradition says, only there is a shortage of good suitors that could support him and his wife for life in exchange for his girlsIn turn, the girl will show the same indifference: the people are like infants. Evil forces conspire against them. And they are powerless. Thus the need for a hero. The precise mythology that got them all in trouble every time.

The artwork is beautiful and the scenes are heartfelt and considerate of the character's emotions, so we really form a connection with each of them.

This film was a beautiful way to highlight the real lethal struggles of women under the Taliban regime, and showed the dangerous strategies young girls have to go through to support their families. But it also shows this families bond and their traditions of story telling to quietly educate their daughters, as well as their faith and culture. Wonderful story and it's made me grateful for the things I have, instead of yearning for the useless things I want. For now at least. And that's the power in this film; it doesn't needlessly dramatize it or make it political, or tell it in a condescending way.

The animation is very nice, if a bit too stylized, the characters are very compelling and you are guaranteed to get angry at the helplessness of people in this bleak story.The story is based on the first book in the Breadwinner series, by Canadian writer Deborah Ellis, and you can see that the story is written by a Westerner, yet her work was directly inspired by interviews with real people.

However, I feel that it's a great family experience if everyone watching is mature enough to understand it. It uses its animated nature to great effect, somehow achieving a genuine balance between bleak and beautiful, and it highlights some very real issues still going on today. In a way, it's quite sobering; in another, it's quite hopeful. It uses its platform to send an, ultimately, empowering message. It helps that it's a diverse, female-driven movie (both in the frame and behind the scenes) in a system that often seems to suppress those. It's a remarkably brave but self-assured experience. It constantly makes bold decisions that have you on the edge of your seat, since it also does an excellent job of getting you invested in its characters. The finale, especially, is a tense, and thus, thrilling experience that weaves the real with the fantastical fantastically, finally bringing the latter full circle. See, its fantastical interludes may initially seem to be incentives for a portion of its audience that, by and large, just isn't there, but they're actually a way of showing how stories can often be one's only 'escape' and how they can be used to impart important messages even on those who may not want to hear them. On top of all that, the soundtrack is superb. It mightn't always be fun, but it's certainly powerful. 7/10",

Four films in, they haven't put a foot wrong with their releases yet. This 2017 production is very good - 8/10 from me, but it's a borderline 9/10 tbh.",

            "content": "Watching this with my family was a touch daring - my youngest just turned 11 - and the film depicts the harsh life experience of a family, and especially a young girl, in Kabul under the Taliban. Being animated makes the sense of horror a little less immediate and scenes of violence are mainly just off screen but the sense of danger and oppression is painfully real.That said I loved this movie. I thought the animation was perfect, subtle and appropriate, from the gritty slumy street scenes to the family arguments between sisters. The only character whose animation jarred was the baby brother who was a bit too cute, but that's a very picky complaint. The voice actors were superb, bringing the characters distinctively to life so convincingly they became instantly easy to relate to and engage with. Saara Chaudry as lead character Parvana was exceptional.My favourite element was the splicing of the harsh 'real-life' story, depicting people struggling to cope in an impossible situation, with the fantasy folk-tale story that Parvana tells her younger brother, her family, her friend and herself. The animation for this story brings colour, warmth and humour into play; the animation is cut outs with wonderful repeating motifs that swirl across the screen. I loved these brief changes of pace. The story-telling theme starts as with Parvana's father; she takes it up to entertain her little brother, but it develops to be both an escape from horror and a source of courage for the story-teller herself. This is achieved naturally and beautifully, making the viewer ask themselves, how would I survive, in a situation as bad as that? What story would I tell?This is a war story with women at the centre of the tale; sisters that bicker with each other, friends who bond, quarrel and support one another, a mother who takes terrible risks to try to protect her family. It neither excludes men nor implies that all men are vicious - indeed Parvana benefits from kind acts by strangers, and loves her father and baby brother. But it is so very rare to find a film where most of the main characters are female, and a fully rounded characters, that it seems like a minor miracle.I found the ending a little abrupt. It's not that I wanted a Hollywood all-loose-ends tied nonsense, but we went from the story to a black screen so suddenly I found it almost confusing. But overall I thought this was an exceptional film, a beautiful animation, depicting the appalling experience of war but with hints of courage, resilience and hope.",

Giving a face to a calamity that's quite possibly happening right now & using the canvas of an animated feature to process this complicated meal, one gleans the perils Islamic followers are going through when fascism rules the day. A nice double feature would be the indie live action Osama, released about a decade ago, which like Breadwinner encapsulates a world most Westerners have no idea about.",

I was elated when Netflix picked up this film so I could finally see it.What I really liked about the film was the layering of three stories together: the story of an Afghan girl who must pretend to be her dead brother to support her family (the primary animation style of the film), the mystical story of a young Afghan boy (her brother) who must fight evil forces (a secondary animation style in the film), and the story of the Afghan people through history (an oral story told by the girl's father to her). The weaving of these stories together is really artistic and beautiful.The story of the Afghan girl is an inspiring one for all women, who often make significant sacrifices to support their families and hold them together no matter what the odds or the circumstances. She is just a girl, yet she is heroic beyond her years. I think the filmmaker has done a remarkable job with this film, not just in terms of the quality of the animation and the layers of the story. The filmmaker took a big risk choosing this specific story because of both the geopolitical and cultural taboos. Despite those risks, SHE brought this story forward and told it in a very thoughtful way. Bravo!",

The political content of such a story is obvious and the film does well to acknowledge this aspect; but the film focuses on the personal is what makes it a truly great film. This is not a political polemic but rather a small intimate story that happens to be political.The animation is wonderfully expressive. I thought the story within the story was the more striking animations and the style invokes simple feels mythical. But not that the representational sections are bad. They are emotive and real in the way they are required to be.This is a hidden gem. Go find it.",

She is mean, unapologetically impolite, and cynical which mostly through her interactions with her sister and in the beginning of the film. A few sibling arguments or if they fought a few times but then learned to get along more would've been fine but it seems like every time Parvana and Soraya are on-screen together, they are bitter with each other and they never changed.Other than those two annoying me, it's an honest film but it's kind of sad. The plot could've been simpler but still pretty good. I also really liked the different animation styles and how the movie switches from Parvana telling a story to her actual life and her gaining confidence through her story.I can give this film a little respect for its decent directing and producing from the people who made \"The Secret of Kells\" and \"Song of the Sea\"",

In a Taliban ruled city in Afghanistan, women are strictly prohibited to go outside during the start of 21st century. Parvana, a brave and resourceful girl, has no clear idea of what she is hoping to ultimately accomplish when her father was falsely accused and imprisoned for being a threat to Islam.\nShe, cut off her hair to became a boy and tried to dress like a boy to roam around the city for finding a way to get her father out. In the meantime, a Elephant king story was told by her alongside with the main story. The Elephant King story, which is related in chunks throughout the film, too often disrupts the flow of the main story, and its ultimate purpose to help explain the whereabouts of Parvana's missing older brother, Sulayman. Two stories merge in the ending of the film.\nIn my opinion, the elephant king story was the main story, as it states how a country in the middle east - which was so powerful and educated, destroyed by the empires (the invaders). The children like Sulayman, who died on the street picking up a bomb while thinking it was a toy. That's the story, that's the secret of the film - to realize. Realize the consequences of War.Nora Twomey, the director, has previously created two of my favourite movies. The Secret of Kells - Official US Page, Song of the Sea. This one is the best, the animation, the story telling, the script, the characters and the music. Everything is perfect!",

The details put to it really shows what 2D animation is capable of. The highlight of the animation is definitely the parallel scenes of the stories they tell each other in the main character's family.The main family we follow with the middle child being the central character is so down to earth and a good depiction of how an Afghan family can be. How she disguises herself as a boy to provide for her family kind of reminded me of 'Mulan', but that was only a thought. I think we could have got a more focused narrative with less of the parallel stories, but they added up to a good pay-off, so they weren't pointless.You kind of wonder how movies like 'The Boss Baby' and 'Ferdinand' could be nominees to the Best Animated Feature Award along with 'The Breadwinner', because they both were so mindless and unoriginal.

And this film is an excellent drama, that is more aimed at adult than it is at kids.The Animation:\nThe animation to this movie is beautiful to look at, with a unique style, that looks like a cross between hand-drawn and flash animation. Creating such beautiful shots and images that I would hang on my wall.The Story & Characters:\nAs I explained before, the story is similar to Mulan. And this film is a lot darker in tone than Mulan, as it focuses more on the prejudices against women that run rampant in the Middle East. As the film went on, I was constantly invested, as you don't want her to be caught. Along with that, all the characters are interesting and down to earth people.Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, 'The Breadwinner' is one of the best animated films of the decade, and I will remember it for its great animation, mature storytelling, and interesting characters.",

I liked how it reflects the life of that time in the country, the animation and the dark history, which is very rare to see in animated movies. More or less after 1/4 of the film they tell us as a second story, metaphorically linked to the main plot. This is why i think animated movies are heavily underrated by modernist people. They think all of them has to be for childrens or they cannot told a realistic situation without any magic? NO!!!Some of the problems that the film may have is that this second story adds almost nothing to the plot, one can calmly skip it and one loses nothing, in addition to the fact that there are few characters and a variety of settings. It also does not explain if Parvana and Baba reunited with their family or that a little more is told about the war that was taking place, or how Rafaq was able to get rid of the guard with the AK-47, but apart from the bad, which is very minor, it is undoubtedly a great movie and I am going to praise the fact that it is very serious, because truly SERIOUS animated films without stupid and childish humor as is the custom today (which by the way I hate a lot), there are very few.",

The story is great and also the characters in it are very empowering. \nThe way it tells the story is awesome, because they had the ability to step out, they were original and creative, using so much colors and different animation. In motion pictures what matters is not if it is an entertaining story full of action or drama, but how the plot is told regarding of its theme.\nThe two combination of the animation present in this film and all the magical and non-magical parts in it, is extraordinary, at least for me. They not only try to show a little of reality of this culture but also a little of fantasy and art present everywhere, regardless of its culture. \nBreadwinner is really worth your time.\n8.8",

            "content": "The Breadwinner is one of the main reasons why foreign movie can sometimes be worth spending the extra cash on. Set in Aghanistan, it deals with a young girl who is trying to free her father from prison after he was wrongfully arrested. To do that, she disguises herself as a boy in order to make enough afghani to free him. She also tells the tale of a young boy who travels to reclaim seeds stolen by the elephant king (told through dream-like sequences). The movie portrays Aghanistan as a country in disrepair. Buildings look damaged, burnt cars appear on highways, and the movie invokes a dreary and sullen atmosphere. Afghans are portrayed in different ways; some are violent, while others are portrayed sympathetically (like the guard that helps the girl rescue her father).Character development is extremely well done, the animation is superb, particularly the story sequences, and the score sounds good while sounding authentic. My only complaint is that the movie didn't end perfectly well. While Parvana does rescue her father in the end, we do not see if she ever met her best friend who had also disguised herself as a boy. I watched the end credits to see if it was included there, but to no avail. I think the movie should have included a scene where they reunite and then end the movie. Overall, The Breadwinner is a very touching movie that is worth a watch.",

It kept me engaged with the ongoing scenes and the relativity moved me on a personal level. Being an intellectual woman in a conservative society is never easy and only through kindness, perseverance and love can we all find a way to what we really want to achieve.Through violence, there's no answer to any confliction.

It differs from their previous features in that it is an adaptation of a prominent, young adult novel rooted in contemporary, Taliban-era Afghanistan.\nWhat all three share is exceptional care taken in all aspects of production. Colour palettes are rich, animation is paced to suit narrative arcs, voice casting, sound design and music all propel the plot and enrich the visual style.\nIn keeping with the subject matter, The Breadwinner is faithful to the everyday actuality described in the story; daylight can be harsh, the streets noisy and dusty, dialogue is sparse or often confrontational but this is juxtaposed with the considered portrayal of Parvana's family's interior life, their strong love for each other in desperate circumstances and the film still retains elements of pleasure, humour, storytelling and fantasy to punctuate and re-frame the impossible choices inflicted upon the characters.\nAs is often the case with an adaptation from a book, I believe the plot has been somewhat simplified but (whilst not a reader of the book myself) I don't feel there is any loss to the momentum.\nThe film's impact is still felt for some time after viewing and I fell that it's themes will (unfortunately) remain relevant for some time to come.",

Let me tell you why it isn't:The story is strong and honest as it is emotional, at some places, there are times when some of the scenes does drag for too long, but at the most, it is rather minir for the writing that we got here. The beardwinner ahow us that gender rules still exist, and that it is bad as it is a threat. Some peopole can argue that the story is a little predictable, but it actualy works for what its trying to be.The animation of cartoon saloon alawys had proved again and again how great they are. The backgrounds are not colorful to present the village in a more realstic manner, but the looks of it is more abstract as the cartoon saloon style is. The character designs share that style in thr best way possible. The smooth movements really brings them to life by how they are look. In the story sequences the colors are more hybrid to show it comes from a mind of a child. As the story, the animation is great for what it is, in here, its just breathtaking.The characters are both likeable and relateable to carry the film, all of them feels rally human and possibly the film's strongest aspect. The girl (Parvana) is detrmind to see her father, she is why this movie is so emotional and GOOD. Her father had being taken and now they can't get out of home. As the characters are written, they are both powerful, and timeless.The breadwinner is one of the finest examples of animation, storytelling and the reality of gender roles. This is REALLY underrated. And for how it is, the peopile that don't like it should be ashamed!",
