            "content": "Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski's masterful achievement - Aguirre: The Wrath of God (Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes) is a rich and powerful film set deep in the the South American rain forest. Ostensibly a piece of historical fiction based on fragmentary evidence concerning one of the many ill-fated attempts to find and conquer the mythic El Dorado (a city of gold rumored to be anywhere from southern Canada to Patagonia), Aguirre operates on so many levels and reflects so many aspects of its story that it is difficult to convey precisely what the film is really about. It is too fictionalized (yet plausible) to fit comfortably in the \"historical fiction\" shoebox; the dialog is as much a presentistic bit of reflexive thinking as it is fitting for the historical context of the film; and the setting is so breathtaking that without a plot and without the brilliant concept and fantastic acting, the film would still be breathtaking and painful.The opening scene, which very slowly depicts a caravan of Spanish soldiers, African and South American Indian slaves, burros, horses, cannons, and provisions making their way down a steep mountain path surrounded by miles of rain forest, is breathtaking and ominous, and sets not just the tone, but the pace of the film. Many people will find the pace a little too slow to handle. After a few minutes of struggle, the nobleman leader of the expedition throws in, and appoints a small number of participants to go forward into the jungle. Of these, only Lope Del Aguirre, a career soldier with vast ruthless ambition, and Ursua, a more gentle nobleman, are really leadership material. As the party floats down-river on rafts, it rapidly becomes clear by whose will the party continues on, and who will emerge as its sole leader in the end.Herzog develops some of his usual themes in this film, and does so with poignancy and cinematography nothing short of beauty. The film is about power, madness, religion, oppression, nature, and culture, but certainly does not stop there. This is film as high art. Brilliantly executed, multi-faceted, moving, and as ambiguous as real life so often is.This is also one of the great actor Klaus Kinski's most profound and appealing roles. Though Kinski was later typecast in mad, or at least eccentric, roles, as Aguirre he is able to show his range very effectively - because the character varies from a cold, brooding, Machiavellian rationalism to an obsessive sociopathic suicidalism. The rest of the cast rises to the challenge and acts right at Kinski's level, making this film one of the best actors/production team collaborations I have ever seen.This film is definitely not for everybody, it is a long, slow sip of delicious and yet bitter wine which the typical movie-goer will only appreciate when 'in the mood' for something which requires thought and energy to watch. It is also one of my favorite films of all time.",

            "content": "\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\":  Werner Herzog is one of my all-time favorite film makers, and this is one of my favorite films by him.  Actually taken from the diary of the priest who accompanied Pizarro's expedition in 1560, Herzog recreates the pretentious and self-deluded search for the \"Lost City of Gold - Eldorado\".  Herzog likes true stories...ones that are bizarre in their own right, but with his direction and personal vision, they become profound (and never optimistic).  The camera work is always interesting (he single-handedly \"patented\" camera shots that don't sweep - they (\"you\") stare and stare - and stare - at a thing or person or place until it becomes abstract, intense, beautiful, threatening, profound), the scoring is always appropriate yet never expected, and his casting, often using the unique talents of the late Klaus Kinski, guarantee nothing less than an intense experience...even in a film like \"Aguirre\", which SLOWLY claws and slogs it's way along each and every slippery, dangerous, foreign mile of jungle. \nIt is clear Herzog 'focuses' on the ridiculously high beliefs humans create for and hold of themselves - that they could actually \"own\" anything, \"conquer\" anything, outwit that which they do not understand, and by sheer Will cause anything they deem important, to exist.  Herzog is NOT a cheerleader for the history of humans, but he is a ponderer... and we are fortunate he does it on film.",

            "content": "AGUIRRE: THE WRATH OF GOD (Werner Herzog - West Germany 1972).Herzog's daring and unconventional approach in film-making is something very few filmmakers can match. Due to the incredible hardships while filming on location in the Amazonian jungle, the myth surrounding AGUIRRE has almost outgrown the virtues of the film itself and over the years it has become an almost integral part when (re)viewing this film, even more so since Herzog's documentary MY BEST FIEND (1999) was released about his relationship with \"best enemy\" and star in many of his films, Klaus Kinski.A mesmerizing exploration of human obsession based on the diaries of Gaspar de Varvajal, a monk who accompanied Gonzalez Pizarro (half-brother of the brutal conqueror of the Incas) and died during the expedition, the film chronicles Pizarro's 1560 Peruvian expedition in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. When the expedition is faltering by the difficult terrain, Pizarro decides to send a small party ahead to determine if exploration should continue. Though Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) is put in charge, he is soon challenged by the ambitious fanatical Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), who against all odds wants the journey to continue, with catastrophic consequences. One of the key elements in Herzog's work is the use of landscape and the natural surroundings. The Amazonian jungle is a key third dimension in the film and really is a green hell, threatening and unforgiven. There's no romanticism in Herzog's view of nature. The continuing sounds of the running water and the birds are just as important for the story and the despair of Aguirre's men as the ambient electronic soundtrack by the German ensemble Popol Vuh, the ultimate modern and very German pioneers in electronic music, mixing choral chants with electronic samples and organ music. To me it is simply astonishing Herzog decided to use their in a film about 16th century Spanish explorers shot on location in the Amazon and somehow it works wonderfully, a perfect blend of image and sound. Hard to identify a very important element of the \"natural soundtrack\": what's the name of the bird that produces this whistling shriek, that is heard almost continuously in the background and is one of the most recognizable sounds of Neo-tropical rain forests? A Quetzal? Klaus Kinski's performance is a perfect match for Aguirre's descent into madness, eerily resemblant to Kinski's own Mad Kraut persona and well-published rampant behavior on the set and his misconduct in general actually. Watching the film for the first time with audio commentary by Herzog and he revealed many things I never heard before. One of the strangest anecdotes is not really about the film itself but is, well..truly one of the most bizarre things I ever heard. Before the shooting started, Herzog and his crew were boarding for the plane that would bring them from Lima to Cuzco when the airplane had some technical problems. Since the airline company in question already had two or three serious accidents not long before, they decided to wait and take the next plane. Repaired or not, the plane left off anyway and crashed in the Amazonian jungle with the only survivor a young German woman, Juliane Koepcke. After weeks she finally reached a remote Indian village, malnourished, an almost fatal larval infection, close to death. Later Herzog would make a documentary about this, JULIANES STURZ IN DEN DSCHUNGEL (English title: Wings of Hope) (2000). Besides the already astonishing, many times near-fatal accidents and Kinski's impossible madman behavior, this film seemed doomed from the start, like an old curse from the Incas.For those less familiar with Herzog's work, FITZCARRALDO (1982), also by Herzog and shot under equally horrendous conditions in the Peruvian jungle, would make a good companion piece. For Herzog's relationship with Kinski there is the interesting documentary MEIN LIEBSTER FEIND (My best fiend) (1999).Camera Obscura --- 10/10",

            "content": "Filmed not far from Machu Picchu, the legendary lost city of the Incas in the mountains of Peru, the opening images of this film are breathtaking in their natural grandeur and visual scale. A long cavalcade of 16th century Spanish soldiers slowly winds its way, serpentine like, down a steep mountain face. It's one of the most impressive and awe-inspiring openings in film history.The soldiers are searching for El Dorado, the fabled Andean city of gold. The caravan includes the story's main character, Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), a greedy, ambitious soldier who will stop at nothing in his quest for riches and power. Also included is Inez, a young, well-meaning woman who wears blue velvet and white lace. Representing the Spanish Crown, she rides in a wheeless carriage, described in the movie as the \"sedan-chair\", a flimsy, enclosed wooden box toted by other soldiers. The carriage, painted blue and red, is so out of place in this rugged wilderness, it's the first clue that the entire mission is a fool's errand, based on romantic dreams and delusions. Against the backdrop of towering mountains and dense jungle, the sedan-chair and Inez' regal looking clothes make Spanish royalty look impotent.Eventually, only a small convoy of soldiers, along with Inez and her sedan-chair proceed, as El Dorado becomes ever more elusive. Down the Amazon River the little band of adventurers traverse, encountering one problem after another. Aguirre, having long since taken command, leads them on, ever in search of that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.Throughout the film, Aguirre rarely smiles. He displays a strange body language, sometimes leaning sideways or backwards, his thoughtful, stern face with reactions that are slow and deliberate. His behavior suggests other Messianic \"leaders\", like Jim Jones, who led his flock of followers to their doom in 1978 in the jungles of Guyana.\"Aguirre, The Wrath Of God\" is a story of adventure, a story about the mystery of the unknown. It's a story about dreams and fantasies of greed. It's a very physical film. Every single scene, without exception, was filmed outdoors.It's a non-Hollywood type film, too. There are no sets, and some of the plot and dialogue are improvised, enhancing spontaneity and grim realism. It's a film not unlike \"Deliverance\" (1972).\"Aguirre, The Wrath Of God\" is one of the most visually striking film I have ever seen. And the underlying theme of mankind's arrogance, against an implacable Nature, is starkly apparent. The film is visionary, profound. It will leave many viewers changed, enriched, perhaps even a little wiser.",

            "review_title": "Herzog's jungle descent into hell",
            "content": "Werner Herzog's bleak masterpiece might well be the best film the auteur has ever made \u2013 a masterful movie that embodies the director's offbeat career with a perfectly realised study of madness and ultimately despair. The story itself is simple \u2013 a boatload of Spanish Conquistadors travel down the Amazon, in search of the legendary lost city of El Dorado. The realisation is something else. Herzog's close-up cameras capture every moment of the journey, focusing on the faces of the men who undergo what quickly turns into an ordeal. The film is dotted with set-pieces that impress: a raft caught swirling endlessly in a whirlpool, a boat stuck high in a tree and a visit to (and hasty retreat from) a cannibal village. However, it's the 'quiet' moments that Herzog captures so well, the hope and then stark realisation as it crosses the faces of his men.I found this film tremendously spooky. The hostile natives are barely seen, and the characters barely notice the arrows sticking from their bodies. The cannibal village is one of the eeriest moments captured on film. But there's humour here, too, with an early 'talking severed head' gag and the final scenes that reveal Kinski's madness. The use of the baby monkeys is a wonderful idea and the film never runs out of steam, getting stronger as it goes along. The ending might be inevitable, but it's the journey that grips the viewer. You'll laugh, shake your head and even cry at the events which unfold; I found the bit with the horse particularly moving, despite the absurdity of the situation.The film belongs to the maverick actor that is Kinski. He's perfectly cast as the unhinged Aguirre, and one of the maddest actors ever seen on film. I'd say that this was the highlight of a long and varied career. Still, the supporting cast are all great too, with nobody putting a foot wrong. The theme may be familiar from the likes of Conrad's novel HEART OF DARKNESS and Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, but Herzog's vision is all his own \u2013 and as a result this is one of the most unique and compelling jungle movies out there.",

            "content": "Klaus Kinski's enigmatic and frightening portrayal of man's obsession in Werner Herzog's nightmare masterpiece Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is a German film that is as powerful today as it was when released back in 1972. Kinski and Herzog's absolute real life hate for one another only makes the film more real in its depiction of a man driven to the edge of sanity as his obsession for a mythical treasure - so obsessed that he sacrifices all that is precious to him in finding it. Like the 'Mosquito Coast', an almost identical film, it concentrates on the human condition, in how far 'man' can go in his quest of becoming God. Werner Herzog, who's persistence in Klaus Kinski to star in most of his films, is a master storyteller and one great director, famous for other films starring Kinski including \"Fitzcarraldo\" and \"Woyzeck\". \"Aguirre: The Wrath Of God\", however, is his and Klaus Kinski's most famous and one of the most powerful films of all time.Entirely a true story, set in the 1600s, following the annihilation of the Incas Empire, when the Spanish Conquistadors explored and roamed most of South America, a legendary expedition set out in Peru into the Amazon River to locate the mythical City Of Gold, El Dorado. Pizarro, the leader of the expedition comes to the point where he must turn and head back to civilization, following a long and tormenting journey that ultimately led them to nowhere. Fearing they'll get lost in the uncharted jungles of the Amazon, he sends a smaller group to complete the journey and commands them to return within a few days if no Gold is found. It is only a matter of time before this group faces unbearable difficulties down the Amazon River. Fearing the leader of their new group might turn back to prevent any more men being killed, Don Lope de Aguirre (Kinski) inspires a mutiny and manipulates the men in believing that with the riches they would find they wouldn't need to go home. They must battle with the native enemy they can't see and walk through the most difficult terrain on a most terrifying quest. What follows is a devastating character study of human nature and how one's obsession can destroy him and everything that really matters.This film comes as a rarity in our world gone mad - a world controlled by greedy, obsessed and powerful dehumanized people. Klaus Kinski was one of the world's most profound and versatile actors. His rough, striking and villainous exterior gave him an almighty presence. He creates such a vividly obsessed and evil character in the film, you are easily convinced he is for real. I believe his abhorrence for Werner Herzog assisted him in his performance. Never during filming did they ever share ideas, always opposing and showing one's hatred for one another, which leaves people questioning their constant repairing. But Werner Herzog makes no mistake when casting Kinski in his films. Kinski drives the film, sometimes completely on his own. Werner Herzog's films are always extremely deep, philosophical and mythical. The cinematography is consistently breathtaking and never fails to transport you to the world Herzog intends to take you. And music perfectly paints the picture of human degradation, with its slow, subtle and haunting tone. It sticks in your head long after the conclusion and adds immensely to the the power of the film.'Aguirre: The Wrath Of God', much like 'The Mosquito Coast', is one of the most poignant character studies in film history. It is in German with subtitles, but you are bound to forget they are there, as this epic film will take you to the vast and dehumanizing Amazon on an adventurous journey you will never forget. See this for the adventure if not for the underlining depth. It is a master work from a unique artist that is Werner Herzog and made a classic by the colossal Klaus Kinski. A beautiful and haunting experience that is not to be missed.",

            "content": "This is an amazing experience, becoming more so the further we get from it. When I see 'Apocalypse Now, or even 'Mosquito Coast' I see this. In fact whenever I see both an actor AND a director/writer risking all in a coordinated way, I see this. And when I see a combination of fictional documentary and highly stylized poses, a memory of this glistens.I highly suggest a periodic refresh-viewing of this film on a big screen, followed of course by 'Fizcarraldo.' with some life-affirming experience in between. In that film, the jungle and river is engaged, animate: here it forms an organic container for fantasies. This is one of the most visual film experiences you will have, but so much of what you take away is what is not seen. Superficially, it is a depiction of madness in a context of religious colonialism, rank exploitation. But the complexities abound, and the one that captured me this time around was the women. The first scene is the most promising in all filmdom. In addition to its beauty, we get it all in promises; and among the promises is the women. Two senior-level military men are allowed to bring females on an expedition worthy of Bird or Lewis and Clark - this at extreme expense. The obvious reason for the women is as breeders to populate the New Jerusalem of riches and religious conquest.One woman we understand, an adult mistress to a noble soul. We learn more about her than anyone else save the 'Negro.' She is played by an accomplished actress, and acts. The other woman is a fifteen year old. A daughter, already aware of a forthcoming incestuous dynasty and resigned to a life with her deformed father in a magical future to be obtained only by passing through a barrier of tests. She, like the local Indians, is played by a non-actress, in fact a girl plucked out of a Peruvian high school nearly at random.The less she does, the more transcendent her presence. We don't see her die, but as she knows she is dying she looks at her father as if to transfer all her energy to the space immediately surrounding him. That space does become filled with fantastic life on the raft and all that surrounds it, creating the sequence that ends the film. That scene perfectly compliments the first, where the people are the river bringing their seed to the promised land. In the last, the seed is released and the river itself carries the offspring of the imagination to the treetops.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.",

            "content": "A Spanish expedition is sent out to travel deep into the jungle and find the legendary city of El Dorado and recover its gold for the throne of Spain. Quickly the expedition gets into trouble and leader Don Pedro de Ursua decides that they must turn back. However to do this is not an option to Don Lope de Aguirre, who leads a violent rebellion, culling those loyal to Ursua and officially breaking off ties with Spain. The group continue down the river in search of their goal but conditions are hard and it is only the increasingly unrealistic aims of Aguirre that drives them onwards.In both the film and the making of the film this is best sold as a medieval Apocalypse Now as it has a great collection of stories behind it while also being an interesting journey into the mouth of madness. The \"making of\" is told better other places than I can do here so I shan't bother, but suffice to say that at times the film feels like Herzog is just watching his cast to see what happens and not just following his characters. The plot sees them gradually fall from the pomp and civility that they start the film with and this is no surprise, but the manner in which it happens is still interesting and engaging. Some viewers may find it going where they expect it to, but this should not surprise anyone and it shouldn't stop the majority of people enjoying the journey.Herzog's direction is strong throughout. He does well with what was a very difficult shoot and he gets plenty of strong shots out of it \u0096 all of which still stand up as being impressive by today's standards. His direction of actors may not have been quite as good but the performances are still very good. Kinski is very strong in the lead role and, whether acting or not, he is totally convincing as he loses touch with reality. The support are all good, although Kinski is obviously where the picture is.Overall an impressive film that is more worthwhile watching because of the stories behind it. The narrative may be simple and obvious enough but it is still very engaging as a journey or rather descent. Is maybe praised a little bit too highly by some but is a fascinating film regardless.",

            "content": "German director Werner Herzog is one talented film-maker, with some of his films among the finest of German cinema. Meanwhile, one of his most frequent collaborators Klaus Kinski was a somewhat larger than life actor in terms of screen presence with a seamlessly commanding if at times wild style of acting.Having heard nothing but good things about 'Aguirre Wrath of God' and finally getting back on track with my film watching, it was at long last viewed. Whether it is the best Herzog/Kinski collaboration is up for debate, to me it's among the best. It is still a crowning achievement for both Herzog and Kinski and a fine example of German cinema. No matter how much it has divided audiences it cannot be denied how much effort went into 'Aguirre Wrath of God', especially with its troubled production behind the scenes.'Aguirre Wrath of God' is quite brilliantly made. The cinematography and editing may not be some people's definition of \"beautiful, but they are still impeccably crafted and enhance the harrowing atmosphere magnificently. Every bit as impressive is the locations and how they are used. Having real life locations rather than studio sets gave the film so much realism, and they are both stunning and atmospheric. The music is sometimes sparse but when used pretty haunting.Typically Herzog directs splendidly, delivering on the substance as well as the style. The script is largely improvisational but it is remarkable that it still flowed surprisingly well. 'Aguirre Wrath of God' is not a long film and it's paced in a way that while deliberate and nuanced one never feels every second or minute. Instead if in the right mood or taking the film for what it is and what it set out to do one gets swept up by the shocking power and poignancy of what is depicted.On top of all this, the acting is remarkable, considering the conditions and that the script was written in haste and apparently the actors weren't even permitted to see it, let alone read it. There is not a single weak performance but it is Kinski who dominates the cast and the film, a powerful and chilling performances that burns long in the memory. Not a subtle performance by any stretch but the role (which is a deliberately eccentric one, a trademark of Herzog being having eccentric character in difficult conditions) and the film didn't call for subtlety really.In conclusion, a crowning achievement in every regard. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This proclamation comes from Don Lope de Aguirre, sailing aboard a lifeless raft, drifting aimlessly down the interminable run leading to the fabled city of El Dorado. This quote is a perfect representation of the mindset of Aguirre, 'The Wrath of God'. He is consumed within his unrelenting determination to satisfy his deepest desires of avarice, supremacy, and grandeur. His obsessions slowly begin to affect his judgment, and his passion enthusiastically blinds his perception of reality, blurring the distinct line between actuality and fabled illusion. Aguirre becomes firmly intent on conquering all of South America, of breaking away from the Spanish crown and beginning a new world securely under his unconditional domination.Aguirre becomes capable of garnering support among his men through promises of unimaginable riches, impenetrable authority and security, and perhaps most importantly, with the promise of a glorious adventure into the heart of the unfamiliar. However, it must be understood that Aguirre was able to initially succeed in his plans due to the willingness and complicity of the men under his control. The absence of dissension was due not only to fear of the potential consequences, but was also a result of the general attitude of the available men. The promises of the power of greed were compelling enough to create strict uniformity and acquiescence to the selfish goals of Aguirre. The story of Herzog's film is as old as the history of Western civilization itself. One infatuated madman becomes able to rally the spirit of a foolish herd behind him through the false promises of unrestricted glory, indestructible power, and incomprehensible wealth. Of course, the second part of Herzog's film is also the most common, recognizable conclusion to such a familiar story. All authority must cease eventually, as nothing built on the foundations of deception and falsity can stand forever. It is through this identifiable situation that Herzog is able to illustrate the fragility and insanity of such wild quests for power. All men maintain the same illusions of grandeur and magnificence, however the attempted acquisition of such desires can often result in tragic consequences, as is made evident in Aguirre's most logical conclusion. What are the tragic consequences of Aguirre's pursuit of the unattainable? The most obvious response to this question would be the loss of his only daughter, his sole reason for being and continuance in the face of adversity. His quest for power is not only a self-satisfying attempt to escape the dreadful monotony of mortality, but it is also meant to bring veneration, allegiance and complicit submission to the forthcoming generations of his family line. The death of his daughter is the signification of the death of Aguirre's unforeseen future, and the cessation of his greatest hopes and aspirations. The tragic separation between a father and his daughter is a universally empathized situation, and Herzog does well to incorporate this moment of indeterminable significance into his film's climactic infusion of incalculable remorse and impending self-destruction. However, despite the realization that his journey has ended in complete failure, Aguirre remains entrapped within his ideological pursuits. He refuses to accept his defeat, and remains steadfastly determined to conquer all that surrounds him. Even the death of his own daughter is not enough to shake the madman from the foundations of his deepest latent fixations, made manifest through the complete destruction and manipulation of his encompassing environment. Aguirre continues to outwardly express his darkest desires, failing to identify his complete isolation and withdrawal from reality. Even when there is nobody to share his inane ramblings with, Aguirre remains absorbed within his delusions. His slow descent into madness comes full circle at the film's conclusion, as Aguirre remains the sole survivor aboard the aforementioned direction less raft, sailing toward some unmistakably predetermined termination. The film's ending is illustrative of the typical conclusion of the typical madman's expedition. There is nobody left for Aguirre to command or abuse, to consult with or confide in, to inspire or to befriend. This is because Aguirre failed to grasp the inevitable futility of his situation, and the enigmatic insanity with which he conducted his operation. Herzog's conclusion is not quite as clear and decisive as some would leave you to believe. Certainly, Aguirre has lost his source of power, his meaning for continuation, and his sanity in the process. However, he is still alive, and he has not learned anything from his experience; he is just as stubbornly determined as when his exploration began. Perhaps this can be viewed as a not so subtle commentary on the inability of selfishly driven men to realize the folly of their ways, and to seek forgiveness from those that they have harmed in the process. Or perhaps Herzog is suggesting that men like Aguirre will always survive the repercussions of the materialization of their own insane aspirations, and it is only the sheep that will suffer the consequences from compliance and strict obedience. Or perhaps the survival of Aguirre is an illustration of the indestructible perpetuation of human greed, cruelty, and irrationality. With men like Aguirre readily available in the world, it is only plausible that such failed expeditions will be tried again. Logic that 'The Wrath of God' himself employs as justification for the continuance of his adventure in the face of overwhelming odds. Whatever Herzog's implications in the final scenes suggest, it is only certain that Aguirre's stubbornness resulted in a path of unnecessary obsessive destructiveness; An obsession that destroyed all hope for the future, and made a mockery of the past.",

            "content": "One of the reasons I go to the movies is to experience a place that I would otherwise not get to see. In Werner Herzog's astonishing \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" we are taken into the Andes region of the Middle and South Americas in the mid-16th century and are exposed to incredible images and faces. It's a haunting masterpiece that seems ageless.At first sight, the costumes and effects seem amaturish, but quickly we realize that this makes the film superior to what it would have been if it had been made with a larger budget; it adds to the film's artistry and authenticity. Film is a visual medium and it works best when the images we see are not tied down to strictly suit the plot; this film is a feast for the eyes.The plot, what little there is, is very simple: a crew aboard a raft are attempting to get to the City of Gold, El Dorado. Much like Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now,\" we are taken on a mesmerizing journey into the depths of madness with the focus being primarily on mood, setting, atmosphere and images.Klaus Kinski, in one of the best performances I've seen, embodies the insanity that comes with the quest for power. The physicality of Kinski's performance is startlingly effective - he seems drunk on his own sense of power and recalls Brando, Dean, and a young De Niro or Pacino at their most absorbed.The music in the film inspires a sense of awe and wonder that, along with the lush landscape and vistas, succeeds in taking us to another place. These are the kinds of films I love: a director so obsessed with achieving a sensation of marvel, so ambitious in his scope that we are free to wander within the film's world as we watch the characters journey into the mysterious unknown of their mind.There are many good, very good and great films - too many to list, in fact. What I am hoping to do is label each film I see fit as a \"masterwork\".This film is a masterwork.****",

It is set in the 16th century, the ruthless and insane Aguirre leads a Spanish expedition in search of El Dorado. It deals with an expedition under command of Pedro Ursua (Ruy Guerra) with various officers . The travelers who are over-dressed for the heat in their old world clothes and armour must survive the crises of jungle life and human frailty . The river , jungle scenery and several dangers dominate the motley characters in the risked journey . But later on , Lope De Aguirre (Klaus Kinski , who was the start of an extremely stormy, and sometimes violent, professional relationship with Herzog that lasted 15 years) taker over the explorers .Slow-moving and interesting film that contains historical events , thrills , double-crosses and wonderful scenarios . The picture has been criticized for its plodding argument , with brief moments of tension where the travelers must survive the crises of jungle life and human frailty . Good performance from Klaus Kinski , who plays this actual historical character of strange manner , as usual . According to director Werner Herzog, Klaus Kinski threatened to abandon the film entirely at one point during the shooting. Herzog says he threatened to kill Kinski and then turn the gun on himself if Kinski left and later declared he was quite prepared to do so. Kinski stated in interviews that Herzog wielded a pistol to emphasize the threat, but Herzog denies this. Werner Herzog claims to have written the screenplay in two and a half days , he wrote a good portion of it while traveling with his soccer team, during games and on bus rides . Rare musical score and colorful cinematography , though most of the film, as well as several other features by Werner Herzog, was shot on a 35mm camera that he stole from his film school . The motion picture was originally directed by Herzog , though he did not storyboard a single frame of the film and ll of it was shot and framed spontaneously. In 1988 was realized another version titled \u00a8El Dorado\u00a8 by Carlos Saura ; because of a similarity in plot and characters, the movie suffers by comparison but stands on its own as a less fantastic version of the same travel of obsessed adventurers . Rating : Above average , it's considered to be a \"Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time\" The picture is based on real incidents , these are the followings : Together with his daughter he joined the 1560 expedition of Pedro De Urs\u00faa down the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Amazon Rivers with 300 Spaniards and hundreds of natives ; the actual goal of Urs\u00faa was to send veterans from the former Peruvian civil wars away, to keep them from troublemaking, using the Eldorado myth as a lure . A year later, he participated in the overthrow and killing of Urs\u00faa and his successor, Fernando De Guzm\u00e1n, whom he ultimately succeeded. He and his men reached the Atlantic (probably by the Orinoco River), destroying native villages on the way. On March 23, 1561, Aguirre urged 186 captains and soldiers to sign an act which would proclaim him as prince of Peru, Tierra Firma and Chile. He is reputed to have said in 1561: I am the Wrath of God, the Prince of Freedom, Lord of Tierra Firme and the Provinces of Chile In 1561, he seized Isla Margarita and brutally suppressed any opposition to his reign, killing many innocent people. When he crossed to the mainland in an attempt to take Panama, his open rebellion against the Spanish crown came to an end. He was surrounded at Barquisimeto, Venezuela, where he murdered his own daughter, Elvira, \"because someone that I loved so much should not come to be bedded by uncouth people\". He also killed several followers who intended to capture him. He was eventually captured and shot to death. Aguirre's body was cut into quarters and sent to various cities across Venezuela.",

            "content": "If a guy standing on a raft, as the camera spins round and round it in 180 degree fashion, clutching a monkey looking as dazed and confused as we might well be whilst talking about ideas of world domination and how they'll take on nations single-handedly sounds like the sort of film you'd like, then you'll love Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes. But don't let the sheer avant-garde nature of that scene fool you into thinking it's something that sounds quite silly because the film is anything but. Aguirre, the Wrath of God is a bizarre and yet strangely compelling piece that teeters on the brink of fiction film-making and documentary but for sure, charges through the barrier labelled 'art'.So where to start with a film as bizarre as Aguirre? The film is like a docu-drama; a biopic of absolutely nobody in particular and yet you feel it centre around something anyway \u0096 what could it be: a man going insane? A heritage film about the Spanish conquistadors made by the Germans? An experiment of a film shot in the jungle merely to make it more gruelling for the cast and crew? Well, it's probably all of these things and much more. Aguirre, the Wrath of God sees Klaus Kinski's Don Lope de Aguirre lead, eventually, many Spanish soldiers through the jungles in search of El Dorado, the city of gold. Immediately, this establishes a sense of greed amongst the characters added only further by the establishment of their location. The jungle is thick and intense, with several shots dedicated to seeing the soldiers hack their way through it for cannons and royal boxes to proceed. The very first shot of the film sees steep South American hills cover the screen. The people are shown to be microscopic versions of themselves, making them look like ants crawling down a hill - a cannon is dropped accidentally but they must go on.Such an immediate beginning and choice of shot, composition and subject matter is quite brilliant \u0096 it puts us right there and tells us exactly what they're up against. We might think this is a man vs. nature tale, but the third element of the tribal natives are an important and somewhat enjoyable addition to the story. As a setting and as a set up, the film ticks plenty of boxes but as a character study Kinski's Aguirre is both bizarre and yet fascinating all the same. Aguirre is given a bizarre sort of face thanks to the casting of Kinski, also his actions and general body language right from the off implant a certain degree of un-canniness or eccentricity about him.So for a film to establish both setting and characterisation of the lead role in such a manner is impressive; nobody else is really developed or has as much attention paid to them because, simply put, they are not as important. The film's narrative may feel as if it is lacking in this disorientating and surreal film and yet if anything adds to the brilliance of the film. More contemporary examples of this could perhaps be seen in other such off-the-wall films that revolve around an (in)sane protagonist such as Taxi Driver and American Psycho but Aguirre, the Wrath of God is more-so a rural version of those sorts of approaches. If one were to look more recently at a cause and effect passage of storytelling in a film demanding a man vs. nature perspective, one might find the final half an hour of Apocalypto as a good example.The one scene that does stand out as a clear tactic to confuse and force the audience into thinking is the one in which, very early on \u0096 (perhaps the initial incident?) the leader of the Spaniards is killed off through one way or another creating an ambiguous situation in which the group are already established to be struggling, Aguirre seems to be going a little crazy and now nobody can lead them to El Dorado. This is where, of course, Aguirre's character study kicks in. As a mission and as an idea for the narrative, searching for El Dorado is both brave and foolish of the team. Aguirre further looks insane when he uses the last resorts of the recent conquest of Mexico as a drive for success, something completely unrelated and something rather different to searching for something that could quite possibly not exist. Rather than an example of poor story telling emphasised by unrelated dialogue, it actually acts as a well timed line about something else uttered by someone perhaps going under.And so from this setting of the scene, the character introduction and scenario Aguirre and the band of soldiers travel on a mere raft, down a river which you very much get the feeling is of no return. But that's part of that particular beauty, we never really know where it leads or how they'll get back. The film becomes a series of scenes that play on both nature, the third element of the natives complete with deadly arrows and trouble afoot on the raft itself. Each of the three make up a dramatic and artistic triangle that engrosses and entertains. Incidentally nearer the end, Aguirre seems more interested in conquering Port-of-Spain in Trinidad than finding a city of lost gold \u0096 perhaps that is the one sane moment in the film Aguirre expresses: his realisation that such a thing could probably only exist in legend.",

            "content": "The caravan of the longing is moving downward, from the cloudy peaks of the Andes into the valley. They are longing for El Dorado, the land of gold. They want happiness in this life. One of them is longing for power, too, he wants to emulate Hernando Cortez, the man who subjugated the Azthecs in Mexico and created a new big empire, bigger than the mother country Spain. His name is Don Lope de Aguirre.But there is a blatant contradiction between claims and reality, although at first, everything seems to go according to plan. Aguirre does succeed in taking command of the troops by accusing the old leader of treason and having him condemned to death. And the soldiers do follow him, apparently without any questioning, into the remotest swamps of the Amazon Basin, driven by the only thought of easily to be acquired wealth. But innumerable adversities accompany an expedition that is heading for disaster. Fatal arrows are whizzing across the river to the men's raft, thrown by some invisible Indians. Supplies are dwindling. And the ill-humor of the soldiers is increasing as they realize that they have left themselves in the hands of a madman. Nonetheless they do nothing to change their fate.This gives rise to the thought of drawing a parallel to recent German history. Aguirre seems to have Hitler's features. He stays on his raft until the very end, even when everything around him has already died off and he is surrounded by nothing but the pitiful squealing of an armada of monkeys. The raft is turning around, hallucinations arise and are not to be chased away. Aguirre wants to sail on to Trinidad, in order to snatch the colony away from the Spaniards and found \"the purest dynasty\", together with his daughter. But her innocent body has already been pierced by the lethal arrows.There is more than just historical allusion in this movie. It is the account of failure on a large scale, and such a failure is not limited to history. Each and every human being is basically a pursuer of happiness and is looking for his own land of gold, the realization of his dreams. And in the process he can easily become entangled in delusions and get into a situation of life in which he is just moving round in circles and cannot get out of the traps he has set himself. Even when he calls himself \"the wrath of God\", he still remains nothing but human, and is therefore a prisoner of his own limitations.",

            "content": "Werner Herzog quickly establishes the gaping void between civilised man and nature in his 1972 masterpiece Aguirre, the Wrath of God, with the sight of an expedition navigating a path down the side of a mountain in the Andes. They scuttle like ants, carrying objects unsuitable for such a perilous journey through the harshest of rain forests - a sedan chair, a huge cannon - and are adorned in sweltering metal armour, complete with helmets and weapons. This is the opening scene, and the message clear - these people simply should not be there, and whatever riches or glory they seek will surely result in death. Backed by Popol Vuh's haunting score, it is one of the finest shots in the history of cinema.The filming of The Wrath of God is possibly as well-known as the film itself, with stories of poor planning, severe injuries, and leading man Klaus Kinski's generally disruptive and psychopathic behaviour emerging from the cast and crew after the film's release. Yet while a chaotic shoot can result in disaster for the finished product, every now and then a masterpiece will be born from the rubble - just look at Apocalypse Now (1979). And Herzog's first of five collaborations with Kinski is precisely that; a glorious, brutal and completely absorbing depiction of madness and greed that benefits from the bizarre happenings behind the scenes. Set in 1560, the film tells the story of the ill-fated expedition led by Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) to find the fabled land of El Dorado.Accompanied by a band of Spanish conquerors and a hundred Indian slaves, Pizarro soon realises that his expedition will soon be cut short by a lack of food, water and supplies and orders a smaller group of approximately 40 men to carry on with the search. He puts Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) in charge, with the maniacal but efficient Don Lope de Aguirre (Kinski) as his second-in-command. With them they take the fat representative of the Royal House of Spain, Don Fernando de Guzman (Peter Berling), Brother Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro), and, against Pizarro's wishes, Ursua's mistress Inez (Helen Rojo) and Aguirre's daughter Flores (Cecilia Rivera). The quest is soon in trouble, as one of their rafts is swept away by perilous rapids and Aguirre quickly overthrows Ursua, seating de Guzman in his place.Herzog isn't interested in peppering the film with set-pieces. The Wrath of God moves along at a slow pace with not much happening for long periods of time, while the rainforest lurks all around the screen, proving itself to be a formidable and unpredictable presence. The German auteur has said before that there is nothing peaceful about nature, and here the eerie silence is frequently interrupted by the high shrill of some unseen animal. As the group journey further into the harsh terrain, their decreasing mental state starts to reflect their surroundings. They drift along the river in a raft made by slaves (the natives made them for the film), and occasionally come across an Indian. Brother Carvajal is there to spread the word of God and offers one a Bible. When he puts to his ear and wonders why it doesn't talk, he is put to death for blasphemy.Nature, including humanity, is madness itself, and this message is hammered home further by the wide-eyed performance of Klaus Kinski, who was clearly mad himself. His spats with Herzog are the stuff of legend, and anyone with an interest should check out Herzog's documentary on his relationship with Kinski, My Best Fiend (1999). During the filming of The Wrath of God, he shot at some extras keeping him awake, removing the tip of one of their fingers in the process, and hit a cast member so hard with his sword that he still bares the scar (the incident can be seen in the film when they attack the village). Never has a film affected me, mentally and spiritually, with such power. In the final scene, Aguirre mutters to himself on board his tattered raft as some monkeys invade the screen. Herzog transports you there, and leaves you questioning the sanity of the world around you. Unquestionably my favourite film of all time.",

            "content": "I don't really know where to start with this masterpiece from the hands of Werner Herzog... As strange as it may sound and to my own surprise, the actual story of \"Aguirre, Wrath of God\" itself isn't staggering or even innovating at all. It completely is Werzog's eye for perfection and the unbearably slow suffering of the characters what makes this film such a mesmerizing and unforgettable experience. The events take place in the year 1560, when Spanish Conquistadores struggle their way through the Peruvian jungles in search for El Dorado; the city of gold. Due to misery and the constant threat of Indians, it is decided that a smaller group continues the quest on rafts, led by Don Pedro de Ursua. But, in reality, it is the second in command \u0096 the malevolent and power mad Aguirre \u0096 who runs the expedition and eventually brings total damnation upon his men and himself.The first thing that immediately strikes you is the genuine filming locations. With much sense of realism, Herzog and his entire crew went to the heated and perilous Peru, rather than to shoot this epic in fake and jungle-decorated studios. Much like it also helped \"Apocalypse Now\", the characters really seem lost in this setting and unknowing about what'll happen next. I nearly can't stress enough what kind of extra impact this gives to the film! After all, did the real Spanish colonialists back in the 16th century knew for sure that this El Dorado was a true place and within reach?? Another beautiful example to illustrate the importance of the setting, this time along with Herzog's typical eye for symbolism, is the magnificent opening sequence in which the whole group descends a mountain pass. Other than proving how difficult the journey is, Herzog \u0096 without words \u0096 sketches the relations and hierarchy in the group, with slaves, exhausted warriors and ladies in fancy chairs.\"Aguirre \u0096 Wrath of God\" is a film filled with fascinating contradictions. Too much to list, actually. All these men ever talk about is power and wealth, but they're stuck in a hopeless situation of poverty. More particularly Aguirre, who boisterously declared himself the embodiment of God's Wrath, is a victim of his own ambition. Even the beautiful filming location merely is a contradiction...since all you ever see is suffering. There's not that much dialogue in this film and yet all the cast members deliver memorable acting performances. Especially Klaus Kinski, of course, whose Don Lope de Aguirre is one of the most macabre and antipathetic figures in the history of film-making. Fans of cult cinema already know that Kinski was an indisputable genius and his multiple collaborations with director Herzog are all masterpieces. The climax sequence, in which Kinski misguidedly roams around the raft, is one of the most haunting things I ever saw. See this masterpiece whenever you have the chance!",

            "content": "'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' is one of those films that wins points for the story behind how it was made and not for the actual film itself. Created by famed German New Wave director, Werner Herzog, when he was twenty-eight years old, 'Aguirre' was created in insufferable conditions in the Peruvian rain forest on the Amazon River over a five week period, with Herzog directing hundreds of extras including local natives who built rafts for the cast and crew. Herzog and his crew escaped death right before filming when they were bumped off a plane at the last minute, that ended up crashing into the jungle, killing all aboard except one. Herzog also had to deal with his volatile star, Klaus Kinski, who fired a rifle at some extras who he objected to being too rowdy during the film's production. Miraculously, no one was killed, with only one man losing a fingertip!'Aguirre' is a work of fiction but it's based on two historical accounts which Herzog melded together in two and a half days. All the major characters including Aguirre were involved in a 1560 expedition that left Peru to find the mythical city of El Dorado. Urs\u00faa, appointed by the Peruvian governor, led the expedition, but was murdered upon orders of Aguirre, whose goal was to overthrow the ruling Spanish government. Herzog also makes use of an earlier expedition, beginning in 1541, which involved Francisco de Orellana, who led a group down the river searching for El Dorado, upon orders of the famed explorer, Pizarro. During this expedition, Gasper de Carvajal kept a journal, which forms the basis of the narration in Herzog's fictional story.When 'Aguirre' was made, in 1971, a new wave of American directors, had already established themselves as anti-establishment, attempting to present the dark side to current American culture as well as its history in films such as 'Little Big Man', 'Easy Rider' and 'Bonnie and Clyde'. Herzog attempts to debunk the myth of a golden age of European exploration by proffering up the surly Kinski as the cruel monomaniac, Aguirre, who reminds one of the crazed Hitler inside the bunker in the German film, 'Downfall'. Rather than a group of enlightened Renaissance men, Herzog's soldiers are religious fanatics who lose all perspective on reality in their crazed quest for gold. In one telling scene, the monk Carvajal, exhorts the soldiers to murder two natives who mistakenly throw a Bible to the ground because they are unable to hear the actual spoken word of God, emanating from the book.While 'Aguirre' is seriously short on character development, there are enough 'events', that will keep you mildly interested. Early on, a few of the men are caught in a whirlpool on one of the rafts, and are found the next day, murdered by natives, with arrows and spears protruding from their bloated bodies. Soon afterward, Aguirre takes over the expeditionary force by shooting Urs\u00faa. Surprisingly, he's given a short reprieve after the fat nobleman, Guzman, is appointed 'Emperor', and spares his life. When the jungle is completely flooded and virtually all of their rafts destroyed, Herzog has his crew build new rafts and incorporates the new change in circumstances as part of the story. The plot thickens a bit when Guzman is found murdered and Aguirre finally has Urs\u00faa disposed of. In one of the most dramatic scenes in the film, Urs\u00faa's mistress, walks off into the rain forest, disgusted by Aguirre's cruelty.One gets the impression that Herzog seeks to present his tale of bad guy explorers as a documentary, shot in cinema verit\u00e9 style. There's an air of self-congratulation here, with Herzog constantly reminding us how depraved his greedy conquistadors really are. After awhile, it becomes more and more obvious, that Herzog merely seeks credit for being on the 'winning side'. One doesn't need an entire film such as this one, to conclude that the people who founded the 'New World', mistreated the native population in an abominable way and were guided by a materialistic spirit of the crassest nature. Nonetheless, things could have been a little more interesting, if some of the really bad apples had a few ambiguous (sympathetic?) spots here and there. On the other hand, it would be presumptuous to assume that a 28 year old director is capable of presenting complex characters that we come to expect from a master such as Ingmar Bergman.In the end, despite Herzog's masterful attempt to brave the elements while filming 'Aguirre', his characters don't have enough shades of gray to convince us that the great quest for El Dorado actually happened as Herzog would like us to believe. For those who believe that 'Aguirre' deserves accolades as a 'masterpiece', mainly due to Kinski's performance, I fail to see how that's possible. With his surly, threatening demeanor, Kinski as Aguirre is hardly acting at all. Rather, this is how Kinski acted in real life. As for the character of Aguirre, he's such a one-note concoction with all the nastiness, that he comes off more as a buffoon than someone who's actually scary. At the denouement, Aguirre's monomania is so obvious, that we care more about the cute monkeys than such a pathetic lunatic.The actors in 'Aguirre' mainly spoke English but the original audio could not be used due to its poor quality. The copy I saw was dubbed into German but Kinski did not participate in the dubbing\u2014his million dollar fee was way beyond Herzog's budget. For those who can't stand dubbed movies, this may be another reason why you won't find 'Aguirre: Wrath of God', to be very endearing.",

And honestly? I think it's probably mine too. I'm normally not into Foreign Language films, but this is a breathtaking exception. The plot is quite basic, with a group of Spanish explorers searching for the legendary El Dorado.I am reminded of reading the book \"War And Peace\". It was great just to see the area being described, but it was the deep dialogue that really made it readable (is that a word?). The same works here. The camera work is among the best I have ever seen in a movie. I just love the way it shows people off in the distance and how it focuses on the most important things. Everything about this movie just looks beautiful. I love the costumes, I love the animals (who must be real), I love the environment, it's simply a gorgeous film. There is some action in it, but for the most part, they just have realistic stuff going on. The entire movie takes place outside and I don't think anyone is ever in a house.That's a wonderful and unique way to film. Even the very first scene had me hypnotized. It's beautiful to see these people being led along a mountain. Near the end of the movie, the title character Aguirre is told there is probably no golden city, but wants to conquer whatever he finds. Mixed throughout the film are insightful messages about politics and religion and the true motivations behind these ideals. It's one of the most philosophical movies I've seen in a long time. The title is spoken in a wonderful way as this is how Aguirre sees himself. The film never really ends, it just stops with little progress made in the entire story. It works wonderfully that way.What's great is just how amazingly realistic this film is. It shows how we crave glory and how we act around people of different races and beliefs. Everything just molds together for a wonderful visual feast. Near the end, we're not even sure of what's real. A guy is hit with an arrow, but it might just be in his (or someone else's) imagination. It is this delusion that makes us question exactly what goes on around us. After watching such horrible movies like, \"They Saved Hitler's Brain\", \"Dracula Vs. Frankenstein\", and \"Doomsday Machine\" this was an inspiring thing to watch. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's only a hour and a half! It seemed more worthy of being a truly epic film. Still, it works wonderful with its time and I obviously recommend it. ****",

            "content": "Some productions are so legendary that they are familiar to viewers long before we actually watch the film. 'Aguirre, the wrath of god' is arguably one of the very best examples of this. The conditions the cast and crew experienced, and the trials and tribulations of the expeditionary party in the film, are all but one and the same. The fiery animosity between filmmaker Werner Herzog and unpredictable star Klaus Kinski is among the most widely known collaborations, or clashes, in all of cinema. Between these heavy doses of untamed realism, the immense work from all angles that went into the creation, and the lush, haunting ambient music of Popol Vuh, it's easy to become absorbed in the saga as it unfolds. Recognizing the unembellished nature of the film, declining hooks or twists, 'Aguirre' surely won't appeal to all comers, but it remains a dazzling and almost naturalistic spectacle that everyone needs to see at least once.For all the intense hardship that characterized the days filming on location in remote areas of South America, it resulted in a viewing experience that's fascinating. We get eyefuls of incredible landscapes and scenery thanks to Herzog's timeless shot composition, and Thomas Mauch's rich, crisp cinematography. The costume design, set pieces, and weapons and props have the appearance of stark authenticity, while the somber and grizzled performances of the cast give definite impressions of the growing disintegration of the expedition, mentally and otherwise. (Even questionable dubbing in post-production can't dampen the effect.) As the runtime advances and the group aimlessly journeys on, strong, dire themes come into ever greater focus of the inane madness and foolishness of colonialism, and empire; the exploitative amoral cruelty and senselessness of the Age of Exploration, and all it represents; the corruption and myopic folly of power; and the monstrous abject barbarity of so-called missionaries. To these add a gnawing air of futility as the length goes on while Aguirre stands mindlessly fixated on a glorious goal - this is not a movie one watches to be entertained, but instead to be mesmerized, and indulge in the terrific artistry of cinematic storytelling.There's a bleakness to the narrative (and, frankly, the production as a whole) that is spellbinding, while at the same time it's eerily, tragically beautiful. The sparing music and more prevalent contrasting silence in the soundtrack only compounds the grim atmosphere, and tightens our attentiveness. I fully expected a good time before I started watching, but still the experience has bested my assumptions. Every element of 'The wrath of god' boasts a reputation that precedes it, and despite the basic simplicity of the plot, it undeniably becomes captivating as the trek progresses and unravels. I can understand why this won't be for everyone, yet there's such tremendous excellence of film-making and storytelling as to become an essential classic. It's difficult to speak of the title to any further extent without betraying foreknowledge, but all I can say is that 'Aguirre, the wrath of god' is stupendous achievement that ranks among the finest works the medium has to offer. Even if you need to go out of your way to find it, this is well worth 90 minutes of your time.",

            "content": "Looking at the reams of adoring praise in the comments section, and the high average score of 8.1 on the film's page, this is not likely to be a popular review with most people.But I feel entitled to give my opinion. I have never seen a Werner Herzog movie before, but after hearing about this and discovering the IMDb page I thought it would be worth a rent. I sat down to watch it this afternoon devoid of any prejudgements, and watched attentively. I'd like to think I don't have a short attention span: if a film is good enough to keep me interested, then it doesn't matter what pace/colour/language/style/length it is. However, it did not take long for this movie to leave me somewhat frustrated. The story is very simple: an Emperor and his men set off searching for El Dorado. Fair enough. But this film fails to keep things interesting. Its first mistake is to not introduce any of its characters in a meaningful way. The crew are just faces, none of them play any significant part in the film. You do not see their lust for El Dorado. You only see their frustration in one exchange of dialogue late in the film.Aquirre, the main character (played by Klaus Klinski), is the only one of any real interest. The emperor is fat, greedy and generally cares only for himself. The monk (and narrator) just wants to convert the savages. Ursua seems like he should have an important role, but is shot early on and remains silent for the rest of the movie. None of these characters have depth. Only Aguirre, but even then he possesses little more than an odd fascination, which I guess is credit to the actor and definitely not the script. The way he moves and talks, he is egocentric and clearly a little mad. Yet this is not a progression. He seems mad and selfish at the beginning, and at the end he is still mad and selfish, only slightly more so.Another problem with the movie is the pace. Despite being only 1hr 30 minutes, the director successfully sucks all potential life from the film. The editing is abysmal. Nothing interesting going on, and shots linger for way too long. Most will probably claim something to do with art and beauty, but the fact is the editing is poor. There early two early shots of the river that linger for almost 30 seconds each, never shifting. You are just staring at a fast-moving current. Maybe to some people this is evocative. To me, it's just tedious.The film would have a better atmosphere if it wasn't filmed almost documentary style. I hate to compare it to Apocalypse Now, but that film managed to create a thick atmosphere, through music but more specifically the excellent cinematography and editing. It had montages that helped to convey the feeling of madness, an almost dreamlike feeling. No such effects are used here. It is very plainly directed, in fact the direction is what lets the film down the most. When the music occasionally kicks in the film improves considerably, especially as in the end scene with Aguirre's daughter. But most of the music is completely silent, and unfortunately this doesn't convey any feeling of eerieness or tension, just boredom.It doesn't help that half the dialogue seems dubbed even though I watched it in the original language with subtitles. It doesn't help that nothing eventful happens in the entire movie. It may not be an action movie, but something has to happened to keep our interest. Characters die, but I had no reason to care for any of them.If people could reply to this I'm sure they'd say that I missed the point of the movie, and I guess they'd be correct. I see no point to this movie. I tried to enjoy it, but it is slow, tedious, uneventful, sometimes badly acted, lacking characterisation, poorly scripted... yeah, you could say it's beautiful, but only because the place where it was filmed was beautiful in the first place.Overall, I'm put off Werner Herzog movies for the foreseeable future.",

            "content": "Writer / director Werner Herzogs' poetic, haunting, beautifully filmed historical drama stars frequent collaborator Klaus Kinski, who plays the title character. Don Lope de Aguirre is one of a group of Spanish conquistadors travelling South America in the 16th century. Aguirre leads a successful revolt, and the whole crew sail down the river in search of the legendary El Dorado, the lost city of gold.Herzog works with a first rate filmmaking company to create some absolutely breathtaking images. One of the things that is the most striking about \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" is its quietness. It manages to create a feeling of intensity without cranking up the volume or indulging in action set pieces. Its effectiveness derives from the mental condition of the men, who battle the elements, an unseen enemy, and each other. Throughout the story, characters perish, but what is chilling is that we don't always see people die on screen. We merely see their bodies afterwards, which is likely to create true uneasiness in the viewer.This also works as a potent character study, looking at power hungry individuals such as the crazed Aguirre and examining how people react over the course of journeys such as this one. While it is a somber, serious film, it's not totally without humour.Kinski is excellent, in one of his best performances. He never overplays the madness of Aguirre. The other actors are just as fine: Helena Rojo as Inez, Del Negro as Carvajal, Ruy Guerra as Ursua, Peter Berling as de Guzman, and Edward Roland as Okello the slave.The atmosphere is impressive right from the start, with Herzog beginning on just the right note, slowly adding humans to the environment. The wonderful music by Popol Vuh is a powerful component.This viewer is a relative newcomer to the filmmakers' works, but has been encouraged by what he's seen so far.Nine out of 10.",

            "content": "My expectations going in to this film were pretty high given its critical acclaim and reputation. Grizzly Man is the only other Herzog film I have seen and it happens to be my current favorite documentary of all time, so needless to say I was quite excited to see another film by him. And I'm happy to report that, although on a first viewing I didn't love it to quite the same degree as Grizzly Man, Aguirre: The Wrath of God definitely did not disappoint. I was quite interested to see what Herzog's style would be like as a filmmaker working with his own script and actors rather than as a documentarian. Based only on this film, he definitely seems to have a very deliberate, methodical air to his direction. The entire film is very even-toned and it slides along at a steady pace that feels neither fast nor slow. There is definitely an emotional coldness to the film that feels almost Kubrickian. None of the characters are very relatable or likable; quite the contrary in fact - they are consumed by greed, selfishness and delusions of grandeur, our \"hero\" in particular. Thus, there is an emotional distance between the audience and the characters that is definitely reminiscent of a Kubrick film.And ironically, despite the fact that I turned to this movie as my first Herzog non-documentary, the film almost feels like a documentary. The way the film is shot with hand-held camera and without any pomp or dramatization makes everything feel so real and authentic. It's very obvious that everything in the film was done for real on location and that is to its advantage as you really feel like you're there with these men rather than just watching a dramatization.This ultra-realism also works very well in bringing the themes of the film through and making them resonate. The film is clearly about man's misguided and even delusional thirst for power. Aguirre embodies this more than anyone in the film - a man with very clear delusions of grandeur who fancies himself a god despite clear evidence that his expedition is futile and doomed to failure. Klaus Kinski gives a spectacular performance in this role which is even more impressive given his relatively minimal amount of dialogue. He just has such an ominous presence on screen, his face perpetually twisted in a snarl, and he becomes almost hypnotic to watch as the film goes on.And it isn't just Aguirre. Essentially every Spaniard in the film engages in treachery at least once, including the holy man who utters one of the most searing lines of the film: \"You know, my child, for the good of our Lord, the Church was always on the side of the strong.\" Ouch. These men commit mutiny, elect \"emperors\", make grand declarations of land ownership, and hold trials with their only audience being the indifferent tangle of vegetation and the raging river. The realism of the film perfectly captures how delusional these men really are as they parade around with their notions of power and fame in the middle of the jungle. Nothing could be further from the truth as they slowly succumb one by one, lost in a foreign and foreboding land. And their impossible goal of finding El Dorado, the imaginary city of gold, is the perfect metaphor for their delusion. A great strength of the film is that the way this theme is executed feels so universal. Herzog isn't just showing us the madness of these particular men in this particular scenario, he's showing us the madness of man in general. He showing us that these illusions of power are just that - illusions. In the grand scheme of the world and the universe, the titles of men are meaningless and transient.Aguirre: The Wrath of God is a powerful film and an impressive achievement from a filmmaking perspective. However, it is definitely not a movie that is out to entertain or dazzle its audience. It is a film of ideas rather than plot or spectacle. Really the only criticism I can make of the film on a first viewing is that there were some moments of humor which felt a bit out of place given the tone of the film - a man makes a quip after being shot with an arrow or a decapitated head speaks its last word. There is definitely an absurdity to the film and you could argue that these scenes play to that, but I felt these moments perhaps went a bit to far and were too cartoony to mesh well within the film's fabric of realism. Regardless, it's a minor complaint which does very little to sour an otherwise excellent film.",

            "content": "AGUIRRE: THE WRATH OF GOD (1972) Spaniards in search of El Dorado descend down an intense mountain peak with barely a path on it. Men slosh through a wet jungle forest with cannibals, dragging horses, cannons and women on thrones with them. Rafts try to navigate harsh rapids with no end in sight, sending one of them into a whirlpool. This is the first ten minutes. And it is probably easier than what it took to make the film. Werner Herzog's masterpiece follows Klaus Kinski as a conquistador leading a group of men through his personal madness in Peru, searching for the mythical city of gold. Kinski wasn't an actor, he was a time-traveller, and his performances for Herzog are his best. My favorite scene of all his work is in this film early-on: as the huge group of slaves struggle and burn their souls carrying a woman on a throne-chair against the unforgiving jungle mud and trees, Kinski suddenly appears in the middle to offer a helping hand. He writhes and morphs, grabbing the slaves and shoving them, screaming at the top of his lungs, \"Fools!!! The sedan chair is stuck!\" AGUIRRE is  what got Herzog noticed around the world as part of a new group of German filmmakers along with Fassbinder and Wenders. His previous film was EVEN DWARVES STARTED SMALL, which resulted in Kinski calling him, \"A mere dwarf director.\" The battles between he and Kinski should be legendary by now. The final result in Herzog stating he will grab his gun and kill both himself and Kinski as the actor was threatening to leave the production. Kinski was convinced and finished the film. This story and more is part of the excellent analog track by Herzog, covering all of the hardcore production that overwhelms the more famous Coppola problems making Apocalypse Now. Herzog didn't have millions of dollars, rather 300 grand, had to live on the rafts for months and deal with the jungle and Kinski. But he never bitches - you do what you have to do, and the film is never compromised, from the costumes, the beautiful real locations and the boat hanging in the tree to the eerie group of small monkeys at the end (which Herzog had to steal, even though he paid for them). The analog track is constant (many now seem to take pauses to watch the film) with background on the idea, actors, filming and philosophies. Yes, that is a real mummy in the cannibal camp, for which Herzog's brother had to buy a passenger ticket for the plane ride over. The DVD is another fantastic release giving the nice treatment to a title that can't be making them millionaires. The image looks great and is not letterboxed, so I assume that that is how Herzog prefers it. The three trailers didn't add much to the presentation, but that's a minor point. When they are finished with the entire Herzog collection, it will be one of the most fascinating career studies on DVD.",

Theirs was a voyage of conquest, death a reality. They were unclean and destructive, and only thought of gold. While the native populations of the time may have had their failings as a civilization, they pillaged and raped and conquered in the name of God. The God they worshiped held Europeans, even these reprobates, in high esteem. I'm sure if there were an Inca or Aztec population available to watch this film, it would become a favorite in no time. Aguirre drives into the heart of darkness, his own end to be an emperor. But he is diseased with obsession and self worth. He watches as his men are picked off along with his own daughter. He maintains the mission because he is the mission. Klaus Kinski in his leathery, serpentine best in this film. He has that expression of the walking dead like in \"Nosferatu.\" Undaunted, he pushes his way farther and farther past the point of no return, believing that what he is doing is right. He is the Wrath of God; he receives the Wrath of God. As he sails on, by himself, on a boat full of monkeys, we see what he has become. Herzogs creates the claustrophobic ethos of the South American river; something he seems fascinated with. It must have been grueling to make this film, but it is indeed a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Director Werner Herzog has always been interested in telling stories about men with obsessions, especially if those obsessions lead to madness. So it's no surprise that he was engaged by this story about a group of Spanish conquistadors in 1560 trekking through the Peruvian jungle in search of El Dorado, legendary city of gold, and one man in particular, Aguirre, who stages a mutiny and continues to lead the remaining troupe on an increasingly insane and futile journey when all logic and reason compels them to turn back.It's remarkably easy to forget that you're watching staged action during this film, as the movie drips with authenticity. Herzog's approach to the material is one of almost journalistic objectivity; he never tries to impose emotions or meanings on his viewers. There's very little dialogue and hardly any music; we don't realize how much we rely on characterizations and scoring to tell us how we should feel until they're no longer there to direct us. The series of events that transpires over the course of Herzog's movie could be considered to be telling the history of man in microcosm -- or the history of any civilization. It's only a matter of time in any group of individuals before one tries to assert his supreme authority, and from that moment the rest break into factions of those who will follow and those who won't. Aguirre uses fear to retain control; those who oppose him are disposed of. Substitute Hitler for Aguirre and it wouldn't be difficult to read this film as an allegory for Nazi Germany. However, I feel like Herzog is interested in Man in general rather than Man at any one point in time, and he seems to be saying that the obsessions that drove men centuries ago are the same obsessions that drive them now. One of the most striking aspects of this film is its treatment of religion. The film is narrated by a priest, whose diary was the sole surviving record of the expedition. He is determined to tame the savages by bringing them the word of God, but Herzog's irony is not lost on us, for who are the true savages in this film? The hypocrisy of the church is brought home by a scene in which the priest tells one of the women of the expedition that he supports Aguirre because the church has always allied itself with those who are strong, not those who are worthy. And in another scene later in the film, when someone suggests that they are nearing the city of gold, the priest's eyes glitter as much as anyone's with the promise of fortune and wealth.Herzog doesn't treat any one incident in the movie with any greater emphasis than any other. This is refreshing in one sense, because the movie is utterly lacking any of the phony bombast that plagues so many more commercial films. But this can also sometimes be a disadvantage, because the monotone pacing too often lulled me into a state from which I had to remind myself to pay attention.Grade: A",

The one awe-inspiring fact about Werner Herzog's much-admired 'Aguirre, Wrath of God' (1972) is that it got made at all. As messianic as the maker himself, the film charts an ill-fated 16th Century Spanish Crown expedition to Peru and the Amazon in search of the fabled gold of El Dorado. Tranquil wide shots belie the true nature of the place. The heat stifles, the raging river demoralises, the paucity of food consumes. The nobility are quickly overpowered by the unforgiving environment.Capitalising on the band's resignation from their quest, a rebel soldier, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), inspires a mutiny and assumes leadership. He pushes the men to their limits, forcing them to go further, faster. Meanwhile the 'Indian' slaves free themselves of servitude and periodically resurface to arrow their former captors to death. The expedition doesn't enervate Aguirre as it does the others. It enlivens him. As his sanity declines, he declares that he will marry his daughter before conquering other places and then overthrowing the monarchy. Kinski was one of those die-for-your-art actors. Steely-blue eyes set among an intense, rough face gave him the look of a noble hobo. He might well have come closer to the crazed characters he played than any other international star. Herzog often used him, though theirs was love-hate relationship, and their fights are the stuff of legend. There are many memorable moments in 'Aguirre'; indeed I best remember it as a series of quite dazzling set pieces. Take the raft scene where a horse loses control and dives into the river. Or the superbly edited shot of a head being lobbed clean off. Or the final scene, featuring an army of common squirrel monkeys. The opening long shot remains the most breathtaking: the entire crew slowly snake their way down an imposing mountain; a visceral metaphor reflecting their insignificance \u2013 a sequence that would only be done with CGI today. Throughout, the film is visually arresting and remarkably static, except for occasional paroxysms. It's an arduous watch and I think overrated, but you may genuinely not see anything quite like it \u2013 except for other Werner Herzog films.",

The sublime aerial shots which open the film ram home that the painstaking endeavor is the real deal, the crew does go off the beaten path into the ethereal mountains, a mesmerizing hands-on style of filmmaking which has its built-in allure simply because who will not be in awe of a film takes so much human labor against the elemental force to make itself happen (the legendary Herzog-Kinski pair would go to extremes in FITZCARRALDO, a decade later), particularly at a time when the preponderance of offerings hitherto had been studio- bound, steeped in artificial aesthetics.In search of El Dorado, in the mid-16th century, a gold-crazed contingent of Spanish conquistadors goes deep into the Peruvian rain forest, lead by Pedro de Urs\u00faa (famed Portuguese filmmaker Guerra), second-in-command Lope de Aguirre (Kinski), Brother Gaspar (Negro), a rotund nobleman Fernando de Guzm\u00e1n (Berling), among others, two females, In\u00e9s (Rojo), Urs\u00faa's wife and Flor\u00e9s (Rivera), Aguirre's teenage daughter, and many Indian slaves. Most of the time, the team steers their route on rafts, but comes in for successive adversities in the hands of the unfathomable nature mother, one raft trapped by an eddy among the rapids causes a horrific aftermath, just when Urs\u00faa commands to abort the scouting mission and backtrack, Aguirre precipitates a mutiny, keeps a wounded Urs\u00faa as prisoner and puts Guzm\u00e1n on the throne as the emperor of the new kingdom, because he firmly believes, they will find the gold, then their mission continues.Story-wise, the film is pretty garden-variety, and decidedly trimmed down to the nexus, Aguirre and co. are real historical personages, the expedition and mutiny are true happenings, but Herzog fictionalizes their journey en route and the grim wind-up. Barely landing their feet on solid soil, the conquistadors are singled out one by one by unseen enemies hidden in the forests through poisoned arrows, often proceeded by dead silence.However, in Herzog's method, the suspense and dreadfulness is toned down by his dispassionate temperament, which would be made into great play in his equally robust documentary filmmaking. Merely watchful and often centering on Kinski's distinctively fierce and emotive visage, the camera expends more time perusing the biome's vista (the ship snagged on top of a tree is a coup de ma\u00eetre of the then young filmmaker, flagging up its powerful metaphoric impact and ludic whimsy) than engaging in the narrative proceedings as their ill-fated destiny lurking ahead, until the final majestic 360-degree twirling shot sending the megalomaniac stranded with numerous skittish monkeys on the raft, paranoid, bereft and dream-dashed.In any fair sense, the film is less potent as a character analysis of an outrageous madman than a gorgeous landscape porn, utterly otherworldly for those outsiders, but Kinski still hounds you with his muted aggro, lunacy and repellence (by dint of Herzog's tactful maneuver, who deliberately lets Kinski rip in his more frenetic performance, but saves the actual shots for the moments when he is abated or simply worn out), which would go beyond the pale in FITZCARRALDO, but here, the final impression is much more balanced and nuanced.One cannot finish the review without mentioning the acclaimed score composed by the West German avant-garde band Popol Vuh, it is unearthly but not intrusive, a bespoke incident music which leaves its repercussions long after the film reaches its finish-line.",

Despite all of these problems, it is through the vision of director Werner Herzog mixed with the great ability of Kinsinki's acting prowess that this film becomes a masterpiece as we take a voyage through insanity that is sure to end in tragedy.All the tragedy that will befall upon these people is stated within the first few seconds of the film. Herzog does this through the opening text which tells us about the expedition to search for the legendary land of El Dorado made of gold. But it also informs us that the land does not exist and is a myth spread by the native Americans and thus their goal will never be within reach and shall not be able to get past the endless landscape. It is within this lack of success where we become fixed to the screen and hypnotised by this journey with no chance of success. To further emphasise the hopelessness of their quest we are also informed that the only thing to survive the expedition is the diary of the monk with their fates sealed from the very start of their journey. The presence of the priest in itself is fairly ironic seeing as their journey is about as far away from god as could be imagined with the Spaniards mission to spread the word of god following a trail of blood, at one point killing a native American for not having read the bible. And by distancing themselves from god, Aguirre further ensures they shall never find the land of god. Due to their quest forever being outside of reach then the journey that we take is focused upon seeing how these characters begin to lose their sanity, as they begin to draw themselves close to their own doom. We are reminded further as we see the numbers of the crew slowly begin to grow slimmer with many of those dying and the raft they travel on becoming more and more empty as the film goes on. Many of these deaths we do no actually know much about, with a lot of them happening off screen to grow a greater feeling of the isolated kingdom that they are in and their growing insanity upon the raft. In contrast to the land of gold that they envision, they instead become lost in this endless land of no use or worth. Great emphasis is played on this by Herzog as he made the interesting decision to not storyboard any of the film, coming up with each shot as it was being filmed. Through this he's successfully been able to adapt to the rivers landscape and play greater emphasis on endlessness of the environment and create a greater sense of how the characters become trapped on the raft. But they continue onwards down the seemingly endless waters, spurred on by their own greed and want of gold. One mans greed spurs them on more than any other. This is the traitorous and insane Aguirre who has a vision of greatness, wanting to become ruler of his land and create a kingdom that will rival Spain through his land of gold. That this goal shall fail remains a certainty throughout. But what is uncertain is if he knows he shall fail but dooms his men nonetheless or if his obsession is driven by his own insanity as he slowly loses grip of what is going on throughout the film. This obsession is shown less through the dialogue but rather through his facial expressions as we see in to his wild eyes and his lack of pity to any of those who die in his name.It is his villainous insanity that is the leading factor of the doomed fate of each person in the film. This is shown by none better than the final shot where he stands amongst the dead bodies, resemblant to the ending of Hamlet. It demonstrates how he is the one who has led to the demise of everyone on board with the hopelessness of the quest shown further by the similar endless landscape and the monkeys who have taken over the boat demonstrating both the failure against the native Americans and the complete insanity he has been driven to. This film is an incredible journey to go on. But it is not the journey to El Dorado that the travellers of almost 500 years ago had envisioned. Instead it is a journey into the depths of insanity. As they go further into that river we dwell further into the madness of Aguirre and see how he will doom them all. Whatever pain and agony went towards making this film was clearly put to great use with this being nothing short of a masterpiece, rivalling the likes of Apocalypse Now and The Shining by trapping us in the labyrinth of Aguirre's madness, losing ourselves inside.",

            "content": "Apologies to all the people who love this film but I find it one of the most over-rated films of all time! It seems to me a case of 'the emperor's new clothes', in other words, people read greatness into it because it has somehow got built up by critics to be a masterpiece. In my view these critics are being pretentious! Its logistical prowess, as with Russian Ark, blind some critics and others into thinking it is good. The adventure of filming this may be amazing and some of the scenery is testament to that. This is a plus but does not make up for the mainly amateurish documentary style direction and production which makes it seem more like a 1970s TV docu-drama.The acting of Klaus Kinski is somewhat mesmerising and impressive and the aspect of the film which is interesting is the study of madness/megalomania in action. However, this madness of the character is not built into the story in a sensible or realistic way. I would suspect Kinski and Herzog himself are rather mad in real life! The bizarre plot development and actions of characters are further undermined to a great degree by very poor script and acting (apart from Kinski).Kinski too is SO wild and unrestrained he at one stage throws a monkey (unscripted), just one of a series of horrifying scenes of cruelty to horses/monkeys which cause me to be sickened and to lower any respect I could have for the film. A horse was actually extremely cruelly treated and then abandoned in the jungle! The film is recent enough it should be subject to animal rights legislation.On top of all that, for most of the film I was simply bored to death! Only Kinski's insane performance enabled me to watch until the end whist my 2 friends with whom I had been watching gave up and left!",

            "content": "One of the film's highlights is the superb intro. We see a cloudy landscape of the Andes, as we hear a haunting heavenly choir singing. As the camera moves, we distinguish small dots climbing down the mountain, like little ants, but as we get even closer, we figure out they are actually human beings, most of them Inca Indians. This emphasizes one of the movie's central themes : the smallness of man confronted to immensity and wilderness of nature.Among the Indians, we see also a few Europeans dressed in 16th century costumes. These are Spaniards on their way for the conquest of the new world. A gentleman holds the hand of a noble looking lady to help her in this vertiginous descent. Another blond girl is carried in a porter chair. A monk is also part of the journey. The story is based on the diary of that monk, Gaspar de Carvajal, and is therefore inspired by real facts. The expedition was led by Pizzaro, the Conquistador of Peru, looking for El Dorado, the land of gold. As the troop arrives at the foot of the mountain, they enter an inextricable jungle and come to the shore of a wide muddy river. As they cannot go further, Pizarro appoints a part of the group to explore the river on rafts. The group will be lead by Don Pedro de Ursua (played by Brazilian director Ruy Guerra), and by Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski). Ursua's wife, Aguirre's daughter and the monk will also embark on the journey. From then on, the movie becomes a slow-paced drifting on an endless wild river. Not much is discovered, outside hostile cannibal Indians hiding in the rain forest. But the rapacious Aguirre plots with a few of his handymen to take Ursua's place at the head of this hopeless expedition. He takes advantage of the fact that the crew is getting all the time more hungry, desperate and afraid. He fools them with promises of endless wealth. He names a stupid fat gentleman king of El Dorado, but the \"king\" will be just a puppet into Aguirre's hands, as he is to die soon after his \"coronation\", possibly poisoned. After that, Aguirre can take total control.Ursua is eliminated and his wife disappears into the woods. The monk, sole representative of the church, sides with Aguirre without a hesitation. As the journey turns into a disaster, Aguirre gets all the more megalomaniac. While his crew is slowly dying of thirst and starvation, the delirious adventurer sees himself as ruling on the biggest realm on earth, and plans to marry his own daughter to breed a new pure dynasty. Poisonous arrows are shot from the forest, decimating the few survivors, among them Aguirre's daughter who dies in his arms. Aguirre's realm is but an endless wasteland of water and trees, and his only subjects left are squirms of little green monkeys which invade the rafts like rats, but the mad conqueror has already lost touch with reality. This movie was directed by a German director, Werner Herzog, and it is possibly an allusion to Hitler's taking of power. Aguirre's thirst for conquest has no limits, even if he knows down inside that he is taking his crew on a journey towards chaos, where not even he has any chance to survive. Hist last words are \"I am Aguirre, the wrath of God, who else is with me?\" German actor Klaus Kinski, who starred in an incredible amount of B-grade flicks, was offered here a golden role, and achieves a brilliant performance, probably his best one ever.The shooting was visibly achieved in very difficult conditions. First, it was done in natural locations in the Amazon basin, which really means in the middle of wilderness. Secondly, the cast was made up of different nationalities, Germans and South Americans. Last but not least, Klaus Kinski was known as a very difficult actor to manage, and he had a very hostile relationship to director Werner Herzog, who used to call him \"my best enemy\".This journey to chaos helps us remind man's insignificance in front of overpowering nature. The feeling of helplessness will lead most to fear and subservience, while a few will deny fear by sinking into megalomania. Because they believe to be invincible, they are believed to be so by the fearful others, and it is often too late when one realizes their madness.\"Aguirre\" was made in the early seventies, a time when the Western world, which had regarded itself as the epitome of civilization, was more and more questioned in its self-delusions. The Europeans had initially presented themselves as the ambassadors of God's word to barbaric Indians but they had come to plunder, enslave and destroy. Their real motive was endless greed. Even if we have got used, since then, to hear that type of message, it still remains quite actual nowadays.Parallels come to my mind between Aguirre and three other movies : \"Deliverance\", released the same year, also tells about a journey on a wild river with hostile natives in the backwoods; \"Fitzcarraldo\", filmed a decade later, was a sort of 20th century version of Aguirre also directed by Werner Herzog, and also played by Klaus Kinski; finally, the recent \"Downfall\" focuses on Hitler's own denial of reality as his country collapses.",

            "content": "With a small crew and cast Werner Herzog marched into the Peruvian jungle and walked out with possibly dollar for dollar (mark for mark) the finest epic in film history. From its first breathtaking shot of the conquistador led expedition struggling down a treacherous mountainside to the stunning final image of Aguirre adrift on a raft overrun with monkeys, Wrath is one hallucinogenic journey of bravura imagery and wry storytelling.In his search for Eldorado Juan Pizzaro makes a decision to split his force in two. Aguirre manages to undermine his superior, install a puppet leader and run things his cold and brutal way. The deeper they move into the heart of darkness disasters mount. The forest and the swirling waters of the Amazon slowly begins to consume the party as unseen Indians pick them off from the shore. Hunger, exhaustion and betrayal lay things to rest.Unlike Francis Ford Coppolla (Appocalypse,Now) and David Lean (your choice) Herzog had to depend more on pure grit than lavish budget and from out of necessity it brought forth a fresh and original approach producing daring and striking results. Composition after composition is exquisitely composed with the bedraggled soldiers against the rain forest setting along with a gold lusting priest ( from whose journal the story is narrated) a lady aristocrat and Aguirre's daughter. Then there is Klaus Kinski as Aguirre. It is literally a remarkable portrait of evil and cunning performed more by expression than dialog. The best this side of the bench mark Conrad Veidt.High praise should also be given to cinematographer Thomas Mauch. Whether it be the mesmerizing tracking shot finale or the megalomaniac Aguirre being soothed by a pan flute player in a two shot that evokes El Greco his aim is true. Perfectly complimenting the imagery composer Popol Voh gives the film its ethereal and mystical tone with a sound track that after a dozen viewings over thirty years I cannot differentiate whether it's voices or instruments I'm hearing. Either way it contributes mightily in what I believe is an outstanding work of art at any price.",

            "content": "Long before Werner Herzog documented actual men (\"Grizzly Man\") getting disemboweled by actual nature, he was filming (German) men he made up being picked off one-by-one by nature and the indigenous peoples of South America who inhabited it. \"Aguirre\" is, as they say, a tough sit and one imagines a much tougher production as the cast with piles of non-river-worthy gear, including a horse, seems to actually have been set adrift on rickety boats on a drifting South American river. The always creepy (if he played Ward Clever you would constantly be waiting for him to chainsaw The Beaver) Klaus Kinski plays the cunning, megalomaniacal but ultimately a little too far down the psychopathic spectrum to really pull off conquering all of the South American continent title character. Some of the cinematography is gorgeous, particularly behind the opening credits, but the dialog, what there is of it, definitely portrays the extensive use of improvisation employed by Herzog. Basically the cast sits on the boat and waits to die at the arrow points of the \"Indians\" as the German-speaking cast refers to them or to starve to death or to be cut down by Aguirre himself when the unheard but presumably screaming voices in his head tell him to do so. The movie is probably about man's primordial battle with nature or about the horrors of Western conquest or some other noble subtext but getting through the suffering, long stretches of not much happening and a generally uninteresting story make the trip, like the mythical quest for El Dorado depicted in the film, something of a fool's errand. I would say watch \"Grizzly Man\" instead but not getting to hear the final attack after listening to everything else Timothy Treadwell had to say for 2 hours was a bit of a tease.",

            "content": "Werner Herzog's widely acclaimed film about a 16th century expedition into the Southern American jungle looks like some hippie commune happened upon a bunch of costumes and a camera and decided to make a movie because \"everybody's an artist\".Klaus Kinski, in the title role, does his wild-eyed Kinski routine, overshadowing in the process the rest of the cast who seem to be on a mission to demonstrate that acting's actually hard.The editing is poor. The results of the complete post-production sound overdub range from the o.k. to the ridiculous.All aspects of the camera-work are done really badly. As for choices of frames and camera movement, nothing in particular seemed to motivate the former except for the desire to show the person that's speaking most of the time; the latter makes you remember that it's not easy to hold a camera still when you have one leg in the river, the other on an uneven stone and nothing to stabilize the camera. The lighting and colours? Well, you can see everything alright.The complete absence of a narrative arc, the lack of motivation for some scenes (during one I got the impression that the actor was wondering when it would be over so he could finally scratch his arse) and the quality of the dialogues might lead the naive observer to believe that they just made the story up as they went along. But no. From Wikipedia:\"Herzog wrote the screenplay \"in a frenzy\", and completed it in only two and a half days. Much of the script was written during a 200-mile (320 km) bus trip with Herzog's football team. During the bus trip, his teammates got drunk after winning a game and one of them subsequently vomited on several pages of Herzog's manuscript, which he immediately tossed out the window. Herzog claims he can't remember what he wrote on these pages.\"The screenplay was shot as written, with some minor differences.\"When people say that something's \"so bad that it's good\", they usually mean that a work of art is unintentionally funny, and indeed I had to laugh when I watched some of the death scenes, which seem like reenactments of something out of The Simpsons. But what kept me watching was the fascination with the yawning gap between the film's renown and the real thing. Incredible.",

            "content": "I almost thought I knew what to expect from Aguirre: the Wrath of God, Werner Herzog's big breakthrough film at the age of 29. Boy was I wrong. But not really for the reasons I thought. Maybe my expectations were set up a little bit differently, like from reading the quotes from the film I imagined a completely mad, over-the-top Klaus Kinski doing these lines as Aguirre, totally within his own hubris with a loud voice and kooky mannerisms. His is a performance I'll get to in a moment, but really what's most remarkable about this film is how it takes on the story of a group of conquistadors- with Cortez in part as their inspiration, as well as religious intentions- and makes it a brooding epic that comes off a lot more like a documentary than anything one might see from David Lean or something. In over an hour and a half's time, it might seem here and there as if it's slow, but to me, after soon adjusting to Herzog's tempo with the pacing of the film, I really got into it.And for a good portion of the film, or rather big parts, there isn't a whole lot that does go on, which is part of what Herzog wants to get to. One might have this romanticized ideal of how these Spanish conquerers in the 16th century operated, with lots of adventures and always something to do in their pillaging of the lands. But Herzog here makes us spend the duller moments with them too, and its never actually dull in the sense that one might really get bored by it. It's not a high-powered action picture like from today, but really dealing much more with the mind-sets of these people, and how all we can really do is watch them as their plight unfolds. Kinski plays Aguirre, who for most of the film is actually 2nd in command, first to a higher up, and then later to an \"Emperor\", who is dubbed as such because, well, this group is after El Dorado, which entails many riches for all. But their journey down the river becomes one that reveals these men are not very curious explorers, but rather quite close-minded, narrow in knowing the ways of the natives, ready at will to strike down Indians not accepting of the Bible (there's one such scene that brings this to light). And soon, Aguirre's obsession completely takes over, and takes everyone down with him.Aguirre: The Wrath of God is, as Ebert suggests in his review, one of the true haunting visions put to film. But this mad vision, to me, is one that might be second-guessed if not really ready for Herzog's already established style. He takes his time showing these characters, at first with lofty ambitions and then spiraling into chaos, and doesn't rush his narrative. Because of this, nothing ever really feels un-real about any of this; while Herzog admittedly made the facts of the story up not from a real 'diary', it might as well have been. We feel the desperation of some of the earlier scenes (i.e. the caught raft) and later ones of course). The madness then starts to almost become funny- almost- like when the guy gets his head chopped off and still mouths 'ten' during his counting. What's brilliant as well is this madness comes out in spurts amid the moments of contemplation on the men and the moments of quiet. It's a great way to draw suspense, like right before they come upon natives on the land and there's no sound, just the looks of unease and nervous anticipation on the men's face. And Herzog's (stolen) 35mm camera gets shots that both capture the truly awesome scope of the terrain he's in, with big wide shots of the forests and rivers and the whole environment, and hand-held shots that adds to the intensity of the scenes. This is not your old-timer epic of ultra-heroic, practically flawless men of valor and strength going into uncharted territory, but a group who, with the bug, so to speak, of Aguirre's own hidden passions that soon surface full-on, are out for something that really can't be attained.The music, which is repeated throughout either by the real synthesizer score (which unlike in Herzog's Nosferatu doesn't become distracting or out of place, on the contrary is perfect) or with a simple instrument performed by one of the 'natives'. But the music can only do so much; Herzog, aside from his star, populates the film with what might as well be non-professionals, as he mostly casts them for face value. Many a time an actor's worth in Aguirre can be measured more perhaps by how he (or the one or two she's) express their malaise and obscured frustration. Finally, there's Kinski himself, who has those eyes that mark many a great actor, like a German Al Pacino to an extent. Going into it, and hearing so many stories of Kinski being a complete nut off-camera, threatening to quit and so on, that it would be almost like kabuki or something. But it's the kind of crazy-genius performance where just the slightest mannerism, and look in the eyes, tell more than a lot of outward expressions. Even in the final sequence, his madness is a kind of staggering one where it's contained on that raft, surrounded by monkeys, and while he is alive Kinski's movements and face and eyes and voice still express him to be on his mission forever. At the end of the film, the filmmaker suggests something that is left open for the viewer, all through a journey where putting a specific vision of God on people who know nothing of it goes to a fault and obsession makes a dividing line between those who want it and those who don't.Unconventional and uncompromising adventure movie-making, and surely one of the very best German directed films ever.",

The acting was utterly wooden, with no one showing the slightest trace of emotion at atrocities perpetrated by Aguirre or at any other random killing.

Like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Herzog's film is something truly beautiful to look at. From the opening shots of the men walking down the mountain to an incredible looking raft trip, each and every second of this movie had my eyes wide open with a strong visual aspect that puts this film on its own historic level. Also like Kubrick's 2001 this film really isn't about a thing. Herzog makes a brilliant and very brave decision to not throw any fake effects at the viewer to make the film more adventurous. There are many slow moments in the film where Herzog just lets the camera role so that he can capture the mood and feel of death that the actual characters are going through. A director without any guts would have given us more battles, more fights and more melodrama but thankfully that doesn't happen here. This is an amazing adventure film that deals with greed and madness. The ending is very haunting but also very realistic because it just confirms the horror that we just sat through with the previous hour and a half of the film. The movie is beautiful to look at and Herzog does a brilliant job at places us in another time and another land that we have never seen before. The low budget certainly helped the film because it gave it a documentary feel that makes us look at the movie as something real and not a work of fiction.

It did three things for me, initially: it began my lifelong admiration for Werner Herzog; it also began my fascination with the music of Popul Vuh, the small German orchestral group; and, with consummate visual detail, it rekindled my recollections of a similar large rain forest - the jungles of New Guinea, in which I'd live for six years in the 1960s.So, in 1972, it left me stunned by the time I'd reach the last frame.I've seen the film four times now, most recently this year, 2007. Time has not changed my opinion about Herzog's skill, determination and sheer madness in making this movie, surpassed only by his next great epic, Fitzcarraldo (1982), perhaps even more impressive than Aquirre. I'll not debate that, because both films are film art in the finest sense.And, what can you say about Klaus Kinski that's not already been said? Not everybody's cup of tea, for sure; and the title role he plays is Shakespearian in its grand madness, a madness that afflicts only those with great vision, good and bad. Arguably, however, Herzog and Kinski shared that kind of madness that is, for most people, totally beyond our reach, mentally and physically.From the documentary, Mein Liebster Feind (1999), I found out that the opening sequence \u0096 one of the most visually and orally stunning vistas ever put to film \u0096 came about through sheer coincidence: Herzog revealed that, just prior to starting the shoot, the clouds rolled in \u0096 but he carried on anyway, thus using the work of God (if I may) to make a good opener just perfect. A lesser man than Herzog, I think, would have kept that nugget under wraps.Was the story based on fact? There are various opinions, but I think Herzog said he concocted the whole thing. What does it matter? The story is timeless, that's Herzog's point: the human condition is forever driven to and repelled by the need to achieve \u0096 for want of a better word \u0096 glory, whether for good or for evil. In Aquirre's case, it's a journey into madness as he tries to achieve his dreams for El Dorado on earth.Although Kinski, sadly, is no longer with us, I think we can rely on Herzog to continue producing and directing major works of film art. Let's hope so.Highly recommended for all lovers of fine film making.",

While originally director Herzog claimed this was based on the writings of a priest, the story is actually fictional. Things go from bad to worse during this Spanish expedition as the elements and hostile natives begin slowly wiping out the expedition. Ultimately, the megalomaniacal Aguirre kills off the leader and assumes control (with, initially, a puppet in charge). When the members of the expedition are killed off by hostile natives, but considering how unpleasant and evil the Spaniards are, I really could have cared less. And that brings me to why I score this movie lower than most other reviewers. I have a bias that IF a movie has no one to care about, I feel rather indifferent about it--no matter how well-made it is. This is technically a pretty good movie (though the print on the video was very dark and not particularly sharp), and I know it was a lot of work to go to the jungle and film much of it on a raft with a tiny crew. But in the end, WHO CARES? It's different but very unpleasant and mostly historically inaccurate.",

            "content": "Aguirre, the Wrath of God (or should I say Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes for the purists?) is the quintessence of cinema snobism. In a sense, it is a masterpiece of the art of deception. Take a loosy script, officially declare that you represent a new school of movie-making that rejects any acting efforts, coherence of script, etc. and build up some hype around \"this mad big-eyed Klaus Kinski genius\" and you will have the most overrated film ever, which in fact is something so intentionally bad it wouldn't even make up for a college end year movie class work.This film is so bad, it becomes actually good. Please have in mind that the actors don't play, as they are not supposed to. Not that they are bad actors, they were just directed not even to try and play. This is the director's stand. A kind of \"new school\" of cinema. For instance, when a soldier takes an arrow, he doesn't even try to play a dying soldier, he just looks at the arrow and says \"God, an arrow, I am dead\". And closes his eyes. Or jumps into the water. Waw. Talk about revolutionary cinema...So no acting at all. It makes things simplier for the reviewer: you can't even review the acting because there's none. But what about big-eyed Klinski? Well, he is big-eyed Klinski. Through the damn whole movie. Big-eye Klinski stares at the horizon for 2 minutes. Then soldier takes an arrow and says \"I am dead\" and dies. Then Klinksi stares again at the camera and says some cheesy sentence, like \"I must get the gold\". Then another soldier takes an arrow, etc.When I watched this movie, I actually thought it was a kind of parody, a Monthy Python-style parody of these pseudo-intellectual overrated movies that pseudo-intellectual cinema critics love masturbate to because they think it makes them so intellectual to watch them.But it is not a parody. It is an actual movie. A very serious one indeed. With sad big-eyed Klinksi. And a lot of fake dying soldiers from fake arrows that intentionally look fake. But deep inside, I am sure that Herzog knew it was a fraud. What a jubilant feeling it must be to make a movie from which you remove such painful things as actors directing and plot coherence, where you can just let the camera go and big-eyed Klinkski be big-eyed Klinski, and then have it proclaimed one of the best movies of all times! My suggestion: watch it while you are drunk or high on something and prepare for a good laugh!",

That alone takes about two thirds of its running time. Nothing spectacular happens, dialogs are sparse and there's no character development at all. Somewhat noticeable acting was given by Del Negro, Edward Roland and the Native Americans, since all the others (including Kinski) seemed more like wooden mannequins with no expression whatsoever.

            "content": "In many ways Aguirre, the Wrath of God is the template film in director Werner Herzog's filmography. It's a formula he returned to several times over the course of his career. The idea of basing a film around a very bizarre individual is one that typifies much of the director's subsequent output. Herzog's recurring focus on obsessive dreams and borderline madness also figure strongly here, while his intense depiction of the natural world as beautiful, mysterious and dangerous have never been better depicted than in Aguirre. Of course the other key element here is in the combination of the director with his mercurial leading man Klaus Kinski. They went on to make five films together and the relationship was extremely fraught, with all manner of confrontations. Kinski was as close to a madman as any leading international actor ever was. His infamous biography 'Kinski Uncut' is a notorious and massively enjoyable read, which pays only scant notice to his acting career and instead concentrates on his sexual exploits in unprecedented pornographic detail. While the insults he throws around are breathtaking in their lack of restraint. In other words, he comes across as demented and deranged, with undoubtedly a screw loose. This craziness he was of course able to convert into quite extraordinary acting performances and in his collaborations with Herzog he was never better. The two men constantly fought but they ultimately brought out the best \u2013 and the beast \u2013 in each other.Aguirre is about a crazed 16th century Spanish conquistador who takes over an expedition down the Amazon in search of the lost city of El Dorado. The story is very minimal. What is of interest besides Kinski, is the real sense of danger that pervades the production and the rich atmosphere of madness captured by Herzog. The Amazon river and jungle is almost a character in itself, while the opening scene of the group descending Machu Picchu is a fantastic example of integrating landscape into a narrative. The authentic on-location photography really elevates Aguirre to something special, and this extends to the very real sense of danger with these people really travelling down dangerous waters in primitive rafts. I don't think health and safety legislation was a big consideration in the making of this movie to be perfectly honest. Another strong point is in the surreal and horrific moments, such as the boat in the tree and the discovery of the cannibal village, respectively. These are well integrated into the film and highlight the increasing insanity of the trip as the group travel further down the river in a journey into madness. It should also be said that Popol Vuh compliment all of this with a terrifically effective minimalist soundtrack.Aguirre, the Wrath of God is truly one of a kind film-making. It really indicates what a singular talent Werner Herzog is. A great example of a left-field adventure film.",

Just like 'Apocalypse Now', it was famously difficult to make, with director Werner Herzog falling out with his star Klaus Kinski. Personally, I don't like Kinski's performance, which seems both exaggerated and yet lacking in intensity; and while the film hints at the lonely exposure of its protagonists (the space travellers of their day), it never quite made me feel them, and the impossibility of rescue means the dramatic tension is muted throughout. I've seen plenty of less interesting films; but I don't fully understand this one's classic status.",

The film pulls the viewer in right from the start with the Fargo-esque \"based on true events\" tag giving the film some historical credence. From the shaky hand-held shots of the men and their slave making their way down the mountain, and taking rest at the bottom the film never lets you go. Sure there are a couple of moments later on where the film slows down and nothing much happens, but Herzog is trying to show just how tense the men's situation is becoming. Like other's have commented, I too was amazed just how similar the film was to Apocalypse Now (1979), others have stated the obvious comparisons better than I could so I won't go into detail, but certain moments where just uncanny. As the men move further down river, life on the raft becomes more hostile, as Aguirre vies for the position of leader, even though the men despise his selfish actions. Kinski's performance as Aguirre is without a doubt one of the best I've seen, his constants scowl and dead eyed looks he passes to the other men, yet he shows utter devotion to his daughter. The great monolog in which he explains why the men should follow him, boasting that he is \"the wrath of god\" is one of the standout scenes within this film.The images of Aguirre, wrath of God will stay with you for a while, there are some astounding moments including a shocking, yet slightly comical decapitation, and the brilliant final shot as Herzog moves his camera in fast across the water until we reach Aguirre, left alone on the raft, now over run by monkeys, Aguirre still refuses to give up his search for the city even as the film fades to black, sealing his fate. This is a great film and deserves to be seen, after three other Herzog films that I have watched this is the best of the bunch, compelling and definitely thought provoking. 9/10",

Some days later, he splits his men in two groups: one would return to Peru with him, and the other, leaded by Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra), would follow in the search of the legendary city for at least two weeks. Some days later, Ursua decides to return with the group, but Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) leads a mutiny against Ursua. He uses the example of the successful conquest of Mexico and his power to convince and threaten the soldiers to follow him. Under his command, he leads all the men to death instead to the golden city. This movie is a spectacular adventure of a man, blinded by an  obsessed greed and thirsty of power, to the destruction of his followers and his own destruction. Klaus Kinski has one of his best (or maybe the best) performance of his career in the role of a mad commander and traitor.

In some ways Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979) does stem from that same, deep and dangerous place, but as a film this is, in my view, incomparable. Aguirre is madness complete, but true genius in madness.Much of this naturally has to do with the production itself, where the jungle became the deadly and dangerous cradle of folly to the crew just as it became to Aguirre and the others; that Kinski was a monomaniac only equalled by Herzog himself, and that everything, it seems, that usually becomes metaphoric in the film, turns upside down and is projected back into the film: the jungle is a metaphor for the lost self, and because the crew actually lost themselves during the making of the film, the jungle really becomes more than metaphor or allegory - it becomes what it originally only referred to.But let us stop and marvel. We, at no risk, become witnesses to a journey that, because of the obsession, genius and luck is made to be cherished. \"Aguirre\" is an involving, hypnotic experience, indeed like a dream in a world so strange it becomes the stuff dreams are made of.Some filmmakers are exquisitely talented and acute to the nuances of nature. Imamura is one, Malick another. The river is an important metaphor in Malick, in more films than one. I think seeing those through Herzog gives extra meaning without which it would be a shame to watch films such as \"The New World\" (2005).",

The script (written in 2-1/2 days) was right out the imagination of the director (listen to him speak these words in the commentary). This is not an historical recreation, it's pure Herzog.The raft drifted, the story drifted. The actors (I really hesitate to call them actors) mostly stood around waiting for their inevitable doom. I found myself caring less and less about them and rooting more and more for the nameless Indians of whatever culture they were trying to decimate. Women in long velvet gowns and starched lace collars in the middle of a sweltering hot jungle (whichever jungle was never explained) after a harrowing journey through a series of life-threatening rapids. Not a hair out of place, not a spot of mud anywhere. Yeah, right! I felt like I was right there with them, ready to see them duck into the travel trailer and change into the next climate proof outfit.There is really so little here, save the scenery and a thin, familiar story-line of greedy \"explorers\" getting their comeupance. The story is much too slow and not so much badly acted, as non-acted. Most of the secondary characters could have been played by mannequins (maybe some were).

            "content": "Coming off a recent vacation trip to Costa Rica, I was struck by the similarity of the Peruvian locations serving as the backdrop to this story. Our tour group had a couple of rain forest hikes along with two wildlife spotting river cruises, and if I didn't know better, I would have pegged the muddy brown, tranquil river in the movie as the Rio Frio. What struck me though was that the long views of the riverbanks in the picture offered no animal or bird life, which was in abundance on my excursions. Anyway, enough of that.The film begins with an impressive looking descent down a steep mountain pass, and as a harbinger of things to come, director Herzog chooses to focus his camera on long establishing shots, often times unnecessary as in the drawn out view of the turbulent river rapids early in the story. These serve to pad out the length of the picture, which is only a tad over an hour and a half to begin with. With the title acknowledging that the principal character is named Aguirre, it takes some time for Klaus Kinski to initiate the mutiny that takes over the expedition hunting for the mythical El Dorado, the ancient Inca Lost City of Gold. Aguirre is a fanatic, but allows some semblance of composure as second-in-command while undermining the authority of both the original leader Gonzalo Pizzaro (Alejandro Repull\u00e9s), as well as that of Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerraas), the leader of the smaller expeditionary group.What's perhaps most revealing in the story is how difficult it must have been in an a pre-machine age for explorers to make their way through uncharted jungle territory. Watching men drag along cannon and Ursua's mistress (Helena Rojo) aboard a throne-like sedan chair seemed like an incredible waste of energy that eventually ended in a failed mission. And then one has to consider that the director, actors and film crew had to endure these same hardships for the sake of their craft. A 'making of' picture detailing the effort probably would have been as compelling as the film's narrative.I'd consider myself a Klaus Kinski fan, even though I've mainly seen him only as a villain in off-beat Western movie roles. He doesn't quite carry the entire picture here as the principal actor, but his presence does create an eclectic magnetism of a man obsessed by the idea of power, fame and riches. As his men are decimated by unseen arrows, spears and poison darts, his fateful descent into madness is complete, forever to be defeated by the relentless force of an unforgiving environment.",

            "content": "I was dazzled by this, my first experience with a Werner Herzog film, which is a fascinating look through an impressionistic magnifying glass at the details and mechanisms of life and wilderness in the 1500s, when a colossal mass of Spanish conquistadors and captured Indians, climb down the mountains into the jungle below to find El Dorado. The men, clad in half armor, pull cannons through narrow mountainous paths and hot, heavily damp jungle. After a great deal of sweat and nuisance, a small expeditionary group of forty men to carry on ahead by rafting a river. If they do not return to the main party within two weeks with information of what lies in advance, they will be considered lost. Aguirre, played by the volatile Klaus Kinski, is named second-in-command to the leader of the expedition.The environment is so tangible it's metaphysical. Herzog's attention not only to physical and material detail but to atmospheric nuance establishes the feeling that you are in fact watching a movie made during the 16th century. The dramatic action moves forward via true-to-life possibilities of the time and place combined with overpowering incidents of nature. One of the expeditionary rafts is separated from the others and gets caught in a whirlpool. A rescue team is unable to approach the raft for an entire day, when all men on the raft are discovered killed by unknown attackers. The leader wants their carcasses brought back to camp for proper burial. Feeling this would only delay the expedition, Aguirre orders to shoot a cannonball at the raft and the corpses are blown apart. During the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Since supplies start to run out and things get progressively worse, the leader decides that their undertaking is of no use and commands them to go back to camp. This is when Kinski's title character, longing for power, takes the occasion to head a mutiny, telling the men that countless treasures lie ahead of them.The essential charm of this film is that it exhibits the cynical, self-accepting personality of Werner Herzog. There is an ominous feeling of danger in this movie's world. Aguirre proves to be an oppressive leader, so terrifying that few protest his leadership. Those who complain are killed. The expedition continues on a single, newly built, large raft. An Indian couple moving toward them in a canoe is seized by the explorers, but when the man conveys puzzlement at the sight of a Bible, he and his wife are slain at the insistence of the expedition's priest. As explorers continue to be intermittently found mysteriously murdered, Aguirre further instills fear to cancerously spread his leadership. The group at one point attacks an Indian village, where many of the explorers are killed by spears.As the morale lowers, the film becomes more sardonic, a lot of the violence becoming sprinkled with totally unexpected throwaway humor so dry that the tone of the film isn't changed one single bit. Aguirre is eventually the sovereign of a cluster of gradually starving, hallucinating men. It is a prickly, coarse film with a defensive core, embodying the self- protective xenophobia of a finicky, exacting recluse. It detaches itself from any conventionality at all and flourishes as an entirely individual film, and a succulently brutal one at that. An indispensable phantasm, consequently excavated by Coppola, Weir and Malick but inimitable in its prophecy of the sneering yet cathartic insanity underneath our armor.",

'Aguirre, The Wrath of God' is a German New Wave film by the legendary Werner Herzog. To watch it is a fascinating experience, whereby its beautiful imagery establishes a certain mystique.

Klaus Kinski explosive relationship with director Werner Herzog is legendary, and he gave a fiery performance, which has become iconic. Kinski sucks all the energy towards him and I was impressed by the immense fear he spreads to his companions. his \"If I, Aguirre, want the birds to drop dead from the trees... then the birds will drop dead from the trees\"- speech left me chilled to the bone.

It's one of those films that I haven't forgotten at all in the half century that has passed since I first watched it, a film that remains actual in message and artistry, and that if it were released today as a new film would, I think, have an equally strong impact. The script, written according to the legend by Werner Herzog in two nights while he was accompanying his soccer team on a tour, is based - very loosely - on the adventures of a historical character from the time of the Spanish conquest of South America. Historical truth is probably respected to a very small extent, but that is unimportant. Don Quixote is not based on a historically documented figure either, and even Shakespeare's plays do not excel in factual accuracy, but they represent their eras and the passions of their characters better than archival documents and historical treatises. 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes' is an allegory about colonialism, about the meeting of civilizations, about power and about the madness that can lead to glory or downfall. The film is an artistic adventure, and making it was a human adventure.The comparison with Shakespeare is not out of place. Don Lope de Aguirre is a Shakespearean character, a Macbeth who takes over a kingdom through murder and whom the surrounding moving forests will end up defeating. Adjutant to the commander of a patrol sent by Pizarro on a near-suicidal mission, he is the de facto leader of the group, orchestrating a 'revolt' from the shadows that ousts the mission commander and installs a puppet emperor of an empire as vast as imaginary. Deadly dangers lurk around: a lush and hostile nature, natives who see their territories invaded and their way of life threatened. The group of Europeans consider themselves representatives of 'civilization' through the force of the Christian faith that they try to impose on the inhabitants of the barely discovered continent, but their power is actually based on the power of arms and they only bring them slavery, disease and the destruction of indigenous civilizations. El Dorado with its treasures remains a mirage that inflames the imaginations of the Europeans who came in dressed in armory and with their guns. In its search, a political and human drama plays out, which can only end in madness and death.Countless articles and even whole books have been written about how this film was made. Filming took place on location and the film crew lived in conditions not very different from those of the members of the expedition that had taken place four centuries before. A 35mm film camera that Herzog stole from a Munich film school he never graduated from is said to have been used. Most of the dialogues were spontaneous, without a script written in advance. Several of the scenes considered of symbolic value were improvised. The film is dominated by the acting perforance of Klaus Kinski, a formidable actor and a controversial personality, whose relations with Herzog during the filming were as conflictual as possible. That didn't stop the two from collaborating on four more films over the next few years, the last in 1987. All of them are among the best of the director and actor's respective careers. 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes' is probably the peak.",

            "content": "Hopeless, hellish, horrifying, and humorous, 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' is indefinitely the most iconic of Herzog's narrative films. Shot under the most grueling and uncomfortable conditions imaginable, based loosely upon historical fact, and centering on a mad, obsessive, and tragic anti-hero's excursion into the most deranged depths of his already-deranged-pretty-much-by-default psyche, 'Aguirre' is not the most pleasant and cheerful film ever made, but damn is it stunning. The locations and cinematography are eye poppingly gorgeous and colorful and yet fit the film's desperate and bleak tone w/seamless perfection. The lead performance by the chaotic and demented Klaus Kinski is legendarily haunting and convincing (one can easily draw parallels between the real life Kinski and the character he so perfectly portrays in this film). Tonally, the film balances itself brilliantly out w/disturbing drama, subtly absurd pitch black humor, and intentionally miserable, repetitive \"adventure\". \n Everything about the film is dark and grueling, there is no hope, there is only a passionately maniacal weirdo attempting to take control of an already to-likely-be-botched expedition and sadly succeeding. The deluded simultaneous pro/antagonist is portrayed w/an almost brilliant lack of judgement through Herzog's shaking, saddening lens, we are just kind of forced to sit there and view his destruction of all opposition along w/the destruction of all possible success, possible success that was already far-reaching and improbable anyway. Yes, it is a gloomy, dreary, weary, eerie, bleak, dark, disturbing, sad, weird, violent, miserable, surreal, and uniquely funny masterpiece unlike almost any other. While certainly not perfect, and oft-less-than-entertaining, 'Aguirre' is doubtlessly one of the most fascinating, fantastic, and, indeed, GREAT movies of all time.",

            "content": "I decided to check out this film for a few reasons, one of which is that I was considering taking Werner Herzog's masterclass online in which he claims to have every answer and everything a filmmaker needs to know. In the trailer for the class, Herzog admits that he doesn't use story boards, calling them an instrument for cowards, and that he sees himself as a thief, stealing whatever cool, interesting footage he can. Herzog rightfully has the reputation of being a bad ass, world traveler, and daredevil, who will film whatever he can, and I commend him for that. He has a distinctive style, that I think works especially well in documentary form. But out of principle, I find myself hating \"Aguirre\" simply because people love to call it a visionary work, and it's anything but that. Granted, it is a wonderful character study and leading man Klaus Kinsky lends to the film tremendously. But Herzog went in without a plan, shot what he could, got the hell out and put it all together in a way that made sense... which works better in a documentary than in a narrative film. We can call it Cinema Verite if we want to ignore the flaws, but if I'm being honest with myself, it just feels lazy. Justified, maybe... being out in the jungle requires some shortcuts, and having a low budget would limit the ability to enforce one's vision... I still respect Herzog for doing what he could with his limited resources and living to tell the tale. But my point is that there is no vision in this film. Herzog had an idea, rushed to write a screenplay in 2 days (not something worth bragging about in my opinion. Malick's opus \"The Tree of Life,\" my personal favorite, took years and years) and he wanted to go film it somewhere cool, and once again, mad props to him for being adventurous, but out of principle I can't get behind a film people are calling visionary when this is just not one of those films. \"Aguirre\" is only proactive in that Herzog and his crew went on an expedition. Meanwhile the only shot that feels planned is the wonderfully ambitious opening shot of hundreds of conquistadors hiking Machu Picchu, which reminds me of the thing I admire about the film, Herzog's ambition and his exploration of a remote part of the world.Why do you think he's been able to make so many films in his lifetime? It's because he shoots them like documentaries, without any plan, just running around with a camera. We can't hail \"Aguirre\" in the same ball park as films of great, proactive, visionary filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman, etc. That's what drives me crazy about \"Aguirre.\" I'm not going to call it lazy, because I appreciate Herzog's efforts in exploring the jungle, but it lacks the vision of what I believe to be great films. While Kinski's performance is great, the feeling I'm left with overall is quite bittersweet. And I won't be taking Herzog's master class, because I don't plan on being a documentary filmmaker, and that is where the skill set and the answers Herzog seems to have belong. Me on the other hand, I'd like to execute thought out vision, which I believe to be a pillar of cinema.",

            "content": "As Bette Davis said: Fasten your seat belts, this is going to be a bumpy ride.A tough film to classify, let alone enjoy, \"Aguirre The Wrath Of God\" is at times an adventure story, a psychodrama, a surrealist tone poem, and a black comedy. What keeps it together is the visual splendor of its real-life setting \u2013 the Amazonian rain forest \u2013 and a mesmerizing central performance by the moldbreaking Klaus Kinski.In the beginning of 1561, a team of Spanish explorers are sent off by Gonzalo Pizarro to locate the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. They decide in short order to break away and declare their independence instead, as a self-declared empire under the nominal command of one Fernando de Guzm\u00e1n (Peter Berling) but really run by the unhinged Lope de Aguirre (Kinski), who seems to be taking his orders from the wild jungles that surround him.Writer-director Werner Herzog gets strong mileage from riding the anarchy of both Kinski's performance and the Amazon River, delivering a powerfully immersive cinematic experience. It never quite gels as a story or character study, instead focusing on stand- alone images that remain in one's mind after the film is over.\"Our land is already six times larger than Spain, and every day we drift makes it bigger,\" Guzm\u00e1n gloats.\"Have you seen any solid ground recently to support your weight?\" Aguirre sneers.What is the point of the movie? Herzog himself says it was written in a sudden burst of creativity, without much attention to historic detail. I see it as a send-up of man's hubris, thinking they can build something ordered and profitable where \"God's creation is not finished.\" But there are not a lot of signposts to work with here.It's a fascinating film, however muddled. You can watch the German- language version and the English-language version and get two very different experiences. Aguirre himself comes off a little less nutty in the English version, which also offers more context as to what is going on. Both versions are dominated by an awesome silence, however.Exactly when Aguirre and his crew go over the edge is hard to say. Actually, in the very beginning of the film, Aguirre is the sane one, telling Pizarro \"we're all going to go under\" when the latter airily pronounces the worst is over. But once Pizarro sets him loose, Aguirre seems to work up an appetite for self-destruction that only Indian arrows can cure.\"I'm the greatest traitor,\" he tells his crew, late in the movie when there's much less of them to order about. \"There must be no other.\"As tedious as \"Aguirre\" the film often gets, with long static shots of non-actors talking to themselves and repetitious scenes featuring variations on cruel death and vainglory, it never bores with Kinski at the helm. His beady eyes and wild shoulder motions are used to masterful effect. Apparently, Herzog worked Kinski on-set to freak out often, just so the actor would then cool down and the director could then film shots that work. The result is a quiet but menacingly unstable performance that keeps an otherwise random- feeling film together all the way.I can't quite get on board with the masterpiece verdict many spout, but for 94 minutes \"Aguirre\" runs you through the mill and gives you a lot to chew on. Not perfect, just pretty good.",

As the journey progresses however, hardship, disaster, starvation and madness await ...Herzog's third movie (not counting some TV and documentaries) is arguably his best; it has an incredible hypnotic power. Watching it is almost like being drugged with some soporofic, but it is never slow or boring, as if the malaise of the story somehow infects the viewer. The third shot of the expedition gingerly trekking its way down across an incredible mountain chasm while a sheet of cloud hangs in nothingness is one of the most stunning openings to any movie. It's a real image that looks like a special effect; solid yet impossible, scored with a haunting electronic chorale by pioneering synth band Popol Vuh (who worked on five subsequent Herzog films). Film critics have made much of the link between Herzog and the obsessive Aguirre, driving people on in the face of extreme adversity for his own vanity and folly, but this is naive and simplistic. Herzog is not cruel or arrogant, but believes passionately that life experience is essential in making a film - if there is no personal adventure there is no drama or originality. Hence his reason for shooting the movie in the amazing Urubamba river valley in the Andes of south-eastern Peru, in places few people have ever even been, let alone made a film. Klaus Kinski is astonishing in this role, arguably the greatest crazy in his gallery of lunatics, permanently hunched over on his right side, scanning the horizon for a dream that is always around the next river bend, and defying the unforgiving jungle with his implacable will. Loosely adapted from historical accounts of the real Lope De Aguirre, who did sail up the Amazon in 1560 and go insane, but made it to the Atlantic and was later shot for treason. Intense and influential (most notably on Apocalypse Now), this was the first of Herzog's five extraordinary collaborations with Kinski (my personal favourite of which is Nosferatu: Phantom Der Nacht); the English title is Aguirre: The Wrath Of God.",

This account of an expedition to find a fabled city of gold in 1500s South America uses the action and setting to delve into the deepest darkest reaches of the human soul. Kinski's maniacal Lope Aguirre is the embodiment of hubris. Reading about the troubled production, \"Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes\" (\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" in English) comes across as a documentary about its own making. Herzog and Kinski of course went through much of the same on the set of \"Fitzcarraldo\", which drew controversy for creating the same conditions on the set that the movie depicts.Moving along the story as much as the action and setting is the soundtrack by German progressive rock group Popol Vuh. You may recall their haunting opening score in Herzog's \"Nosferatu\" - probably the best adaptation of \"Dracula\" in movie history - while the camera pans across mummified bodies. In the end, the story reflects all successive colonial quests, continuing to the 21st century. Aguirre's fanaticism is no different from any other individual who was obsessed with taking over another land, regardless of the consequences (look at the past thirteen years). The movie affirms Herzog as one of the leaders of the New German Cinema in the 1970s (along with Wim Wenders). It's a movie that everyone should see.As a side note, I'll add that since we in the English-speaking world are so used to seeing historical movies in which every character has either an English or an American accent, it's interesting to see one in which most of the characters speak German.",

When Aguirre says that he intends to stage history as some men do plays, I believe it is a moment of genius. But that is about all that interests me in this film.As far as the direction goes, I was not impressed. The actors seem uncomfortable and the scenes come off as deliberately staged, which is in stark contrast to the filming style, which wants to try and capture everything as natural. The sound is natural and possibly untouched, the camera work is documentary style. The contrast between the home movie feel of the camera and sound and the awkwardness of the actors on scene is jarring.I read in another review that many of the shots were first and only takes. This comes as no surprise when one sees the film. So much of it seems unnatural. This can certainly be used to good effect. David Lynch, for instance, uses styles that are very unnatural, but they fit in with his overall vision of the film. The acting, the blocking, the lighting, the sound, the camera work... it all fits together into a coherent hole, no matter how absurd the pacing of the dialogue in Lost Highway, for instance, may seem on its own. I got no such impression of cohesion from Aguirre: Der Zorn Gottes.Worst of all, the film very suddenly gets quite silly towards the end, almost like a lost episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus. I am sure that many people would say that I missed the point, that the ridiculousness was meant to represent their hallucinations, and they may be right. But I still was put off by it.This was my first experience with Werner Herzog, and perhaps later on I will regret typing this review, like the critics who tore into Psycho only later to put it on their Ten Best list for the decade of the sixties. But this was my impression of the movie. I can see certain attractive aspects, but I cannot say that I enjoyed it.",

If you've been to the Amazon or are interested in the history, I can recommend this. If not, you may want to think twice. The key downsides is the inexplicable plot - we really don't get to understand any of the 'why's' in this film, and the interminable footage of the crew travelling down the river.

Most movies try to play audiences like a fiddle, generally speeding up faster and faster to a crescendo. Aguirre does exactly the opposite. It starts off slow, stays slow and toward the end virtually creaks to a halt. This movie cannot be enjoyed casually, it must be experienced fully. Which is why I don't watch it very often. I don't want to start it unless I can sit through the whole thing. Because the movie demands that you change your natural rhythm to an unnaturally contemplative pace, but if you do you find it is almost like an out of body experience. You are watching humans who cannot be understood, because they don't understand themselves. Cut off from solid ground, whithered by hunger and illness, they discover the true nature of humanity, which is that without purpose, life is nothing but breathing and waiting for death.I've recommended this movie to several people, including my wife, but they can't stand it, because it is too slow. Well, I love it. It's fascinatingly slow. Mesmerizingly slow. I swear, watching this movie slows down my heartbeat and quiets my mind and gives me a terrifying glimpse into what it must be like to be trapped somewhere, incapable of action. I love this film!

All I got were speaking heads and guys that make jokes after they get a spear through the breast. The single scenes don't fit together very well. It doesn't feel like a complete story. Just scene after scene after scene. You can virtually feel the production of the film and how Werner Herzog tried to make it all fit together, but it doesn't work.

On the other hand, it's a bleak tale, and one in which little episodes such as natives approaching in a canoe and the Spaniards burning one of their villages are stitched together somewhat weakly, with jumps forward in time. The screenplay and editing seem disorganized, and while that may add to an overall dreamlike (or nightmarish), chaotic feeling, which was perhaps the point, it also made it a little less enjoyable for me.

            "content": "Werner Herzog, Klaus Kinski, \"Aguirre, Wrath of God\" all these names with a strong foreign consonance incarnate a certain aspect of Artistic Cinema that intrigues and fascinates as much as it scares and revolts.I must admit, not to the point of reluctance, but I've always been quite distant to what movie buffs love to label as artistic, expressionistic, or any kind of films that try to resemble to a painting or a philosophical book, anything but a film. And \"Aguirre, Wrath of God\" was in my unconscious view, the very incarnation of that style of Cinema. This is why, in all honesty, this review speaks to all the movie fans who are still hesitating to plunge in that cinematic universe. So, just take your last breath before the big dive, this is one immersion you won't regret.Assuming this is a film movie lovers would discover more lately in their never-ending cinematic journey, \"Aguirre, Wrath of God\" starts with a very familiar natural setting. The beautiful shots of green-haired mountains' peaks combed by woolly clouds immediately remind of Roland Joffe's \"Mission\" and the score of \"Aguirre\" inhabits the same divine spirit with a more suspenseful and rousing rhythm. The hellish nature of the expedition in search of the legendary El Dorado, a secret viciously kept by the hostile Amazonian Jungle, provides the same psychological thrills you might have endured from Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\", and last but not least, the feeling of a deadly presence, of an implacable enemy eager to destroy every parcels of the civilized world you incarnate, is reminiscent of another film made the same year, John Boorman's \"Deliverance\".The three films I mentioned featured a natural setting made of tortuous mountains roads, thick and humid forests, treacherous river rapids, an enmity highlighting nature's eternal resistance to the men coming to rape them, and where the natives play the role of the protectors, either because they foresee the devastating effects of civilization on nature, or to satisfy their own bestial desires, therefore underlining their physical and mental symbiosis with nature. In simpler words, it's always about the eternal \"nature vs. culture\" struggle and the genius of Herzog is to combine the three strengths of these films in one powerful and unforgettable experience ... a perfect word to describe \"Aguirre, Wrath of God\".I insist on the word 'experience' because I made the movie sound like a philosophical introspection, when it's also an excellent adventure film, whose simplicity in the script and straight-forwardness caught me by surprise. The realism of the direction is almost documentary-like in the beginning, as we follow this long troop of soldiers lead by zealous conquistadors. They're still clad in armor, the least likely outfit to wear in a mountain, and the presence of such oddities as horses or women give early hints that this is not meant to be a military expedition. Overall, there's something absurd going on, the kind of mission we wouldn't bet our money on. But pessimism is not the general mood of the odyssey, the team that would be formed to pursue the expedition, will be guided by a hypnotic light from the El Dorado lighthouse, igniting the soldiers' eyes with a ferocious thirst of Gold.Aguirre, is the true leader, by any means, he doesn't want the expedition to deviate from its goal, and when the orders, when the loyalty to the King of Spain Philip II, to the commander Ursua, become too unwieldy, he's got a quite convincing way to get rid of them, and to make his point. Aguirre is the ultimate Machiavellian leader perfectly aware of the dosage between cruelty and charisma : he either threatens or harangues in the film, and even understands the intelligence of using a puppet leader to better cover his side. The rest of the film, he says nothing, his blue cold eyes, governed by a secret ambition, and his thick lips closed in an expression that whatever it conveys, puts a definitive answer to the question : \"Why is nobody revolting against Aguirre?\" Well, the answer is in the title.Aguirre is not interested in gold, in being rich, it's all about a power he'll progressively display in the film. This power is the incarnation of civilization, civilization that must conquer, go ahead and never step back. One of Aguirre's many rhetorical tricks is to convince the team that if they failed, other conquistadors would come and take all the prestige, he even refers to Cortes as the one who conquered Mexico because he disobeyed. Aguirre's mouth is more convincing than his sword and the intensity in his eyes, reveals a true quality : being visionary. In a sense, he's right, no one, nothing, can stop the march of progress and civilization, because of its ambivalent use of intelligence and violence. In a curious scene, when the team encounters two friendly Indians, there's an almost comical aspect in the absurd way, the priest Gaspar de Carvajal accuses them of blasphemy, as if their 'ignorance' was to blame, which quite reveals the civilized men's own ignorance.The metaphysical undertones of the film and Klauss Kinski's insanely close-to-perfect performance, translate a thrilling adventure into a visionary statement about human nature, a tale revealing that the power of nature doesn't rely on its strength against men, but on the way, it liberates men's self-destructive nature. 'Man is Wolf to Man' : the ferocious ambition and the blinding greed that triumph over humility and respect toward nature, destroy men even faster than bullets, arrows, or starvation. During the expedition, the remains of a boot from a previous expedition is found, making one with the natural setting, like having surrendered to Nature's divine power.Aguirre is the Wrath of Civilization for God is not in the eyes of Aguirre, but in Nature which states its Almighty power ... and only on those who challenged His power, will be applied the true Wrath of God.",

While some directors of film rely primarily on precision- think Alfred Hitchcock, intellect- think Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick, visual poesy-think Terrence Malick, or visceral reaction- think Akira Kurosawa, there is no other major filmmaker that I can think of who combines all of these things so skillfully, as well as having a mastery of music, outside of Herzog. From musical scoring to narrative pacing to visual imagery, he reigns supreme. Before watching his 1972 masterpiece, Aguirre: The Wrath Of God (Aguirre, Der Zorn Gottes), for the first time, all I had seen of Herzog were some of his documentary style films and Fitzcarraldo. This was enough to intrigue me to explore his corpus more fully, and I'm glad I did, for there's a reason this film made him a 'name' on par with his contemporary German directors, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders. Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is a film that combines the best elements of such diverse great films as Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Apocalypse Now, although it is a much more visceral work than any of those films, and is topped off by one of the truly great screen performances of all time, with Klaus Kinski as the titular lead, Don Lope de Aguirre, a cripple who may also be a hunchback- whose outer deformities seem to have scarred him internally, as well. While there are numerous other supporting characters that turn in fine performances, Kinski utterly dominates the screen every second he's on it, moving like some perverse and slavering arachnid, moving in for the kill of an insect he will never bleed fully for he will never truly get it\u0085.Many critics often opt out of a real discussion of Herzog's excellence in craft by falling back on the old and misguided notion that he simplistically follows his whims and is guided by the same sort of madness he accuses Kinski of always fostering. Yet, any look at a film like this shows that Herzog transcends such myopic claims, even if unwittingly; although I seriously doubt the man who is such a scrupulous artist has ever let a foot of film be released under his name without a bit of wit applied to it. As for the screenplay? It is brilliant, knowing when to let the characters speak, and what they should say, and also relying on chance events, such as a flood which washed away Herzog's rafts. He incorporated that misfortune into the tale. Yet, what the film ultimately says means less than the whole experience, or how it is said through the art. Herzog's small budget becomes a strength when he cannot do overhead shots from a plane, or elaborate crane shots, nor delving close ups that gradually close in on someone, nor elaborate retakes\u0085.Herzog admits with justified pride that this film succeeds precisely because it does not follow the Hollywood formula: there is no real hero to root for, no predictable victory to cheer for, no visible bad guys, and no romantic interest for the leading character. Herzog amply demonstrates his superior art in the scene right after Ursua is taken away to be hung. His wife, Inez, who is repulsed by Aguirre, not attracted to him- as would be de rigueur in a Hollywood film, is shown in a shot from behind, simply gazing down at the dark and mystical river. The symbolism is simple, but immense and erotic, in its mix of death and sex, yet we never see her beautiful face, nor her svelte supple body heave. Herzog does not need to tell us that the woman is mourning her murdered husband. He thinks highly enough of his audience to assume that we get that, and also why she then later walks off into the jungle, albeit in a clean golden dress that comes out of nowhere (movie magic, Herzog proclaims in the commentary), sort of like all the stuff the refugees on Gilligan's Island somehow had. Similar scenes, featuring a captured Incan prince, reduced to slavery and interpretation with the natives, and the black slave Okello (Edward Roland- whose character was named after Zanzibarian madmen John Okello, from whose deluded speeches Herzog culled many of Aguirre's speeches), sketch real depths to these characters in only a few strokes.Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is an indisputable masterpiece, and one of the greatest films not only of German cinema, but human cinema. That Herzog directed it when he was only twenty-eight years old is astonishing. Its combination of improvisation- for Herzog loathes storyboards, calling them the 'disease of Hollywood', with an almost Bergmanian chamber drama focus on an individual, also makes it one of the most unique films ever crafted. It is a film to be seen by anyone with a love of art, intellect, and human nature, at any age, and in any age.",

            "content": "You're unlikely to find other movies like \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" unless you can dig up other examples of director Werner Herzog working with Klaus Kinski, Nasassja's father and Herzog's \"best fiend\", under exotic conditions. Well, I guess one does, exist -- \"Fitzcarraldo.\" But this one was a first, Herzog's \"Tristan chord\".With a budget of less than $400K, Herzog schlepped his cast, crew, and equipment into one of the more hostile and isolated areas of South America to film this story of a renegade band of Pizarro's conquistadors. The narrative itself is such that it leaves one wondering, along with Montaigne, exactly who the \"cannibals\" are around here -- the Indians or the Europeans.In 1561 Pizarro sends Kinski's dozen or so men, along with two female relatives and a priest, down a tumultuous river in Peru to search for the legenday El Dorado. Once at some distance's remove from Pizarro, Kinski decides to declare independence from the King of Spain. He elects their own aristocrat as formal leader, battles the indigenous tribes, and executes would-be deserters. The expedition finally reaches a flat silent place where the two or three large rafts drift in circles. Everyone is weakened by starvation and fatigue. One by one, the men and women are picked off by Indians or otherwise die until Kinski is left alone on a single raft, except for a horde of hundreds of tiny monkeys who scamper about while Kinski carries on a monologue about how he intends to be rich and powerful in this new land. What the hell, if Cortez could do it in Mexico, why can't he do it here in Peru?There's hardly any musical score. What little source music there is comes from a retarded Inca slave. There are long periods of silence, during which people stand around and stare at each other or sometimes, in a stylized manner, at the camera. Hardly anyone runs around. After all, where are you going to run on a raft? Distracting hallucinations crop up. High in a tree there is a boat with shredded sails, a canoe dangling from its stern.If all of this sounds a little crazy it's because it was designed that way, to mirror the deterioration of Kinski's men. If it sounds sluggish and boring -- well, it isn't.The location shooting alone is an inspiration. The setting was almost as isolated in 1971, when the movie was shot on a tributary of the Amazon, as it was when Pizzaro's men reached it. There is no solid land. Not only the cast but the crew and the supply people and the Indian gofers traveled on rafts like those we see in the film. (There was one \"speedboat.\") The jungle on all sides is flooded so there was no place to land. The forest itself is an overwhelming presence, fetid, ominous.Or -- take Klaus Kinski's performance. The guy is dressed in authentic armor brought in from Spain, as are the other soldiers, but Kinski moves in a crab-like fashion. I can't remember a scene in which he's completely upright. He's always bent over or leaning to one side or the other. His features are magnetic -- huge blue eyes staring out of that scowl.It's certainly not the kind of movie Hollywood would produce. Most of the men die after being shot with Indian arrows, darts, or spears, but we only see the lodgement of two of these weapons. The characters, even the most important, die gently and quietly.And that final shot of Kinski, surrounded by wreckage and corpses, holding a terrified monkey aloft and bragging to it -- then flinging it away. What an image.I said that it's not boring but I have to qualify that. The film depends on the viewer's ability to take the role of the other. Herzog trusts the audience enough to avoid the usual clich\u00e9s that are spelled out in case you might miss the points they're making. Some viewers who like a zippier pace, lots of action, plenty of music in the background, and who dislike movies with subtitles, will find it boring because it won't suit their tastes.It's too bad, in a way, because those who spurn the film for those reasons will miss that final shot of Kinski talking to the monkey while surrounded by its scurrying cousins. That one shot is worth a dozen movies about troubled vampires. Come to think of it, though, even fans of slasher movies might get something out of seeing it. They may or may not be bored but they'll probably never forget it.",

            "content": "It's been about a year since I saw 'Aguirre, The Wrath Of God' and all I can see in my mind's eye is Klaus Kinski, that crazy-eyed madman of the cinema. German director Werner Herzog (who, in true auteur fashion, also writes and produces his pictures) guided Kinski through 5 films. I can't imagine the other 4 being more bizarrely effective than this one. Before Francis Coppola turned \"Heart Of Darkness\" into the monumental 'Apocalypse Now', Herzog was trekking through the impossible Peruvian rain forest to essentially adapt Joseph Conrad's novel his own way (whether he meant to use the book for inspiration or not).Aguirre (Kinski) is one of many Spaniards on a jungle expedition to find the gold-laden El Dorado. It's a fool's mission...as, you might say, was shooting a movie on these locations. The story isn't about the mission, though---it's that when men go where they aren't supposed to go, some die and others lose their minds. Aguirre eventually takes command and becomes both Willard AND Kurtz. He might be Lear too. And does Kinski ever play the hell out of this role. By the end, as Aguirre defiantly stands amongst corpses and curious monkeys on a drifting raft, he's a microcosm of all the crazy-brave leaders in the history of the world.It's as if he's TRYING to destroy his men and himself as some kind of stupid test. That he outlasts them is not a wonder, since movie stars usually live longest in their own movies. He's tougher than they are, sure. Why does he keep pushing? Why does he become such a savage? Well, I'm guessing that Herzog made this 1973 picture as a cautionary tale about how obsession and power can destroy everything. Call it, \"Apocalypse Before\". As great as Brando was playing Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now' several years later, Klaus Kinski got there first. In 'Aguirre, The Wrath Of God', he's one of the most galvanizing mad warriors of the movies.",

I don't know where I got that idea.Some people claim this movie is intense. They must have watched a different movie. The movie is slow and plodding. For some reason I expected a heroic struggle to survive. Instead people do almost nothing and everyone dies by slow attrition.People claim the movie is beautiful. Maybe it was when it came out but it's not in 2021. There are a couple of beautiful scenes but overall it could have been Gentle Ben. There just isn't that much scenery. If Lawrence of Arabia is a 10 in terms of cinematic beauty, Aguirre is a 4.Even the idea of surviving the Amazon the 1500s I felt it fell short. Sure it made me think about how tough that must have been but I didn't get a feeling of that toughness from this movie itself, only from the suggestion of the topic.I also found the arrow/dart deaths unbelievable. Maybe that's the way it actually was but I'd have expected on big attack that killed everyone. Kind of like the first raft to buy it. Instead one or 2 people die from a arrow or poisoned dart every week. Is that realistic? That couldn't be from a single group and it seems really strange that natives would just randomly kill 1 or 2 strangers from afar for no reason. If you're going to kill them you'd kill them all to take their stuff. In other words, seeing a raft pass by and just randomly killing 1 or 2 people for no reason seems psychopathic. The motivation doesn't fit.In the end I have no idea why this movie is rated so high. I'm sure it was hard to make but that alone doesn't make it a good.",

To say the resultant shoot proved to be fraught is an understatement. And yet, to some extent, the gamble paid off, with Kinski giving a tremendous powerhouse performance. To my mind, however, even this was somewhat overshadowed by the punishing conditions and Amazonian surroundings the characters go through.In front of the camera, the story tells of the travels of Spanish soldier Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Behind the camera, Kinski's tantrums terrorized the crew and local natives who were assisting the production. It is difficult to know which is more fascinating, but there's no doubt that 'Aguirre' is an uncompromising and bleak journey into madness and mistrust.The music comes from West German band Popol Vuh - an excellent soundtrack which conveys both the majesty and unforgiving qualities of the environment. Additional music comes from the persistent native gentleman who doesn't let the conditions put him off playing a selection of panpipe pieces that lighten and irritate with equal measure.As you may expect, the journey doesn't end well for anyone, but the final image of Aguirre alone and still battling to survive, is a strong one. You have to be in the mood for this, but there is no doubt is a very grim and powerful piece of cinema. My score is 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Fear and desperation are two powerful and deeply disturbing human emotions that few directors can easily convey through their films; an even greater accomplishment is managing to affect the viewer with the aid of only a few images that, devoid of much dialogue and events, still linger and trouble you even after the film has ended. Werner Herzog's \"Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes\" is a perfect example of truly affecting cinema that, even through its simplicity, manages to carve itself a memorable space in our viewing experiences.The film records the failed expedition of Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as he leads a small and frightened group of men through the vast desolation and beauty of South America's jungles in the search of the legendary El Dorado. An expedition through the jungles of the new world goes terribly wrong, and a group of men led by Don Pedro de Urzua (Ruy Guerra) and Lope de Aguirre is sent to explore the lands near a river to find food and a route that should hopefully take them back home. Aguirre betrays Urzua and claims the absolute leadership of the expedition, severing it from any relation to the original expedition and from Spain. Driven by fear and by an instinct of survival, these men now follow Aguirre through a mind-bending journey atop a ragged raft through a treacherous river, where there is nothing around them but a despairing solace, lack of food and the maddening certainty of death.Klaus Kinski plays the title role to perfection. He's relentless, vicious, demanding and his wrathful resolve overwhelms the men and takes them to their doom. You find yourself fearing for these men and biting your nails off with apprehension for Aguirre's next step. From the first frame to the very last scene, the camera follows Aguirre and his followers through the breath-taking beauty and danger of the jungle, juxtaposing the natural beauty with the impending doom; natives are hidden in the foliage and, little by little, they finish off with the voyagers. The camera takes long shots at the trees, at the landscape, at the rushing water, and even though we can't see them, we know the natives are hidden there, awaiting their chance to kill these oppressors. A continuous sense of peril and alarming fear prevails over every scene, and it's remarkable how much suspense can be gathered from simply looking at the landscape; it's pure cinematic perfection.The men seldom leave their raft for fear of an attack, so we see as they gradually become weaker and weaker, ravaged by madness and hunger, till every sense of humanity, decency and every point in life has been lost. Each scene treats us to an unabridged piece of silent horror, and above it all stands the maddened and loathsome Aguirre, delivering his so-called \"wrath of God\" upon anyone who dares go against him.The cinematography is ruthless in establishing this fear and desolation, and the music (at times violently serene, at times sarcastically joyous) enhances the fear to unbearable heights. There is very little dialogue, but the images speak for themselves, and there really is no need for words when the hopelessness of the situation is so apparent. And once again we never fail to notice the way so much natural beauty and such splendor mix with the futile attempts these men go through to stay alive one more day. It just can't be fully described by words.Werner Herzog is a master at playing with images and with the viewer's minds, and it's way past remarkable the way he makes you delve deep into the film and savor (for the lack of a better word) the situation. This is, indeed, a cinematic triumph of mood and setting that no cinema lover should overlook.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!",

            "content": "Aguirre, The Wrath of God, is a film definitely worth seeing due to historical controversy, impressive cinematography and a haunting musical score. It's also a spiritual film delving into man's quest for prosperity while questioning man's morality intertwined with his religious beliefs and personal hubris.Loosely based on the presumable diaries of a 16th Century Spanish Monk, Gaspar Carvajal, the story chronicles a journey led by a large group of Spanish soldiers; their group of captive Indigenous men and Inca slaves in 1560. This expedition is led by a Spanish governor, Gonzalo Pizarro, a Spanish General, Guzman, Asura, his wife and a formidable Officer, Don Lope Aguirre along with his teenaged daughter. The first 10 minutes of this film elaborates on the ominous and stagnant beauty of a mountainside along the Andes as we see the group trekking down a slippery stepped path leading down into the Peruvian rainforests. The terrain proves difficult for this cavalcade. While the women are being toted by hand in a large sedan chair by foot on muddy ground they are also dressed in perfectly clean dresses with their hair perfectly coiffed. The men are dressed with Battle helmets, Chest plates and boots. Some have full body armor. We realize, very soon, their gear and attire proves unsuitable for this mission. They struggle through the swampy mud and heavy green thickets with all their armaments and provisions until they must stop out of exhaustion.The leader, Pizarro, realizes this journey is hopeless. As the cavalcade has nearly used up all their food supply and are depleted of energy, Pizarro decides to create a new plan to have a portion of the team split off to forage food and to acquire insights on how to seek the City of Gold, Eldorado. This plan proves to be disastrous, because one of the members, Don Lope Aguirre, chooses mutiny and to pursue Eldorado without Pizarro altogether. After a group of their men get caught in an Eddy on their raft while cruising down the river, they are ambushed by marauding Indians nearby. A power struggle ensues between 1st in command, Asura, and 2nd in Command, Aguirre. Subsequently, Aguirre wins out and the rest of the group bands with Aguirre. They appoint someone to be an Emperor, Fernando Guzman, just for the sake of having a figurehead. However, it's Aguirre who remains the true boss and ruthless leader of this ill fated voyage.Director, Werner Herzog, uses historical facts infused with a fictional narrative based on two separate expeditions. General Pizarro, Done Lope Aquirre and Gaspar Carvajal were historical figures during this time of Exploration, but were on separate missions. Herzog takes Artistic license in adjusting history, and I excuse him for that. It's also possible that Eldorado was just a mythical city of Gold that was rumored by the Indians to lead the Europeans into their lair only to be open prey. Cannibalism, savagery and torture is also suggested. And although this folly proves to be a Fool's errand, it transcends into a deeper understanding of man's psychology through his overreaching ambition and spiritual visions.It's a stunning piece of work visually, despite it's numerous flaws with dialogue and acting. Aside from Klaus Kinski, the acting is very wooden. Some of the death scenes look poorly choreographed or plain stupid. It's as if the actors were incapable of showing pain. The unknowable fear and desperation of traveling on unfamiliar country accompanied with bugs, hostile Indians and a scarce food supply is likely to be a suicide mission. This is what makes this movie worth watching. It's truly a cinematic journey and notable account of World History, regardless of any possible inaccuracies there may be. Herzog draws us into this dreary and perilous world, making us feel like we are part of the experience.\nAlthough the only acting standout is Klaus Kinski as the title character, he also proves tedious as well. His glowering stares, manic grimaces and sinister voice isn't easy to buy as overpowering since he is small in stature and walks with a limp. One would think that such a ruthless and fearless leader would have to be physically capable and domineering to accomplish such an upheaval against his superiors. But as history has it, sometimes the manipulative and dastardly people prevail as the last man standing in times of desperation and crisis.",

Basically set in the 16th century, in the year 1560, decades after the destruction of the Inca empire, a Spanish expedition of ruthless conquistadors leave the mountains of Peru. The band are under the command of Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repull\u00e9s), with Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as second-in-command. They are travelling down the Amazon river in search of gold and fortune, but the journey rapidly becomes more perilous, and loyalty deteriorates when the ruthless and insane Aguirre overthrows the group's leader.

            "content": "The runtime of this film is only about 93 minutes. Is enough to show the road to perdition, the road that, originally, was going to be to a specific place of course, the road to El Dorado. There aren't many documents, at one point the brother Gaspar Carvajal (Del Negro) could not continue writing but anyway it was not a very long journey. As I guess you already know this film is about the expedition of some of the conquistadors in order to find the promise land El Dorado. As soon as some don't see any advance Pizarro (Alejandro Repull\u00e9s), the leader, creates a group that will be separated, a group to find some answers, a group product of the desperation, a group that will never return. One of the fascinating things of this film is that it shows how in the middle of nowhere, well of the jungle the group can't fin any peace due to the natural environment and to the enemies, of course, but also due to its own people. The formed group of course has its leaders; they were Don Pedro de Urs\u00faa (Ruy Guerra) and in second place Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) but everything can change just with some papers of course after some relevant acts. The \"structure\" is logic: one man with influence seems to be afraid of the journey and with that he is the one who really understand the situation of the group. As soon as he sees that their expedition has no hope to succeed he wants to take the group back to Pizarro, who gave them just a few weeks to return with news. In the other hand we have another man with influence, a conquistador who can't be focused in anything but the original mission. This man can go beyond anything, he can't be stopped by his own people, he calls himself the wrath of god. The documents were written by Gaspar Carvajal, the man who is there with his own mission, the religious one. During this journey of course we see natives that now are slaves of the group, at one point the slaves will feel sorry for their conquistadors. Also during this journey we see how easy was to name someone something, they named a new emperor in a new \"society\" that does have the normal inequality, some of them could eat but some could not. It was a broken group since always that was \"together\" for a mission, a mission that was just the road to perdition. Aguirre was someone apart, he just wanted to be like Cortes was in Mexico, he wanted power, he was the always wanted to continue. This is easily one of the best films I have ever seen. It is about madness, on that it is a great character study but it is more than just that. You see Aguirre wanting to continue with the journey and you see his madness. You see Gaspar wanting to kill two natives because they don't know what the meaning of a bible is and you see his madness. You know from one of the slaves that he was like a god for their people who can't see him to his eyes and you see the specific believes of each culture. This shows perfectly the encounter of two worlds; Aguirre looking at that native who plays that traditional music. The cast did a wonderful work, a unique situation since they were from many different countries. Even that I had seen only four performances of Klaus Kinski (For A Few Dollars More, Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht, Les Fruits de la Passion and this one) I can write that this is one of his very finest. \"It was a very simple 35mm camera, one I used on many other films, so I do not consider it a theft. For me, it was truly a necessity. I wanted to make films and needed a camera. I had some sort of natural right to this tool. If you need air to breathe, and you are locked in a room, you have to take a chisel and hammer and break down a wall. It is your absolute right.\"Those are words of Werner Herzog, pure film-making at its finest.So I give my highest recommendations to this one.Something about the R4 DVD: the company Zima has been releasing some Werner Herzog films. I have added to my collection the following films of that Herzog collection: Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht, Woyzeck, Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes. These DVDs are not great presentations (no extras) and they are quite expensive however Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht and specially Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes are very worthy purchases. By the way, this film is presented only in English.",

It is the ultimate river-movie, the ultimate jungle-movie and the ultimate adventure-movie. No one will ever do it better.A mad bunch of opportunists launch an expedition down the Amazon into the most impenetrable thickets...that's not the plot I'm describing, it's the making of the film! Alright, the plot also is about the psychotic conquistador Lope de Aguirre and his doomed 1561 expedition in search of El Dorado! But the film was made on the tiniest budget, in the most inhospitable environment, with few modern conveniences or technical sophistication, and even the camera was \"borrowed\"! Conditions in the camp resembled those in the story, especially since the star (Klaus Kinski) was as mad as the character he portrayed, and the director made him perform at gunpoint. The main difference is that the film was a resounding success; Herzog made it work just by the force of his personality. This was the first movie Herzog and Kinski made together, it was made under the worst conditions with little money when both were almost unknown...and it is their very best. Now I've seen all the H-K movies, I can say this is the most moving, because you can feel the team sweating to achieve results.If you expect action here, you will be disappointed. The tone is moody and introspective, as the movie is a meditation on the folly of human vanity. The music soon alerts you to this, as Popol Vuh's \"choir-organ\" gives the effect of supernatural chanting. It is pointless to complain how the editing spoils the action-climaxes, as the whole intention is to produce a sombre and thoughtful effect, almost Buddhist. You aren't supposed to be excited. We see the expedition slogging through deep mud and lost in impenetrable thickets; an Indian slave says \"My life has been made miserable, but I also feel sorry for you, because I know there is no way out of this dreadful jungle\".Coppola was trying to achieve the same effect in Apocalypse Now, but that is very inferior despite spending 100 times as much ($30m versus $0.3 m). The hardship itself helped in creating the right atmosphere. And the intensity of Herzog's artistic vision overcame the technical obstacles to create some of the greatest images ever, notably the opening and closing sequences.It is said that Aguirre was a Basque, and that this explains his disloyalty to the Spanish crown. It helps to understand Herzog and Kinski if you realize that they are Slavs pretending to be German; their original surnames were Stipatic and Nakszynski. All three seem like talented people in a marginal situation.Watch out for Ruy Guerra playing Pedro de Ursua, the decent commander deposed by Aguirre; Guerra is one of South America's foremost directors, and its a treat to see him in a major acting role. But most of the actors were ordinary people pulled in off the street, and it must be said they do magnificent job. Their acting has been called wooden, but a meditative movie like this demands such a style; especially Cecilia Rivera, playing Aguirre's daughter, whose soulful expression is the sort of thing professional actors spend years trying to achieve.  Her last scene with Aguirre has to be one of the pinnacles of drama.",

Psychedelism was still there in '72 but it was muted and it was a qualified sense of psychedelism; the atmosphere was bleak reflected by the lemon-y/lime/grey/sap-green tones of Herzog's cinematography. The score by West German experimental prog band Popol Vuh 'In the Garden of the Pharoahs' is profoundly cosmic. Polish-German actor Klaus Kinski gives an evocative performance as the conquistador in search of the legendary El Dorado.

The overall haunting quality of the film as a whole is dreamlike in it's delivery, but dark in its implications of human nature and especially in larger context of the natural world itself which both surrounds and spawned that nature.Removed from the historical context and cinematic importance and its potent subtexts, the film itself has not aged very well. An irreverent viewer or an inattentive viewing would result in a poor experience and a lot of questions about the high praise this film carries.

The film won quite a few awards, especially for its cinematography and there are some interesting anecdotes about this movie, such as Herzog's struggles in order to get the monkeys for the final scene.

            "content": "Having seen all of Herzog's other films, there it is just no way I can label Aguire: the wrath of God as a stunning picture. However if this is is your first look at the eccentric German filmmaker whose knowledge of humanity and culture is unparalleled, it certainly does hint at the potential he has. This is the story of the 17th century Spanish expedition in search of El Dorado. After months of treking through thick jungle finding nothing, all hope was lost until one individual, Don Aguire kicked the leader out of the big chair and took charge. His ego and obsession with fame and gold, would spell potential doom for his men.What we have here is very much Moby Dick in South America. Herzog likes telling stories about obsessions and craziness. Actually more than Moby Dick, I can't help but compare this to Herzog's masterpiece, Fitcarraldo made ten years later. Both were filmed in the same corner of the world, with the same star and identical production values. While both films demand a patient attention span, this one is far less interesting, because nothing much happens visually or story wise. It feels ponderous and direction less. Only the first third of the film has structure, but all it really amounts to is a set up for a meandering final hour with lots of four to five minute sequences each containing mere fragments of dialogue, rather than stretched out full scenes.Being neither character driven, nor plot driven, and not quite grandiose enough to be considered a visual spectacle, Aguire the wrath of God, is just a little too distant for the audience to reach out a feel what it is trying to do. At the same time it is not completely a bore. The fact that Herzog even as a young man had the patience to haul a film crew into the most challenging of shooting locations, shows us that this is a dedicated filmmaker. If the movie does nothing else for you, at least it will perk your interest in Herzog, and make you want to view more of him.",

This one is more fragmented with far less continuity. The visuals are impressive and it does deserve credit for whatever inspiration it may have given Coppola to make Apocalypse Now - which is definitely a far superior film.

            "content": "In the mid 16th century a party of several hundred Spanish conquistadors set out from Peru in search of El Dorado, the fabled \"City of Gold.\" In this film, loosely based on fact, Herzog tells the story of such an expedition. After crossing the Andes, progress through the dense jungle ultimately became unsustainable for the entire expedition and, at that point, a small band of several dozen was tasked to continue down the Amazon on rafts. They were given a week to return. This contingent was led by Pedro de Ursua with Lope de Aguirre second in command. Ursua's wife and Aguire's daughter were chosen to go along. The principal part of the film follows the fate of those on the rafts.All of the actors are good, but it is Kinski, as Aguirre, who gradually comes to dominate, both in the context of the story as well as in your imagination. The more desperate the situation becomes, as the raft slowly makes its way down the river, the more Aguirre's lust for power and glory drive him to greater madness. At the end he talks of marrying his daughter (who in fact lies dead on the raft) and jointly ruling the vast new lands he has traveled. Whether Kinski's reputation for being a madman in his personal life is true I do not know, but his unforgettable performance here almost persuades me that he must be a little mad to be so harrowingly convincing. His unstable posture and crablike movements seem like physical manifestations of some inner demons. A few swipes are taken at the Church. While Aguirre claims that it is the small-minded who search for gold and treasure rather than power, it is Brother Gaspar de Carvajal who on occasion displays the most physical portrayal of greed that I have ever seen. As the situation deteriorates, Ursua's wife comes to Carvajal to intercede on behalf of her husband, whom Aguirre has wounded during his usurpation. Seeing the direction things are headed Carvajal begs off, saying, \"The Church has always been on the side of the strong.\"A broader meaning can be ascribed. We are all on a barge floating down a river to nowhere, a barge that moves slower and slower. We are assailed by unknown threats from the shore. And all the time we are convinced that some good think is going to happen further downstream.Filmed on location in Peru the scenery is lush and beautiful. The opening scene that has the conquistadors descending a steep Andean slope in a fog has to be one of the most transfixing ever filmed. There are too many unforgettable scenes to list (I can say this with certainty, since my recent viewing called to mind scenes in my memory dating back over thirty years). Some of the standouts are: the raft caught in a whirlpool, a horse struggling to maintain its equilibrium on a raft (can you believe that they actually filmed a horse on a raft?), a native Indian playing the pan pipes (with a Herzog trademark extended hold on his face after finishing a piece), and the burning of an Indian village. The final scene that has the camera starting at a distance from the one remaining raft, then closing in and circling a couple of times has got to be one of the greatest scenes ever. Aguirre stands alone, his empire having shrunk to dominion over a pack of monkeys.The haunting music of Popul Vuh puts you in a meditative state and is a perfect accompaniment to this dreamlike film that simply engulfs you.This was filmed without any assist from computer graphics and that lends realism to the effort; you have the feeling that this could have been the way it actually was. I have to believe that filming in the jungle and on the river was exceptionally arduous; think of those scenes that have the rafts going through the rapids for example. In the end I wondered who was the maddest--Aguirre, Kinski, or Herzog?",

            "content": "German director Werner Herzog is known as one of masters of cinema, making documentaries and feature movies about many different subjects. One of his early films that is also considered one of his best is Aguirre, The Wrath of God.In 1560 the Spanish have conquered the Incan Empire and in Peru an expedient lead by Gonzalo Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) to find the legendary city of El Dorado has come to a standstill in the middle of the rainforest. Pizarro orders a small expeditionary team to go up river, led by Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra), with Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his second-in-command. But Aguirre quickly mutinies and promises the men fame, land and riches. But Aguirre shows his true colours as a madman and a brutal leader who is willing to lead his men to disaster for the sake of his delusions and lush for wealth and power.Aguirre, The Wrath of God is an art-house film, but it tells a straight forward story that is not bogged down by symbolism or plot cul-de-sacs. Herzog does use the film to explore some ideas of classism, slavery and the absurdities of early modern politics and society. We see how power corrupts, as we see Aguirre use every trick to keep in control and how power, or the illusion of power turned nobleman Don Fernando de Guzman (Peter Berling) who tried to be decent ruler, keeping order and peace within the fractious group, but soon accepts the trappings of power, demanding excess when his men are suffering.The men embark on a rough and tough journey into one of the environment known to man, with a hostile, unseen enemy constantly around them, becoming more surreal as they progress. Francis Ford Coppela has stated that Aguirre, The Wrath of God was an influence on Apocalypse Now and you can see that with how their journeys pan out, particularly the surrealism. I also saw some of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto being influenced by the film, using a simple story to explore wider themes and a particular scene being when Aguirre and the men find a village of cannibals. It is a maddening trip which tracks it toll on the men physically and mentally.Kinski gave an intense performance and combined with his creepy look he was a menacing presence throughout the film: he was the highlight of the film. The whole cast was strong throughout and Herzog gives many of the other characters their moments, forcing on the slaves, their backstories and their dreams. There is a term of the workers and the slaves having better survival skills then their leaders. I admit it was weird to see actors dressed as conquistadors but speak German, but then I think how would a foreign audience feel about seeing a British or American film about their culture or history.Aguirre, The Wrath of God was shot on location and as expected the cinematography was fantastic, showing the beauty but also the harshness of the rainforest. Herzog had to use a really small crew during, so he had use a lot of still and long shots: but it works to the films advance, particularly for the actors who could give unbroken performances. There was also a really good steady cam shot when the men storm a village. Herzog does immerse the audience into the rough world of the South American jungle with all the mud and the rough waters and he does a lot with scenes with no dialogue. He can illustrate this world easily.Aguirre, The Wrath of God is a very good film and it clear why people do adore it. Its strength are its acting, visuals, directional and using a simple story to use to explore wider themes and ideas. It is an example of thoughtful filmmaking and how an art-house film should be made that can appeal to a wider audience. It is also a great example of the determination of a filmmaker who has an idea and despite what happened make sure his film is made.",

Based on the fragmentary accounts of a futile expedition deep into the heart of the Amazonian rainforests by an army of Spanish conquistadors seeking to find the fabled city of El Dorado, the film is a haunting and oppressive study of insanity and the insatiable lust for power and glory.Bogged down in the increasingly impenetrable jungle and with his troops suffering from exhaustion, Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) sends forth a scouting party of his best men under the leadership of Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) down the river on rafts to reconnoitre the area and judge whether there is any point in leading his army any further. However, the expedition is hit with misfortune from the outset as one of the rafts is lost in rapids. Unable to return by the river, Ursua determines to lead his men back to camp through the dense jungle but is instead challenged by his ambitious second in command, Don Lope De Aguirre (Kinski), who leads a mutiny and installs a corpulent nobleman, Guzman (Peter Berling), as the new ruler of his separatist regime.Driven by his desire to conquer the fabled city of gold, Aguirre leads his men further down the river to their inevitable doom on a giant raft which soon takes the appearance of a floating fortress. As they float deeper and deeper into the wilderness the band of soldiers find themselves not only under increasing attack from the unseen native enemy camouflaged amidst the wild river banks but torn apart by the presence of the now captive Ursua, who still retains the loyalty of some of the group. Dissent and fear set in, followed swiftly by hunger, fever, hallucinations and eventually madness until finally a now raving (and seemingly indestructible) Aguirre prowls alone on his raft surrounded by bloodstained corpses and a plague of monkeys.Echoes of Joseph Conrads Heart Of Darkness resonate through this film. Indeed, the parallels between Aguirre and Kurtz are not to be overlooked. Charismatic, ruthless and egotistical men lured into insanity and delusions of grandeur by obsessions with power and glory. As well as this, Herzog tackles religious hypocrisy and weakness through the expeditions priest (Del Negro), whose piety drives him to spread the word of God, but who puts any morality to one side and sways with the breeze in the power struggle between Aguirre and A. Similarly the concept of nobility is treated with cynicism. At one point Guzman boasts of the the size of his new empire that surrounds him only to be cut down when Aguirre notes that not once have they found one piece of firm land capable of taking his weight.A majestically paced masterpiece, Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is at once both vast and claustrophobic. Herzogs use of location and nature creates an oppressive and stagnant atmosphere where the beauty of the surroundings serves to makes the squalid quest for fame and empire all the more harrowing. The cast is faultless, the tensions from the arduous shoot etched deep into their performances. However, it is Kinski who dominates. His menacing presence towers over all around him, creating a complex and very human character who is monstrously pragmatic yet utterly corrupted by his ambition and the pursuit of a dream.",

He is more an artist who wants to \"inspire\".Aguirre, the story of a conquistador who wants to be like Cortez, is truly a risk taking venture. A lot of famous films claim to take risks, but few actually do. This does, because Herzog dares.I won't go into the imagery and mechanics, because Herzog is an expert at those. In regard to my opening statement, there are usually two motivations towards good film making-\"inspiration\" and \"construction\" (one may think of \"construction\" as \"perspiration\"). Most films have a combination of the two. Herzog leans much more towards construction and perspiration.That sets the bar higher. In such cases, an audience looks more toward detail. The director must be \"Perry Mason\" putting everything together.We get a great story.What makes this \"risk taking\" is the novel approach by Herzog. It's probably the true reason he and Kinski fought. The character, \"Aguirre\", does express some motivation, in wanting to be like Cortez, and in caring for his daughter. We know it won't end well for his daughter in this environment, and it's a miracle she survives as long as she does. I don't think this is a spoiler.However, the motivation for his vicious nature and cruelty is not explained. He is a \"thug\". The entire story is clearly told from the POINT OF VIEW of the other characters. He is seen for the demon he is, at least in their eyes.Those who grew up in hoods know that people like Aguirre exist. If you try to understand such people, you will be destroyed, or nearly destroyed. Such people have no real motivation. They truly intend to destroy. Perhaps they think it's cool. Perhaps they think it makes them leaders. Don't try to think about it. Just avoid them. Run away.

            "content": "Director Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinski did some fantastic and outstanding works together, besides Aquirre, the Wrath of God I would name Fitzcarraldo (1982), Cobra Verde (1987) and Nosferatu (1979).In Aquirre Kinski plays the ruthless and insane and passion driven Don Lope de Aguirre, leading a Spanish expedition of Conquistadors to find the city of El Dorado and plunder its riches for the Spanish crown and for himself. What most of them find is an endless jungle, heat, fever and other plagues, hostile natives and madness and finally death. Kinski is one of the few, rare actors who are able to play such intense characters like Aquirre without ridiculing them in on or the other way. And Werner Herzog is a daring director with vision and a look and care for details. Alone the tensions and group dynamics between the Conquistadors are superb choreographed.If you want outstanding movies for your dish, The Wrath of God and the other mentioned movies are made for you: what you get are intense acting, fabulous and unique story(telling) and a great production with (as far as I can tell) great care for historical accuracy.",

            "content": "The most interesting thing about \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" is how so many people seem to gushingly adore this film. I wonder to myself, do they watch it over and over again? Do they recite the \"gripping\" dialogue over and over among their friends? Do they think about the film often?I can't imagine they do because there is so little of value here. The film is boring and unimpressive to look at. The characters are flat. The acting is dull and quite \"hammy\" (obviously fake). And the film grossly undersells its own story. I found myself not caring one bit about the characters or what might happen to them by the end.That is the real shame here, as the actual source material that this film is very loosely based on, that being the journal of Friar Gaspar de Carvajal, is very compelling and could be made into a fantastic film. But this is not that film. Carvajal's original account included reports of large cities in the jungle, well developed roads, monumental construction, fortified towns, and dense populations. Whether you believe that or not, imagine the film it could have made!Instead, we get a few men on a raft for the vast majority of the film. The gushers talk about how \"stunning\" and \"beautiful\" the film is, however it is shot in 1.33:1 aspect ratio (more or less square). Such a ratio may convey tightness and the walls of the jungle closing in (which I assume is the reason for the selection) but it does not convey beautiful landscapes well... if one even considers jungle to be beautiful.An example of a true river descent into madness and hell would be Coppala's true masterpiece, \"Apocalypse Now.\" In that film, you really feel the walls starting to close in, you feel you are with the characters on their boat, you feel the slow decent into hell. That is not this film, except in the imaginations of the people who consider this a masterpiece.",

            "content": "An \"epic\" film usually starts with a lone hero and builds up to a massive confrontation with as many people in costumes on screen as possible. This film inverts that basic equation, giving us a stunning opening shot of the Spanish army and their slaves inching their way through an imposing South American landscape and slowing dwindling parts of this army down until only the enigmatic and insane Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) remains. One's never sure just how insane Aguirre was in the first place, but undoubtedly the film is like a journey to the inside of his cranium, or perhaps his soul.Aguirre and the others bring with them the things that are most precious to them from civilization, which in Aguirre's case is the daughter for whom he carries a sexual infatuation. She herself is silent, even in death. Kinski is the engine of this movie just as he is the driving force for the expedition after they rebel against the crown and establish their most portly and respectable member, Perucho (Dan Ades) as the Emperor of the new world. it's worth watching the movie just to see Kinski work in a really extreme mode.The photography by Thomas Mauch is breathtaking and Herzog's direction is perfectly balanced. It's not an insult to say the movie feels a lot longer than its running time, and a lot bigger than its actual content. It produces the impression of an epic even while subverting all of our expectations for such a historical pageant on every tangible level. The film has no melodramatic structure, no reliance on the dynamics of identification, no heroes and villains. But it also wouldn't be fair to accuse the film of literalism or realism, because the images in the film become appropriately surreal as the logic and reason of the characters themselves gradually breaks down -- decapitated heads continue to express their concern, ships are found in the treetops. The effect is to produce an experience of trauma in the audience as opposed to simply allowing us to view it in a detached way.",

Klaus Kinski provides the greatest performance of his career as the power-mad Aguirre.  More is said about his character by several scenes where he says nothing ... his powerful blue-eyed stare says more about madness than Hertzog's script, (although the script is also brilliant).As a huge fan of Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now, which I had seen several times before I saw Aguirre, I was amazed at the similarity of the two films. Both feature obvious thematic similarities ... (journey down a river to an unexpected fate, decent into madness, the jungle, hostile locals etc) but two scene's from Apocalypse Now, I believe, are a homage to Hertzog's/Kinski's work.  The Dennis Hopper monologue around the bamboo cage is first seen performed by Kinski in Aguirre.  Coppola also replaced a plane in a tree-top instead of the surreal image of the boat in the tree top in Aguirre.  Also the monk's narrative may be seen as an inspiration for Williard's in Coppola's film.All round, great performances from the entire cast.  I doubt I will ever see a better portrayal of madness now that Kinski is no longer with us.",

But it's also quite obvious Herzog exploited Kinskis mental disorders.Kinski was drafted by the Polish army at the age of sixteen, forcing him to leave his mother and sister, both to whom he had sexual relations. During his short stint in the war Kinski spent his time trying to wave down american fighter planes, begging them to shoot him, before going AWOL.Diagnosed with schizophrenia,delusions, psycopathy, depression and anti-social personality disorder he forged a somewhat career with his intense stage-presence and gained ever larger roles in cinema with his raw, unrestrained persona. After several suicide attemps he broke into his psychiatrists home and tried to strangle her.It's when he met Herzog his career took off with Aguirre: The Wrath of God.Herzogs method of making this movie; going on wildly disorganized, underfunded treks into the wilderness with his crew and adding further lability with Kinski,-and then using the mess as promotion worked like a charm.Isolated and under harsh conditions, the crew had to suffer Kinskis stark raving psychoses, and Herzog exploited it to the hilt during the later promotion by mythologizing Kinskis \u00abmaaaadness\u00bb.Herzog brought Kinski along on later excursions, amongst them Fitzcarraldo, as he perfected his machiavellian method.It's a career-making formula, as for going on fifty years now Herzog has used every opportunity to dispense petty anecdotes on the madness of Kinski to anyone who asks him a question on any subject.I saw him in a recent documentary where he traveled around, knocking on the doors of homes where Kinski ostensibly had lived several years prior. The unsuspecting tenants let the famous director in and he had at least two trivial stories of Kinskis maaadness per room. \u00ab...and hier in ze bathroom Kinski locked himself inside, screaming FOR FOUR WHOLE HOURS!!...he was madd....and when he finally opened ze door and came out-, do you know what he said to me?....\u00bb and so on.Well. Now to the movie.Klaus Kinskis acting here, as the character Aguirre is pretty much how \u00abevil\u00bb usually was portrayed in the silent-film era. As the bad guy in a Chaplin short, maybe. -All baleful oogling and bug-eyed scowling. This film unfortunately do have sound however, so we're left to suffer the grating monotony of the few lines he has.And we're to believe him a visionary,strong leader?How realistic is it that they all would be persuaded by this incoherent little goblin with the presence, vision and leaderhip-skills of a deranged old bag-lady?This project, released in 1972, could have been great! -If directed by Terry Gilliam scripted and location-scouted by Palin/Jones starring John Cleese as Aguirre and Graham Chapman as the jesuit priest. Maybe with a song or two and a dance-number by Eric Idle. And Connie Booth could be the sleepwalking maiden. But then, of course, this would be too coherent,intelligent and competently made to make it in the arthaus-circuit.The other \u00abactors\u00bb in this misbegotten mess drones their lines like hostages reading at gunpoint. As they more or less actually were, with Kinski shooting somebodys finger off in a fit between takes. There are however one or two intentional shots too in this movie, but the overall style of direction seems to be \"anything goes\" , the cuts between scenes are often jarring and the soundtrack is abysmal. I do get that the movie has it's cult-credentials down;-with stories of how tough it was in the making, the low budget, the love/hate-drama between actor/director and that they had an unhinged star to contend with-, but it's a silly stinker nonetheless...So for weeks they are rafting through the jungle, eating tadpoles and rationing rice, slowly starving to death....whilst on a river full of fish and with monkies running between their legs..And the two females they bring along are through it all perfectly made up, with fresh blow-dryed hair and crisp, white dresses. They even die noncommittaly. Uninvolved and unflustered like window display mannequins.It inevitably ends as expected,though. As incoherent and un-persuasive as the character of Kinsky is, -it pretty much mirrors Herzogs direction.Maybe the two of them should have just fessed up, gotten a room and left the rest of us out of it?",

This expedition was also the inspiration for films as \"El Dorado\" (1988, Carlos Saura) and \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008, Steven Spielberg).\"Aguirre\" is in my opinion superior to this films because of his heavy use of symbolism. The search for gold also stands for the search for power and fame. We see the expedition crew travelling downstream a wild river. External enemies remain unvisible on the river bank and much of the story is about tensions and power struggles within the crew.The central role that is played by the river and the constant threat emanating from invisible enemies brings films as \"Deliverance\" (1972, John Boorman) and \"Apocalypse now\" (1979, Francis Ford Coppola) to mind. Indeed in \"Aguirre\" we see both the disintegration of civilization (\"Deleverince\") as well as the sinking into madness (\"Apocalypse now\").After seeing \"Aguirre\" onde does not easilly forget the last images where Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) stumbles about the raft as the last survivor. Surrounded by dead bodies he is still dreaming about establishing his own empire. Klaus Kinski gives a perfect performance as Aguirre. His limping walk and lurking eyes give the impression of a dangerous animal.Werner Herzog is maybe the most driven director of \"Die Nue Deutsche Welle\". He loved making films at extremely difficult locations, such as the Peruvian rain forrest. He not only shot \"Aguirre\" in Peru, but for example also \"Fitzcarraldo\" (1982). His images of the surroundings illustrate both the beauty and the unapproachability of these areas. In the opening scene (filmed at Machu Picchu, Peru) we see the expedition descending a mountain. Symbolicly the film is descending into the story.Herzog also knows how to draw our attention with elements that do not fit at all in the general surroundings. So are the two noble ladies enormously at odds in the rain forrest. The scene in which one of them slowly disappears behind the trees is mysterious and intriguing (I got a deja vu with respect to \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (1975, Peter Weir)).",

However the word that flashes through my head is 'overrated.' Having stated that I think the acting throughout this entire movie is unconvincing so Kinski becomes the shining actor here by default. The film itself employs too many long takes thus making the narrative slow moving and laborious which for an adventure movie (the cannon I believe this falls into) places it in bad stead. The opening shots of the soldiers & slaves descending a mountain lasts about ten minutes of screen time and NOTHING happens at all. As motioned above Thomas Mauch is the saving grace for this film and he has collected two awards (German Film Award, 1973 & National Society of Film Critics Award, USA, 1977) for the cinematography of this picture. Although it's more a personal comment from Walter Hill on Vietnam, Southern Comfort (1981) covers similar ground (better trained & equipped Soldiers terrorised/killed in a strange & hostile environment by the poorly trained & equipped locals) I feel it is much more successful dramatically & a much more rewarding experience.",

After the group runs into many troubles, a spirited and largely egotistical man named Aguirre mutinies and takes control of the group, quickly becoming obsessed with discovering El Dorado for himself and becoming a god in his own right.This movie has many fine things working for it that add up quickly to make an appealing and enthralling movie. The on-location shooting does more than reveal the merciless world they were trying to conquer, it hems in even the camera and the action into one long act of pure claustrophobia. Great acting creates utterly believable characters, and directing and cinematography enhance the experience.Stranger is the writing. Obviously, being conquistadors, these were very obsessed folk, enraptured in the idea of glory on earth (gold) and in heaven (spreading Christianity). Herzog does not let up on their personalities, and comes at many times close to making the characters rather unbelievable. Luckily, the few spikes towards pure nonsense are rather Absurdist in a good way, and definitely show the destructive power of the self-righteous greed of humanity, yet it all seems to be placed very realistically. Modern day audiences will find it difficult to relate to these characters, though they can still understand them.Either this is brilliance or just over-the-top. I can't decide which.

It is legendary in film circles not only for its beauty, wide scope, amazing storytelling, Klaus Kinski's performance but also for the troubled production, delays and Herzog's craziness.Werner Herzog's third film opens with one of my favorite scenes in cinema. The great krautorock soundtrack and all the people walking down the huge mountain and into the forest. I love this opening scene for many reasons. The llamas in the background, the man carrying the wheel gives the movie this peculiar authenticity that not even the low quality of the costumes can take away. We see the the people all gathered in the forest as the King Pizarro decides to separate the people and send a small party to find El Dorado. Aguirre will be second in command and now for the first time we see Klaus Kinski in full form with the gleam of madness in his eyes.From this point on we saw how the troupe are driven to destruction by the madness of Aguirre to find El Dorado and all its riches. The men go crazy along with their misguided leader and are slowly killed of as the Indians attack them with a volley of spears, arrows and small poisoned darts. They begin to have a non chalant attitude towards death because everyone around them is dying and what sense can one make in such a world.The movie is filled with so much beauty that you have to see it a couple of times to take in the film's wide scope. The great shots of the water and the ending shots are some of the most influential camera angles in cinematic history. These same techniques would later be used by Coppola in his masterpiece Apocalypse Now which incidentally is also about a man's descent into madness.Herzog wrote the script on a bus ride after a football game. The film was shot as it was written. The crew has to undergo every bit of the turmoil that Aguirre and has men landed up in. It was shot on location in the Amazon forest. Herzog almost became Aquirre the mad man on his mission. Crew members left him and decided to head back. Herzog threatened to shoot himself. He was channeling Aquirre.If ever a man came to discovering the ecstatic truth it was Herzog in this film.

It's a story of a man whose God completely denounced him because of his greed and delusions of grandeur, and therefore cursed him in the midst of paradise and turned it into hell. A hell of illusions, mirages and unfulfilled desires, preceded by inexplicable, dreadful nightmares and an ominous warning of a disturbing sound of silence. This is the Wrath of God that comes upon whoever exceed his limits as a human being.What strikes me about this is that it's a story of a grand scale, compressed into a compact 95-min long film without losing a pinch of its epic quality, and that's due to the perfect pacing, I guess. As my first Herzog, I'm really impressed by how his raw docu style feels so cinematic. Unlike other directors who only use some kind of a pseudo-documentary style to give their films an authentic feel, Werner's camerawork, as I mentioned above, fully adopt this style throughout the entire film. We even get, once in a while, observational and poetic shots. And, all of a sudden, a ghastly and hideous image is revealed, and then lingered upon it. Moreover, the way the film changed its tone and became a bit whimsical and implausible at the end is simply astonishing. However, I think there are some jarring tonal shifts between one act and the other. Other than that, this is a peerless masterwork of filmmaking and storytelling.(9/10)",

It's a polarizing picture with some loving it and others hating it. I'm in the middle.I see its greatness: It's artsy, realistic, haunting and there are potent, unforgettable moments, like the titular character skulking around with a menacing look. But it's also not as effective as those two future films because it's rather un-compelling and when the end credits start rolling the viewer is more likely to say \"that was different\" than be blown away.The movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Peru.GRADE: B-",

            "content": "Aguirre:Der Zorn Gottes/Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972) displays a documentary style sensibility that makes the audience believe they are watching a film with historical significance.  The documentary style apporch of the motion picture makes it even more enjoyable to follow.  If there were cameras available at the time the story takes place in than this is what would be the result.  The documentary style cinematography works to the film's advantage.  Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972) is a film where the documentary style and fiction style blend together very nicely.Filming in the jungle was a difficult and frustrating experience for the cast and crew to deal with.  The first film Werner Herzog would film in the jungle and certainly not the last.  The director would return to similar locations almost ten years later when he did Fitzcarraldo(1982). The jungle plays a vital role in the destiny and emotions of many of the people in the feature.  The jungle to Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972) is as important to the story if not more than any other aspect of this pic.Although the first time Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski worked on a film together, it wasn't the first time that Herzog and Kinski meet each other. The first time Herzog meet Kinski was when Herzog was in his early teens. Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972) marked the beginning of a well known love-hate relationship between director and leading actor.  The first of five films the two men did with each other which includes Nosferatu(1979), Woyzeck(1979), Fritzcarraldo(1982), and Cobra Verde(1988).  There couldn't have been any greater contrast of personalities then there were with Herzog and Kinski yet they managed to do five films together.A few reasons why Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972) is a much better film than Blair Witch Project(1999).  First, there is more imagination put into this film.  Second, its much more effective in the less is more theory with the scenes where the natives strike without being on screen. Third, made with a similarly low budget without the annoying and pretensious aspects of BWP. Fourth, more professionally done by a director who loves the cinema.Aguirre:Der Zorn Gottes(1972) may have inspired Francis Ford Coppola to produce and direct Apocalypse Now(1979).  Don Lope de Aguirre is a character that is similar in his madness for power with Colonel Kurtz.  Many ideas and scenes from this picture influenced Coppola's masterpiece war epic.  has some things in common with the stories of Joseph Conrad. The travel through the swamp river to discover El Dorado is something out of the novella, HEARTS OF DARKNESS.A powerful study of greed and how a person can change in his/her personalty when thinking solely of wealth.  The El Dorado subtext is secondary to the adventures of the Spanish Conquistadors looking for the city of Gold.  El Dorado in Aguirre:the Wrath of God represents something that is unatainable or unbelievable.  Everyone in the story except the Countress is affected by how finding the City of Gold could change their life.  The El Dorado subtext is here to provide the film its foundation.Its nice to see a film without the usual Hollywood chiches attached to it. Intense in realism as well as steeped in unromanticized adventure. By Shooting the film without any of the usual Hollywood tricks, Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972) is heighten in pure realism.  Many of the scenes had to be shot only once because of budget restraints and the avilability of one camera.  This meant that there was no room for error in shooting some sequences.Don Lope de Aguirre is a fascinating cinematic figure of the German New Wave.  He is a person who is silent yet dangerous as well as being someone who can strike without warning.  Don Lope de Aguirre is played excellently by the only actor who could have done this role in Klaus Kinski.  Aguirre is an obscure historical figure to whom not much is known about.  Based on a power obsessed general whom Herzog heard about and knew briefly.Contary to the film's appearence, Aguirre:Der Zorn Gottes(1972) is really an anti Adventure film.  Adventurers are depicted here as money and power driven conquerors who care only about their own well being.  The adventurer is painted in a realistic and not so nice portrait.  The director films adventurers for what they really were.  The adventurer here is not a heroic or noble figure like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft.A lot of chaos and stress went with the making of Aguirre:the Wrath of God(1972).  Kinski according to the director was both a pleasure and pain to work with.  In the commentary of the film on DVD, the director talks about when his leading actor would go out of control.  The speech made by Aguirre at the film's critical point is awe inspiring and charismatic.  One of my favorite scenes is when a native is killed after throwing the bible on the floor of the raft because the book did not talk(after all the priest told him it contained the word of God).",

Yellings are visceral, fear is natural; fights are emotionally charged, settings are numbing.The slowly driven pace of the boats over the Incan Rivers are as progressive and sluggish as Aguirre's explosion and descent into Wrath. The film is a little slow and boring, but is extremely artistic and needed into a cultural cinematic library. The movie is passionate, raising over all Klaus Kinski raging role. At the moment the caravan starts drifting of the river, fear is smoothly introduced and a sense of restlessness and awkwardness dominates the crew and the audience. Aguirre is a fearful figure, and the leafy setting will uncover Man's most primary emotions, in a deep, sharp study over the Human Nature and it's development over the ages and situations.But what one ultimately values more is Klaus Kinski's vital role. Besides his constant struggle with Werner Herzog in real life, all of his conflicts and worries are exposed violently in scene, with impressive realism that jolts the audience. As they say, you have to be a little crazy to act so greatly as a such.",

            "content": "Aguirre, The Wrath of God draws inspiration from historical events to portray a story about greed, colonialism, religious fanaticism, glory, and madness. The story is set in the 16th century and depicts the journey of a group of ill-fated Spanish conquistadors across the South American rain forests in search of the mythical El Dorado. Led by the dangerous and probably-insane Don Lope de Aguirre, they face sickness, inner intrigues, Indian attacks and Aguirre's own self-destructive behavior.This is the first movie by Werner Herzog, and it's one of the best movies I've seen in recent times. I'm amazed he just went to South America with a small crew and shot this epic movie. Visually, it's impressive: the shots of the forest, with its mist and thick vegetation, are haunting; the shots of the conquistadors going downriver in fragile rafts are breathtaking and exciting, leaving you pondering how they achieved such shots.But the real draw is Klaus Kinski's performance. This was his first collaboration with Herzog and, even though legend says both hated each other, it must be his best performance ever. Used to seeing in only in small roles in spaghetti westerns, I was amazed at seeing him dominate the entire movie with his presence and intense eyes.Aguirre is a fascinating character: capable of styling himself emperor of the Americas, declaring independence from the Spanish crown, ruthlessly conspiring against all opponents, killing all enemies and leading his men towards death for his own glory and fame. And Kinski plays him with conviction, making the viewer wonder if he wasn't perhaps a bit insane himself.In many ways this movie resembles Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'; but imagine if that novella had been written from the point of view of Kurtz going upriver, showing the things he saw and did that turned him into a self-styled God. That's Aguirre, The Wrath of God, a movie which shows the collapse of sanity and how easily a man can descend into the illusion that he's more than a mortal. And the rest of the themes are present too: the uncaring natural world, the conflict between a supposedly primitive culture and a decadent modern one, the masking of vicious deeds under the guise of civilization (in the movie's case, in the guise of saving the primitives' souls from damnation).And it's only 90 minutes long. Packed as it is with ideas and action, there's never a dull moment in this movie, which will stay with the viewer for a long time to come.",

            "content": "'Aguirre: Der Zorn Gottes' is an interesting audiovisual study in the psychology of 16th century colonization through the mind of the film's central characters. In search of wealth and glory, a Spanish expedition encounters the banks of the snake-like Amazon River and is physically subdued by Peru's untamed nature. While the main force of the expedition becomes stationary, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) leads a small group of these colonizers further down the river, in a paranoid pursuit of mythical El Dorado -The City of Gold.The initial colorful obscurity of German-speaking conquistadors is quickly overshadowed by the documentary-like delivery of this extremely physical film. Klaus Kinski's striking appearance dominates the screen, coupled by the solemn figure of Brother Gaspar de Carvajal (Del Negro). These two characters engage in a memorable interplay against the magnificent backdrop of the South American jungle, all wrapped in Popol Vuh's haunting ambient soundtrack.The film's flamboyant amateurism is at times alienating, but should not discourage the patient viewer. The noticeable budgetary constraints inevitably confine this production in more ways than one, but director Werner Herzog manages to compensate for some of these gaps with reasonable doses of creativity and directorial stamina.Though ultimately a lacking production, 'Aguirre: Der Zorn Gottes' deserves to be watched for its austerity and boldness -both characteristics that make it the quintessential anti-Hollywood film. Herzog's German wit and striking recollection render the director's commentary, provided in this DVD, far more enjoyable than the film itself. Tolerable, 5.7 stars out of ten.",

            "review_title": "A unique and fascinating survival film",
            "content": "When I looked at a summary of what this film would be about, I assumed that it was going to be a fast-paced action film. However, what I got was something entirely different. This film felt unique compared to other survival films, and I don't think that many other directors would be able to make it as good as good as Werner Herzog did. This is a kind of a film which gets more mysterious the more I think about it.In 1560, hundreds of Spanish conquistadors leave their home in the Andes mountains in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. Running low on supplies, 40 men are ordered to scout ahead by a raft on a river. If they don't return in one week, they will be considered lost, and everyone else will return without them. However, their expedition proves to be more and more dangerous as the days go by.As I said above, I was expecting something completely different. I was expecting a typical fast paced action/survival film. Instead, this movie had very few battle scenes. Most of the action showed a character hit by an arrow or die off-screen. We sometimes saw glimpses of Indians or heard gunfire in the distance, but every time a character was killed by the Indians, the enemy was always unseen. I feel like Herzog's reason for filming the action like this was to show how vulnerable the Spaniards were. It was almost like he was letting the audience know that they stood no chance against the Indians. This aspect also applies to other areas. For instance, after a group of people become untrusting of their leader Guzman, he is found mysteriously dead moments later. Another great scene is when one of the characters walks off into the jungle never to be seen again. However, the best use of this aspect involves the large group of people who waited for the 40 men to come back. Since they were never seen again in the film, it raised the possibility that they might be either struggling with the Indians or are already dead. I'd say that despite the exception of a single scene and a single line of dialogue, the action was perfect.The character of Aguirre is hard to describe. The reason I say this is because it's hard for me to decide whether he was meant to be a protagonist, an anti-hero, or a villain. If I had to choose, I'd say that he falls somewhere in the middle of being an anti-hero and a villain. He seemed like a character who cared about nothing more other than having everything done the way he wants and discovering El Dorado at all costs no matter how much of his men are still alive. He didn't seem to care about the fate of his crew (except for maybe his daughter). If any of his men would try to defy him, he wouldn't hesitate to end their life. A great plot point that given us insight to how mysterious Aguirre's character is was how he wanted Ursua to die. After Ursua is sentenced to death, the leader of the group (Guzman) prevents him from dying (an action which clearly infuriates Aguirre). After Guzman's mysteriously killed off, however, there's nothing stopping Aguirre from executing the man. With that being said, I feel like Aguirre killed Guzman, because that way, he'd be able to kill Ursua without anyone stopping him. Guzman's death seemed convenient for Aguirre. Aguirre is definitely one of the more memorable movie characters I've seen in a while.The visuals in this movie are also worth noting. They feel both awe-inspiring and unsettling. A great example of its visuals is the intro to the film. It does a great job introducing us to the environment the film takes place in. When the film starts off, we see hundreds of men and women marching down narrow paths in the mountains. The scope of this shot is amazing as it lets the audience know how insignificant the men are compared to the terrain they're walking across. It also gives you a feeling that the Spaniards and the Indians will encounter numerous hardships during their expedition. Another scene that has a similar feel to the intro is when we see the rafts floating down heavy rapids in the river. Both of these scenes show that Herzog isn't afraid of risking his crew's life just to make a film.There are also a few haunting visual set pieces. One of these scenes occur near the end when the Spaniards see a ship up in the trees. All of them react differently to it. One person thinks that it's a hallucination while another person thinks that it's real. Aguirre tells his crew to bring the ship down so they can use it to sail to the Atlantic, but one member of Aguirre's crew immediately refuses to do so - this is one of the only times in the film where a character disobeys Aguirre. This is a disturbing scene as it shows us how weak the mental state is of the remaining crew members. Another memorable scene is the ending where monkeys overrun the raft. That scene shows how Aguirre has been conquered by nature.In conclusion, I was pleasantly surprised with this film as it turned out to be completely different than how I imagined it would be. It's a brilliant film. It may not quite reach perfection, but it's still an outstanding and a unique film. The action scenes feel unsettling, Aguirre was a memorable villain, and the visuals evoked different moods from me. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for Herzog in the future.",

            "review_title": "Man Proposes, God Disposes !!!",
            "content": "Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' is not a film that can be merely watched, it has to be experienced. While watching the film, I truly thought that Herzog didn't just convey a story, he put a bit of his heart and soul on screen. The film stars Herzog's frequent collaborator, the eccentric and volatile Klaus Kinski who plays the titular role of Aguirre. Although the story is loosely based on real events, the script is pretty much a fictional account of the travels of a Spanish soldier named Lope de Aguirre who leads a group of conquistadores and their Indian slaves down the Amazon river in South America to find El Dorado, the city of gold.The film commences with a prolonged single shot of the line of conquistadores with the Indian slaves going down a mountain and the shot is slightly obscured by the mist. The camera stays stationary while it captures the scene. It is a shot that is immensely beautiful in its surrealism while also being thematically transcendental. The men look like ants walking in a straight line. They have huge ambitions of conquering lands and becoming rich, but they are nothing but tiny ants in comparison to the vastness of the mountain and the surrounding elements of nature. Popol Vuh's haunting music lends a spiritual undertone to the entire film.I believe this film is about man's obsession with power, fame and superiority and how God in the form of nature can be completely indifferent to these obsessions and ambitions. I think the principle of accepting nature as God like it is done in some religions like Hinduism is the basis of interpreting the meaning of the film. When the conquistadores led by Aguirre try to ransack nature, nature hits back. All the deaths happen off- screen. We are never shown anyone firing the arrows at the conquistadores. We just see the arrows flying towards them, almost creating the impression nature is fighting back and thwarting the greedy conquerors. This aspect of man's mad obsession falling prey to the nature's forces was clearly an inspiration for Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'. Aguirre is the manifestation of the greed and lust for power that humanity can fall prey to internally. His obsession spreads through the others in the mission and anyone who questions Aguirre gets dealt with mercilessly. Considering that this film was the creation of a German filmmaker, I found it very difficult to not think about Hitler and Nazi Germany. Aguirre shares Hitler's colonial obsession with annexing other countries and conquering nations. We also get another similarity between Hitler and Aguirre in their desire to create a pure dynasty. The film's production and shooting processes have become infamous due to all the troubles that Herzog had to face in the form of lack of money, highly treacherous filming locations and the anger of the extremely volatile Klaus Kinski. But he kept on persisting and his obsession in making the film almost mirrors Aguirre's unflinching obsession to find 'El Dorado'. There are many signature shots of Herzog's surrealist film language like the shot of a ship hanging at the top of a tree, a scene where Aguirre holds a newborn sloth and is appreciating its beauty and telling his daughter how naive it is and how it has remained asleep for the major portion of its life, but we know that Herzog clearly wants to say that it is the humans who are sleeping and naive in trying to assert their superiority over nature. Herzog also critiques religion in the film. There is a clear distinction that Herzog establishes between organised religion and God. His guerilla style of filmmaking actually accentuates and captures the madness in the story instead of serving the purpose of being a gimmick. Apart from Werner Herzog, the other person whose name has to be mentioned is Klaus Kinski. Everyone mentions Anthony Hopkins in 'Silence of the Lambs' when talking about an actor having an immense impact and owning a film with very limited screen time, I think such a discussion should also include Kinski's portrayal of Aguirre. Even with limited screen time Kinski has an undeniably chilling impact. Every gesture and every mannerism of his is expressive. His character's madness and obsession gets expressed through his postures and his eyes. This is one of those legendary screen performances that not only ornaments the film, but also ends up elevating it.To end this review I will analyse the last shot of the film. The final images will stick with me forever due to the beauty and the depth of what's on screen. There are corpses lying everywhere on the raft. Aguirre is the sole figure still standing. He holds his dying daughter. We see Aguirre's hand soaked in his daughter's blood which figuratively conveys that her death is on his hands and in the bigger picture it establishes the perils of the coming generations due to the greed fuelled obsessions of their ancestors. Now we had earlier seen the soldiers torturing animals, but now a group of numerous monkeys are seen invading the raft, thus signifying nature completing its revenge. Aguirre is still holding on to his deluded obsessions and moving on. This is one of the most beautifully poignant ending to any film I have ever seen.Aguirre, the Wrath of God is a philosophical work of art. It is not for everybody and I can only recommend it to hardcore art-film lovers. But the themes explored in the film are giant-sized. I can't stop thinking about it even after days of watching the film.Aguirre says that he is the 'Wrath of God' and then looks directly at the camera. He thinks he will do whatever he wants and no one can stop him. His naivety prevents him from realising that he is not the 'Wrath of God', he is just a victim of the same.",

            "content": "In a way quite similar to Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Aguirre, the Wrath of God is primarily about a ride straight into madness. In this case this is due to the obsessive nature of humanity and the indifference one has with other concerns when faced with a promise of riches.It is a colorful, yet eerie and haunting movie because of the eeriness of the soundtrack and the visual deterioration of the expedition ( aswell as the unseen natives picking them off one by one ) as the journey progresses. There is a constant suspenseful silent feel around the film which seems like anything could happen at any moment. In the end it is obviously about Klaus Kinski's character and his greedy psychopathic madness which causes him to keep going on a never ending quest for El Dorado, a mythical illusion symbolizing the emptiness of man's obsessive compulsion.Klaus Kinski is, ofcourse, excellent as the crazed 'Don' Aguirre. His facial acting screams out the word 'madness' ( Quite possibly so convincing because Kinski himself has been described as a madman in real life. ) and his path strays further and further from humanity as the film progresses, eventually even showing indifference to his daughter. Unfortunately none of the other characters are quite as fascinating as Kinski, which makes the film in turn revolve more around him, but he carries it with such conviction that this does not lesser the film's quality by that much. There is little dialogue, and there is a lot of silence throughout the movie, emphasizing the inner dilemma of the question whether 'El Dorado' is even real.The movie's on location shooting results in beautiful shots all the way through. The first one is obviously the greatest one. In the first shot of the film, we see a staggering view of the entire expedition making its way down the mountain, symbolizing how little we are in quest for riches beyond our belief. As a combination of movement and cinematography, the opening scene also has to be one of the greatest and most beautiful openings to a film ever made. One of the slightly lesser qualities of the camera work seems to be Herzog's tendency to film with a moving camera on things like the rafts or at the indian village causing it to become quite bouncy and difficult to see what's going on. This was probably implemented to improve the audience's immersion, but still widescreen shots still seem like the better way to go.It is in the end not about a quest for gold, but a study on how greed affects the obsessive nature of man and changes a man for the worst. This obsession causes man to develop illusions of themselves to neglect any kind of argument that it cannot be real, and this is displayed perfectly in the final stages of the film. With a masterful Kinski performance, excellent on location cinematography ( except for lesser handheld shots ), a great psychology on greed and obsession and a great moral dilemma ( Ursua being the voice of reason, and Aguirre madness ) it is a great film.",

The further down the river they head, the more distraught the bunch becomes.The characters are well crafted. Klaus Kinski does a commendable portrayal of the egocentric and senseless Aguirre. The other actors all form a likable regiment of warriors, which one can't help but grow attached to. The sound effects are decent, but the musical score is great. The cinematography is good as well. The shots of the rain forest and the conqueror's propaganda (which quickly becomes worn out) is pure eye-candy.The main strength of the film is that it succeeds in being both an entertaining adventure story and a deep philosophical journey.

            "content": "In 1560 Gonzalo Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador who had conquered the Inca Empire, dispatches a forty man expedition by raft to search for the fabled 'El Dorado', believed to be deep in the rainforest surrounding the headwaters of the Amazon River. The ill-equipped foray is led by Don Pedro de Urs\u00faa (Ruy Guerra) and his second-in-command, the unstable Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski in the titular role) with the fat, ineffectual nobleman Don Fernando de Guzm\u00e1n (Peter Berling) in tow as a representative of the Spanish Crown. Accompanying the soldiers are Brother Gaspar de Carvajal, dedicated to bringing the Word of God to the unenlightened, and Urs\u00faa's mistress Helena Rojo and Aguirre's daughter Flores. To some extent, the women represent the unreality of the entire expedition as their presence necessitates hauling a palanquin down steep Andean passes, through the dense jungle, and eventually onboard the flimsy raft. The scenery and cinematography is outstanding, notably the opening scene of the endless column of armoured men and Inca slaves wending their way down an impossibly step trail (filmed on the Huayna Picchu in Peru), burdened with cannon, horses and the aforementioned palanquin. Kinski (who may have been as loopy as his character) is superb as Aguirre: vicious and intense, walking awkwardly with his back twisted and one leg rigid, as if his body is as imbalanced as his mind. Stories of tension between the volatile actor and director Werner Herzog abound, as do tales of Kinski assaulting members of the crew (including shooting one in the hand). The film has moments of acerbic commentary on the audacity of colonialism as Guzm\u00e1n, floating aimlessly on a disintegrating raft, languidly waves his hand, indicating his claim to all of the land through which they drift. The final scenes, deftly directed by Herzog, in which Aguirre, who now styles himself 'The Wrath of God', lording over an army of monkeys is fantastic. Despite the limited resources available to the filmmaker and his team, the story and production is excellent, with a great cast is backed by beautiful imagery and stirring music. On par with 1982's 'Fitzcarraldo', Herzog and Kinski's other epic of dreamlike obsession in the jungles of South America.",

            "content": "Aguirre, The Wrath of God opens with a spectacular wide shot showing a long, snaking line of big, strong men in armor navigating a treacherous mountainous terrain. Tagging along are Indian slaves, animals for slaughter, and a few well-dressed women of royalty. The minimalist, atmospheric electronic score by Popol Vuh accompanies the scene, its strangeness echoes in the vast, inhospitable nature that surrounds these brave and crazy men. In just the opening five minutes, director Werner Herzog brilliantly transports us to a world that could be described as curiously bizarre.By the end of the film, Herzog has brought us to the edge of madness and back, leading us to question the extent to which power, greed, and fame can possess one man to see past reason and rationale, and as a result, cause his followers to suffer terrible consequences. Aguirre, the title character, as played by the great Klaus Kinski, is that man in question. He oversees a mutinous charge to overthrow the expedition's leaders, and force the rest to follow him in search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold.During their journey, these people find themselves lost and trapped in an environment they know little about. Shot in the Peruvian Andes, Aguirre is one of many Herzog pictures that are characteristically (or should I say, notoriously) filmed in daunting, and almost hellish conditions, making the great German director a rare breed amongst even \"crazy filmmakers\". To constantly put actors and crew in the \"shithole\", and direct them according to his artistic demands, Herzog has taken filmmaking to, for better or worse, a new level of obsession.Story-wise, Aguirre takes quite a while to pick up momentum. This is probably due to the presence of a narrator, whose monotonous recount distances us from the characters. It is only past the quarter mark that the lead character Aguirre starts to shine. Kinski 's performance slowly grips us, as we are dragged into his insanity. The last half-hour of the film sees him on a huge wooden raft floating in the middle of a still river under the scorching sun. His men are feverish and hallucinating. Some see a boat washed up on top of a tree. But could it be real? After all, they seem to be in a world where a man beheaded at nine can still count to ten.The very remarkable final shot sees Aguirre standing motionless on the raft, now filled with decaying corpses and hundreds of scurrying, scavenging monkeys. The camera revolves around it multiple times like a whirlwind, suggesting that the madman is giddy with the prospect of fame and power. Aguirre, The Wrath of God is raw, hypnotic, violent, and filled with macabre humor. It is one of Herzog's best films, and one that very much introduced the civilized world to a filmmaker whose cinematic pursuits literally know no boundaries.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All righrs reserved!",

His wide-eyed, tense look makes him look absolutely derranged, and his limp only adds to that. He's very believable as a crazed and murderous conquistador whose connection to reality, which was probably initially tenuous, degrades even further throughout the movie.As for the rest, it's competently put together. The other actors mostly do a fine job. The scenes involving animals and scenes of violence look impactful. The Incan flute player plays some very excellent music.As for the plot, the story of a would-be colonizer gone mad with ambition to find El Dorado and claim the land on his way for his own use and management is interesting and compelling on its own. Here I think the Aguirre actor did it something of a disservice. The truth of the matter is that he looks crazy from the beginning and it doesn't look like there was much of a progression.Why it's cited as one of the greatest movies of all time, I can't say. It's a competent movie, compelling mostly on the strength of the casting of this one main guy, but I can't say there's anything extremely meaningful or novel.Honourable Mentions: Cannibal holocaust (1980). I think Holocaust did many things better than this movie. It shows the barbarism of modern man when brought into contact with premodern people and also devolves into fatal violence as the natives, stepping into the role of natural disaster, bite back.",

Vice clothed in virtue feeding vice clothed in virtue, and with delusion on both sides of the spectrum. Sooner or later, vice feeds upon itself, and so it does here: death and madness. Innocence sacrificed. Rationality sacrificed. What could have been a very good life for many, sacrificed. The \"what's really the point?\" of human nature and the meaning of life.A great movie for a thoughtful night, but it's slow, heavy and brooding. No real emotive action scenes. No comic relief of note. No Mozartian hopeful flutes coming through the cellos. If this movie makes you feel, it is through your head, so you need to be in the right frame of mind. And, it does not present a happy view.My rating is because I don't find this film as entertainment, as such. It is more of a study of human nature, relationships, self-interests, and the meaning of life. Not to compare apples and an oranges, but other works do it with more entertainment value. Perhaps this work is a 10, but, for a forum as IMDB, that type of rating may imply a different type of entertainment quality. To me, this movie is more head than heart. That's why I will need to watch it again, to study it further, but that is a type of work. I study the subtle complexities and human nature lessons of Master Shakespeare, too, but that's fun.

No one films nature as well as Herzog, and here it becomes a crucial character in its own right, introduced in the stunning opening shot, dwarfing the characters immediately.We see a cloud-misted mountain.  Slowly, the camera pans down, down, down, and, in the distance, a formation of people move, trailing a tiny line through the jungle, looking like ants.  the camera continues to pan down, and now we see the people slowly lumbering to the forefront of the frame: hundreds and hundreds of sweating, exhausted Spaniards, dressed in 16th century style, slowly making their way through the dense growth.  These days it would be done digitally, and couldn't accomplish what happens here: that these people have come so far, have no real hope that the end is near, and continue to disappear into the thick with all the hordes of a kingdom -- horses, livestock, cannon.The description cannot do the scene justice.Aguirre is the madman who pushes the expedition further and further down the river in search of a city of gold.  He manipulates the others, who are tired, hungry, sick of the whole thing.  Even as his personal empire is reduced, Aguirre becomes further determined until nothing is with him but a blazing sun, probable malaria, and a raft overswarmed with monkeys. Kinski's performance is outstanding: expressionistic, oversized, and yet perfect.  The film is extraordinary and hypnotic.One caveat, perhaps unnecessary: the story is gripping, but unfolds at nature's pace.  Not as slow as, say, BARRY LYNDON, but the narrative is rather deliberate.  Give it a few minutes to catch on in case that opening shot doesn't seduce you straight away.",

Herzog himself is, notoriously, not unfamiliar with delusions of grandeur, and his mania for authenticity is demonstrated throughout the film, from the stunning opening image of Pisarro's troops descending the Andes into the Amazon basin, to the claustrophobic rainforest locales, which likely provided his cast and crew with a test of endurance equal to any the Spaniards themselves faced four centuries earlier.

Things begin to fall apart early on, such as the loss of a raft to an eddy and an attack brought on by the natives.  As the crew reluctantly presses on, the hazards only get worse, leaving the men frustrated, exhausted, and hungry.  Noticing their hopes and loyalty to the Spanish emperor are diminishing, Don Lope de Aguirre, the second in command, subtly begins gaining the trust of the group in order to make his move later on.  Eventually, he hijacks the expedition and intimidates the crew into following his orders.  Aguirre's actions are driven solely by greed, and a series of violent outbursts results in the loss several soldiers, as well as food, transportation, and supplies.  As the remaining crewmembers' health begins to rapidly deteriorate, Aguirre's ambition for wealth still remains, leading to an unforgettable conclusion that manages to transcend surrealism while still seeming 100% plausible.AGUIRRE is definitely among the most powerful films of all time.  It is a movie that is experienced rather than simply watched, and merely passively viewing this film is impossible.  To put it simply, virtually everything about AGUIRRE is perfect, from the haunting soundtrack to the gorgeous picturesque scenery, which Herzog wisely emphasizes in his shots to better capture the mood of the situations and to show the beauty and the viciousness of nature.  The performances are also nothing short of first-rate, especially Kinski's chilling portrayal of the ruthless title character.  And the photography, cinematography, editing, and costuming are so awesome, they are beyond description.There are very few films that impact me after repeated viewings, but AGUIRRE is one of them.  Even after watching it a handful of times, it is still just as intense, and I can't help but to become entranced by the picture's hypnotic spell once again, all the way until the unnerving yet inevitable conclusion.

At the end of the film, only one of them is still alive - the others have starved, been shot by Indians or gone mad. That's good material!Pacing: glacial.Acting: terrible. Calling it 'wooden' is an insult to the trees. There is not a single actor in the film who has more than one facial expression. Klaus Kinsky (Aguirre) does his maniac-routine, exactly as in every other of his movies. He and the others speak their lines as if they had just joined their highschool theatre society.Dialogue: Banal. Actually, the English subtitles are quite a bit better than the German spoken dialogue, which is so bad that it makes you cringe.Costumes and sets: The male costumes are good, they are suitably dirty and used. By contrast, the female actors (Helena Rojo and Cecilia Rivera - what is her role, by the way? She does not say a word) look impeccable, with clean sixteenth-century courtly dresses, always freshly washed hair and immaculate makeup.Photography: ok, I suppose. There are some nice scenes, and a couple that might even be called poetic (for example, one of the Spaniards looking at a butterfly).Score: I liked it.In sum: I decided to watch 'Aguirre' because it is so highly rated - considered a sort of classic, really -, but much of the praise heaped upon it seems to be based more on the bandwagon effect than on genuine enjoyment of the pretentious claptrap that the film is.

I thought it was very well filmed and that the actors had very interesting performances. The story itself was a little confusing for a first viewing and even a little bit slow. But, the allegories and hidden meaning through the symbolism and filmmaking were very well crafted. The themes of madness were also very apparent.I found it really interesting during the discussion when Herzog mentioned how they shot all of the film on location and most of the shots had to be done in one take. For example, Herzog states that the famous \"Wrath of God\" scene was done in one take. As well as the shot of the ship stuck in the tree, the final shot with the monkeys, and most of the raging river shots. They quite literally could not afford to do things twice. Herzog kept saying he was so young when he made the film, only 28, that it was \"a film made by kids, a kids film.\" Werner also shared how he went door to door during shooting to get money that he needed to pay the hundreds of extras. And He sold his shoes.Herzog also shared a story about Kinsky and how he genuinely was mad just like his character. He told a story about how he shot a gun in a tent filled with crew and extras because they were making to much noise in the jungle late at night.It was a very interesting movie and it was really cool to sit there and watch Herzog himself have a discussion.

Unlike usual films nature is not just beautiful and soothing canvas in Herzog films but mystery and absolutely indifferent one towards humanity. Herzog shot his films as raw as nature itself. Perhaps, it's these impressive qualities which separate his cinema from rest of the auteur of the World Cinema.Men keep trying to fathom, exploit and challenge the nature from the very day he became part of this planet and till day nature remains an unsolved mystery to them. In Aguirre, Herzog takes us to the mid sixteenth century in the heart of jungle where a large group of Spanish explorers trying to search El Dorado, a land of gold located in depth of Amazon tributaries. The journey is full of misfortune as changing climate is taking toll, food ration is short and the terrain is difficult and hostile Indian territory. But still it's not nature but human avarice and obsession which brought the biggest tragedy.El Dorado is represented as an illusion, almost like mirage in desert. Aguirre is rebellion who became traitor and the precursor of tragedy making all others innocent victims. Herzog's favorite Klaus Kinski's presence is dominant all over the film as maniacal tormentor. It's no easy film but disturbing parable of human vices. Striking visuals encapsulated the whole journey part from very opening long shot to its shattering end. The scene where Aguirre addresses, \"I'm wrath of God' in monologue with only presence of monkeys on raft is brilliant moment of irony. Human is back to his primate stage addressing primates.Only Herzog can do this. While reading the book 'Herzog on Herzog', I come to know that his own life is almost as mysterious and natural as his films. It's one more masterpiece of New German cinema.

At the same time, a song composes the scene with sounds that travel between the sacred and the rusticity of the Indians. It's the band Popol Vuh (name of the Mayan holy book) led by Florian Fricke.If the music is sinister, the presence of Klaus Kinski in the role of Don Lope de Aguirre sets the harrowing tone of the action. When the expedition splits into two groups, Aguirre rebels treacherously and cowardly against the leadership of Dom Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra). Leaving this nobleman injured, he appoints the unimpressive nobleman Don Fernando de Guzman (Peter Berling) to command the expedition.In a meeting with an Indian couple who cannot hear the word of God in a bible, the arrogance of the Spanish conquerors is expressed.In contrast to jungle adventure movies, where it is known that someone will survive in the end, this film offers few alternatives to the hostile environment of the equatorial forest, the rushing river, and the arrows of the Indians.There are no spectacular scenes, nor many dialogues. Faith in Aguirre's delusional thinking, which speaks of being emperor of a kingdom full of riches, or the fear of this delirium, causes everyone to follow him.In the end, what you see is a limping Aguirre and what remains of his expedition drifting on the Amazon River on a raft. The hallucinated commander's speech becomes increasingly ambitious about the future, while little monkeys insist on occupying the float.",

Clearly, the film is technically sublime. The jungle itself is a character and the overall mood of this movie seemed to me to be dark, yet somehow striving to be positive.Kinski was really quite good as Aguirre, who leads a group Spanish Conquistadors and some Indian captives down the Amazon River in an Ill-fated quest for the mythical city of El Dorado. Yet only hardship, insanity and death await. There are many quiet scenes throughout and Kinski himself seemed to understand the power of understatement of both word and action.A number of scenes are memorable. The opening shot of the Conquistadors traversing the mountainside, the arrival at the cannibal village, but the closing scene was stark for me. Aguirre, the madman who proclaimed himself to be the wrath of God, floating aimlessly down river. Hostile natives ostensibly surrounding him unseen in the jungle around. His crew and daughter lie dead or dying, a hoard of monkeys scurrying around his feet, yet there he stands, alone striking a noble and regal pose, plotting with no one how he will conquer all the possessions of New Spain. Aguirre, The Wrath Of God is a forceful portrait of madness and cruelty, and it was captivating to watch.",

            "content": "Werner Herzog is one of the most unique directors in cinema history, and Aguirre is the work that most encapsulates his approach to film-making. Normally, I dislike neo-realism in cinema \u2013 for me it makes for boring films by the all too often unfocused, episodic storytelling and mundane subject matter. The difference with Herzog is that, although he adopts a realist style (rough camera-work, naturalistic performances, non-professional actors and so on) his subject matter is far from mundane.By adopting those neo-realist techniques for this incredible period tale of gold-hungry conquistadors lost in the Amazon jungle, it's almost as if a documentary crew has been transported back in time. In spite of Herzog's reliance on spontaneity and improvisation, there has still clearly been enough pre- and post-production work to make this picture well-crafted and cinematic. He is almost like John Ford in his economy of expression, introducing characters and explaining their relationships and preoccupations with just a few well-placed shots. Although everything looks natural, Herzog saw no importance in striving for authenticity \u2013 Aguirre is full of anachronisms and factual errors, not to mention that the whole thing is dubbed into German.The Heart of Darkness-esquire plot crops up time and again in cinema, and Aguirre could even put you in mind of a dark and despairing twin of The African Queen. In fact, Herzog's work has a few things in common with that of John Huston (African Queen's director). Both show humanity struggling against nature - not comfortable within it. The wilderness is rarely beautiful in Herzog's films \u2013 for him, nature is the enemy. You can also clearly see the influence this film had on Francis Ford Copolla's Apocalypse Now. There are in fact some very direct references to this in Apocalypse Now \u2013 the hails of arrows, the wooden cage \u2013 as well as Dennis Hopper's madman being clearly based on Aguirre's creepy sidekick Perucho.Aguirre may be slow paced, but it keeps the viewer enthralled with constantly engaging set pieces. The atmosphere is kept tense and brooding, with eerie jungle noises underscoring every scene. There is also Herzog's slightly absurd touch, with many surprise comical moments \u2013 the ridiculous puppet king, Aguirre's bizarre oaths (\"whoever even thinks of deserting shall be cut into 198 pieces\") and suchlike.At the heart of this picture is Klaus Kinski's mesmerising performance in the title role. Kinski is genuinely one of the greatest actors who ever lived \u2013 I am serious when I say he ought to be up there with Brando and De Niro. Unfortunately, not only was he generally considered too ugly for a leading man, his regular outbursts of rage and violence meant many directors found him impossible to work with. Herzog handled him brilliantly (the behind-the-scenes stories of Aguirre's shoot are fascinating) and managed to get from him a disturbingly subdued performance, full of menace. He would then deliberately provoke the actor's anger when the script required it.Aguirre is a unique and incredible picture. The stories of how it got made are as engrossing as the film itself \u2013 the cast and crew more or less lived the experiences of the characters. Personally, this is as close as I'll get to watching anything \"arty\", although luckily Herzog has always resisted any pretentious, highbrow interpretations of his work. It's a far cry from Hollywood, and it's not exactly exhilarating, but once you've begun watching, it's hard to look away.",

This is a film in which I regrettably use the word: pointless. I simply did not see the \"point\" of this movie. I heard rave things about it, and was expecting something, well, better.The first sequence of the movie is a long train of the travelers descending down the side of a mountain. I have heard people say it is on of the greatest opening sequences to a movie ever. I thought it was too long.The last shot of the movie is Aguirre standing on raft with dead bodies strewn about and monkeys running around on the raft. He is talking about how he will marry his daughter(the only person he really likes), become King of El Dorado, and form the purest dynasty ever. And then it ends with a circling shot of the raft. People have said this is the most desperately disturbing shot in cinematic history. I saw nothing special.Just to clarify one thing, this is by no means a terrible movie, but no where near as good as hype makes it out to be. You will hear people say it's \"Breathtaking, \"Disturbing\", and \"Simply Amazing\". Well, it's not. I was disappointed. Again, I simply did not see the point to the entire movie.

Having only seen Herzog's Documentaries I wasn't sure how I would like this one but being a Herzog film I figured it would be bleak, probably depressing, and for sure my kind of movie.It was all that and more.The film opens and amazes you with its scope. The cinematic quality of the film can not be understated. Breathtaking scenes and views of the Amazon rainforest, surrounding mountains, and river are populated with such an authentically dressed and burdened cast that you would swear you are seeing this group of Spanish Conquistadors as they truly would have been, trudging through that jungle. Not at all the story book drawings of finely dressed and armored noble Europeans which populate many people's imaginations of this period.As they descend the tight mountain passes and trudge through knee deep mud carrying dismantled cannons on their backs, the extraordinary feat of exploration which these expeditions were is profoundly impressed upon the mind. Watching this film leaves one feeling exhausted at merely the idea of such an endeavour. How much worse must it have actually been.As the Spanish continue to search for El Dorado, the mythical city of gold, we begin to get to know the group and are finally introduced to the film's namesake, Aguirre, the second in command of the expedition, played by Klaus Kinski and we immediately recognize him as being different from every other man in the group.Maybe it is the way he stands, the way he glares, the way he stalks around, or the way he pontificates, but it is quite apparent that he is thinking, acting, and speaking on another level from everyone else. His intensity is so palpably felt that every other person in the team knows that though Aguirre is only second in command, he is the true leader of this cadre.",

The claustrophobic camera work from their tiny, wayward raft feels like an embedded documentary crew covering this weird, violent moment in world history.

            "content": "An involving contemplation of the human condition, `Aguirre, Wrath of God,' directed by Werner Herzog, is a pensive meditation on the nature of the species, an emotionally engrossing film that is visually stunning (it was filmed on location in the Amazon), insightful and imaginatively presented. The story begins in 1560, with Pizarro (Alejandro Repulles) and his army of conquistadors traversing the Andes in search of wealth, as in the wake of the conquest of the Incas some years before, the Indians began circulating stories of the legendary City of El Dorado, which purportedly held riches beyond measure.  When they reach an impasse, however, Pizarro commands forty men to continue on down the river by raft, to seek out any Christian civilization that may be of help or able to lead them to their destination. He places Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) in charge, with Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his second in command, giving them one week, after which time if they have not returned, Pizarro and the rest will go back the way they came.  Among the forty chosen to go on, are Ursua's wife, Inez (Helena Rojo), and Aguirre's fifteen-year-old daughter, Flores (Cecilia Rivera).  But when this leg of the expedition goes awry as well, Ursua issues orders that they are to return to Pizarro; Aguirre takes exception to this, however, and rallies the men against Ursua, telling them to consider Cortes, who disobeyed when ordered back, and then went on to conquer Mexico. What the men do not realize at the time, is that Aguirre is a delusional madman with an agenda of his own, that actually has little to do with the acquisition of wealth, but everything to do with what he perceives to be his destiny as the `Wrath of God.'\tHerzog has crafted an absolutely mesmerizing film that is innovative and transporting.  He permeates the story with a hypnotic, ethereal atmosphere that draws you into this world, and allows you to experience the hardships of the river and the nearly insurmountable obstacles of the Peruvian Rain Forests and the mountains.  He creates that sense of being in a dream, where nothing is real, all of which is enhanced by the deliberate pace Herzog sets, as well as the haunting score that intensifies Aguirre's descent into madness.  There are a number of truly memorable scenes, the most brilliant of which frame the story:  The opening takes you along with Pizarro and his men as they negotiate the treacherous mountain paths, plodding slowly through mud and mist against all odds.  It's an extended scene that allows the viewer to assimilate the full import of what is transpiring, and with it, Herzog is letting you know what to expect from the rest of the film. It's a breathtaking beginning, rivaled only by the final scene, in which the camera endlessly circles Aguirre as he stands alone on a raft in the middle of the river, expounding his delusions of claiming lands and the conquests that lie ahead still, surrounded by scampering monkeys and an aura of doom.\tKinski, with his natural, haunted expression and the chilling depth of his eyes, is perfectly cast as Aguirre.  He captures the very essence of a man whose soul is damned, yet remains adamant in his quest to fulfill what he deems to be his own destiny.  Cloaked in armor, his long hair straggling out from beneath his helmet, he exhibits a singular countenance, infused with menace and an attitude of invincibility.  It's a powerful performance that underscores the impact of the contrast between the strength of his misguided and paranoid character, and the folly of his actions.  That he is unbalanced is obvious fairly early on in the film, and because of that, coupled with his determination, you are quickly able to discern the probable outcome of the story.  And it's disturbing, watching and knowing the fate that awaits these people with whom you've become involved, while at the same time, you're somewhat numbed to it all by the wistful state of being into which you have been so subtly lulled by Herzog along the way. \n\tThe supporting cast includes Edward Roland (Okello), Dan Ades (Perucho), Del Negro (Brother Carvajal), Armando Polanah (Armando) and Peter Berling (Don Fernando).  An honest consideration of instinctual behavior, `Aguirre, Wrath of God,' is a thought provoking study of the innate predisposition of man to go forth and conquer, regardless of-- or perhaps owing to-- his present situation, whatever or wherever it may be.  It's a rare film that will take you to a place wherein reality is seemingly an illusion reflected in madness, profoundly borne on the artistic wings of Werner Herzog.  I rate this one 10/10.",

It's one of those cases, like Apocalypse Now, where the film is probably less interesting than the making of it. Werner Herzog directs and Klaus Kinski stars - the duo is famous for their volatility (Herzog threatened to kill Kinski at one point during shooting). Consider that along with the fact that they were shooting in the middle of the Peruvian jungle with more actors than crew members and you begin to realize that the film's depiction of descent into madness could easily have been a chronicle of the filmmakers' journey.The movie starts with some long shots of a convoy moving precariously along mountain ledges, equipment and food often falling over the edge. It is an image of civilization intruding on the natural world and nature is winning. But that doesn't deter the conquistadors leading the expedition to find El Dorado. Even when the party is divided, supplies dwindle, and people are being killed by invisible natives, they do not turn back. Instead they decide to abandon the other group that waited behind and form their own country once they get to the mystical city. Kinski plays second-in-command Aguirre (really first-in-command since the royalty present is a pushover under Aguirre's insane thumb) who just knows they get closer to the treasure and unlimited power every minute. It is he who pushes the party forward. What he and everyone else fails to realize is that they are the ones who have been abandoned to the mercies of nature. They glide down a murky river seemingly unable to stop even if they wanted to.Herzog delivers the movie with spare dialogue and an emphasis on surreal visuals. Two things that stick in my brain are the images of a boat trapped high on a tree, indicating some sort of Biblical disaster there, and Aguirre's raft covered with dozens of screeching monkeys. After most of his crew has been killed, he paces around the raft surrounded by the monkeys, his new crew, soothing himself with the promise of eternal life and limitless power and wealth. So it's a story about mankind's unquenchable thirst for more control, more power, more money, and more more more. And the further we get from that point, the more convinced we are it is right around the corner. This is a chilling film that won't soon leave my mind.http://www.movieswithmark.com",

            "content": "This movie seems to get rave reviews almost unanimously by critics and fans alike, but I wonder if this isn't as much due to a favorable bias towards \"anything Werner Herzog\" than to the movie's real merit.It was certainly quite an extraordinary undertaking for the director, not even 30 at the time of shooting, to make a film under such precarious circumstances, with a small budget and many unforeseen snags and dangers. And the film does succeed in providing some memorable images set in the ominous and tantalizing jungle, combined with a haunting soundtrack.But the film fails to deliver a coherent narrative, a story and characters that the viewer can believe. Klaus Kinski's presence in front of the camera amounts to little more than posturing; the central character would have required at least some fleshing out for us to care about him. His threatening, wide-eyed stares and occasional outbursts leave us wondering who he is supposed to be. The same goes for the other characters. Also, better, more consistent use of the narrator's (the monk's) voice-over would have provided us with a thread tying together the disparate scenes into a clearer story.Ultimately, the film suffers, I think, from being essentially the product of Herzog working by himself, alone at the helm in the jungle, then in the editing room. \"Apocalypse Now\" was also a \"pet project\" of another great director. But in the latter case, Coppola most certainly had a host of film professionals assisting him in creating his nightmare vision, and the result is far more convincing and compelling. \"Aguirre\", by comparison, seems amateurish and unfinished. Werner Herzog has made it a personal mission to denounce \"Hollywood production values\". But to successfully pull off a film such as \"Aguirre\" aspires to be, a minimum of production resources and experience are required, more so than what Herzog had.",

I can't recall a single shot in this film that didn't look like it was filmed at eye-level.The reality of the cinematography is essential to realizing the point of the movie -- their journey, their drive to conquest, their justification of it, is an empty shell.The appointed leader of the expedition is abdicated, so Aguirre appoints a figurehead while reserving power for himself (a la Dick Cheney). These men proclaim laws, claim land, proselytize, speak of purpose and mission, but there's no substance to any it. They're just an effete body of men on a raft floating aimlessly -- morally and physically.The message is that the Spanish monarchy is just as bereft of probity and purpose as the self-appointed leader of this mission. The laws he writes overnight are as depraved as the Old World laws that have stood for centuries. And the spoils of a fictional city of gold are just as illusory as those of the New World.",

Believing that El dorado a city of gold lies waiting beyond the next mountain is a lesson in wishful thinking.  Finally, deciding to build a raft and continue their journey by river, gets them into deeper trouble as they become sitting targets to hostile tribes armed with poisonous darts.  The river scenes with the adventurers exposed on the broad expanse of river and tribesmen lurking in the shadows anticipate the inevitable consequences.  Klaus Kinski is an actor of few words but has great intensity.  He uses an effective technique with back to the camera, slow turn and then an unflinching stare at the camera.  He sure grabs his audience in a kind of magic spell.  The final massacre is a scene not easily forgotten - absolute slaughter including decapitation. There is no comic relief in this film, although I must say that I found the little thatched hut perched on the raft as a private toilet highly amusing.  The monkey scene at the end was a rare and moving experience as Aguirre a pathetic solitary figure swore he would start a new civilisation.

To me, this film looks like someone took a time machine, traveled back to the 1500's and filmed Aguirre's crew through the jungle.

            "content": "Aguirre, the Wrath of God, is Herzog's ultimate jungle adventure, continuing on from the trance-like and hypnotic Fata Morgana and Signs of Life (which aren't necessarily jungle films, but do have a similar approach to the strange and the exotic), whilst simultaneously prefiguring the more traditional narratives of Fitzcaralldo and Cobra Verde. It also has certain similarities to Chris Marker's excellent film Sans Soliel, with the combination of mystical realism and otherworldly forces, alongside an almost documentary approach to the art of film-making. Like Marker's film, Herzog takes the viewer on a journey, not only into the Peruvian jungle, but also back in time, to the days of the Spanish conquistadors, and deep into the heart of darkness. He introduces us to a collection of characters that will be our guide throughout the film, but, despite this, we're never really allowed to learn anything about them. To Herzog, their personalities are unimportant... to him, the film is about something deeper; it's about greed, it's about brutality, it's about obsession, and ultimately, it's about the corruption of the human soul.Right from the start we are captivated by the haunting and hypnotic mood that the filmmaker creates; with the film beginning on a close-up-detail of an enormous mountain peak, partially shrouded by mist. The evocative music of Popol Vuh then drifts in as our eyes focus on a small band of adventurers and their guides making their way down the side of the gigantic, monolithic rock... disappearing beyond the horizon, only to reappear on the other side. Here, as Herzog establishes the notion of nature as a symbolic obstacle or uncontrollable force, he also sets up a sense of eventual foreshadowing of that climactic image and the theme of man against nature. To reinforce these notions, Herzog makes his film as episodic as can be, with little explanation into events and little to drive the characters besides the wild-eyed obsession and ferocity of Aguirre himself. As with Fitzcaralldo and Cobra Verde, the film is driven by its central character - as opposed to being driven by plot - which works exceptionally well with Herzog's approach of stylised-documentary-drama, and of course, works even greater when personified by the manic Klaus Kinski. Here, Kinski's task is to instill Aguirre with an animal force and psychotic obsession... to push this band of weary soldiers down the river, with the promise of the ultimate reward in the shape of the city of gold.For me, this is possibly Kinski's greatest performance (the emotional flip-side to his pained and sensitive turn in Herzog's other great film, Woyzeck), as he stalks the tiny raft - which becomes our main location - like a caged tiger, alternating between screaming, ferocious rants and moments of quiet contemplation that will eventually lead to a implied sense of complete self-destruction. Herzog's camera has an intruding intimacy about it that makes it impossible to imagine a film-crew actually standing around capturing this. It feels so real... like nothing has been staged. It also makes the drama all the more interesting, as characters die or break down, whilst Kinski just continues to scowl and grown through furrowed brow and clenched teeth... descending into madness with his eyes completely vacant. As the film moves towards it's inevitable climax, Herzog's direction becomes more and more surreal... like he's capturing some kind of fevered dream, as boundaries between fantasy and reality, truth and fiction, man and nature, all start breaking down. Throughout these closing sequences, Herzog offers up a number of images that define the style of Aguirre... whilst also lingering in our sub-conscious for months on end.These images include a boat resting atop an enormous tree, a decapitated head that continues it's count from one to ten, a woman wandering into the jungle never to be seen again, and the butterflies that flutter and perch on the shoulders of the slave Okello, moments before he is shot through the heart with an arrow. Much of the violence of Aguirre is surreal, capturing that same fever dream ideology and happening at a point when the characters are at their most removed from reality. It also shows Herzog's talent in creating scenes of simplistic beauty from the most unexpected sources... tying in with the whole \"shot-on-the-run\" simplicity of the editing and cinematography, with the camera constantly roving from person to person, finding a composed moment of tranquilly before curiously pushing on. Unlike the work of his contemporaries (Fassbinder, Wenders, etc) Herzog is able to captivate his audience, not simply through narrative, but through the creation of a dense, dreamlike and hypnotic atmosphere and a character of immense, obsessive proportions. Aguirre, along with The Enigma of Kasper Hauser, is probably his ultimate masterpiece, a film that is constantly changing from one extreme to another, drawing you in, then pushing you away, making you want to go back and experience more and more of this landmark adventure.For me, Aguirre, the Wrath of God is a film of monumental proportions... climaxing with a final shot that stands as one of the most breathtaking final images in European cinema, with that downward spiral managing to embody both the lunacy and obsession of the filmmakers and the fate of the ruined Aguirre. It is as much a testament to Kinski's brilliance, as it is to Herzog's, making this film (and the whole of the Herzog/Kinski box-set) an integral purchase.",

            "content": "Review:Werner Herzog's \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" is what \"Waiting for Godot\" would be, if that play were an epic. And what a minimalist epic this film is. The story is simple and evokes a terrifying message: what we seek, we will not find and where we seek shall inevitably lead to our demise. It's a grim forecast but when seen through the eyes of Werner Herzog there is a certain awe that eventually transcends the dread.In the late 16th century, an expedition of Spanish Conquistadors sets out into the wilderness of Peru and Brazil to discover the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. The doomed mission is led by Gonzalo Pizarro. When the army encounters innumerable complications from traversing the jungle, Pizarro decides to send 40 of his men down the Amazon River on raft to further explore for the golden city's whereabouts.This rafting expedition is led by Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra) with Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as second in command. Though he does not say much at first, the malignant stare of Aguirre informs the audience that there is something not right with this man. Perhaps the jungle has pushed him too far or maybe he's purely a megalomaniac, but really, this speculation is irrelevant Part of the effect of \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" is the utter lack of explanation for everything. Herzog does not waste our time by trying to explain away the motivations of Aguirre or the terrors of the Amazon.After some disastrous days on the river, Ursua decides he will turn the mission around and the remaining soldiers will march back to Pizarro. But Aguirre, unable to accept defeat when El Dorado may be at hand, quickly devises a haphazard mutiny and overthrows Ursua. Not sure he has the men's loyalty, Aguirre puts Don Fernando de Guzman in charge. He's a bumbling and gluttonous conquistador, not long for this movie.From this point on the story begins a rapid descent into madness. Life on the raft becomes a mock-imitation of civilized life. As they proceed further down river, lurking natives shoot arrows from the banks, sickness envelopes the crew, and Aguirre keeps insisting on pressing forward.\"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" is maybe two steps away from becoming a farce. There is something utterly absurd about seeing hundreds of men trek through impenetrable wilderness with metal helmets and armor. One of the great symbols in the film is the conquistador cannon, which they bring on the raft. This cannon is heavy and predisposed to rust when exposed to water and yet the conquistadors never once think of abandoning it. When surrounded by the immensity of the jungle the cannon is a last consolation, an absurd reminder of the power of the Spanish army. It allows the doomed soldiers to believe they still wield some power, even in this hostile terrain. But no cannon or horse or slave or man would save this crew.We know Aguirre's expedition is doomed from the start because we know there is no El Dorado. And yet, is this not a grand (albeit bleak) metaphor for human existence? The search for the unknowable and finding only nature's wrath? Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca this film is a \"The Birds\" (1963).Rationalization:Nature needs no explanation for its crimes. In a Herzog film nature is as indifferent as God in a Bergman film; it is omnipresent and silent and consuming. The only ones who dare defy the jungle are the mad crusaders like Aguirre who attempt to rival nature with their brutality. Klaus Kinski deserves praise for his portrayal of Aguirre. There is not a moment of stereotypical Hollywood madness in his performance. He broods instead of rants and only his eyes become portals into the depths of his insanity. I'd go so far as to say his madness, while quite noticeable, is generally understated. And how could it not be when in the face of the Amazon? \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" is a beautiful film that will haunt you a hundred times over before it inspires you to explore the Amazon.www.iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com",

Fittingly, for a film about roaring obsession, swirling madness seems to suffuse every frame, from that celebrated opening shot in which an endless procession of conquistadors and their road crew descend a cloud-kissing Peruvian mountain, to the final, unforgettable image of Kinski ranting but resolute on a collapsing raft teeming with frantic monkeys.",

            "content": "Aguirre: The Wrath Of God is nominally a period piece, focusing on a 16th-century expedition by Spanish conquistadors into the Amazon rainforest, but for a \"historical\" movie, it isn't particularly, er... historical. The director himself, German film legend Werner Herzog, admitted that the story is mostly fabricated, and it isn't really designed to educate us about the real Aguirre, since the historical figures it does feature are mostly used in fictitious ways. Instead, Werner Herzog uses history as his jumping-off point for a surreal, crazed fever dream of a film, portraying the inherent madness of power through the savage lens of the Amazon jungle, resulting in what is easily one of the best films I've ever seen.Its \"plot\" (if it can be called that) focuses on the titular character's coup of the expedition, and Aguirre's failed journey into the Amazon to establish a grand empire, but this really isn't a film driven by story details, but rather, mood; the Amazon serves as a \"set\" far more memorable than any soundstage, with its thick foliage, heavy humidity, and the chirping of various unseen animals and insects creating an atmosphere that is subtly, quietly hostile to the arrogance of the \"civilized\" colonists to think they could ever conquer it.It's an atmosphere that Herzog takes full advantage of, getting up close and personal with the rainforest with his unsteady, handheld camera in a guerrilla-documentary fashion, as arrows and spears, fired by unseen native tribes, continually fly at the expedition at random, and various traps and ambushes serve to steadily dwindle their numbers as their raft wears its way down the Amazon. Some might consider Aguirre's portrayal of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon as mostly hostile, cannibalistic \"savages\" to be rather cliched, or even offensive, but it's obvious to me that this was never meant to be a realistic portrayal of South America, but rather, a cautionary tale of the madness that comes with any kind of lust for power; after all, the European settlers of the film behave just as savagely as the \"savages\" do, if not more so, and its period and setting are ultimately irrelevant except so far as they enhance the film's central themes.It isn't meant to reflect reality at all, but rather, represent Herzog's mad personal vision, and the schizophrenic, stream-of-consciousness pacing serves to further enhance the surreal mood, as the story doesn't unfold with a lot of traditional structure or momentum (a jungle adventure ala Indiana Jones, this is not), but rather, Herzog takes his time in letting everything just play out slowly, as if in a dream, seducing us into a cinematic trance, and creating an example of fragmented storytelling at its best. The film's insanity doesn't wear on you in an over the top way, but a in a slow, gentle manner, as crazy things (talking severed heads for the win) just sort of randomly... happen, and sometimes, nothing happens, like a beautiful, slow-motion, minute-long closeup of river rapids just clashing together, a moment that adds so much more to the film than any traditional plot exposition could've hoped to.The film goes from episode to episode, lurching much like Klaus Kinski's Aguirre himself, an undeniably powerful, memorable central performance. His wild, unkempt blonde mane and deep blue eyes convey so much paranoia and madness, while his performance is still charismatic and human enough at times to make you believe that an entire group of men would willingly (at first) follow such a man to their death. Following Aguirre the film, on the other hand, will not lead you to death, but rather, something much, much better; pure, cinematic greatness.",

Even in the most beautiful and exotic areas, chaos and misfortune reigns supreme. I thought he did a wonderful job of subtly portraying this throughout the film, with the various mishaps to the crew and the worsening condition of their entire journey. His minimalist take on the direction adds mounds of realism to the picture and makes it feel more like a documentary than an actual staged production. I felt there was a very interesting undertone in the treatment of the Indian slaves that is even more poignant today. Herzog showed that someone could be as renowned as a Prince, but once someone else takes over they can just become a lowly slave. The same scenario applies today in terms of immigration. Somebody can be as renowned as a doctor in a third world country, but if they immigrate here the best job they can find is working minimum wage at a Burger King. I felt that the character's themselves felt a bit distant and empty, but I think that is a brilliant commentary on the one-not nature and alienation of society today. A much more subtle way of showing it than something like Crash, which just throws that at you in the first sentence. The commentary could also apply to the mystery and lack of knowledge of people in our government. I think that the spontaneous and illogical decision to make the biggest, strongest man their new leader could also be considered a commentary on the inefficiency and idiotic nature of government. Overall, I found it to be a strong work that has definitely motivated me to see more Herzog.",

Which in my opinion is a very fantastic story / concept. And I see that Werner Herzog, The director of the film, had so many ides and a really great concept. But not enough money for what he would actully need for sush a project. But atleast he tried and it turned out pretty okay, the film is filmed in Peru and Mexico in South America so there's not questuon about it the envoirment is Great. Also the requisites is pretty good but I hate The Bloos it looks really fake, yet I like the canons, the armor and guns, and you get the right feeling for the time period. But its far from perfect, nevertheless it is a budget film from the 70's so what can you expect. The film also was pretty funny with some cool lines, shots and funny things like having a black man for scaring indians.The actors are also pretty perfect of their role of how they look atleast, especielly klaus Kinski for Aguirre.

I have since seen it two more times and have come to consider it one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The immediately recognizable greatness of this movie can be seen in the manic eyes of it's star Klaus Kinski, but the atmosphere of desperation and realism is what, in my opinion, makes this movie great.  The first time I saw it was in the middle of the day with like 3 other people and lots of talking.  If you watch this film I think you should really watch it alone or with someone who is able to appreciate this kind of cinema.  It really creates a great mood and if nothing else the final scene in which Aguirre has gone totally insane and is giving this monolgue about how is going to conquer the spanish main, but is surrounded by his dead men and a horde of chattering monkeys is one of the more memorable endings in film history.  The dvd commentary is actually one of the better commentaries I have heard for a film like this because it actually got the director and someone with him who asks intelligent questions.  The films lead performance, mood, and cinematography (shot all on location in the rainforest) is definetly worth a look, and hopefully this movie will be able to grow on you as it has on me and all the others who find this to be a great film.\nZoopansick",

Its essentially about the lust for power and glory, the madness that is intimately connected with endless ambition and the process of Spanish colonization of the Americas.The film opens with a shoot showing the caravan of Spaniards and their native American slaves in an expedition in the deep South American Andes. It quickly becomes apparent that the expedition is not going well. Soon the mounting problems of this expedition force their leader to turn back. However, an enterprising and ambitious soldier, Aguirre, inspire the other Spaniards to mutiny against their leader and to continue searching for the mythical El Dorado.I enjoyed the movie. It is very \"artsy\" and tends to be a bit pretentious at times and it also requires some patience from the viewer: this is not a modern Hollywood blockbuster, made for the lowest common denominator. However, it is very probable that what the film depicts actually happened many times: a small band of Spaniards declare independence from the Spanish crown and try create a new kingdom in the middle of the newly discovered Americas (spoilers alert) and they all die in the end.Edit: On a second viewing I was able to appreciate more the quality of this film as I understood it better.

It is partly by comparing the two that I come to realize why the shootings led to such vicious enmity between Herzog and Kinski. Kinski used to be (maybe still is) the star of all stars in German cinematography. But even if he is there, in front of the camera, most of the time, his Aguirre remains somewhat tangential to the movie - Kinski does not develop his character, Aguirre is the same obsessive maniac in the beginning as in the end, and the actor might reasonably question why Herzog made him play a role which does not really require great skill or presence. But even so, Aguirre remains the strongest character in the movie - the others, including his daughter, are like phantoms without flesh and weight. Saura's reading was rather different - his story recreated a much more complex Aguirre who moved to the top of the expedition as a result of a series of assassinations which were not started by him. And his end was much more dramatic (even when based on the same original account, the sequence of events in Herzog's and Saura's scripts is significantly different). That is because Saura was interested in the people, in the evolution of characters, and of ideas - his Aguirre proclaimed independence from Spain out of desperation, not out of greed. While Herzog was interested in the destructive power of nature over humans - a theme which he continues to work upon (see his Grizzly Man!). The real focus of his version is the landscape, not the insignificant monkey-like creatures on board of this ludicrous raft (the monkeys which took over the raft in the end were a good allegory for the failed conquistadors). The river, the mountain, the jungle, this is what Herzog wanted to shoot - and he did it great. Whether it would be Kinski or another monkey on board the raft, there would be no difference.

I feel this could be a criticism aimed more at general production and editing procedures for the time though. this film isn't alone in this particular predicament and perhaps symptomatic of the era.

I wanted to be moved, excited and perhaps a little bit frightened... Instead, taking into account the occasional instances of gratuitous violence and half-hearted dialogue, I was nearly bored out of my wits. Madness and mayhem in the jungle- this film had so much potential and yet Herzog completely wastes his subject material, filling most of the runtime with either pointless chatter or shots of trees. Klaus Kinski plays the title role of Aguirre- known as \"The Wrath of God\" or \"El Loco\" (\"The Mad\"- ironic, considering the fact that he played \"Loco\" in 1968's The Great Silence), and is totally wasted. Honestly, he made more of an impact in the few minutes of screentime he shared with the great Lee Van Cleef in For A Few Dollars More than he does in a whole movie- stumbling his way through the scenery and staring at the trees like a demented chameleon, though he's neither maddening nor frightening when he does so.However, perhaps the film's biggest fault is its core story's sheer failure to grip. When I read up about the real Lope de Aguirre, I got quite a shock: leading his men into the jungle on the hunt for El Dorado, Lope went mad and proclaimed himself \"The Wrath of God\" before murdering his own daughter. In fact, the real Aguirre was so evil that he was eventually betrayed and murdered by his own men. Sound's like quite a guy? Herzog's version of events is about as dull as it is possible to get- during the film's climax, Aguirre's company is randomly ambushed whilst going down the river by Indians and filled full of arrows (\u00e0 la Apocalypse Now), with only Kinski left alive to continue to do what he does best in this film: shuffle around the deck, talk babble and quietly stare at the trees, with what could've been a real journey into the mind of a murderous madman like Aguirre de Lope reduced to an underwhelming artist statement.Want to watch a soldier taking a river boat upstream and going mad in the jungle, on a journey that grips, haunts and dazzles the mind? Watch Apocalypse Now instead- you won't be disappointed. I can't say the same about myself and Aguirre, the Wrath of God...",

At first i thought it might be OK, but then when i got into it, it got better and better. Especially the acting, especially klaus kinsinki, who was just amazing in it,and would come to be in a few of herzog's films( kinsinki died in 1992 unfortunately) if he wouldn't of been in it i probably would like it as much. Well heres a quick summary about it: its about a group of pizarro's conquistadors and some slaves, who go on a expedition up the Amazon River but the soldiers and slaves are killed one by one by indians and hunger, and Aquirre leads a revolt against the commander and then the journey becomes a gory unsuccessful one. But if you haven't seen this i strongly recommend you go out and find it and watch it, there are also a couple of other movies that werner herzog made with klaus kinsinki, who were friends in real life(kind of a violent one due to kinsinki's violent rages) but ya you should definitely watch it.",

Slow-paced and not really enjoyable, the film nonetheless is attractive by allowing the characters to slowly sink into hallucinations and misfortunes at variance with their ambitions of power and wealth.

The infamous and apparently, very strange Klaus Kinski plays Aguirre, and given that he himself had certain psychological problems, one can only say he is perfect for the part. Kinski brings a reality and empathy to the part that could not possibly have been done better. The other characters all provide him with ideal support for him to extract as much meaning as possible from this fascinating character.Admittedly I only saw this film out of idle curiosity for the director Werner Herzog but I'm extremely glad I did. The story that Herzog weaves through the Amazonian wilderness begs us to come along with it, and we succumb. I'm not sure if it's true that the majority of this film was improvised, but whether it was or wasn't, it works brilliantly. The actors all seem genuinely scared, angry, relieved, at various points in the movie, and this produces an effect that can't be matched.Aguirre is quite an amazing achievement for all involved and it leaves you pleading for more.

Apropos of his comment that he could have shot Titanic for a fraction of the actual cost, Herzog in most of his films lets nature provide the sets for him. His long holding shots timed to perfection accentuate the beauty and power of those natural settings.The story is derived from famed conquistador Pizzaro's real life disappearance in South America. As history would show Pizzaro and his band of ruthless conquerors rebelled against the King of Spain shortly before his disappearance. In this movie, one of Pizzaro's leading lieutenants Aguirre rebels against him and the Spanish crown.Kinski as Aguirre is strong and controlled. He is quiet at the beginning when he is with Pizzaro's large gang. But when given the opportunity to be second in command of the small party Pizzaro sends downriver to explore whether the main expedition should continue Aguirre rebels, kills his enemies and goes on a massive ego trip whilst his remaining gang and raft drift down river, a place where 'god did not finish his creation'.Herzog times his movie superbly. Kinski's ego descends into insanity at alarming speed. But his rebellion ends in humiliating oblivion. His crew dead or dying from hunger and arrows shot unseen from the surrounding forest, and at the very end with the raft slowed down to a stationary state, monkeys from the trees and jungle invade his boat, running amock. The symbolism is obvious.In a film of natural images, the opening image is the most staggering of all. A long line of conquistadors and their Indian guides winding their way down a sloping path on an Andean mountain, whilst Herzog's camera focuses in on them through the mist, with the ominous music of Popol Vuh warning that this descent into the valley below may not have a happy outcome.A fine film.",

Also there are some comical scenes especially with Don Fernando the Guzman played by Peter Berling, it is specifical humour unique to the Werner Herzog i would say it is cynical but i like it a lot.

At this moment, Klaus Kinski as the malevolent Aguirre is having his Al Pacino moment, that scene every great actor craves in which he gets to deliver an over-the-top monologue to the camera.Watching this movie is like watching my retired father's home movies of his cruise through the Alaskan Inside Passage.  Long lingering shots of water, jungle, water, rocks, water ... on and on and on these moments stretch, broken apart by smatterings of story.  Kinski stumbles about through this film, sauntering and rocking on his back leg like an Aryan John Wayne who just received a cement steroid shot in his right shoulder.  He cannot deliver a single line of dialogue with out scowling, scanning the horizon, and seemingly digging the words from the back of his throat as if they are balls of sand.I groaned through Herzog's `Fitzcarraldo' in college, and I still have nightmares from that experience.  But I read many great things about `Aguirre,' and as it is only 94 minutes in length, I assumed that Herzog could tell his story without all of his pretentious cinematic nuances.  I was wrong.  This film feels as long as `Fitzcarraldo' and `Burden of Dreams' together.I want to think that maybe it's a German thing, that as an American weaned on Hollywood cinema I `just don't get' German cinema.  But I know that if the diaries of Brother Gaspar de Carvajal had been given to an A-List writer in Hollywood, a riveting script would emerge.  As for myself, I have enjoyed many German films dating back to early Expressionist cinema.  Among German contemporaries, Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff's `Die Blechtrommel' was an exceptional example of storytelling.

This is true guerilla film-making; the viewer feels the dirt and the heat and the overall sense of desperation and aimlessness.The tone of the film is further intensified by the actors, most notably Klaus Kinski with his piercing blue eyes and overall subdued fierceness. Of course, it's not exactly a stretch of the imagination to believe his character has gone mad, because Kinski himself was somewhat of a lunatic. Having seen the film \"My Best Friend: Klaus Kinski\", I knew a lot about the tumultuous relationship between Herzog and Kinski going in, and I couldn't help thinking about it throughout the film.While I found \"Aguirre\" to be an interesting experiment and an obviously exhaustive effort on the part of the filmmakers, it did have its flaws.

            "review_title": "''Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski,'' Werner Herzog .",
            "content": "Herzog grew up in a remote mountain village in Bavaria. He didn't see his first film until he was age 12, when a traveling movie company passed through his village with two documentaries-one about Eskimos, the other about Pygmies. After watching Zorro, Tarzan and other films, he became convinced he could do better films. At 14, he started writing screenplays and at 23 he produced his first film.His first film to break through with audiences was the 1972 Aguirre, the Wrath of God, about a mad and power-hungry Spanish conquistador who leads his men through the Peruvian jungle in search of the lost city of El Dorado. The film had its genesis when Herzog was leafing through a children's book in a friend's library. He read with fascination 11 lines about an adventurer named Aguirre who took his men into the jungle and disappeared without a trace.That same night, on the bus with his soccer team, he began writing the screenplay on a little typewriter on his lap. Two and a half days later, he finished it. Such efficiency, according to Herzog, is customary. \"I have never written longer than 10 days,\" he said. \"I only write when the film has already come to me in my mind.\" His shooting style is as economical as his writing. He shot Aguirre, a film of grand scale, on location in five weeks, shooting scenes only once. \"I don't shoot that much when I work on film,\" he explained. \"I shoot what I need on the screen, and I see it clearly in my mind.\" His budgets are as streamlined as the creative process. \"I'm my ownproducer so I've always had to live on low budgets or no budgets,\"he said. He produced Aguirre for an incredibly low $375,000 andclaimed he could have put the $200 million blockbuster, Titanic, onscreen for $40 million. Aguirre, which first brought him public attention, was his first filmwith the notorious Kinski. Their enmity was so profound thatHerzog claimed he once threatened to firebomb Kinski's house.Kinski's autobiography showers page after page of invective againstthe director, which seems merely to amuse Herzog. \"People likeBrando are just kindergarten compared with Kinski,\" he said. \"He istotally mad and unpredictable. It's very hard to domesticate this wildman. I almost shot him it got so bad. There are rumors I directedhim behind the camera with a gun. This is not true. He threatened toleave the set and I explained very calmly that I did have a rifle. Hewould reach the bend of the river, but with eight bullets. You cansee there is something raging in this man. I owe him a lot. We oweeach other a lot. We liked each other, we hated each other and werespected each other. It's not easy to explain our relationship. Itsounds like a paradox. The only thing that counts is what we see onscreen.\" Kinski wasn't the only difficulty Herzog encountered during filming. The crew, living on rafts floating down the Amazon, almost starved to death; after three and a half weeks of shooting, he learned the negatives had disappeared; and he was bitten by the 450 monkeys he brought aboard the sinking raft for the film's powerful final scene. With Kinski as both muse and nemesis, Mr. Herzog was just the artist to harness that fury. Their first film together, in 1972, was ''Aguirre: The Wrath of God,'' in which Kinski played his most astonishing madman. Peering out wild-eyed beneath his explorer's helmet, the actor played an ever more delusional explorer in the midst of the Peruvian jungle, using his hugely expressive features to make the character's deranged hubris unforgettable. For Mr. Herzog's own forays into the heart of darkness, Kinski made the perfect traveling companion. (Their four other films together were ''Woyzeck,'' ''Nosferatu,'' the great, haunting ''Fitzcarraldo'' and a last feature, shot in Africa, ''Cobra Verde.'') In ''Aguirre,'' Herzog says, ''somehow the beast had been domesticated after all, so that his true madness, his true energy was contained within the frame of a screen image.'' In Machu Picchu to shoot ''Aguirre,'' Kinski is seen ignoring the director's suggestions and announcing: ''You have to beg me. Even David Lean did that.'' (The actor turned up in ''Dr. Zhivago.'') ''And Brecht, too.''Here's film critic Pauline Kael on Kinski's acting: \"...wearing a metal helmet that seemed to be soldered to his skull, [he] had so little to do that he kept acting up a grotesque storm. Aguirre's glassy blue eyes didn't blink; they seemed to have popped open and stayed that way. He was like an angry, domineering Bette Davis; he held his mouth like a dowager, pursing his lips and scowling, and he took command of a group of soldiers by the demonic force of his glare. Kinski's Aguirre was a crazed conquistador who always walked at a tilt, and when he stood still he was slanted backward or, occasionally, sideways. He achieved the effect of the angled sets in Caligari just with his own body, which told us how off-balance his mind was.\" Article excerpt",

            "content": "SPOILERSThe film starts out with a brief history lesson. Pizarro's conquistadors march through mountains and jungles of Peru in search of El Dorado. The large group of slaves and troops is unable to find the city and ends up low on supplies, lost and stuck in inhospitable land. Pizarro decides to send a small group away to search for El Dorado, supplies and simply scout the area. The group sets out in rafts downriver. One of the rafts is lost in a whirlpool and the group begins to argue about how to deal with the situation. Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) seizes power through wit and force, deposing de Carvajal (Del Negro). Though Aguirre puts de Guzman (Peter Berling), a Spanish nobleman, in power and attempt to justify his mutiny, the second group itself gets stuck in the thick and foreign jungle. They lose their rafts, are frightened by the fear of cannibals and are constantly threatened by attack from Natives. The group runs low on supplies, starts to bicker amongst themselves and many succumb to disease. One way or another the members of the expedition die until only Aguirre is left. The film ends with the raft slowly drifting downstream as Aguirre rambles to himself and the wilderness. The film, as Dr. Sturdevant (Wright State University) points out, extremely exotic to a West German audience of the 70s. The high mountain tops, lush jungle, wild rivers and Incan faces make this a real adventure movie - more akin to the later Indian Jones. It is this wild setting that is so fascinating. There are long shots of the landscape and faces. The costumes and music help complement the topography; it feels more like a National Geographic documentary. Even with the 40 odd years the camera work amazes the eye. The plot is simple, thus effective. It's based in a real life Lope de Aguirre - a man with a reputation for brutality and insanity. One sees the breakdown of society in microcosm and the darker side of humanity in its lust for gold, God and glory. The madness of Aguirre, ineptitude of de Guzman, and fragility of de Carvajal's wife are shown in the backdrop of murder and looting. This psychological examination couple with the geographical of the terrain help to create a truly stark and unforgettable impact.There are few films that I can actually sit down and watching in their entirety. That alone is an extreme compliment.",

But I would swear he really is going insane in the end.All together, I like the way in which there's no real story in it, but the evolution of of a bunch of people on a suicidal expedition into their deepest self.

            "content": "Aguirre, the Wrath of God is probably the most interesting movie I've watched in recent years. Being loosely based on a historical event, the \"revolt\" of the real world Lope de Aguirre, which ironically, was marginally more successful than the one we see lead by his fictional counterpart. After seizing control of a forward expedition in an effort to find the city of El Dorado and establish his own 'Empire of El Dorado,' with his puppet 'Emperor' Guzm\u00e1n. He leads the expedition deeper into the Amazon, on a path that can only lead to the doom of all those following him. However, a sense of hope for the expedition is maintained through the first half of the movie, with the original leader still being alive, albeit injured and in the custody of those loyal to Aguirre and Guzm\u00e1n. Through this, the movie does a spectacular job of keeping you on the edge of your seat as the expedition descends further and further into madness and disarray.Despite diverging from the true story of Lope de Aguirre, which ended only in his death, rather than of his entire expedition, the movie is very accurate to the time and region it is portraying. I was pleasantly surprised to see the usual trope of every single soldier being armed with a gun and nothing else. In the 1500s, gunpowder had not completely eclipsed the crossbow or even melee weapons. Seeing the expedition armed equally with arquebuses, crossbows, and halberds was an appreciated change of scenery. Additionally, the idea that the area these conquistadors were exploring was uninhabited or even sparsely habited is disregarded for the myth that it was. They encounter native resistance throughout their entire journey, taking significant attrition from the natives as they are sniped with arrows and blowguns from the shores of the Amazon River. They are in hostile territory where they are not wanted, and the movie makes that very clear. So while this story is not entirely accurate to the story of the real Aguirre, the fictional narrative exaggerated from reality still takes itself seriously and gives an accurate depiction of a plausible series of events during the time period.",

            "content": "In 1560, not quite 20 years after the death of Francisco Pizarro, who had conquered Peru for Spain, an elaborately provisioned party of conquistadores set out from Quito to find the land of El Dorado. It was a fearful journey first to cross the Andes but even worse on the other side. Those who didn't starve, drown or die of fever in the Amazon jungles were in constant danger of being killed by Indians.When it became apparent the entire expedition could not go on, a small task force was commissioned to continue down the Amazon for a week. In command were Pedro de Ursua and his aide, Lope de Aguirre, sometimes referred to in history books as Aguirre the Madman or Aguirre the Traitor. They never returned.Exactly what happened afterward is unclear but it seems that Aguirre murdered Ursua, declared the little band's independence from Spain and crowned a man named Fernando de Guzman, the ranking nobleman among them, \"Emperor of El Dorado.\" He eventually murdered Guzman and was himself murdered by his own men when they at last reached South America's northeast coast.This story, one of the more bizarre and bloody footnotes to the history of the Spanish conquests, is the basis for Werner Herzog's absolutely stunning 1972 German film, \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\". The movie was shot by Mr. Herzog (\"The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser,\" \"The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner,\" \"Even Dwarfs Started Small\") on locations of breathtaking beauty (and, I must assume, of horrendous difficulty) in South America, but it's no ordinary, run-of-the-rapids adventure.\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" is simultaneously a historical film (to the extent that it follows events as they are known) and a meditation upon history. Aguirre is truly mad, but as played by Klaus Kinski, whose crooked walk and undiluted evil recall Laurence Olivier's Richard III, he is the essential civilized man, a fellow who, in Mr. Herzog's vision of things, must be lunatic.There's an eerie moment in the middle of the film when the Emperor, sitting in rags under an improvised shade on the makeshift raft that is carrying the party down the Amazon, picks at his fish dinner (the other men are starving) and thinks with satisfaction that his \"empire\" is now six times as large as Spain's. No matter that he too may never eat again, nor that his empire is jungle swamp, the sense of power is so intoxicating that it overwhelms all other considerations.It's as if Mr. Herzog were saying that civilization, our assumption that we have conquered nature or even come to some accommodation with it, is as ridiculous as the Emperor's pleasure.From the film's opening sequence, when we see the conquistadores, their women (including Ursua's wife being carried in an elegant litter) and their Indian porters making their way down an Andean slope, looking like the inhabitants of an ant palace, to the concluding shots of Aguirre on his raft in the company of hundreds of tiny marmosets, Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions.The film is incredibly rich and lush looking. It is tactile. One can feel the colors of the jungle and see the heat. The conquistadores endure terrible trials, whirlpools, Indian attacks, rebellion within their own ranks, yet the mood of the film is almost languid. Ursua's faithful, loving wife, played by a classic beauty named Helene Rojo, throws no tantrums when her husband is executed. She watches and waits, and when the opportunity arises, she walks off to her own death in the jungle as if going to a tea.Contrasting with this peculiar languor is the radiant madness of Aguirre, who hypnotizes his soldiers into following his wildest instructions, who sneers at men who seek riches when power and fame are all that matter, who aspires to be nothing less than the wrath of God and who, at the end, is planning to create a new dynasty by marrying his dead daughter. He's mad but he's a survivor.This is a splendid and haunting work.",

It turned out to be praise. Seeing the movie, it is more than possible to understand Kinski's slight enthusiasm. Perhaps the best of all Herzog movies, it is a tremendous epic about egoism, heroism and delusions of grandeur, totally unveiling its power to allure and its ultimate consequences. Klaus Kinski makes an absolutely incredible performance as the protagonist Aguirrre. This could be one of the finest acting performances in the history of film.Long, slow shots of mountains and rain forest and a haunting soundtrack also contribute to making this one of the most unforgettable movie experiences I've ever had. The mood of the movie can almost be criticised for being *too* hypnotic and trance-inducing. The most obvious flaw (if it is a flaw) is that the narrative is developed too subtly, making it hard to extract the meaning of some scenes.

I was able to finally purchase this gem not too long ago. It brought back all the visions and sounds that remained locked inside of me through the years. The dense jungle and cloud covered mountain peaks combined with the hypnotic sounds of Popul Vuh captivate the mind. Klaus Kinski portrays the main character Aguirre with a maniacal intensity. The way he stares into the camera, at one point, demonstrates this perfectly as he threatens those who might mutiny against him. His single-mindedness in finding wealth and fame override all else. Nothing and no one can stand in his way. Reality becomes blurred and distorted as obsession and delusion consume Aguirre's mind. This is clear towards the conclusion when all around him are either dead or dying and Aguirre fantasizes about the \"purest dynasty\" that he will propagate with his own daughter who, by now, is already dead. All in all, this film is not without it's faults. One glaring example for me was the disembodied head that continues counting. There are others. In the end, however, these sometimes laughable moments, are easily overlooked when contrasted with the rest of the story. Make no mistake about it, \"Aguirre\" is a classic. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "There are many candidates for the top cult film - we all have our favourites. \"Aguirre\" must however, figure high up on most people's lists. The story of a doomed expedition of conquistadors on the rivers and through the hostile jungles of South America, driven by the lure of mythical Eldorado, the film unfolds at a dreamlike pace as a series of arresting images: treks down precipitous Andean mountain paths, a log raft trapped in a whirlpool, refined ladies dressed in velvet carried through the jungle swamps in sedan chairs.In surely his most famous role (for an international audience at least), Kinski holds the whole film together. It's not that he does much really - mostly stomping about kicking his soldiers or glowering balefully at the towering vegetation. He does, though, convey a demonic will and energy most effectively.However, having said that about Kinski, maybe the jungle is the real star of the film. The grandeur and power of nature in the end dwarfs the schemes of man and reduces his plans to utter inconsequence. A film for long attention spans, it's not for everyone - my teenage kids didn't like it, nor did my wife. But if you have an hour and half to spare, and are prepared to let yourself relax into its hypnotic grip, this film will take on a long bewildering trip into the darkness and chaos of untameable nature, and stay with you a long time afterwards.Just a note on the film quality: I've seen it many times over the past 25 years, always as a scratchy, grainy print with washed out colours. Somehow you felt remote from the action as a result.

            "content": "If Werner Herzog had made the decision not to make \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\", the Francis Ford Copolla's \"Apocalypse Now\", the greatest war movie ever produced, will not be with us today. This is the first of many collaborations between director Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinski and probably acted as the feat which rocketed Kinski to world's attention. Shot with a simple 35mm camera, and equipped with low budget, \"Aguirre\" is another proof that a film needs not to pretend to be grandiose, and yet be revered and remembered. Although Herzog proclaimed that the story inspired by a book devoted to Lope De Aguirre (a real-life 'Aguirre') is mostly fabrications, historians confirmed that there are events in it which really did happen during the conquest in the 16th century.The movie begins with groups of Spanish Conquistadors (a.k.a. Spanish conquerors) marching down mountains to search for the city of El Dorado. El Dorado is a mythical city; which had been falsely believed that it was occupied with riches of gold. Blinded by greed, these European colonisers could not deny its existence, and set off for the discovery of the city, but to only realise afterwards that the heinous expedition brings not wealth upon them, but only destruction.This is uncommon, but the element which induces the movie's immersive cinematic experience is its music. Right from the beginning, there is something subtle in its score, which I care not to explore, that brings forward ordinary attentions. Herzog's masterful direction in its visual images just further complemented it.Kinski's Aguirre will largely be remembered as a villain for his betrayal and ruthless leadership. But Aguirre, despite his villainous antics and stuff, actually rebels a side that is arrogant and oppressive, instead of a band of people that are honourable, decent and respectful. We all know that the armed-Spanish, when set foot on those South American lands, actually did colonise them, and that is not too bright morally. I believe that, rather interpreting Aguirre as the bad guy like how movie history depicts, it would be more interesting to observe him as a judgement call for the wrongdoings that possibly had been done by the Spanish occupiers. The closing scene where Aguirre is seen to be the only one alive while everyone is dead, just accentuated him as a metaphorical figure.If Kinski had not played the title character, would this picture be still relevant as it is today? I am doubtful if he was merely being himself or not while playing Aguirre but who cares; his depiction as the insane Spanish 'villain' is perfectly fine. Kinski put up genuine intimidation for a man who is cunning, selfish and cold. No matter how strained the relationship between Kinski and Herzog during the filming phase was, their collaboration for the movie is indeed essential.The portrayal of a man seeking for his own destruction is absolutely spot-on. To be able to conquer the city of El Dorado, and exploit its wealth is a short-cut to success. The Spanish, with all their power and sophistication, would had believed that their goals will be fulfilled with ease, even if there is no solid evidence proving the existence of the mentioned city. It seems to me that the sense of superiority has an insidious impact on them, or us in general. Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" is undeniably a more polished picture, but its roots for inspiration which is Herzog's \"Aguirre\", is a staggering masterpiece of minimalistic and honest cinema.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)",

Aguirre was a Basque Conquistador who went to Peru looking for fame and fortune. There he married an Inca princess and had a daughter, and was also wounded in the battle of Saxahuaman (notice Kinski limps in the movie). There was no Pizarro expedition that separated in the foothills of the Peruvian Andes as the movie portrays. Rather, Aguirre was sent on an expedition along with Ursua (the expedition leader) and others to look for El Dorado. But he knew there was no El Dorado- the expedition was a pretext for the govt. to rid itself of potential trouble makers like Aguirre. So in the Amazon river, Aguirre proclaims his famous \"freedom manifesto\", by which he severed all ties with the Spanish crown and aired complaints about the way the conquistadors were treated by the Spanish Crown. This is considered to be the first declaration of independence in the Americas, almost 250 years before Simon Bolivar, who by the way, was also of Basque origin.Aguirre does not get lost in the amazonian jungle, but finds his way back around to Margarita island, in Venezuela, where the tyrant terrorized the people and committed horrendous deeds. Thereupon, he goes to the city of Barquisimeto where he is finally caught and executed for treason. There are all sorts of popular legends in Venezuela regarding the heinous deeds committed by Aguirre, and the figure of Aguirre is tantamount to the devil, guardajumo, and other demoniacal figures by which mothers would scare their children.",

I don't see how one could rank this among the best films ever made or refer to it as a hauntingly beautiful and deeply intense film (I've heard both). Yes, the film has some amazing shots, such as the opening sequence, the blurry torrential river coming into focus, Kinsky's revolutions about the camera (see My Best Fiend), etc. However, with the exception of Kinsky, the acting is sub-par by today's standards making it a little difficult for the average modern viewer to appreciate. Also, I just felt unsatisfied at the close of the film. I felt as if Aguirre lacked any real 'meat'. You don't feel like the characters are developed and you really don't see Aguirre's ambition slowly regress into insanity as suggested by other reviewers. From the onset it's like, \"OK, this guy (Aguirre) is crazy...\" and by the middle of the film he confirms this. Nothing very 'haunting' there. No spiral into oblivion. So, for someone who is not very aware of cinematography, for someone who doesn't ask themselves \"How'd they get those shots?\", for someone who is turned off by gritty, shaky-cam close-ups, and for someone who doesn't know the history of Herzog and Kinsy, I can see how they'd find this film to be a terrible or even unwatchable piece.

Kinski's performance is purely one dimensional - all he ever does is give us an intense stare, which looks rather ridiculous after 10 minutes already.I don't even think he was acting at all, we are just witnessing a man with contempt and suspicion for the people (actors, cameramen) around him.Physically he doesn't have the weight to be feared by the characters in this movie, he leans constantly, the armor obviously is too heavy for him. But that's a minor issue, what his performance really makes poor is the lack of development in his character as I already mentioned. There's no way you can identify with his character, because he doesn't give you anything other than a mad suspicious look, he isn't human.

            "content": "The movie beautifully opens into the Amazon forests, depicting the natural beauty and man trying to find his way through. It moves on slowly, depicting the changes that come upon every member in search of El Dorado, the lost paradise on earth.The changes on Aguirre and his rise to power within the search party is beautifully depicted, showcasing different shades of human nature trying to adjust the wrath of nature.Aguirre's relationship with his daughter, somehow reminded me of what I had read about Klaus Kinski in his real life. But nonetheless he is shown as someone who has a very soft corner for his own daughter and would do anything to save her.The Indians keep on troubling the party and the boat keeps getting lighter. The end is somehow an injustice to the title, so thats why I summarize it as \"The Wrath is on Aguirre himself\"........",

            "content": "A drunk soccer player reportedly vomited on Herzog's typewriter rendering many of the pages he was working on useless and he couldn't remember what he wrote, so he ended up throwing them out a window. Had he decided to keep those pages in his final draft, (which he apparently spent a whole 2.5 days on since he's that brilliant,) they would have added some much needed improvement to the finished film.I have watched my fair share of art house and had been looking forward to checking out Aguirre for some time, but I call bs on this.I read a review where a guy described this film as \"intense.\" I mean, what kind of life are you living if an intense experience is sitting through this movie?",
