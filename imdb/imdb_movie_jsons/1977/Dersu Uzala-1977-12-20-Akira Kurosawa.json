            "content": "For a variety of reasons (that are well known in the darker period of the director's history at this time), Akira Kurosawa left Japan to make a film in Russia (Siberia to be exact). Instead of an epic action picture, he went to one of his other passions as a storyteller- the drama of pure humanity (like Ikiru and Red Beard, this film follows in that vein). The film runs two hours and twenty minutes, but it is a kind of epic story, that does have that pulse of adventure from his other films. But this time he combines that method of a big, spacious environment in the wild with a deep character study. His craftsmanship as a 'painter' of the frame is top-notch as always (all pretensions aside, he is one of the masters at finding the textures and moods in a scene's look as in its character and action), and the use of locations brings a quality that directors today would brush aside with via special and visual effects. Simply put, it is one of, if not the, ultimate testaments to man vs/with nature, with a character that remains one of the most memorable that Kurosawa's envisioned.To give an idea of who Dersu Uzala is to someone who hasn't seen the film, picture Yoda without the ability to lift objects with his mind and to kick ass with a light-saber, but still contains all of the direct wisdom and strength that make him one with his surroundings (and, as well, uses his own kind of 'force' for knowledge and defense, and for attack as an ultimately final resort). As a lonesome hunter and drifter with a family tragically lost, Dersu comes upon a team of explorers led by Captain Aseniev (Yuri Solomon, not the best performance but sturdy enough to sustain the physical scenes). He goes along with them as a guide of the sights and smells and feelings that the others just can't sense (out of lack of experience). Aseniev and Dersu end up becoming friends as they brace a torrid windstorm over a bare, wintry landscape, as Kurosawa brings out one of his towering sequences (topping anything David Lean could've drummed up for sure).It's always of interest to me to see characters doing things on screen, having to go against the elements that almost dwarf them in the face of nature (i.e. Cast Away's hour and a half second act). Dersu Uzala seems to be of few words and mostly actions, and soon gains respect and admiration after an odd introduction to the team- he shoots with a keener than keen eye, he spots tracks, he sets up protection in the harshest of conditions, and is always a step ahead of the pack. And bringing all this out is actor Maksim Munzuk, who appears here (like Falconetti in Passion of Joan of Arc) in the performance of a lifetime out of an otherwise obscure and small career. Munzuk never brings anything to Dersu that isn't in his character, and he makes at least a quarter of the film's success a reality (the other three-quarters could be attributed to Kurosawa alone). He can be tough, smart, funny (in an off-beat way), and if nothing else, humble. But more than anything, Munzuk makes Dersu seem alive in a way no other actor could've accomplished, and also brings out the better in Solomon's performance.The story itself has a superb appeal most of the way, but it is in it's last act that 'Derzu Uzala' reaches an intensely tragic plane. Dersu does something (which I won't reveal here and has been discussed elsewhere on the message board) that brings great shame to his own self-worth. In this part of the film, Kurosawa brings out what can be said to be some of the saddest moments in any of his work, however not without logic. While it was likely a major dramatic function in the novel, Kurosawa doesn't just throw these last twenty minutes or so to let steam flow out of the picture. I sensed something almost cathartic about these scenes, that rose the qualities of the rest of the story to a higher level, to one of almost spiritual in nature. It's hard to really pin-point to one who has not seen the film (and, indeed, I have seen the film all of one time). But once its over, you may feel you have seen a work far more rewarding than imaginable- even in awe.",

            "review_title": "A great film from one of the all-time masters",
            "content": "This 1975 joint Japanese-Russian film is a celebration of simple virtues, friendship, loyalty, love, and respect for nature. Based on the journals of the Tsarist explorer and surveyor, Captain Vladimir Arseniev, it is the story of the relationship between Captain Arseniev and an Asiatic hunter of the Goldi tribe named Dersu Uzala. With a love and understanding of the forest that is extraordinary, Dersu guides the Captain through several deadly encounters. He saves the Captain's life by building a shelter out of reeds during a ferocious wind storm. Maksim's performance as Dersu, the ancient woodsman, is very \"Yoda-like\": wonderous, dignified, and very natural. The friendship between the two main characters grows over many years and several expeditions in the wild. Their relationship is beautifully developed and moves to an inevitable climax when Dersu and the Captain move back to the Captain's home in the city.There is in this film a sense of the beauty, tranquility, and timelessness of nature. It takes place at a time in the early part of the last century when people had closer ties with nature and felt a kinship with animals, plants, and the elements. Dersu endearingly refers to all elements of nature including the river, the wind, the trees, and the animals as \"men\". As the English writer, Hugh Trevor-Roper said of Shakespeare so it is true of Dersu, \"He sees mankind almost as part of nature, sometimes basking in a delightful, smiling Nature; sometimes caught up in a fierce, cruel, inexorable, insatiable Nature\".I was totally absorbed in this film and in its regard for the essential goodness of man and the beauty of the natural world. Dersu Uzala is a great film from one of the all-time masters.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa was a masterful director and powerful storyteller, Dersu has always been my favourite of his films. It was also the first I saw - on Christmas Day afternoon 1978 on UK BBC2 - would that they were as adventurous nowadays! Since then of course I've seen all of his films from Stray Dog on, Rashomon and Ran being especial favourites, but I keep on coming back to watch this one, ostensibly the simplest tale Kurosawa ever filmed.The understanding and bonding that develops between the two men Arseniev and Dersu is wonderful to see, and over two hours holds your attention with expertly observed minutiae of character and scenic interplay. The last ten minutes cover a lot of ground (no pun intended) but it's all so logical and sad that I always need to see the end credits to recover.So many marvellous scenes: the tiger in the forest in the morning; the phlegmatic reclusive old Chinaman; the raft; wispy blue shaded smoke from night-fires; the conclusion of course; the view of those two great men, the Moon and the Sun in the same shot. Not everyone would like Dersu, their most likely comments being \"boring\" - but how wrong they are they'll never know!A film not fit to lick Dersu Uzala's metaphorical boots (or even Plan 9 from Outer Space's for that matter), Blazing Saddles was filmed the same year in America and a generation on still gets more praise than this poetic masterpiece!",

            "content": "In 1902, a Russian army expedition is assigned to explore Siberia under the command of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin). He befriends the Goldi (Nanai) hunter Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) and invites him to guide the explorers through the stark forest up to Khanka Lake. Along their journey, Arseniev discovers that Dersu Uzala is a man with a beautiful soul and they become close friends. When his assignment ends, Dersu Uzala says goodbye to Arseniev. In 1907, Captain Arseniev is assigned for another expedition to the Ussuri River; when he meets Dersu Uzala in the forest, the lonely hunter joins his team and guides the group. However, he is older and has problems with his vision and Captain Arseniev invites Dersu Uzala to live with his family in Khabarovsk City. But the old man does not adapt to the urban lifestyle and decides to return to the forest. In 1910, Captain Arseniev is called to Korfovska\u00efa to identify the body of a man that has his calling card and might be Dersu Uzala.\"Derzu Uzala\" is a simple and unforgettable tale of friendship between a Russian Captain and a lonely hunter with a beautiful soul. This wonderful movie has one of the most beautiful cinematographies I have ever seen and the camera work is impressive, with awesome angle and locations that seems to be of pictures in movement. I had watched most of Akira Kurosawa movies and I do not know how I could forget to see this magnificent must-see movie of his amazing cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Dersu Uzala\"",

            "review_title": "A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Simplicity can sometimes be painful as well as majestic",
            "content": "Dersu Uzala is not just the quintessence of pristine cinema or a landmark in art cinema, but is also a living proof that brilliance can be achieved with absolute simplicity. Storytelling is undoubtedly one of the most potent tools known to man: from the Illiad and Odyssey of Homer to the tales of Jataka, to the 1001 nights of Arabia, to the tales of Panchatantra, to the plays of Shakespeare, man has always found ways to amuse himself by spinning the yarn of his imagination. These tales, though picturesque, fantastic and resplendent, mostly overlooked the potency of austerity vis-\u00e0-vis grandeur as an element of revelation powerful enough to transcend the effects of all other affects know to man. Only a handful of storytellers like Akira Kurosawa and Satyajit Ray have shown the grit and perspicacity to use simplicity as the weapon to incite and hence portray the deepest of the human emotions on the celluloid. Kurosawa demonstrated the might of simplicity as an element that can pack a punch for the first time in Ikiru and followed it up with an unending list of pristine cinematic masterpieces including Seven Samurai. But, even Kurosawa's greatest critic would not find it hard to concede that cinema does not get any purer than Dersu Uzala. Dersu Uzala is a poignant tale of human bonding of trust, friendship and adoration between two contrasting individuals: a nomadic hunter and an army explorer. Captain Arseniev and his troops are on a topographic expedition and while camping during a night, they come across Dersu, who happens to be an aboriginal (Goldi) tribesman. Being fully aware of the handicap of being in a remote and tricky territory and of the indispensability of having an indigene in the ranks, Arseniev asks Dersu to be their guide. Dersu being humbled by Arseniev's courtesy obliges his offer almost immediately. We soon witness a great sense of camaraderie developing between the two of them as Dersu rises in status from being a comrade to a stalwart and a friend in the eyes of the captain. The long years of experience had equipped Dersu with a great sense of intuition and psychic-like abilities to anticipate change and danger. Dersu uses his skills to good effect as he maneuvers captain and his troops through the harsh Siberian terrain, sheltering and guarding them from the cruelties and wilderness of the Tundra. Behind the fa\u00e7ade of a rugged hunter, we see a man of profound intellect and deep compassion in Dersu which is most conspicuous in his respect for the old Chinese and his selflessness in rescuing Captain Arseniev and one of his men. After the expedition is over, Arseniev embraces Dersu and bids him farewell as Dersu returns to the wilderness. Few years later, when Arseniev returns to Siberia on another expedition, he once again encounters Dersu, who again proves to be handy, only this time round he appears to be aging really fast as time, which can be a great healer as well as a great leveler, had begun to take a toll on the Goldi. His eyesight deteriorates under the superstitious effect of a self-imposed curse after having killed a Siberian tiger, which the Goldis worship, in an act of self-defence. Arseniev, in his pitied adoration for Dersu, takes him to the city to live with his family. Arseniev's son gets greatly attached to Dersu and his story-telling abilities, but Dersu finds it difficult to adapt to the relatively restricted and significantly tamed urban life and soon realizes that his life has been reduced to that of a captive. He implores the captain to let him return to the wilderness of the woods. With great reluctance, Arseniev grants him the permission to leave, but not before presenting his savior with a brand new rifle as a parting gift and a souvenir. Few months later, Arseniev receives a letter informing him that a dead body of a Goldi has been found with no identification on it barring Arseniev's visiting card. As Arseniev pays a visit to the place of burial, he identifies the dead Goldi to be none other than Dersu Uzala. The investigating officer speculates the Goldi's brand new rifle might have lured someone into killing him.Dersu Uzala is not just a movie, but is an experience of a lifetime. Dersu Uzala is the only movie that Akira Kurosawa shot in a language other than Japanese and he proved it once and for all that cinema at its most pristine, knows no bounds or barriers. Kurosawa uses his auteurist mastery to bring the memoirs of Russian explorer, Vladimir Arsenyev to life as he inexplicably metamorphoses cinema to new levels of poignancy and pristineness. The cinematography is breathtakingly picturesque and it evokes a sense of melancholy that makes the majestic Siberian wilderness appear hypnotic and at times, surreal. The panoramic shot of Dersu and Arseniev looking at the horizon caparisoned with the juxtaposition of the setting sun and the rising moon is also indicative of their respective lives: Dersu is long past his prime and there is no hope for revival, but Arsieniev's is still in his prime and has a promising career ahead. Dersu Uzala is strongly suggestive of the sole consistency in human life: change. It also demonstrates the might of nature as an unforgiving force, strong enough to humble even the most savage of the creatures. Dersu Uzala can also be termed as an allegorical account of the environmental imbalance that unrestrained human intervention is causing. Dersu Uzala, besides being one of Kurosawa's greatest masterpieces is one of those rare cinematic gems which can be relished again and again, each time with a completely different perspective. It's a must watch for everyone who loves and understands cinema. 10/10For more on cinema visit: http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

Once upon a time a magnificent director and film crew have put a beautiful story on the screen with such perfection, that in our days we look back and we wonder: why movies like this are not being made anymore??It doesn't matter if you like any other Kurosawa's works or any other 'Russian' films, because this one would touch you so much that you would go back and looked for similar films\u0085 I wish I could see this film in all his beauty: on a big screen, in the original format (70 mm), as I felt that I missed a lot of details from the TV format.There are directors and there is Kurosawa, there are dramas and there are Russian stories, so when you put both of them together, what do you get?

After his recovery, he got over his depressive state and directed the Japanese/Russian co-production, Dersu Uzala.Set in the forests of Siberia in the 19th century, Dersu Uzala is one of the most important films about friendship ever made. It tells the story of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomine) as he leads an expedition through the woods. While his group is camping one night, a small mountain man named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk) comes across the men and agrees to act as their guide. The friendship between Dersu and Vladimir grows over the years and Vladimir urges Dersu to return to the city with him but the latter always refuses. Finally Dersu agrees to go, but finds that it is a very difficult adjustment to make.This was the first Kurosawa film that I ever saw and it amazed me in so many ways. The beautiful landscapes, the well-developed characters, and most importantly, the great friendship between Dersu and Vladimir make this one of my favorite films.",

            "content": "This is one of my definite favorites.It tells a story of a man who is one with the wilderness and nature and cant live any other way.Dersu Uzala is an old Goldi(siberian asiatic minority) hunter who thinks he has been cursed after he kills a tiger.To him,every being,every part of the nature is equally worth as humans.The film gives us accounts of one Russian captain's friendship with Dersu.They are together through thick and thin and Dersu even rescues him from a blizzard when they are stuck on a frozen lake.Dersu has all the natural senses and therefore knows when he is in danger.He knows everything by looking and observing the landscape around him.So when he kills the tiger,its like a spell has been cast on him.Or is it just his imagination?His people believe in a ghost that rules the taiga,Kanga.He thinks Kanga will punish him in some way.Soon his fears start to get real.He cant kill his prey for food that he needs for living because his eyesight dramatically worsens.One frightening night(my favorite scene) it gets too much for him,listening to the howling wind in the dark,waiting for Kanga to send a tiger to kill him.And captain Arseniev,seeing the horror that struck him,offers him to come with him to his hometown.It happens so.Throughout the film,you cant help but wonder what will happen to Dersu.Not only because in the beginning Arseniev searches for his grave,in retrospection,but also because he is one lonely,sad man who lives only by hunting.There is no place for him but the taiga.And when the tragedy happens,its hard not to feel remorse and pity the old Dersu.His world has come crashing down.The end specially is painful and shows that there is no mercy in this world for a man who falls from grace in his own homeground.In the end,this film has outstanding photography,outstanding music,outstanding cast,beautiful scenery and do i need to say anything about the director? A  timeless work that can never be surpassed.",

It tells of the friendship between a nomadic Siberian native and a Russian army explorer, and how the former is able to help the latter and his team to negotiate the many obstacles presented by the Siberian wilderness. We see how traditional survival methods and intrinsic common sense can help the more urbanised army men to cope with the extremes of climate and geography. Eventually the nomad is persuaded to join the general on his trip back to a town. His ignorance of urban life is apparent, but interesting nevertheless, as we do not imagine such people nor meet them in everyday life today. Kurosawa is on top form here, letting the camera take in the vastness of Siberia, and still allowing the viewers to observe the characters closely. The story is interesting too, with a sadly ironic ending (won't say any more!). I think everybody should watch this film, because everybody will have something to learn from it.",

I have Ran, Throne of blood, Seven Samarai, Roshomon, Dreams, Hidden Fortress, Jojimbo, Snajuro, Red Beard, and even \"Kurosawa\" the documentary. I guess you can say that I like his work. The \"Kurosawa\" documentary narrated by Sam Shepard and produced by thirteen / WNET I recommend for anyone at all interested in Kurosawa's films as it will really wet your appetite.Of all of his films, Dersu Uzala is my favorite. It is also one of my favorite films by anybody. It was done shortly after Akira had went through a very dark time in his life and had attempted suicide. It was his first film afterwards and the content of the film appears to reflect more than a little of his mindset at the time. Dersu Uazla is both a feel good film and also a sad film. It touches the way that people as they grow older have a more and more difficult time adapting to life as it changes and has its affect on them. The end of the film can certainly show light on the inhumanity that appears to be growing more prevalent in our society. But, I think what you remember from the film is the love between two individuals, and that is what feels good.Many of Kurosawa's films have a great deal of spectacle, and he is perhaps known best for his Samarai films. There is none of that in this movie. Dersu Uzala is a statement by Akira of life. Akira was fighting to keep making films and was not having an easy time of it. If Akira Kurosawa could not make films, he could not feel that he was living. As a result, he attempted suicide. He survived to make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today. Dersu Uzala may be the most important of his films and the one that shows the great director's true personality. Just perhaps, it shows more about humanity than any of his other films. Again, it is my favorite.",

I would say that you have not lived until you have seen what Kurosawa can do filming nature in its raw splendor and magnificence. The scenes in this film like the wind rushing through the tall reeds, or the mist draping the forested hills, are images of haunting beauty.Kurosawa, one of the greatest film directors of the 20th century, made his final masterpiece with film. The characters are well drawn, the sub-text of the story (the clash of civilization vs. nature) is nuanced, but most of all it is the wild beauty of nature which is the focus of this film.

He knows its ways and its moods. The Russians scoff at his ways and his 'primitive' belief system, but eventually come to rely on him, and even love him. It is a beautiful story that takes place in an world that very few of us in the West have had a chance to see. I thought the fact that the film was set in the pre-revolutionary period gave it a peculiar sort of charm - Russia before the Great War and the Russian Revolution was innocent and even naive, the same way the Russian soldiers were innocent of the wonders and the dangers of the Taiga. One of the things I loved most about this film was the cinematography - there are long, lingering shots of the landscape, the endless steppe, the forest, the rivers, the mountains. We believe ourselves to be powerful because we have been moderately successful in our attempts to harness nature for our own uses, but the film shows us that we are deluding ourselves, that nature cannot be controlled or resisted, and the truly powerful are those, like Dersu, who co-exist in harmony with nature and learn what the wilderness teaches.",

The landscape is filled with the change of the seasons of great autumn colours, lakes that mirror great reflections, smoke over fire in a blue hue, to winter desolate landscapes and sheering sun that sets on the fateful band of men who dare to pass through the dangerous terrain.Throw in a great bond of characters and a lesson about a time when humanity was more in touch with nature instead of trying to dominate it, a classic Kurosawa ending, and you have cinematic gold.  A film not to be missed on the big screen.Rating 9 out of 10",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Kurosawa's genius was in envisioning a story in visual terms, then translating that through masterful framing, and direction of actors. Along the way, he became an absolute master of editing -- editing each day's shoot that night. And he invented a vocabulary of multiplanar storytelling with often three planes of action flattened by his telephoto lens.Then, success crept in, and his studio forced him to make more and more samurai pictures with plots not conceived in his mind. These are still wonderfully photographed, but you can see that the narrative itself wasn't fertilized in his visual imagination. That integration of visual narrative and the various production skills was broken, most clearly with `Red Beard,' and the realization led to collapse, a suicide attempt, and a long, long crawl back to `Ran,' possibly the most narratively integrated film in existence.Along the way, he went through a new apprenticeship and this film is one of the tests he endured. It has one of the Kurosawa master touches: it has an abstract, intelligent, sometimes beautiful camera. But it lacks nearly all of the other elements that add to the hypnotizing mastery of his earlier, integrated efforts:--he had no control over the story, which is quite second-rate and ordinarily conceived (meaning it is literary like Tolstoy and not visual like Tarkovsky)--he could not edit at night because of the cumbersomeness of the 70mm process and the insistence on using remote, Soviet processing labs--he had to work in a language that is not only different, it is profoundly so: Japanese phrases have a staccato rhythm that builds with an emphasis on the end. This is something Kurosawa uses to project to the next scene, or cut within the scene. Russian is a matter of lingual brushes that peak in midphrase and tail off. Each phrase has its own arc, its own closure that one cannot use to sew continuity between utterances. (There is the whole matter of noh gestures as well, but the structure of phrase is more basic and leverageable.) --he was forced to live in an `open' environment.This last is the primary test of this film (which incidentally bears fruit in `Ran'). Hitherto, all of his visual compositions were a matter of manipulating physical constraints to `contain' the frame. He would use buildings to frame village scenes and valley tree and rock elements to frame wilderness (the best of which are `Hidden Fortress'). `High and Low' is an exercise in inside/outside constraints, but always constraints. Here he is faced with an openness, where the openness is the unescapable soul of the environment. How to frame and focus when all his framing and compositional tools are unavailable? You shoot from the inside out, rather than the outside in as is traditional in all Japanese art.Lots of this film is unsure experiments in managing this new visual cosmology. The running along the bank of the rapids and the waking up in the emergency grass yurt were irresistably with the old eye for instance. But the lost wandering on the lake bed is an example of him struggling for a coherent frame. There is not a tree, nothing at all. So see how he uses nothing as a constraint, and he shifts that nothing of the open air to the surrounding grass sometimes when they frantically cut it. Framing with open space. See how he plays with this space constraining the fabric constraining the men in the opening of `Ran.'Its a painful journey, this film, not a joy, often tearful for us as we participate.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

            "content": "If you're used to the propulsive, kinetic Kurosawa films like \"Seven Samurai\" or \"Throne of Blood,\" be warned that \"Dersu Uzala\" is very quiet and slow in comparison. But it's a film that rewards patience.It's a very simple film in many ways. It's about the bond that forms between a group of Soviet explorers and the Japanese tracker who helps them wend their way through the wilds of Siberia. The Soviets are pretty glib about the natural world they're traipsing through, while Dersu brings a Buddhist philosophy to his interaction with nature. It's a film that has a renewed relevancy in these days of climate catastrophe.I very much enjoyed the visual poetry of this film, filled with a reverence for the natural world. A scene set during a deadly windstorm in which Dersu and his Soviet friend must make a shelter out of prairie grass if they are to survive is one of the film's most memorable and weirdly beautiful. On the other hand, I remained ever so slightly distant from the film because of Kurosawa's decision to film almost every scene in long shot. The men are always given less importance because of how far away they are from the camera and by extension us, the audience. I'm guessing this was intentional so as to show their place in the natural world, but it does have the result of making it that much harder to become involved in their story. This is a minor quibble though, and mostly this is an exceptional film.\"Dersu Uzala\" won the 1975 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Ironically, the only film to ever bring Kurosawa a competitive Oscar was won by the USSR.Grade: A",

            "content": "How fantastic is it that Kurosawa was a fan of Russian literature, and picked this obscure memoir to make a film out of when the Soviet production company Mosfilm approached him during a very difficult period in his life. Somehow it seems appropriate, being so quiet and contemplative, and like a return to truth or one's original self. The story is fairly simple, relating the real-life adventures of an exploration into the rugged region around the Ussuri river basin when the group's captain (Vladimir Arsenyev, played by Yury Solomin) befriends a mountain man (Dersu Uzala, played by Maxim Munzuk).Early on we see that Dersu identifies everything around him as a person - the sun, moon, wind, water, a tiger, etc. It seems childlike, but it's actually rather profound - he sees a unity to everything, and that man is not separate from his environment. He lives as one with nature, respects its power, doesn't waste, and helps others when he can. As the captain says, \"He had a beautiful soul. He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know, and probably wouldn't ever see.\" He also recognizes subtle signs in things like tracks or weather conditions that others can't see. The scene where he ingeniously builds a makeshift shelter out of tall grasses on the taiga when it gets late and the wind starts howling is excellent. I don't know whether this character or movie helped shaped George Lucas's vision of Yoda, but there are certainly similarities.The pace of the film is on the slow side, and that combined with minimal action may turn some viewers off, but I found that it went well with Dersu's spirit and the environment they were in. \"Man is very small before the face of nature,\" the film says, as Kurosawa gives us beautiful footage of wide open spaces, ice floes, and forests. Let the simplicity wash over you and cleanse you, like Dersu undoubtedly did with Arsenyev's soul. It's not Kurosawa's very best, but this is a good one, and it got the 65-year-old director back on track to make more films at the end of his career.",

I would like to report that its a great film but its not. I enjoyed it but to me the story was lacking, I wanted to know more. I also had problems with the second half of the film which seemed to be straining to go into a man made direction instead of one that flowed naturally.The first half flows. I was just going to take a peak at the film only to find that 45 minutes had passed as if in a blink of an eye. The second half of the film is less natural, it moves in fits toward a conclusion we know from the outset of the film, but which is arrived at via a journey that doesn't seem natural. (the events are fine, its the foreshadowing and thrust to the end that doesn't work.) Technically this is a beautiful film... The march across the ice under a red setting sun is now one of my favorite images..Don't get me wrong, I like the movie but I don't love it.If you get a chance to see it please do so its a wonderful film, that simply disappointed me in the second half.",

Storyline-aside, it is another Kurosawa's awesome visual spectacle, a tremendous field shooting endeavor, epitomizes by the sun-moon co-existence with solemn placidness, furthermore, it is a hymn to mother nature, Dersu personifies as the harmonious co-habitant of the mighty wilderness, a sublime soul with well-versed survival skills, on the contrary to my recent watched documentary TOUCHING THE VOID (2003, 8/10), DERSU UZALA owns a purer and more admirable prospect, instead of conquering the insurmountable to chase a spur of glory and invincibility, it is far more intrepid and unpretentious to be a part of it with reverence and be respectful to its law and act, in addition to its indefatigable undertone against industrialized modernism (it is the brand-new rifle, a token of friendship, actually wreaks the somber demise of Dersu). Strictly speaking, there is merely two characters in the film, Dersu (Munzuk) and the Russian Captain (Solomin), a bond is tenably formed through their expedition in the wild, from lush jungle to walking-on-the-thin-ice frozen river, the life-saving bravado during a squalling night when they lost their track on a snow land or a torrent peril, Kurosawa molds a great range of topography with taut excitement where it is required. The character study of Dersu also is been executed through the observation and the interaction from Captain (viewers' proxy), who is enthralled by Dersu's simple yet ethereal nature, a rare bird may or may not be extinct now. The dual-acting from Munzuk and Solomin is the fruit of naturalistic emancipation and unassuming engagement. Also a memorable presence is Isaak Shvarts's accompanying score segues from lithe to menacing, eerie to sonorous, with Russian folklore and shanty as well.Being a Chinese, I cannot avoid mentioning the sensitive timing (after China and Japan's rapprochement in 1972 and China and Soviet Union's dispute in 1969) of the film-making, which prompted an accusation from Chinese government concerns a so-called political libel on Chinese people, mainly by vilifying Hunhutsi (which literally means red beard in Mandarin) as the villain and the nature-balance defier. But honestly, this episode is largely overstated since there is no direct confrontation at all in the film, at least for my compatriots, don't let this smokescreen blinds your eyes, DERSU UZALA is a spirited ethnological oeuvre could inspire whoever has a chance to watch it, preferably on a big screen or at least a BluRay edition.",

The cinematography is often breathtaking.In two parts, the two and three quarter hour film, introduces us to an almost Siberian \"Indian\", the sort we might have seen in westerns from the '50s. Dersu Uzala is a simple trapper in his 70's, living from hand to mouth in the wastelands of Siberia. Lush in summer, bleak and raw (and arctic) in winter he relies totally on his instinct and experience. He has also escaped from a previous 'life'. In the 19th century, a group of Russian army surveyors are mapping the area and become out of their depth in the relative wilderness. They stumble upon Dersu and they soon form an unbreakable bond and through a series of survival adventures and near death skirmishes with the inclement weather and nature itself the film moves with dignity and statesmanship. What will happen to the ageing Dersu? Can this wild man ever be tamed? These are all the questions that this Oscar winning fable addresses - and more. Kurosawa's own life mirrored Dersu's alienation and for those of more used to the director's ruggedly brilliant black & white masterpieces made thirty odd years prior, will find this refreshing - and moving. This is one film that can be enjoyed by all. Take it in one, or two sittings and let the warmth, frailty - and harshness - of one man and his surroundings wash over you.",

However, his genius stands apart from any particular genre, and this film is a stunning case in point.Faced with such unpromising material as a story about the friendship between a Russian army officer and an aging hunter, set in Siberia in the early 1900's, most film-makers would run screaming for cover. Kurosawa revels in the story, and creates a true cinematic masterpiece.While the heart of the film is the human relationship between the \"Capitan\" and Dersu, the main star of the film is the Siberian wilderness itself. Rarely can such loving care have been lavished on ensuring that the natural beauty of a location comes through onto the celluloid. Some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed: the group round the campfire with the river in the background and the wind whipping up; the sequence where the captain and Dersu have to cut reeds to make a shelter as night falls and a storm approaches; the night-time scene (I kid you not!) of the group dragging a sledge across an icy waste.The simple story of exploration, man versus nature, and the evolution of a true friendship is both thought-provoking and deeply touching. The tiny Maksim Munzuk is superb as the title character and Yuri Solomin is a study of restraint in the role of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (upon whose actual journals the story is based).This is one of those rare films that you can watch twice back-to-back, or at any time to restore your belief that, in addition to being a means of mass entertainment, movies really can be an art form as well.",

It's not that it's a bad film (it isn't), but it's because the style is so unlike the rest of his work and the film is amazingly slow. The casual viewer might easily give up early on, as it is a difficult film to love. But, if you are able to get past this, it's a very rewarding film.This film is set in remote areas of the far Eastern portion of Russia about a decade before the Revolution. A group of soldiers have been sent there to explore and document the region and it's clear that they are a bit out of their element in the bleak steppes. Fortunately for the men, they meet up with a nomad named 'Dersu Uzala'--a guy who has wandered this region his entire life. I say fortunate because Uzala has a lot of experience and wisdom. His know-how is able to save the men and aid their journey repeatedly. The contrast between the man and the rest of the group is striking--and not just for the physical differences between them but because of Uzala's unusual animistic beliefs. And, when Uzala leaves to go his own way, the men are sad to see him go and are filled with admiration for this odd but likable man. Fortunately, he does return later and once again, his wisdom saves the men on repeated occasions.Later, the Captain from the expedition brings Uzala home with him. However, Uzala cannot cope with the city--it is just too foreign. It's obvious he's miserable and wants to return to the East. Uzala leaves and soon he's found dead--and the film ends on a very sad note.The film definitely has scope and you can't help but admire Kurosawa and his Russian-Japanese crew. They obviously spent a lot of time on this movie and braved many tough days in the snow and rain. In many ways, it's reminiscent of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that explored much of the US in the very early 19th century. Like the Russians, Lewis and Clark also found a native who assisted them...much like Uzala.One final note. This film is based on a book written by a member of this actual team of explorers. Yes, he was a real trapper and the story was also filmed in 1961.",

The film is a powerful piece that looks at the difference between those who live on the land, and those who have grown up in more \"civilized\" society that are merely exploring the wilderness. It's hard not to love the character of Dersu Uzala, because he is so smart and loaded with wisdom from a lifetime of living in these conditions. I thought Maksim Munzuk was wonderful at portraying this charming fellow, and showing his never-ending supply of energy. Yuriy Solomin was also great as the Russian officer who forms a bond with Dersu, and I loved watching the progression of their relationship.There were certainly moments of this film where it felt like the story was dragging a little, but most of the time I was fully invested because I cared about these characters. The final act was hard to watch because I could see what was coming, and I knew it wasn't good news. I had real tears by the end of the movie, and that is always a sign that a movie has impacted me on a more profound emotional level. I've seen other films that emulate this same story, and in general it's not typically the type of drama that connects with me in that way, but I think the titular character had garnered so much goodwill that I didn't care if it felt like something I've seen before.

It is my belief that the story of Dersu had to end as it did. The alternative: the broken down old Chinaman at the beginning of the story. How far do you think he got walking out of Siberia in the winter? I belive the Chinaman knew exactly what was going to happen. And, as so often in the character of Dersu Uzala you find that he thought of others instead of himself. I believe that the Chinaman surrendered his home to otheres because he knew his time was at an end, anyway. He could no longer support himself in the woods.That character trait is what made Dersu so appealing to us and to his \"Captain.\" Dursu was completely in tune with his humanity even though most people would look at him in Russian society as a barbarian. He always knew what to do and what was best in the woods. Which is actually a great deal like what the rest of the world really is, and what is best for the whole world. However, modern society, as we all know, will not embrace Dersu's beliefs. We will not give even though we have no use for the item, Dersu did. And, Dersu gave often when he could have used the item, remember the leaving of food in the shelter for others who might be in need.SLIGHT SPOILER: The death of Dersu Usala was somehow correct. It is well that it happened as soon as it did as he went to converse with the Chinaman. Dersu didn't have to suffer. Dersu could no longer survive in the woods. Modern society had no place for him as he could not support its behavior. Dersu was honest about life, about himself, and saw things absolutely clearly. It is sorta sad that a gift caused his demise but as I said above, he possibly gave him a more humane death that the slow starvation he was facing.  The only real sadness is that his grave was lost to someone who truly loved him.  It is an absolutely beautiful story that is true to its characters. It is really sad that Hollywood cannot bring out stories about the goodness in humanity rather than how to kill each other with as much flashy aplomb as possible.

But sometimes the best films involve the simple things in life, and this was one of those pictures. Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) is the name of a wandering Russian hermit who lives in the mountains of Siberia, supporting himself by hunting with little or no money in his pocket. He favors this solitary lifestyle, and somewhat uncharacteristically, agrees to become a guide for a Russian survey team headed by Captain Arsenev (Yuriy Solomin). He quickly finds favor with the small survey team during the the summer of 1902. Little by little, we learn that his wife and two children were killed by smallpox, and his despondency drove him to burn his meager home down and take to the wilderness to contemplate his existence. As a master of all things involving nature, he constantly astounds his travel companions with observations all but invisible to the casual eye, and more than once his insight saves the men from peril. In Part One of the story, Dersu eventually takes his leave of the Captain to go his own way, as the survey team heads back to their respective homes.Part Two finds Captain Arsenev back in the Ussuri region of Siberia a few years later, where he meets up again with his old friend and guide, and they resume their woodland trekking and surveying together. However the aged hunter is gradually losing his eyesight and can no longer rely on being the marksman with a rife that he used to be. Wounding a tiger, Dersu laments the idea that the animal will suffer until it dies, and fears that the woodland spirit Kongnga will send another tiger to kill him in retaliation. The Captain, by now a loyal and trusted friend, invites Dersu to come back to his home town and live with him and his family. For a short time this arrangement works, however the ways of civilized society restrict Dersu to such a degree that he must return to his mountains in order to live and breathe.The poignancy of the story reaches a crescendo when Captain Arsenev is informed of Dersu's passing, He arrives as his long time friend is about to be buried in the cold, Russian wilderness where he was found. The strength of the film lies in the friendship that developed between these two men of such diverse backgrounds, neither of which could survive exclusively in the world of the other. For fans of director Akira Kurosawa, this is not typical of one of his better known Japanese movies, and the only one he filmed outside of his home country. The languid pace will not appeal to all viewers, and I think it might fare better with older film fans like myself who can appreciate a slower paced story telling style without the need for constant action. The harsh environment of the Siberian wilderness complements the story in the way it forces the principals to rely on each other for survival, and in that respect, almost becomes a character in it's own right.",

There is seemingly little happiness to be found in the icy, windswept plains of the wilderness, where overexposure has claimed the lives of hundreds of under-prepared explorers, and where the nearest human being might not wander within one hundred miles of your present location. Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev made several journeys into the area in the early years of the twentieth century, charged with performing a topographical survey of the vast region's many mountains, valleys, rivers and lakes. Arsenyev released countless memoirs detailing his explorations, but his most well-known work is \"Dersu Uzala (Dersu the Trapper),\" published in 1923, which details his three expeditions into the Ussurian taiga of Northern Asia, particularly his interactions with a Nanai/Goldi native guide named Dersu Uzala, who has acquired incredible knowledge, instincts and observation skills through his lifetime of living as a lone nomad in the harsh frontier wilderness.If I ever had any doubts that Akira Kurosawa was my kind of film director, then I may now consider them groundless. After two solid but flawed efforts in 'Stray Dog (1949)' and 'Rashomon (1950),' I have finally uncovered my first genuine masterpiece from the famed Japanese director, an awesome 70mm epic that emphasises the harshness of the Siberian wilderness, the detrimental consequences of human progress, and the ever-important bond of male friendship. 'Dersu Uzala (1975)' uncovers indescribable beauty in the sheer malevolence of the isolated forest region, where the sunlight, glinting off the fractured layers of snow and ice, offers only mild relief from the bitter winter cold, and where men cluster eagerly around a roaring campfire to absorb the glowing heat from its flames. In the maddening seclusion of the forest, it is only through teamwork and friendship that travellers can hope to survive the elements, and, in lonely hunter Dersu Uzala, Arsenyev discovers a genuine friend, whose intelligence, awareness and compassion can only be admired with the utmost reverence.Akira Kurosawa, working with cinematographers Fyodor Dobronravov, Yuri Gantman and Asakazu Nakai, has committed to celluloid some of the most strikingly-gorgeous images since David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia (1962).' The wilderness of Siberia is, at first glance, exceedingly mundane and unremarkable, but, out of the sheer isolation and purity of the landscape, Kurosawa uncovers a noble beauty about the trees, rocks, waters and, indeed, the people who survive there. The film's most breathtaking shot shows Arsenyev and Dersu perched before a pristine sunset, the pair perfectly-framed between the blazing red Sun and the ascending Moon. Out of a bitter windstorm on the frozen expanses of a lake, Kurosawa crafts an intense episode of nail-biting suspense, as the two frantically attempt to gather grass for the purposes of constructing a crude but vital sleeping shelter, their only opportunity to avoid freezing to death in the relentless cold of the Siberian night. Recognising the inherent beauty in the landscape he was photographing, Kurosawa often makes excellent use of long takes, allowing the viewer to simply sit back and absorb the majesty of the wilderness with which he has been surrounded.Another important theme in 'Dersu Uzala' is the cultural and environmental toll of progress. It was only during the early years of the 1900s that the Sikhote-Alin region of Siberia began to abandon its old-time traditions and lifestyles in order to catch up with the more advanced civilisations that surrounded it. Dersu, who has lived alone in the forest for much of his life, proves a final victim of society's progress, a tragic symbol of a culture that has been irretrievably lost in the past. With his dwindling eyesight, and an escalating superstitious paranoia of the forest caused by his senseless murder of a tiger, Dersu finds that he can no longer provide for himself, and so accompanies Arsenyev back to his home in the city. His spirit crushed and broken, Dersu spends his days staring soullessly into the burning fireplace, consumed by memories of his lifetime in the free and peaceful isolation of the forest. He eventually resolves to return to the wilderness, but is shortly murdered for his expensive rifle; the lone hunter has now been completely destroyed by the unstoppable march of progress, which brings along both its benefits and its unavoidable evils.",

The men's developing friendship is poignant but not sentimentalised, and the two actors, as well as the secondary cast, are excellent in a very low-key, deliberate story. The cinematography is outstanding, especially the expansive images of the cold, barren winter plains and of the vast forests of eastern Siberia.

            "review_title": "Beautifully filmed, requires some patience",
            "content": "The bulk of this film concerns two expeditions made by a group of Soviet soldiers to map out regions of the Russian Far East in the early twentieth century. In the first expedition in 1902 the soldiers meet Dersu Uzala, an older hunter wise to ways of living on his own in a harsh environment; Uzala accompanies them and serves as a valuable guide. In the second expedition in 1907 the soldiers happily meet Uzala again by chance. I came to appreciate this movie more when I realized that it is based on the memoirs of one Vladimir Arsenyev who made three major expeditions and did indeed encounter a hunter called Dersu.The expeditions are filled will dangers and drama. A most memorable scene has Dersu and Arsenyev cutting grasses to make a shelter for themselves in order to survive a bitter cold night where they would have died if exposed. Kurosawa is a master of filming such scenes.However, the movie is much more than an adventure story. At its heart is the somewhat improbable friendship that develops between Uzala and Arsenyev. When not out on explorations Arsenyev lives comfortably in Vladivostok with a wife and young son whereas Uzala makes it on his own in the back-country. Arsenyev does not have the skills to live like Uzala, nor, as we come to see, does Uzala have the temperament to live like Arsenyev.A person who feels he cannot live without the internet probably has lost a lot of the basic skills and appreciation of nature that Uzala has. The ultimate irony is that the explorations of Arsenyev to document and map the areas pave the way for the development of interdependent social institutions that lead to the extinction of people like Uzala. Kurosawa tends to exaggerate for effect, which I suppose we all do, but I had a hard time believing that Uzala could shoot an early twentieth-century rifle and hit a swinging string at fifty yards. Initially I felt that some of the scenes went on much longer than their welcome. Did I need to watch an old Chinese man walk away into the snow for a minute and a half? But then I began to appreciate the pacing--it gives you some time to absorb and think about what is going on. This film is in stark contrast to most current movies that assault your senses and are tuned for short attention spans.Maksim Munzuk is near perfect as Uzala. Not much is demanded from the Russian actors as soldiers but, even at that, their performances seemed a flat to me.",

            "content": "How strange. I would not consider \"Dersu Uzala\" among Akira Kurosawa's best and yet I'm convinced it's one of the greatest and most important movies ever.At the risk of sounding too mystical, I'd say this is not the work of a director but an artist willing to be directed by forces that surpass Art. The film was released after \"Do Des-Kaden\" whose flop made Kurosawa contemplate suicide, that's how seriously he took his work, ceasing to trust his own inspiration and consider a potential salvation within Mosfilm's project in the Soviet Union.It was an adaptation of 1923 memoir \"Dersu Uzala\" from Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev, about his topographic expeditions in the early 20th century in the Siberian tundra and taiga. Coincidentally, Kurosawa wanted to concretize that project after he read the book in the late 30s (but couldn't because of locations issues). And there he was, thinking about ending his life when in fact it had come full circle. Like Nature I guess. The prospect of making a film in a new country coincided with the Master's doubt journey, a doubt that would be swept off by one of his most memorable characters: the diminutive but grizzled Goldi trapper Dersu, played by Maxim Munzuk.Dersu is the ultimate mountain or forest guide, making his skills look so effortless you wouldn't notice them. He's capable to identify people's ages from the tracks they leave, to repair a hut and leave some provisions for eventual newcomers, he's a man who knows the wild taiga like the back of his hand and can shoot on a swinging thread tied to a bottle (instead of wasting the bottle). I wouldn't dare to make second-rate analyses by comparing Kurosawa with his Dersu but I found a lot of the Master's self-doubt in Dersu once his eyesight started declined and his ultimate feelings of uselessness in the civilized world. Or am I simply projecting my fascination for the character and the director and look upon both as equally powerful sources of great inspiration.In fact, whatever defines 'great' is made of such broad notions they turn out to be either too vague or too specific for a special breed of films. But I'll try to rephrase it, even some of the best movies operate in a realm of predictability but some not only surprise you but they do so in a surprising way, movies like \"Apocalypto\" or \"Dersu Uzala\". They don't take you to new worlds, they show you the natural world and make you realize how precious and fragile it is. \"Dersu Uzala\" doesn't even bother with a plot, a chase or dangerous stunts, just 'men' and 'nature' simply put together in situations where it comes to one simple choice: osmosis or death. Nature is not a villain, but an ally.And that's the film's inspirational message: Dersu's devotion for nature echoes his own empathy for his fellow 'humans', he respects Captain Arsenyev (Yury Solomin) but Nature, first. And it's because the respect is mutual and the friendship between the two men undeniable that everything works in perfect harmony. The underlying message would be that: the more you love or espect nature, the more you learn to love humans. Interestingly the film is told from the perspective of the Captain who treats him like an equal. Seldom movies show brotherly love without having it spoiled by some trivial adversity. There's no room for some complex of racial superiority not that Dersu is portrayed as a 'magical native'.Indeed, the two men are friends because they think similarly despite their opposite backgrounds. Both value their competence but are aware of their limitations. Dersu gives a meaning to his experience by sharing it and the Captain relies on it and so the whole story unfolds as a mentor-friendship relationship blossoming during two expeditions in 1902 and 1907 while Nature, the true unsung heroine, is shot as if Kurosawa was himself being inhabited by Dersu's spirit. And from his previous filmography, we knew he never let nature being just a backdrop thing.There's a magnificent moment where we the moon and the sun coexist in the same frame. Dersu refers them as good fellow, without which we'd be dead, the sun is setting in a palette of pinkish red while the left side of the frame is blue night, the image is too marvelous for words and defines in one single world what the film is about: or harmony. Nature is all a mature of balance and it's up to the man to fit in and there are two key sequences that show Dersu's adaptation.When he and the Captain are caught in the frozen lake amidst a terrifying blizzard, Dersu immediately orders the Captain to work, the two men must cut as many grass to make a shelter of straw. It's not the order itself but Arseniev's prompt reaction: he doesn't hesitate one second as he knows salvation lies within Dersu, the sum of all wisdom. And a second life-threatening situation occurs when their raft is threatened by crushing rapids, Dersu pushes the Captain off the water and while hanging to a tree told the men which tree to cut so he could reach it. He stayed calm and collected and directed his own rescue.I was wondering whether Dersu didn't inspire Lucas's Master Yoda (George Lucas was a notorious fan ok Kurosawa) it turned out my intution was true but there's more to that, the film is perhaps the work of a director who was doubting himself so much he made a film about the ultimate guide (or director). Maybe Dersu isn't Kurosawa but the man Kurosawa wished he could be. And Nature was for Dersu was Art for Kurosawa, a necessity, a life-defining thing...Dersu or Akira? I don't know but from the way Solomin was referring to Kurosawa in his interview, I could swear it was Arseniev talking about his good old friend, Dersu.",

Dersu's skills alarmed the timid person inside me who has been afraid for years regarding the lack of survival skills if sent out away from the civilization ! The movie impeccably underlines the timeless truth - the one staying close and integrated with Nature, knows how the Life on the planet should be respected !!! The plot is strong, the actors have done their parts flawlessly and the cinematography is majestic. Dersu's instincts, the naive but warm-hearted and cheerful soldiers, the sober and emotional captain Arsenyev, the Chinese hermit all touch the Heart. At the beginning of the first expedition, the soldiers sing a song, then Dersu arrives and at the end of the expedition, they sing the same song and that is when the viewer realizes that it, in a way, depicts the hunter Dersu. When the captain is merry on meeting Dersu during the second expedition, the fellow soldiers sing a song about a grey(aging!) eagle which is a pleasant humor. Maxim Munzuk has portrayed all the simple, yet, deep emotions of a benevolent man living in the wilderness - the pangs of his family loss, the respect for Nature and other living beings, the shock and grief of loss of strength due to aging, a man from the wild feeling smothered in the civilization and the brave decision to go back to the wild even if it means death.Yes, one cannot ignore the perpetual dark mood of the film, I speculate it as a result of Kurosawa's melancholic and unstable mental state just before he begun directing the film.

It is a profound revelation of nature by the affectionate portrait of a very natural man, a hunter, who becomes a guide to a troop of charting soldiers, forming an expedition to explore the far east of Siberia. The film is divided in two parts, and the first part is a marvel of beauty with some extremely exciting sequences showing Dersu Uzala's superior craft of surviving any natural ordeal. The second part is greener, there is less ice and winter and instead lush growth, mosquitos and civil life in town, while here is the crucial incident of the tiger. The sequences of the tiger are marvellously shot, and although it's a mere incident it looms into an overwhelming omen foreboding Dersu Uzala's end, which he fully understands himself but no one else. When the end comes it is not about a tiger or any natural phenomena at all but something completely different that no one could have guessed. I have seen most of Kurosawa's films, but this one struck me as something completely out of his normal style and definitely among the best of them all, especially for its beauty. \"Rashomon\" may have been his most impressing film, for its very awesome intrigue, while this one has not much of an intrigue but the more of natural lyricism - the direct association with nature in all its unfathomable magic is the essence of the intrigue here, which is entirely mystical. The film is unforgettable for its beauty and human feeling, and even the music is splendidly compiled. This is and will remain an all time classic and maybe Kurosawa's best.",

A beautiful film, both inside and out. What I mean is that it stands out as an art piece, the mise-en- sc\u00e8ne, the cinematography. But also as a beautiful portrait of the great friendship shared by two men with two distinct ways of living, two seemingly contradicting mindsets, and two disparate socioeconomic strata. So much if the film is dependent on acting performances and emotion rather than dialogue. As always, Kurosawa relied heavily on the symbolic nature of natural phenomena (rain, snow, a rainbow) to aid in his storytelling. (Pun intended.) Kurosawa's first film not in Japanese, as well as his only work in 70mm. Production took three years, being shot entirely outdoors in nature on location in Russia, of course making for some magnificent cinematography. As a side note, the fascinating fact that this achievement by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Russia finally motivated me to figure out what, exactly, the Academy considers a \"Foreign Language Film\".

The second film adaptation (the first was in 1961) of the novel of the same name by the Russian writer and outstanding researcher of the Far East Vladimir Klavdievich Arseniev. The director was the famous Akira Kurosawa, and the film was filmed by the filmmakers of the USSR and Japan. The third picture of Akira, which I really wanted to see. And here's my brief opinion - Travel across the Ussuri region. At first I wanted to highlight one drawback in the picture, but after thinking it over, I changed my mind, and therefore I will tell you about it in a separate paragraph, but for now I will consider the advantages of this historical drama, which received an Oscar (then still valid).\nSo, here they are:\n1. Scenario - apart from one moment (or rather a minus), the story told makes a favorable impression, because the book's primary source of the famous Russian traveler was taken as a basis. Of course, for the sake of spectacle and drama, some moments were altered and changed in places, but for me it didn't matter, because I hadn't read the book, and I am not going to do it in the near future. The film tells the story of a strong friendship between the Russian officer Vladimir Arsenyev and the Nanai hunter Dersu Uzaly, and about their travels across the Ussuri region, with its beauty and danger. Many dramatic moments, but in the final it even surprised me a little and made me think about some things. Moreover, the heroes of the picture are very similar to their historical prototypes. If you love pictures about travels, especially across Russia, stories of indestructible friendship and good dramas, well, if you are a fan of Akira Kurosawa, then you definitely come here.\n2. Nature - originally, the role of the Ussuri region was supposed to be played by the Japanese island of Hokkaido, but when Akira came to the USSR and saw all the beauty of the Ussuri region, he decided to shoot right here, on our land - and he was right. Almost the entire picture presents the viewer with the enchanting beauty of this region, from which it is almost impossible to take your eyes off. Maybe it sounds very pathetic, but I fell in love with the Ussuri region thanks to this picture, and if I have the opportunity, then I must certainly visit this place and see all the beauty with my own eyes. The operators clearly knew how to shoot and what angles to choose. My regards.\n3. Entourage - early twentieth century. The Far East, an extremely turbulent situation, where the attention of all the great powers is riveted. The Far Eastern borders of the Russian Empire have been little studied, which is why numerous gangs of hunghuzs use this (because of this, a scandal between the USSR and the PRC happened to the picture, well, you know this story without me, and if not, go yandeksit!), So Arsenyev travels and performs the task with the help of the Cossacks and the hunter Dersu Uzaly. The costumes, sets, atmosphere, songs - everything is perfectly done and immerses the viewer in that era.\nNow about the minus - this is protraction. Akira had already sinned with this in the film \"Seven Samurai\", and then he decided to do the same. The first half is especially prolonged, when the heroes are silent for a long time or do not say a word at all. Why did it do that? I almost fell asleep, but Thank God that the second half is more integral and dynamic, without long pauses (well, perhaps at the end, but I forgive that), and the music is clearly not a fountain, it would be possible to work in this direction.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Vladimir Arsenyev and performed by Yuri Methodievich Solomin - a Russian officer and traveler who once met Dersu Uzala - an experienced taiga hunter, which became the beginning of a strong friendship for many years. It should be said that the heroes complemented each other perfectly. Yuri Methodievich superbly played a stately and noble officer who is not at all afraid to ask Dersu for advice, for whom the taiga is his home. Bravo Yuri Methodievich! Bravo!\n2. Dersu Uzala performed by Maksim Munzuk - an old Nanai hunter who nailed to the detachment of Vladimir Arseniev. With his experience and knowledge, he saves both him and the members of the detachment more than once. A good-natured, honest old man, with a mysterious soul and pure thoughts, living in harmony with nature. Maxim perfectly embodied the image of this legendary man on the big screen. Bravo!\nThe picture is based on the duet of Solomin and Munzuk and the magnificent nature of the Ussuri region. Thank you Akira for creating this picture!\nAs a result, we have a good historical drama by Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent (albeit prolonged) script, magnificent views of nature, excellent surroundings and simply amazing acting work.\nMy rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

            "content": "Winner, Best Foreign Language Film, 1976.Kurosawa's best film in color. It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Kurosawa takes you to the colorful and picturesque forests of Siberia; a treat to sore eyes.Dersu, a hunter in the forest, is a true son of the forest. He converses with all the life forms and treats them as fellow men with respect and fear. The soldiers ridicule his old-fashioned behavior but the captain sees him more than his customs- as a professional hunter and a guide. Dersu leads the troop into the Siberian forests, leaves them spellbound with his perfect aiming of the gun and his ever-alert ears that would sense even the faintest of the sounds. Dersu saves the life of the captain when they get lost and are caught in a fierce storm and the design of the cave-like-structure that saved captain's life further increases the admiration the captain has towards Dersu.Years later, the captain leads another troop on an exploration into the forest and the soldiers happen to meet Dersu. Dersu becomes a senile, crotchety codger and his sharp eyesight diminishes. He is persuaded by the captain to rest at his place in the town but he feels he doesn't fit among the fast-moving and weird world where people pay for water. He is later found dead after being killed by a thief who stole the gun gifted by the captain and the captain performs the obsequies in respect for their friendship.",

The story reminded me how profoundly any one person can effect another, even without realizing it: an important reminder in the midst of the information age, which seems to be desensitizing people to our relationships with nature and with our fellow man.How ironic, that the vast, forbidding landscapes of Siberia host the birth of a true friendship, while the warm confines of the  city stifle the passion for life!  I don't believe Kurosawa is denouncing modern times entirely; I believe he's reminding us that true sophistication comes from the depths of the soul, not of the pocketbook.While similar in theme to \"Being There,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" or \"The Rain Man,\" Dersu Uzala is superior, because unlike the subjects of those films, the central character here is merely not well-educated, as opposed to mentally deficient.  Kurosawa must have been too lofty a soul, to suggest spiritual simplicity is a result of a defect.Dersu Uzala is a celebration of love and innocence everyone should see.",

            "content": "The 1970s was not a particularly happy decade for Akira Kurosawa, Japan's foremost film director. It started with his being taken off of helming the Japanese sequences for the ambitious U.S./Japan co-production of TORA! TORA! TORA! (1970), was followed by the critical and box-office disappointment of his first film to be shot in color \u0096 DODES'KA-DEN (1970) \u0096 and culminated in a horrible wrist-slashing suicide attempt which, thankfully, failed! All of this, however, ensured the consequent dissolution of a recently-formed partnership with other major Japanese film-makers \u0096 namely Kon Ichikawa, Keinosuke Kinoshita and Masaki Kobayashi.It's not all that surprising, then, that Kurosawa wandered off to Russia for his next venture \u0096 but it is doubly ironic that his sole work away from his home-ground and made during such a lean creative period would eventually win him the Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award! Among the other contenders for that honor were Dino Risi's SCENT OF A WOMAN and Andrzej Wajda's PROMISED LAND, but it was this slow-moving adventure \u0096 redeemed by its stunning visual splendor (in spite of the color fluctuation in the battered Kino print I watched!) \u0096 which emerged triumphant.Not top-flight Kurosawa, then, but generally compelling nevertheless and providing a good balance between his trademark humanism (although the majority of the Russians are tritely depicted as fun-loving and rather immature) and action (a scuffle with bandits, a river rescue, a tiger hunt). The best sequence in the entire film is a spectacular blizzard which bonds together trapper/guide Dersu Uzala (remarkably played by Maxim Munzuk) and the narrating Russian captain (Yuri Solomin).This clash of cultures, therefore, turns into a celebration of friendship with its succession of dramatic, poignant, even humorous vignettes. Dersu's incompatibility with modern civilization \u0096 an oft-used device during this particular era in cinema \u0096 brings to mind THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER (1975) and THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980); curiously, all three films were inspired by real events (DERSU UZALA being based on his companion Vladimir Andreyev's memoirs, and which had been adapted for TV during the previous decade).By the way, knowing George Lucas' fondness for Kurosawa, the amiable and pint-sized titular character here \u0096 who has an awkward way with words but displays infinite wisdom throughout \u0096 may well have inspired the puppet Yoda from the \"Star Wars\" saga! Curiously enough, the film itself was distributed in the U.S. by none other than Roger Corman's New World company!!",

            "content": "For a filmmaker so often credited for his bold action scenes and epic storytelling, it is always somewhat disarming to see a picture like Dersu Uzala (1975), a film that sees Akira Kurosawa dispose of his trademark samurais and sweeping battle sequences and concentrate on a more humanitarian story. The film focuses on the strong friendship that grows between a Russian soldier and a mysterious Goldi hunter in the forests of east Siberia. The Russian, Captain Vladimir Arseniev, enlists the strange and mysterious Dersu as a guide through the stark, dangerous and uncharted deserts and forests. As the two men trek even further into the unknown, an unspoken bond and deep mutual respect grows between them. When Vladimir finds out that Dersu has developed a serious problem with his eyesight, he invites him to stay with his family in the city.The film makes points on the clash between nature and industry, beginning with the destruction of a forest, as well as the more obvious ideas of loyalty and friendship. Both Yuri Solomin and Maksim Munzuk are great in their respective lead roles, displaying a warm and believable chemistry, even if the overwhelming beauty of Kurosawa's frame at times overshadows them. Dersu Uzala is a slow moving film that rewards, with the filmmaker clearly understanding the value of character and the importance of subtle detail. The second act detracts from the grace of the story by trying to say too much about the loss of nature within the growth of industry, but this is a minor flaw that does not ruin the overall effect. This is exemplary film-making worthy of classic status, interesting and enjoyable, and a good place to start for anyone interested in the work of Kurosawa.",

It's also a tale about finding your own soul. While Dersu leads army captain and his men through rough terrains (doing it without any interest getting personal gains) he tells them about forest, and amazes them with his positive and seemingly naive (very wise, actually) outlook on life. Respect towards man and animals, living or nonliving - Dersu calls everything men or people (ljudi).Very beautiful film, but not only because of magnificent cinematography or Akira Kurosawa's masterful direction, but more because of the beautiful soul of Dersu.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa, the masterful director of this humble epic, was in a dark place before the making of 'Dersu Uzala'. His last two movies had become big flops at the box-office and he could not get investors for his next projects. As a result Kurosawa became depressed and tried to commit suicide. Eventually the Soviets would breathe life into his career again by inviting him to direct 'Dersu Uzala'. It is a simple story about humanity, humbility and the forces of nature.We follow around the captain of a Russian expedition team, tasked with exploring the Siberian wilderness. During their travels they encounter upon a man who lives completely isolated in the harsh and brutal evironment that surrounds them. At first the Russians laugh at their new travel companion, unbeknowing to the vast wisdom he embodies. Later on they would depend on his knowledge of the natural forces and eventually love him for the great man he is.Before us grows a relationship that would become the best of friendships. Two men bound by eachother to survive whatever mother nature throws at them and with great prevail. The captain and the wise man get caught in a blizzard and what happens next is a battle of life and death between man and nature. For minutes on end we see two men cutting through high grass in an attempt to get through the night, companioned by nothing more but the sounds of their panting and increasing exhaustion.\nThey come out of the blizzard as best friends who owed their lives to one another and in a warm embrace they show their admiration to eachother. It has become one of the most nail biting but rewarding moments I have ever encountered in cinema.The two man would part ways eventually. With the wise man unable to live in the city he chooses to stay behind in the wilderness. As they part they look around to get a last look at the other. 'Kapitan!', 'Dersu' they yell, both hoping they will see eachother again and so does the audience.Years later the captain goes on another expedition and, as faith have it, the men find eachother again. Once again Dersu would navigate them through the wild and once again they would save eachothers lives by surviving a rafting accident in a fast-flowing river. They had become ore than best friends, they were companions by fate. Dersu who has grown old and aggitated by his decreasing hunting skills, chooses to join the captain in the city. Unable to live the life he wants, because of his failing eye-sight, he becomes unhappy. Dersu belongs in the wilds and both he and the captain know it. They say goodbye one last time, with the captain handing Dersu a new and better rifle. The next we hear is that a dead man needs to be identified in the wilderness. We hope it is not true, but we know that it is. One of the investigators suggests that he was killed because someone wanted his rifle, a bitter end to the best of connections.Dersu Uzala is celebration of nature, life and friendship. A humanist masterwork that could only been directed by Kurosawa at the lowest point in his life. Many of the wisdom Dersu teaches reminds me of Taoism. A philosophy build on listening to the forces of nature and giving in to the flow of the universe. We get a grasp at the vast beauty that the wild contains, but also a look at her harsh mood-swings.",

Kurosawa opted for Vladimir Arseniev's titular travel log.Dersu Uzala follows Soviet cartographer Arseniev and his crew through the Ussuri region, where they meet the title character, a local trapper living in harmony with nature. What follows is a deliberate, contemplative \"road movie\" of sorts, the record of an unusual but touching friendship.This was nothing short of a resurrection project for Kurosawa: a clean break with everything he had ever done, and with almost anyone he had ever worked with. While it is daunting to watch it knowing that the director managed collaborators in a foreign language in hellish conditions and still shaken from a life crisis, discarding all that in no way diminishes the film's merits. It is an immaculate tone-poem, haunted by the ghost of Kurosawa's erstwhile friend Andrei Tarkovsky. It is a hymn to nature, turning the landscape into a character in ways none of Kurosawa's earlier films had done. Given the language-barrier, the performances deserve special mention, especially from the central duo: Maxim Munzuck creates a character for the ages with his proto-Yoda Dersu, but Yuri Solomin anchors the proceedings as the subdued, likable Arsenyev. The photography is more than up to the usual Kurosawa standards, and all the tech credits follow suit. The film won that year's Academy Award for best foreign film and begin the master filmmaker's last trio of epic masterpieces. It might stand out as somewhat of a black sheep in his oeuvre, a moment of contemplation in between the bursts of fury and energy of his other films, yet it managed to transcend its status as a career footnote to become one of his greatest achievements.Do not allow yourself to overlook this beauty.",

In 1974,after a failed suicide attempt,he decided to seek money from outside Japan for a film. Good fortune came in the form of a trip to the former U.S.S.R.,where he was offered to direct a film adaptation of the classic Russian novel, Dersu Okhotnik,by Vladimir Arsenyev,a tale of a friend ship between a Captain in the Russian Army & a elderly man,Dersu Uzala living in the forest. Kurosawa jumped at the chance,and to make a long story short, in 1975,'Dersu Uzala' was released in the U.S.S.R. to acclaim,and eventually released world wide. It's easy to see what would make this beautifully shot,edited & directed tale of a simple man of the Earth, and the friendship he shared with a (so called)learned man,who would learn much more as a result of that friendship. Akira Kurosawa (The Seven Samurai,Ran)directs from a screenplay written by Kurosawa & Yuri Nagibin,from the novel Dersu Okhotnik,by Vladimir Arsenyev. The film's breath taking cinematography is rendered by no less than three directors of photography:Fydor Dobronvov,Yuri Gantman & Asakazu Nakai. The film's editing is supervised by Lyudmila Feiginova. The lush music score is by Issak Shvarts. The cast is headed by Maxim Manzuk,as Dersu Uzala & Yuri Soloman as Captain Vladimir Arseniev,with Svetlana Danilchenko,as Mrs.Arseniev,and Dimitri Korshikov as their young son, Wowa. With Suimenkul Chokmorov,Aleksander Pyatkov,Nikolai Valkov,and others. A well written screenplay,superb acting,lush cinematography,and a sublime musical score make for this,a film that should be experienced by those who are sick to death of the usual garbage from the septic tank that has become Hollywood. This film was produced in two editions:the original Soviet version,filmed in 70mm,in six channel stereophonic sound,and a 35mm wide screen \"scope\" version (alas,in mono sound,only). Sadly,there are only two surviving 70mm stereo prints of Dersu Uzala available:1) in an unsubtitled print,that is currently in a film archive in Moscow 2)The only other 70mm,stereo print is only available in Sweden (with Swedish subtitles)in a film archive in Stockholm (all other prints are 35mm scope,in mono). Spoken in Russian & Mandirin with English subtitles. Rated 'G' by the MPAA,this film has absolutely nothing to offend,making it a perfect family film",

            "content": "In a career littered with classics that have continued to be spoken about as some of the best feature film products the industry has ever known, the Soviet-Japanese produced Oscar winning epic Dersu Uzala remains one of Akira Kurosawa's most underrated and rarely spoken about efforts.His only non-Japanese language film in a decades spanning career, Dersu Uzala was a passion project for Kurosawa and ended up being produced in an important part of the filmmakers life following a failed suicide attempt and a bitterness towards his home countries industry, where his last few films had failed to make an impact and his future projects were unable to get funding, making the triumphs of this true life tale all the more noteworthy.Based on Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenev's 1923 published memoir of his time trekking the often unforgiving wilderness of Sikhote-Alin in the Russian east in the early 1900's, expeditions that saw him Arsenev meet and befriend local nomadic hunter Dersu Uzala who become a key part of the group of explorers in Arsenev's team and a dear friend to the man, Kurisawa's film is a picturesque 70mm shot adventure that features one of cinema's great teachers and a true life character that was a clear inspiration for future characters in key Hollywood films.Often spoken about as key influence on George Lucas's creation of Yoda in the Star Wars universe, Dersu (played with a winning smile by Maxim Munzuk) almost feels like a too good to be true human being that is more than content with helping others at the cost of his own safety or comfort and as he mentors and guides Arsenev across his various journeys across the harsh and unforgiving surrounds of the wilds they find themselves in, you can't help but fall under the spell of a man who in many ways was the last of his kind in a world that was changing rapidly around him.It might not have the scope or spectacle of Seven Samurai, the emotional heft of Ikiru or the storytelling smarts of Rashomon but there's a quiet and understated heart and soul found in Derzu Uzala and despite it being largely unheralded in today's film community that spend their time elsewhere when it comes to praising Kurosawa's works, this tale of friendship, life and adventure is a film unwearied by time and a lovingly crafted experience by one of the all time greats.Final Say -It may not quite match it with the best of Kurosawa's works, which is a nigh on impossible task, but Dersu Uzala is a finely made and heartwarming true life tale that deserves to remain in the forefront of the film communities minds when the topic of Kurosawa's influential work comes up.4 grass shelters out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

The film benefits from Kurosawa's eye for natural beauty when it comes to vast landscapes untouched by civilisation, however, what really drives the film is the bond that develops between the main characters - and in spite of other soldiers ridiculing the local hunter behind his back. This very real bond leads to an especially engaging final quarter in which the captain tries to give the hunter a better life by inviting him to live with him, only to discover that despite their deep friendship, they each want something different out of life (\"how do you live inside a box?\"). The first three quarters of the film are not quite as compelling as this final section, but they are still engaging enough as the two main characters survive through harsh conditions, coming to appreciate each other just a little more in the process. The movie may have benefited from less focus on the other soldiers who are rather dull and ultimately interchangeable, and yet, they serve as an acute counterpoint to their captain who is able to see past stereotypes and racial prejudice and recognise right away the skills, talent and humanity of the hunter who, in some ways, is more civilised than the soldiers who mock him.",

            "content": "Ikiru felt like the work of an old man looking back on a life wasted. Dersu Uzala feels like the work of an old man who knows his time is coming to a close soon. His efforts to find independent financing had ended with the financial failure of Dodes'ka-den. No one in the Japanese film industry wanted to fund him. He had broken professionally with his main star of the previous twenty years. He attempted suicide, cutting his wrists and neck. And then the Soviet Union, through the tyranny's cinematic organization Mosfilm, approached one of the world's greatest filmmakers with a proposition: they would give him complete creative freedom for a film set in Russia and based on a Russian source. Kurosawa, long a fan of Russian writing, chose the little known autobiographical account of a Tsarist Imperial army officer surveyor mapping a remote region of Siberia who encounters a Goldi native of the region and their friendship. It was a work that Kurosawa had kept his eye on developing for decades, holding off because he felt it could only be told by actually filming in the region in which the story originally took place. What followed was one of Kurosawa's longest and most difficult shoots that told the story of an old, useful man watching his abilities slowly deteriorate until he becomes useless.Captain Vladimir Arsenyev (Yury Solomin) leads his dozen men into the Shkotovo region of Siberia where they come across the titular character Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk). Finding him intelligent and well-versed in the ways of the area, Arsenyev asks Uzala to accompany the group as a guide. The Russian soldiers are initially dismissive of the seemingly simple, old man. He speaks in halting Russian and refers to everything (the sun, the moon, the animals) as \"people\". However, he has a deep understanding of the land around them, and he is incredibly skilled with a rifle. When the soldiers, having camped for the night, swing a bottle on a string in a shooting competition, Uzala insists that it's a waste, that he would shoot the string instead and save the bottle. When he accomplishes it, the dismissive soldiers are silenced into admiration.There are two life-threatening sequences in the film, one in each half, and the one in the first is kind of amazing. Arsenyev and Uzala separate from the rest of the group in order to reach the large lake in the area. A sudden wind comes up, covering their tracks, and they are unsure of which way to get back safely, delaying their walk long enough that any hope of getting back to camp on time is dashed. The cold of the lake at night is sure to kill them, but Uzala has an idea. He just tells Arsenyev to cut the tall, wild grass around them, and Arsenyev follows the instruction without question. Arsenyev grows weak as they cut and gather as much as they can, creating a large pile five feet high, and eventually passes out. When he wakes up, Uzala has completed the work, creating a shelter of the grass that gave them enough protection from the cold that they were able to survive. I get the sense that Uzala had never done anything quite like that before, but he understood so much of life in the hills that he could just very quickly improvise in a life-threatening situation.The survey comes to an end, and the two part ways as good friends, especially since Uzala saved Arsenyev's life. Four years pass and Arsenyev is sent to the region once again for more surveying, secretly holding hopes of meeting his friend once again. They do meet up by chance, and the two renew their friendship warmly. The second life-threatening sequence occurs here when Arsenyev decides to try and ford a river, their makeshift raft getting carried away with Uzala onboard until he grabs onto a fallen tree stuck in the middle of the river right before some rapids. Arsenyev has to organize his men to fell another tree that Uzala can grab onto and swing back to shore. It's a partial reversal of the earlier sequence where Arsenyev has to save Uzala's life (only partial because Uzala tells Arsenyev what to do from the middle of the river).There are two events that change Uzala, though. The first is when he shoots a tiger, an evil omen on himself that makes him feel like the forest he has lived in his whole life is turning against him. The second is his failing eyesight, brought to the fore when Arsenyev notes a boar in the distance that Uzala cannot see. This element, the failing eyesight of the man that signals the end of his usefulness in his natural habitat, is an interesting parallel to Kurosawa himself. It's unclear to me when he noticed his eyesight was failing, though it's something of common knowledge that by the time he was making Ran, a decade later, he was effectively blind and was using his assistant directors heavily to set up shots. The parallel between the two is interesting.Arsenyev brings Uzala to his home in Khabarovsk to live with him, his wife, and his son. The life in the town is destructive for Uzala. All of the things he knows how to do are worthless in a place where you buy food in stores and get coal for your fires delivered. He even yells at the man who delivers water for money. He can't hunt. He can't chop down a tree for firewood. All he can do is sit in front of the fire in the house in unfamiliar clothes. It's sad. It's not a more direct civilization vs. The life in nature of some lesser works. It's not about civilization encroaching on Uzala's pristine existence. It's about the natural end of that native life. Uzala's time comes to an end because his body decays to the point where he cannot fend for himself in the hills.The film ends up feeling both apart from Kurosawa's body of work and firmly at home in it at the same time. The setting of language of Russia set it apart, but it also is a slower, quieter work mostly set outside. It's a purely character piece, which he had certainly done before but was always something of an exception. On the other side, Uzala is another one of Kurosawa's stray dogs, men removed from society and learning to survive on their own, coming into some kind of conflict with the world of civilization. It's an interesting mix of the familiar with the unfamiliar, all while telling a sad tale of a man reaching his end.It may not be on the same level, reaching the same emotional highs, as Ikiru, but Dersu Uzala is an affecting film that wonderfully uses the backdrop of the Siberian wilds to tell its story well.",

            "content": "Once in a while, very rarely, I have the pleasure of watching a movie that reminds me of how much good humans are capable of. Told in a simple, linear way, director Akira Kurosawa and his co-collaborator Yuri Nagibin adapt Vladimir Arsenyev's novel Dersu Uzala, about a Russian army captain that befriends a hunter in the Siberian regions. In charge of a military expedition to map out the terrain, Captain Arseniev invites Dersu, an experienced and tough-as-nails old hunter, to guide him and his men across forests and polar deserts back into safety in civilization.Maksim Munzuk, at the age of 65, plays Dersu. At an age when great actors start becoming parodies of themselves \u2013 who can stand Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro nowadays? \u2013 this unknown Russian actor played the greatest role of his life and arguably left us one of the greatest performances in film history. He is short but robust, silent but expressive in his manners, and always honest and outspoken in his words. A simple man, he seeks no glory or profit; he helps Arseniev and his men out of genuine kindness.Yuri Solomon plays Arseniev, a humble officer who appreciates the help Dersu can offer him. Unprejudiced and curious, he observes Dersu with great interest and eventually forms a friendship with him that lasts for as long as they live. This is the movie at its core: friendship and humanity amidst a world that can easily kill us, as the Siberian regions proves several times throughout the movie. Using wide shots throughout the movie, Kurosawa shows how insignificant men are in comparison with the nature surrounding them, how beautiful the world is and how blessed we are to live in it.Every element of Dersu Uzala contributed to making this one of the best movies I've ever seen: the acting by the main actors; the cinematography by Asakazu Nakai; Isaac Shvarts' score. Watching Dersu Uzala is almost contemplating perfection.",

            "content": "Sometimes, it is possible to see how a movie director's changing life has impacted on the way in which he or she approaches making a motion picture. Don't worry, I'm not some crazy auteurist; I'm not talking about themes or symbolism, just the changing relationship between the camera and the material. In 1970 Akira Kurosawa suffered the disastrous commercial and critical failure of Dodesukaden, a picture he had poured a lot of his own funds into producing. Soon after this lifelong humanist made what we can assume was an earnest but thankfully unsuccessful suicide attempt. Dersu Uzala was his the picture he made next.Dersu Uzala is often categorised as an anomaly in the Kurosawa filmography anyway, as it was his only feature made outside his native Japan. This adaptation of a Russian explorer's memoir is a potentially serious departure for a director who previously wrote all his own scripts and always seemed to have his finger on the pulse of Japanese society. Still, the wilderness setting and interaction between humanity and landscape in the story ultimately makes this a tale that could be of any time or place. The largely Russian film crew seems particularly in tune with the Japanese director's sensibilities. The musical scoring by Isaak Shvarts has that beautiful haunting quality of Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, which Kurosawa would no doubt have appreciated. His long-term director of photography Asakazu Nakai works with a pair of Russian cinematographers to great some wonderful images that have the warm softness of impressionist painting.This last point is particularly important for the late-period Kurosawa. He had long been an accomplished amateur painter, but never has this been more apparent in his film work than in Dersu Uzala. We now see in him a desire to create smooth tonal patterns for the screen, creating compositions that are primarily for aesthetic value, even something as mundane as the shot of sleeping soldiers before they meet Dersu, in which everything is arranged in harmonious diagonals. Howard Hawks once derided the widescreen format as being a bad move because it was a shape rarely chosen by painters, but Kurosawa manages perfectly with it. Painterly his approach may be but it is still cinematic. His frequent use of movement in depth shows his understanding of the frame as a three-dimensional space as oppose to simply a short, wide box. Often a little movement and sound adds to the overall impression, the ripple of water, the crackle of fire and the noises of wind and creatures. With complete control over every element of a shot, Kurosawa is constantly seeking to evoke the might of the forest, its beauty and its mystery.This may be conjecture, but it may be that Kurosawa, shaken by his recent experiences and advancing age, is here taking a step back, unable to connect with fully his subject and humanity in general. After all, painting is generally a solitary pursuit. There are no close-ups in Dersu Uzala, and an unusually low proportion of mid-shots. We are rarely encouraged to focus on facial expressions, and almost always take the place of detached observers, lurking in the bushes. Also contrary to much of Kurosawa's earlier pictures, in which the acting was often flamboyant and hammy, the players here are subdued and realistic \u2013 something which incidentally lead players Yuri Solomin and Maxim Munzuk respond especially well to, with Munzuk's performance being incredibly moving at times in its subtle expression. And yet Kurosawa barely allows us to feel as if we know these characters. The physical sense of distance makes us feel like voyeurs on their lives, and while the picture is filled with breathtaking beauty the director's tendency to envelop us in the human warmth of a story has vanished.However as an uplifting postscript, Dersu Uzala was a considerable success, especially at the Russian box office, also gaining recognition elsewhere including an Oscar for Best foreign picture. This veteran director, back from the brink of despair, would soon make some fruitful collaborations with Hollywood producers, and his career would end in a blaze of glory.",

This film won the Foreign Film Oscar, so it was sort of a comeback film for Kurosawa. Based on a real story, the movie is set in the Russian far east in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Basically, is about a Russian captain and explorer befriending a native called Dersu Uzala (of the ethnic group which today is referred as the nanai), after he saves his live during a snow storm. Most of the movie then deals with their friendship as they explore and hunt together in the wilds of eastern Siberia. When Dersu's vision no longer makes him able to hunt, the Russian brings him to the city to live with his family. But for a man who has always lived in the woods, urban civilization seems very strange, so he pleads to the captain to return to his native place. Unfortunately, time has not passed in vain, and in the woods he will find an early demise. It's a great adventure film, though one wonders if the relations between the Russians and the Siberian natives were always as friendly as this movie shows. One detail: though some of the movie was shot on location, other parts are shot in a studio, pretending to be a forest, and sadly, that shows. Still, I think this is one of Kurosawa's good films (though not among his best).",

            "content": "I saw Dersu Uzala originally when it was first released, and literally could not forget it. I was in my 20s, and had no idea who Akira Kurosawa was (and had seen none of his other films) at that time. As others have remarked, the quality of the DVD is merely passable --- it was better translated onto the small to medium screen when I saw it on celluloid at a Canadian community college library in the 70s. The Siberian setting is grandly portrayed. Further, the meeting of two cultures is exquisitely handled in its many complexities. We see this simple, initially misunderstood, man of the uncharted wilderness transformed from a near-simpleton in the eyes of the members of the Russian cartographic expedition, who initially have no idea at all what to make of him, into a genius of his trade, a supremely sympathetic and dependable human, and, ultimately, an entirely inspiring hero.While Dersu Uzala is my favourite of all of Kurosawa's films, it does not seem to be widely recognized as one of his important works. In fact, Kurosawa was struggling with depression when this film was made, and his mood set the tone, particularly at the conclusion of the film (which I think he might have done differently, had he been in better spirits). This was a Russian-Japanese co-production, accomplished, importantly, in the third decade of the Cold War. Through this film, I learned respect not only for Northern Manchurian aboriginal people, but also for Russians and their culture. (Dersu was ethnically Goldi or Nanai, a people of the Middle Amur Basin, of Northern Manchurian descent).This is a story with heart and soul, played out against one of the equally most beautiful and entirely ominous of natural settings I have encountered. My view and understanding of Siberia were transformed by this film, as was my appreciation for international cinema. Certainly, this film, Dersu Uzala, needs to be remastered and released on 4K --- and brought back to large screens in theatres, as well --- though I am not certain that will ever occur.",

It is the 13th Kurosawa film that I have seen, and to me it is so different from the rest of his work that I might not have guessed who the director was if I had simply stumbled upon it at random. For one, it is a Soviet-Japanese joint production, and is spoken entirely in Russian, not Japanese. There is no Mifune or Nakadai at the helm, but rather some relatively unknown actors, although talented nonetheless). There are no samurai that Kurosawa became known for, neither is it a noir-esquire type of film like High and Low or Stray Dog. And yet, among all these differences, it is one of the most beautiful films that Kurosawa created in my opinion. And to me, it is a different kind of beauty. It is a raw, pure beauty. The stunning cinematography adds so much to the story. Nature is alive in this film, from the crackling flames to the cascading rivers to the shredding winds, Dersu even refers to all these natural aspects as \"men.\" This film is not driven by ambiguous symbolism or a complex plot, but by strong themes and tremendous character development. One must be rather cold to not be affected by some of the heartwarming scenes. I have seen some call this film too slow or too long, and while Kurosawa definitely does exhibit a lot of patience in his shots, none of it is wasted. The relationship between the two primary characters is so well developed that I could not help but be captivated throughout the whole story. This is truly one of Kurosawa's most overlooked, under appreciated works. Kurosawa succeeds in telling a very touching tale without making it sentimental, but rather filled with a beauty that deserves to be witnessed.",

Every time I am set to watch a drama, there are few movies that come to my mind which set my expectation. But post this movie, this is the one that comes first to my mind. This has also helped me distinguish clearly between American culture and Asian culture (European here) and what to expect and what not to from Hollywood movies. Don't mean to write off Hollywood movies entirely. There are multiple masterpieces there and I continue to watch and re-watch many of them. However, very clearly, as Robert Altman once said while reviewing Rashomon, Hollywood probably portrays everything with the same causal and logical relationship but in an American setting with American characters portraying American culture, spoken language and body language. That really is the distinction which brings out, in all its glory, the Great American Arrogance (GAA).At the outset, great script, great cinematography, clinical direction, engrossing background score and performances by the actors that does justice to all the technicians' efforts.A bit of background about the movie - might not be new for Kurosawa fans. Kurosawa, after a series of failed movies from later 1960s to early 1970s, Kurosawa unsuccessfully attempted suicide. Thereafter Kurosawa set to work on a film based on a novel by a Russian explorer. Shot for more than a year under extremely harsh conditions, this movie won the Oscars in the foreign language film category apart from many other wins at various film festivals. This marked the re-entry of a master.The movie's beauty or its backbone is in the characterization. To verbally narrate this as a story to someone could be boring and futile as the impact lies in the characters and the screenplay. Extremely adorable characterization of the hunter. He would make you want to be like him or meet someone like him. He would make you think that such God-hearted souls exist only in the wilds away from the cynical and hypocrytic man-made parts of the world. In fact there is a similar line in the movie where the army men discuss that people like Dersu can be found only in the wilds. The character of the Captain is also extremely important as his thoughts and body-language impress upon the viewers Dersu's selflessness (viewers can see that the Captain literally admires him). Both these characters make the movie what it is.The movie is simply about what happens over a few days between a few Russian army men, their captain and a hunter in the Siberian forests. No real start nor finish. Nothing like a specific mission, specific event, specific incident, specific life story, etc. Yet it will totally have you in grips and you wouldn't want to get up before completely watching this movie and until you've seen what happens to the sweet characters in the movie and the relationship between them.At the risk of sounding tangential and biased / prejudiced I must compare, at a very high level, 2 Hollywood movies that quickly come to my mind with Dersu Uzala. Shawshank Redemption and Bucket List. Granted that both have a completely different theme and talk about something different. Yet there is a very striking similarly and a commonality. Both of them are about friendship between 2 adult men and mature. While I don't have much to talk about the portrayal of relationships in the 2 movies as that is purely driven by what the movies called for, I would merely compare the characterization which is what I came to realize as the GAA. While the character of Morgan Freeman in both movies is almost comparable (in terms of his personality and composure) to that of Yuri Solomin (who plays the Captain in this movie), the real difference is seen in the characterization of Jack Nicholson and Tim Robbins in Bucket List and Shawshank Redemption respectively. Both exude a bit to extreme levels of arrogance. And this difference is also seen in the characterization of support roles. This characterization, if not the comparison, is very important as that is really the highlight of this movie for which you'll fall in love with it.This movie reinforces Kurosawa's view of humanity and how he sees the world today. This is one of the movies that can have a lasting impact on one's personality (it did on mine). Fans of pure drama movies MUST watch this. 10/10.",

            "content": "DERSU UZALA just blew me away. Set prior to the Russian revolution it tells a deceptively simple story of a small band of Russian soldiers on a challenging mission to survey a Siberian wilderness that's forbidding in summer and absolutely treacherous in winter.Fortunately for them, along the way they encounter Derzu Uzala, a little man who lives his life alone, at one with the forest and its creatures, and who agrees to serve as guide for the expedition. He's at one with his surroundings; he refers to animals and plants and stones and everything else in his world as \"men;\" he's short; he's initially perceived to be a fool but it turns out he's incredibly strong and capable and wise; he can handle a weapon more skillfully than any of the soldiers -- it's almost as though the Force is with him. Yes, I realized when I heard (read) his mangled syntax that Artoo and Threepio clearly weren't the only characters George Lucas lifted from an Akira Kurosawa movie.But that's a side issue. This film is gorgeous and gripping: I was hooked from the opening scene and I hung onto every small thing that happened from then on. And really, in this film only small things happen, but they add up to an epic tale of nature and the ultimate wonder and tragedy of life itself. And it's all set against the backdrop of breathtaking Siberia.My only regret about seeing this wonderfully photographed film is that I didn't see it on a huge screen in a proper movie theater. The Kino DVD transfer just made me sad. There sat the movie on my widescreen TV like a pitiful postage stamp surrounded by an ocean of black border. Sure, I could enlarge the picture to fit side to side, but then the subtitles were chopped off at the bottom. I think Kino could have done better and I hope Criterion will someday give this film the loving care it deserves.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's \"Dersu Uzala\" (1975) is an oddity in the director's oeuvre, but nonetheless, or precisely because of it, beloved by many. It has a historical setting, though it has no samurais and very little action. It focuses on the lyric moments of humanity which have always been integral to the beauty of Kurosawa's cinema. The film is based on Vladimir Arsenev's novel about his expeditions to Ussuria in the early 20th century during which he became acquainted with an aging hunter living in the woods, gathering all he needs from the environment. The simple charm of the story probably fascinated Kurosawa and offered a perfect basis for that time in his career. Before making \"Derzu Uzala\", Kurosawa had suffered both a professional and a personal tragedy as his first film in color \"Dodes'ka-den\" (1970) became a huge financial flop, and subsequently Kurosawa tried to commit suicide. Thus, in the early 1970's Kurosawa had truly lost his faith in cinema, the modern world, and life itself (for a moment at least). For this level of desolation, Arsenev's story offered a perfect means of meditation since its setting was far from capitalism and modern life as well as contemporary cinema. After all, \"Derzu Uzala\" is, at its heart, a story about total unselfishness, utter humility, and the beauty of life in touch with nature. What is more, Kurosawa uses a veritably lingering narrative which is combined with ascetic aesthetics. Overall, the style is very stripped. The gorgeous shots of the Russian landscape may be sublime, but it is really the landscape that is sublime. The form that shows it is naturalistic. \"Dersu Uzala\" is far from the surrealistic poetry combined with Gorky's realism that characterized Kurosawa's previous film, \"Dodes'ka-den\". It is much simpler. It gave Kurosawa a moment to contemplate the values and ideals of life that were dearest to him.In all its simplicity, \"Dersu Uzala\" tells us about the friendship between two different men: a Russian soldier, Arsenev, and a self-reliant hunter, Dersu. It studies the conflict of nature and civilization which forces a life of nature to diminish. The heart-rending tale is heavy with nostalgic yearning for the past and a melancholic sense of emptiness for the future. All this might sound sentimental, but somehow Kurosawa manages to create a character out of Dersu that is not idealized in a sentimental fashion. Yet, it is very difficult to point out the elements in the film which cause this effect; that is, the believable disposition of Dersu's character. On paper, it sounds naive and sentimental, but on screen -- in Kurosawa's images -- it gathers a new dimension. Arguably \"Dersu Uzala\" is the simplest story Kurosawa ever told, but maybe even more importantly it is also the story which he told in the simplest fashion.",

You feel they really care for each other, as Arseniev is very accepting and understanding of the way of live that he has never confronted before in meeting Dersu. They just get along so well and love and respect each other so much and in every way, it's hard not to like watching them interact and go through situations together.You never see Dersu without Arseniev close to him in his life (either in context of their lives or physically), as the story is told from Arseniev's perspective, the years which Dersu wanders as Arseniev briefly returns to society in the middle of the film remains untold; but you do see Arseniev in the absence of Dersu (even if only for brief lapses) but you do feel the absence and wait in anxiety for Dersu to make his way back into the story.There's one bit at the beginning of the 2nd segment of the film, where Arseniev is told by one of his men that he came across a hunter, but when the hunter asked the name of the leader of his unit he was not allowed by regulations to tell him who his commander is, Arseniev then rushes into the forest and in frame there is a far off speck of a man climbing through the brush and as you hear Arseniev shout \"Dersu!\" hearing Dersu reply, \"Captain!\" as they rush to hug each other is just such a heartfelt moment. Towards the end of the film, Dersu's eyesight fails and accepts that he cannot keeping living off the woods like he has his whole life and Arseniev offers him a place in his own home, back in the city, which Dersu accepts. After a time, it becomes apparent to both of them that Dersu's soul is being broken as he tries to adapt to society and he cannot live as freely as he's used to, so he breaks the news to Arseniev that he must go back to the forest. Arseniev without saying a word, walks offscreen and goes upstairs and brings back his new rifle of the latest model and gives it to Dersu without a second thought. And the fact that Arseniev is so accepting of Dersu's choice and doesn't take offense to his leaving but accepts his decision and supports him is the heart of the movie.The movie seems to be about the end of an era and in the ever- progressing society that we live in, Arseniev discovers this life- force that walks to the beat of it's own drum even as everything progresses and becomes more civilized. Well that's how I explain the beginning of the movie and everything that follows.The cinematography and the editing are gorgeous, by the way. And, of course, the direction. The lighting CAN be a bit BIT outdated, like when they film night scenes by the campfire, but it's such a good movie anyway.",

On their travels they meet a local hunter, Dersu Uzala, an old man determined to live his life in isolation. At their request he becomes their guide and over time a friendship forms between the officer and Dersu.A very un-Kurosawaesque Akira Kurosawa film. For one it's filmed in Russia, in Russian. Based on a true story, Kurosawa had wanted to make this film since the 1950s but struggled to adapt it to a Japanese setting. Ultimately he got to make it in its ideal setting: in Russia, with Russian actors.It's also filmed in colour, a rarity for Kurosawa films.The finished product is beautifully shot and told, the story of a friendship that spanned several years and encompassed many adventures. It's also the story of a clash of lifestyles and outlooks: the urbane, rational soldier vs the superstitious and unsophisticated yet incredibly in-tune with nature hunter. Yet despite their different ages, backgrounds and outlooks the two are good friends and make a great combination.On the downside, the film is unnecessarily long. Every scene is drawn out excessively, resulting in a fair amount of patience being required to get through the whole film. It ends quite emotionally, giving you some reward for your patience, but it can be a slog at times.",

            "content": "Dersu Uzala has remained my favorite movie from the time I first saw it.  I don't think the movie has a single weakness, from plot to visualization, to acting to social relevance.Although Kurosawa is one of my favorite directors, this film is like nothing else he has done.  It is the simple story of a Russian military surveying party around the turn of the century that has the task of surviving far eastern Siberia.  Early in the course of the survey they meet Dersu, an ethnic Goldi who hunts in the forests for a living.  The friendship that develops between the head of the party, Arseniev, and the Goldi is one of the most beautiful stories of cross-cultural interaction I have ever seen.After seeing the film, I was very impressed with the story line, but I was thinking that he had been perhaps a bit overdramatic in his script, including more dangerous incidents than he needed to, and it might seem melodramatic to some people.  Some years later while browsing in the library, I came across a book by Arseniev called Dersu, and sure enough it was the \"real life\" story that Kurosawa had based his script on.  What was most surprising was that Kurosawa had actually understated the dangers faced by Arseniev and his surveying party in that there were several incidents that he had left out.I suspect that there are no Goldis like Dersu remaining in the far eastern forests of Siberia today, that they have been long since overrun by the \"superior\" cultures of the Russians and Chinese.  But this movie remains a powerful testimonial to what will be lost as we continue to try to assimilate the remaining ethnic minorities with little regard to the special gifts they can offer.",

The only other one I know of being \"The letter that was never sent\" (1960, Mikhail Kalatozov).Although taking place in Siberia the film has definite characteristics of the Western genre. In stead of \"Go west young man\" in this case it rather is \"Go east young man\"The young man is captain Arsenyev (Yuri Solomin) of the Russian army being on an expedition. He encounters the nomadic Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) from the Nanai people. This \"Western\" being of the modern nature, there grows a friendship between the newcomer and the traditional inhabitant based on mutual respect.For Arsenyev the wilderness is dangerous and in the city (in this film Chabarovsk) he is at home. For Dersu Uzala it turns out to be the other way around. When he is forced by old age to live in the house of his friend Arsenyev he is, despite the enjoyed hospitality, deeply unhappy. At last he decides to return to the forest, which by now is also dangerous for him.\"Dersu Uzala\" has beautiful landscape imagery. Like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962, David Lean) this can only be fully enjoyed on the big screen. Unfortunately I have never been able to see \"Dersu Uzala\" in a movie theatre.",

They remain companions through several expeditions and Arseniev owes his life to Dersu, whose understanding of nature and the elements saves them both on more than one occasion.Kurosawa plays the familiar theme of the struggle of man against the implacability of nature beautifully. The narrative may sometimes meander, but Dersu is brilliantly played by Maksim Munzuk, who portrays the lonely and fiercely independent hunter as tender and humorous, and Kurosawa misses no opportunity to indulge in long, sweeping takes of the breathtaking scenery.

Released in 1975, it was made at a time when the Japanese film industry was beginning to discover that children's movies were cheaper and easier to produce, thanks to the low-cost of animation and a less discerning audience ensuring a reasonable return on the studios' investment. The studios, concerned only with profit and not the artistic merit of films, could no longer justify the bloated costs of Kurosawa's epics. This signaled the beginning of the end for the Tokyo film industry, which once rivaled Hollywood and Paris in terms of innovation and quality, and eventually changed the Japanese aesthetic to kawaii (cutesy). Kurosawa would later depend upon foreign patrons to finance his films, such as George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg. And in the case of \"Dersu Uzala,\" the Soviet Union.The film is based on the 1923 travelogue, \"Dersu the Trapper\" by V.K. Arseniev, which explains why it doesn't follow a conventional story line. The story is basically broken into three parts. The first part is an account of Arseniev's exploration of the Ussuri basin in the Russian Far East. He and his men encounter a Nanai trapper named Dersu Uzala, and commission him to be their guide. At first Dersu is like a magical woodland spirit. Speaking awkward Russian, his world-view is considered quaint to the Soviets, but engenders him with a brand of common sense he needs to survive in the wilderness. Dersu saves Arseniev's life several times.The second part of the story picks up a few years later when Arseniev is making another survey of the Ussuri basin. He runs into Dersu again by chance, and again hires him to be his guide. Dersu is growing older now, and is becoming too senile to survive on his own in the wilderness. Here he relies on Arseniev to save him. Where Dersu came off as the stereotypical \"noble savage\" in the first part, he now seems more fallible and human.The third and final part is a fish-out-of-water story, as Dersu, believing the wilderness has grown hostile to him, moves to the city to live with Arseniev's family.While something of an oddball in Kurosawa's catalog, the film still has the director's distinctive style. Kurosawa uses his characteristic long takes, in which he leaves the camera stationary and allows the acting to dictate where the viewers' eyes should look.\"Dersu Uzala\" is not just beautiful for its cinematography, but also for its touching human relationships. Arseniev and Dersu come from two different worlds, and they will never be able to fully understand each other. However, they find friendship in each other despite their differences.Unfortunately the U.S.S.R. allowed 20 minutes to be cut out of this 141- minute epic for the Italian release without consulting Kurosawa, which turned off the director from ever making a film outside Japan again.While certainly not Kurosawa's best film, this sweet, but unusual tale is worthy of the director's better-known classics.",

Anyway, I think that if George Lucas really was inspired by Kurosawa's masterpiece, it is perfect, because the Star wars story is one of my favourites ever!

I can't give any better summaries of what's so magnificent about the filming and Kurosawa's genius than the other fan's comments have indicated. But where so many other of Kurosawa's films are about fighting and wars (like \"Ran\") -- this film has more of a lyric or pastoral quality to many scenes. If I ran the world -- if you've every played that game with your friends or with your kids -- if I ran the world, every great filmmaker, or novelist, would be required to write at least one film (or novel) about a person from another culture or another religion who inspired them, or taught them something unforgettable about the mysterious nature of life.

Basically, set in 1902, an army of Russian soldiers are on an expedition and under the command of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin) they are assigned to explore Siberia, and as they trek through the forests they meet Goldi (Nanai) hunter Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk). Captain Arseniev becomes good friends with Dersu Uzala and he is invited to become the guide for the explorers to tread through the forest to Khanka Lake, and as they continue their journey the Captain finds his new friend has a beautiful soul. One time the two friends are caught in open space where the temperature will drop dramatically, and they only have a field of straw that they can cut down and use to make shelter, and after they survive this the hunter says goodbye to move on. Five years pass, and the army are assigned to head for the Ussuri River for another expedition, and Captain Arseniev is happy to meet up with Dersu Uzala again in the forest, and he once again joins them to become guide for the group, but he is much older and his eyesight has become problematic. The Captain invites the hunter to Khabarovsk City to live with his family so they can look after him for a while, but the old man finds it very difficult to adapt to an urban lifestyle, so he returns to life in the forest,l and as a parting gift he gives his friend a new weapon, a rifle. Five years later in Korfovska\u00efa the body of a man has been brought in and Captain Arseniev is called to identify it, they only have a calling card as any indication of his identity, they are sure it may be Dersu Uzala, he confirms it is and that he must have been killed for the weapon. Also starring Aleksandr Pyatkov as Olenin, Vladimir Kremena as Turtwigin, Suimenkul Chokmorov as Jan Bao, Svetlana Danilchenko as Anna Arseniev and Dmitri Korshikov as Vova. Solomin gives a nice gentle performance as the leader of the small army group, but Munzuk almost steals the show with his wonderfully wise and charismatic performance as the wild hunter who has great knowledge for survival techniques, I can sort of agree that there are shots where we are looking at something for a period of time, like a field, snowy places or forest trees, but I think these moments are interesting besides the action sequences and whatever, I found it a great poetic period drama.

            "content": "Yes, it sounds corny, but \"Dersu Uzala\" is (to me) really a love story as well as one of friendship; I cannot think of a more complete, platonic love between two friends. Just think of the scene in which Dersu and the \"Capitan\" spy one another through the dense woods, reunited after years, and rush towards one another, shouting each other's names. It was a giddy moment, and tearful.As much as these two very different men bond, they remain different. Though Arseniev is changed dramatically by Dersu's influence (as are his men, to some extent), Dersu remains pretty much the same. He is organic, part of his wild environment, as much as the trees, rivers or animals. His inner thoughts, though partly understood by Arseniev, remain largely a mystery to the sensitive Captain. In some ways, I think the latter likes this better than knowing all about Dersu, as if he ever could.Much has been made of the stunning scenery and Kurosawa's \"lingering\" way of filming it, which was so perfect. There were also very intense scenes, in which the two men were pitted against the very active forces of nature, such as a snowstorm and a raging river, not to mention the mysterious and symbolic tiger that stalks them. Add to all that the humor that bubbles up regularly, from both men, usually in surprise at the odd way the other does things, and you have a very dynamic film, despite its apparent tranquility. One of my favorite scenes is the Christmas encampment, in which the men have decorated a tree with various things like tin cans, forks and even chunks of ice. It signifies the turning point, especially for Dersu. At first it is comical, but this is also when he becomes obsessed with the tiger's \"ghost\".I can't imagine anyone finding the pace of this film \"slow\"; it is just right. Any faster and we would have \"The Edge\" instead (which makes me wonder if some of that was inspired by \"Dersu Uzala\"). Not that the latter film was bad--I actually like it quiet a bit--but it is no \"Dersu Uzala\"; few films ARE.-SPOILER- I agree with the person who wrote that Dersu's death seems appropriate; for, once his sight was almost gone, how could he live in his natural environment? And he could not handle modern, city life. It was the only way out for him, though quite sad. To me, it symbolized the death of the old hunter-gatherer culture across the world, and the \"triumph\" of industrialization. Even Arseniev, despite his respect for Dersu, makes no attempt to change his modern lifestyle to go live in the wild. He is content to be part of the 20th Century.The fact that the two men bond so deeply WITHOUT becoming like one another or trying to imitate each other to any great extent, is what makes this a love story, I think, and a tragic one. They know that they can never live in one another's worlds for long, try as they may.Some have compared Dersu Uzala to Yoda, but I think the old man would laugh at this. Unlike Yoda, he did not seem to see himself as particularly special, which was part of his charm. He reminds me more of Jeremiah Johnson or later, Lt. Dunbar, or better yet, Kicking Bird in \"Dances with Wolves\". He craves simplicity and merely living off the land, not wisdom, nor even enlightenment, as Westerners see it. Perhaps that's because he already has it.",

            "content": "The photography is good, occasionally terrific even, and the casting is impeccable, especially of the title character. The relationship between the two guys, who are very likable, seems genuine and not overly sentimental. It's a breath of fresh air to occasionally get away from American movies and watch something different.Now to the negative side. As is typical with many non-American or non-British movies, everything moves too slowly often. The early parts of both sections (1902 and 1907) have scenes that are simply dull. Americans have understood and learned early on that a movie cannot be told in \"real time\" or anywhere close to it. Only relevant moments/scenes should be in the final cut. Story-telling in a movie cannot be like that in a novel, not even close. Kurosawa is nowhere nearly the kind of pretentious, almost useless director like Bergman, but he does make some of the same mistakes. Who wants to watch a group of soldiers walk for 3 minutes without any dialogue or anything at all relevant occurring? This kind of slow-paced tool can be justified only when it serves to build up suspense or when the scene is extraordinarily beautiful (see Kubrick).Send me an e-mail, Orphy, I cannot answer your brilliant message on this site...",

            "content": "Kurosawa's genius has been fully outlined all over the IMDB so let me just add a few quips about this seldom discussed film.  First and foremost, one of the best nature films ever shot in 70mm and second, a refreshing handling of cosmotheism without grandstanding.  The creation and development of the character Dersu Uzala was stunning and Maksim Munzuk's portrayal brilliant.That being said, one point of contention.  For the wily Captain Vladimir Arseniev to lock Dersu down in the hell of a 20th century city simply because he needed glasses, bothered me when I saw this film fifteen years ago, and it stills bothers me today.  Oh sure, many would say chiding Kurosawa about that is like bringing up slaves and Jefferson but by God even Leo X used glasses to improve his hunting in the 16th Century!  Surly there was one affordable pair of spectacles in Eastern Russia in 1907.  Couldn't the tiger have ripped his leg off instead?",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's only non-Japanese film presents the revered filmmaker journeying to Soviet Union to fully realise one of his passion projects. Set in early 1900s Siberia, the story of Dersu Uzala covers the journey of two men from different backgrounds who meet during a surveying expedition and forge a close bond while battling the elemental forces in the midst of the harsh frontier.Also co-written by Kurosawa, the film is about man, nature, friendship & clashing of different lifestyles and addresses it through the exploits of its dual characters. Kurosawa offers ample space for their relationship to breathe & blossom and films the Russian far east wilderness in awe-inspiring detail. Shot in 70mm, the photography is absolutely spellbinding to look at and effortlessly enraptures the senses.The picture however lacks the gripping quality of the director's best-known works and unfolds at too relaxed a pace which in turn makes its 144 mins runtime feel overlong. While the drama is far from tedious, the slow patches & occasional stillness do bother at times. Yury Solomin & Maxim Munzuk play the Russian explorer & titular trapper respectively with sincerity and their bonding not only feels genuine but also earned.Overall, Dersu Uzala is another diligently crafted feature from the Japanese auteur and is as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking. Its emotional grip on viewers may vary but the technical craftsmanship on display remains impressive throughout. A gorgeous addition to Kurosawa's rich & resonant body of work, this Soviet-Japanese production may pale in comparison to his greatest efforts but it is nonetheless worthy of a broader viewership.",
