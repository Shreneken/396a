Well, she's in it, and she makes the most of a thoroughly unchallenging role, but unless you're a total completist, that shouldn't be enough of a reason to waste even 80 minutes of your life on this appalling waste of talent.What the writer/directors seem to have missed is that if you're going to parody or satirise a scene from a decent movie, you actually have to add something. It's not sufficient to just throw a bunch of stolen scenes together in the hope that the conjunction will generate humour by itself. I honestly could not see one - not ONE - original thought or idea or line in the script or direction. That in itself is something of an achievement. The whole thing plays like it was scripted by teenagers, and not teenagers from the top end of the grade curve.In fact, I have to wonder if this films is deliberately aimed at the lowest common denominator. If so, it missed by several yards to the south.",

            "review_title": "Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low, you get \"Date Movie.\"",
            "content": "\"Date Movie\" is a movie that spoofs romantic comedies. The movie follows Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) as she goes through all the events that take place in order to marry her prince Grant (Adam Campbell). This process involves meeting the parents, breaking up, meeting the ex-girlfriend, planning the wedding and everything else that the romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. Laughs are supposed to ensue\u0085 Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes \"Date Movie,\" a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. \"Date Movie\" is by far the worst pile of crap I have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made.This movie contained zero laughs, none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. It was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn't think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn't have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.There really isn't a positive thing I can say about this movie. The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. Why spoof comedies? Comedies are already funny so why spoof them? This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing \"Date Movie\" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted. While \"Date Movie\" only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including Bridget Jones's Diary, Kill Bill, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, Napoleon Dynamite, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, The Bachelor, Meet the Parents, Sleepless in Seattle, Rize, King Kong, Wedding Planner and so many more. You would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. You just sit there staring at the screen, losing your brain cells, and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage.I guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it's not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying \"from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\" but there is always that small part of me that says it can't be as bad as it looks but in this case it's worse than it looks. It's a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny I am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature.This movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. If I ever meet Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap I will demand that they give me my $6.75 back for paying to see this movie. These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like \"Date Movie.\" There should be a law in Hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.So to sum it up, \"Date Movie\" sucks, plain and simple. Even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn't walk off the set after the first day of shooting. Why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like \"Date Movie\" I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out. This is the worst film to come out of Hollywood in years even worse than \"Gigli,\" \"Batman and Robin\" and \"You Got Served.\" MovieManMenzel's final rating for \"Date Movie\" is a 0 out of ten. This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie.",

I, like most other people who have seen it, chuckled a few times. The rare laughs were part genuine enjoyment and part trying to make the best of a horrible situation. On the whole, though, 98% of this movie is just mind-numbingly bad. And not just because it has a lot of toilet humor and fat person jokes. The worst parts of the movie are the ones that are not only devoid of humor, but they just flat out are so stupid they don't make sense. I've never had an experience where I've sat through an hour and a half film and felt like I was watching a bunch of two minute clips of stupidity that had almost nothing to do with each other. It was almost surreal how horrible this movie was. Please, do not go see it. You're welcome.",

I'm not sure how a movie so god-awful can make it to screen, but my faith in the system has been shaken. The film isn't funny, I'm not sure if it tries to be or not, but it's not. It references other movies (Meet the Parents, When Harry met Sally etc.) but doesn't really spoof them. This was the biggest problem I believe, as it doesn't have any semblance of flow or sense. Random scenes pop up, trying to get a laugh by basically reenacting the scene, not exaggerating it or making fun of it. I managed to sit through House of the Dead, but this film actually made me angry it was so unfunny. Please skip it, have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it. If they don't knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself.",

            "content": "This movie is one of the most horrible experiences of my life. With once having sat through twelve hours of constipation, I have yet to sit through a dump that was more excruciatingly painful than watching this two hour film. The worst part is it isn't even two hours, it's eighty minutes, but it makes you feel like you must have aged four or five years through this. I feel they must have added in Sophie Monk and Carmen Electra not because of their amazing acting talent, but because they felt the humor was so poor they needed to wake people up from this painfully dumb movie. The audience's reaction to the film provided more laughs than the actual movie itself. I can't decide whether I find it comical or depressing that this film managed to parody movie scenes and make them worse. Truly, the people saying these writers aren't talented are wrong, it takes an art to be able to make something this bad. The movie is a complete non sequiter too. In one scene, after the family has toasted at the rehearsal wedding dinner table, Lil' Jon comes in and says, \"What? Yeah. Okay.\" and that's the punch line. Seriously, Hotel Rwanda was funnier than this movie. The film also contains tons of gross out humor, with a man coughing up a hairball, a woman with a hairy back, and a cat humping a corpse. Real clever guys. This is the kind of stuff that makes angels cry, and kills orphan babies. I would've walked out of this monstrosity had it not been for me hoping that maybe, just maybe, it might be slightly enjoyable than the previous torturous minutes. I mean you know something is wrong when the funniest part of a movie is a cat crapping into a toilet. This film is only really a mess of parodies thrown together that don't make any sense. I really have to say it's as witty as it gets when Frodo delivers a swift kick to the nads of Gandolf, and he screams, \"My precious!\" Finally, the ending seemed to have been thrown in to make an attempt to give the male audience a boner so maybe the wouldn't come out of the theater asking for a gun. No, the worst travesty is not that I spent $6.75 on this movie, but that I will never be the same person I was before. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. Don't go see this under any circumstances. If your significant other wants to see this, fake your death. Anyway you can get out of this movie is truly a blessing.P.S. My cellphone started ringing during the movie. Why, oh why didn't I pick it up? Seriously, man eating on the phone would have been more entertaining than this movie.",

So why was this one so bad? I can't really explain.. I saw all the movies they parodied, and still.. it just wasn't funny. I am absolutely in love with Alyson Hannigan. She's a very beautifal and very talented actress. Eddie Griffin is one of the funniest comedians to grace the silver screen in years. And please, Lil' Jon is in the movie! What's not to like? Well, the fact that basically, a lot of the parodies were just word for word retellings of some of the movies. The dinner scene was an ENTIRE ripoff of the Meet the Parents scene to a t. This movie tries too hard to be funny, and at sometimes its okay (the Pimp My Ride scene comes to mind), but honestly.. it just tries too hard and doesn't go anywhere.

The toilet humor (literally) was simply retarded, and a few jokes almost worked... if they were funny.

The story is about Julia Jones a lonely girl who just wants the perfect romance but her father wants hr to marry a Chinese-German Jew or something like that. She then meets the love of her life and all is well until his ex fianc\u00e9e comes into the picture. I recommend this film over Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans for it is funny and direct but they still can not get away from thinking that dancing from famous characters is really funny.

            "content": "I have enjoyed the Scary Movie parodies to varying extents, finding in each installment at least a few laugh out loud moments. Date Movie provided two\u0085 maybe three light chuckles. That was it.The best they could come up with for a clever tag line in the poster art was \"From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie.\" Uh\u0085 okay. Well, why'd you keep these two? It was honestly like they didn't even try. I could write a better parody than this and, since I'm not a good enough writer to be hired by a studio, I just have to assume that the writers are capable of better.There was nothing original. They were drawing such a creative blank that they spent a good five minutes having the camera watch a hand-puppet cat squirm around on a toilet seat. They interspersed fart sounds and quick shots of facial expressions from the stars. Oh yeah, that made it better.A good parody will take the existing content it is lampooning, and present it in a humorous way by providing ironic twists. Here they simply made sets, costumes and situations similar enough for you to recognize the source material and then either laid vulgarities or toilet humor on top of it. There's no thought in that. Just pitiful.Comedy of this nature almost always demands a straight man. In silly parodies, the straight man is often the least absurd of the various characters. In the Scary Movie series, star Anna Faris carried this role well. She's not up to a Leslie Nielsen standard yet, but she's getting better with each installment. Her delivery, her deadpan, her timing are all very nice. In Date Movie, Alyson Hannigan cannot do this at all. She used a total of two facial expressions to convey her character's reaction to each situation. It just became annoying.I think Hannigan has proved herself to be a charming actress, not without talent. So I'll assume that the problem here was the two writers. Hopefully they'll now go join the other four.",

            "content": "\"I didn't think it would be that bad,\" Mr. Shade remarked as we walked out of the theater, despondent over the fact that 80 minutes of our lives were wasted and there was nothing we could do about it. \"I'd say that's the worst parody I've ever seen,\" he continued.I couldn't agree more. And I like parodies. When they're funny. Unlike \"Date Movie,\" a film whose severe lack of humor suggests that the script couldn't have taken much more than an hour to write. I understand that it can be hard to write good comedy, but at least put forth an effort. I'm sorry, but was I supposed to laugh when Alyson Hannigan popped a huge zit on her face and the force of the \"stuff\" coming out catapulted her through a wall? That's funny? No, no it isn't.Like I said, it's hard enough to write good comedy. And yes, I sincerely believe that \"stupid\" comedy CAN be funny, so don't even bother claiming I'm just some snobby reviewer who can't appreciate stupid humor. Believe me, I can - I enjoyed \"Scary Movie 3\" for goodness' sake! But it's even harder to cleverly satirize movies that are funny in the first place. Perhaps it's just a special brand of talent that can take funny scenes from existing movies and make them completely unfunny. Congratulations writers! If that was your goal then you succeeded.I don't know; maybe it's me. I guess I should blame the fact that nowadays my comedic standards call for something more than a cat having sex with a human corpse. I didn't realize anybody on earth would find that humorous, but it looks like I was wrong. And I suppose I've gotten to the point in my life where extended scenes involving a cat with diarrhea just don't put a smile on my face.I was also under the impression that the \"I'll have what he's having\" joke had run its course, but the writers of \"Date Movie\" have proved that no joke is too old or tired for them. Nor will anything stop them from dragging a scene out way beyond an acceptable length. Oh look, Eddie Griffin's face just slid up and down Fred Willard's hairy chest and Eddie pulled a hairball out of his mouth, and it only took him two or three extremely unfunny minutes to get to the big \"payoff.\" Wow, talk about funny. Ha. Ha. My gut just busted. I better see a doctor.A girl sticks a cherry stem in her mouth and pulls out a carousel, and I'm supposed to laugh? Hardy har har. Uh-oh, it's shock value time! They're talking about a vaginal thermometer that has been in the family for generations and how for good luck it can't be washed. Please, try not to hurt yourself from laughing too hard. These guys are pushin' the envelope and walkin' the edge! As gross and ridiculous as all that is, the worst is when some old woman is having a romantic dinner with a fake cat and later makes out with it. Uh-huh. That's high quality stuff right there ... IF YOU HAVE THE IQ OF KEVIN FEDERLINE! Sheesh. Are you getting the picture? If you're reading this and thinking, \"Man, all that sounds hilarious!\" then I weep for our future. But if you're sitting there with a look of disgust because you can't believe that somebody greenlighted a budget for this tripe then you know to avoid this like Paris Hilton with the plague, and you give me hope.Mrs. Shade had to stay at work late, but she quickly headed straight from work to the theater, arriving just in time for the screening. After the movie, she grimaced and said, \"I rushed over here for this?\" I can't fault her anger. At least she didn't have to pay to see the movie. Just imagine if you go to the trouble to drive to the theater AND shell out at least $8 a ticket. Please, learn from our painful experience. Avoid it.If you have even the slightest inkling that you might want to see this then grab a bottle of White-Out and vanquish those thoughts right now. You've been warned; don't treat this carelessly.As always, I'm Johnny Betts, and I'm watching bad movies so that you don't have to. Don't let my efforts be in vain. Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to read a book in the hopes of recovering some lost brain cells.",

I feel sincerely that the director and writers should be extremely proud of taking on such a difficult topic with such aplomb, to say nothing of the fantastic cast, who breathe rich life into such well rounded characters.But really, the star of this piece is Jinxers. For too long have felines been forced to live in the shadow of their canine cousins. Often portrayed as ruthless, evil creatures hellbent on world domination. Finally, thanks to a shrewd script we witness the true side of the cat world. Intelligence, creativity and sexual prowess.To say that the feline defecation scene exemplifies cinematic art at it's finest would be an understatement. Creatively shot, it carefully depicts the skill and mental ability that cats bring to this world. With deft scripting we are able to witness a side of the feline not previously shown on celluloid. For too long have bigots trodden the cat name into the ground with falsehoods about litter boxes and small piles of faeces in the gardens of fellow neighbours. Finally the truth is revealed.At a time when Oscar nominations are going to such hacks as Robert De Niro, Jinxers executes his role perfectly. With subtle movement and flare he conveys the emotional trauma of cat crappery. People have dared to suggest to me that Jinxers is, in fact, animatronic. How offensive. Such a skilled performance could only be accomplished by such a fine thespian and people should miss his work at their peril.This movie is an unrequited masterpiece and I am appalled that this ever shallow world of low brows and Daniel Day Lewises more people are unable to recognise such fine artistry.",

The film is packed with disgusting images that would make any decent human being sick to his or her stomach. From the cat humping a nearly mummified corpse to Eddie Griffin spitting out a mammoth hairball in slow motion, the humor in this movie is downright distasteful. Sure, everyone needs a dumb comedy to laugh at once in a while, but there is nothing funny about the family cat raping Grandma's freeze-dried remains.There are several moments in this movie that could be funny were they not dramatically overdone. For instance, when the cat is sitting on the toilet with diarrhea for two whole minutes. It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end. Even more so is the opening sequence when Alyson Hannigan is dancing through the street in a fat-suit. No offense\u0097I'm a bit on the heavy side myself\u0097but no one wants to see a soaking wet obese woman dancing on her hands and knees. In the dinner scene, Adam Campbell's orgasmic and continuous shouts of \"YES!\" are awkward to watch. Judah Friedlander plays Nicky, a fat slob covered from head to toe in grease stains who states one of the most disgusting lines of the film, \"When I think about the honeymoon my sac gets all tingly and s--t.\" That's just nasty. Carmen Electra's parody of Paris Hilton's car washing commercial for the Hardee's thick burger is sickening and it is shown in at least four flashbacks throughout the film. It's simply overkill.To its credit, this film does have some key elements that most audiences enjoy in a movie. Boy meets girl, boy thinks girl is beautiful, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl face obstacles in their relationship, boy and girl overcome said obstacles, and they all live happily ever after. Sadly, this film could have been something enjoyable, but it instead we are faced with this warped piece of trash that only the most sick and uncouth can laugh at. This is a movie that will mean absolutely nothing to future generations (if it even exists to them at all). Yes, it had potential, but it turned out to be something repulsive.Really, Date Movie doesn't deserve the attention it's getting from me writing this review. I'm trying to impress upon all movie-goers what a saddening waste of time this film is. I heard warnings from friends, critics, and fellow movie buffs, but like an idiot I watched it anyway.

I know it's a paradox, but that is the only genre it is actually applied to. I was surprised to see the average rating of all newer parody stuff on IMDb: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Vampires Suck, etc. They all have 2.something average rating and it's mostly because people are not well informed on the whole concept of this genre.For a parody to be successful, it has to take elements from real life and/or movies/other media that are seemingly serious, but cheesy, little overrated, over the top, inaccurate, ignorant, full of prejudice... etc. So, the good mocking of this just HAS to go a bit further to make the vague inaccuracies more obvious and laughable. I think that this movie succeeded in that. Everything that is bad or over the top is INTENDED to be so, hence, planned and I like it.Alyson Hannigan and Adam Campbell have good chemistry and acting skills and I enjoyed their performances very much. Adam is an underrated actor and he needs more recognition overall. Also, the cast is full of talented parody performers, like Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin and Tony Cox.For anyone who doesn't particularly find romantic comedies good, and considers them cheesy and overrated, this is the film. It's particular 'victims' are precisely romantic comedies, mostly My Best Friend's Wedding, Meet the Fockers, Wedding Planner, Hitch, Bridget Jones' Diary, My Big Fat Greek Wedding and most wedding films.Alyson Hanigan's character is named Julia Jones, parody of Bridget Jones and Julia Roberts, and Adam Campbell plays Grant Fockyourdaughter, parody of Hugh Grant and Fockers. Sophie Monk's character is parody of Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and typical 'bitch' characters, Tony Cox is Hitch, Julia's family is mostly parody of My Big Fat Greek Wedding family with all national prejudice in it. All the characters are hilarious and deliver their puns on time. I was laughing all the time, it's so on spot about all romantic clich\u00e9s. The moment at the end, with all the most cheesy love declarations ever is my favorite, I can't restrain from laughing hard at that point.Also the films contains Jinxters, the most disgusting cat you just have to LOVE! Let's just mention he doesn't restrain from gerentophilia and necrophilia. His scenes are so disgustingly nauseous, but one of the funniest ever! I will probably never get tired of watching this and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good laughter and mocking romantic clich\u00e9s.It's 9/10 in everything it was supposed to be no matter what critic say!",

            "content": "I really dislike the \"Scary Movie\" series, and since this is same group of idiots, I assumed I'd hate this film, too. But despite the fact I wanted to hate it, and despite the fact it really was awful, I still feel fairly entertained. And best of all, the film was really short (roughly 73 minutes).The bad: The is film is nothing more than 50 other movies (mostly romances or chick flicks) strung together in a very exaggerated way. So if you are looking for something unique, this is the last place you want to check. The acting is also rather poor, and the soundtrack seems to be just Kelis and the Pussycat Dolls repeated over and over. I would not take a date to see this \"date movie\" unless she was 12, but then I'd have bigger problems than this movie.The good: I sadly must admit I enjoyed the cat using the toilet. At first it was stupid, but they stretched the scene way beyond the time necessary. Sometimes when you repeat a bad joke long enough it becomes great. For me, this was that moment. Also, this film featured two of my three favorite Buffy actors. Alyson Hannigan was beautiful and fun, and less obscene than in the \"American Pie\" movies. And Tom Lenk shows up in a cameo appearance as Frodo Baggins, a scene that makes no sense with the rest of the movie but I found to be juxtapositionally hilarious. If only this film also had Michelle Trachtenberg.The ugly: The disgusting parts were actually much less than in the Scary Movie series. Other than pimple joke, I think the only really gross thing was the way this film portrayed fat people. A fat joke here or there I can understand, but they stretched the jokes to the limit with this movie and it was rather nauseating.Don't rent this movie. Although if you like the stupidity that passes for humor these days, this might be up your alley. Heck, I deplore this film and still confess I laughed out loud at least twice. But don't tell anyone I said that, because this movie is not good.",

What I got was this piece of crap that was a complete waste of an hour and a half and my 6.50. What's the problem? Oh where to begin...first of all, the plot is stupid. It's simple enough, I guess, but there's so many random things that just don't make sense (the random weird flashbacks during the Kill Bill sequence, for one). I don't know if it's just that the parody genre is being stretched so thin that there isn't anything left anymore, or if this movie was just bad writing. The acting isn't terrible, though some is cringe worthy. I think they tried so hard for going over the top that the jokes turn out disgusting, offensive, gratuitous, and just plain not funny. Nearly every sequence with \"Jinxers\", the Jones family cat, are horrid and disgusting. Nearly 98% of the jokes I had to tell my sister I would explain to her when she was older. And to complete it all, I was in a theater full of teenage boys, and not one of them laughed once, which goes to show how much the film falls on its face. The only time the audience gave a half-hearted chuckle was during the Mr. and Mrs. Smith sequence. So save yourself the time and money. Skip this absolute zero.",

            "content": "When \"Airplane!\" came out in late 1980, it set the standard for the spoof movie, a motion picture that parodies a whole genre of others. In \"Airplane's\" case, it was the disaster film. It made fun of the Airport pictures, as well as \"The Posidon Adventure,\" \"Earthquake,\" and \"The High and the Mighty,\" among others.This comedy was followed in quick succession by \"Spaceballs,\" \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (which satirized sci-fi movies), the \"Naked Gun\" films, \"Spy Hard,\" \"Mafia\" and \"Repossessed\" (all with Leslie Nielson), \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It,\" \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights,\" \"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon I\", and the 'Scary Movie\" series.Many of these had their own special charm, although none has lived up to the dumb-but-hilarious high mark set by Airplane! (although Nielson's \"Naked Gun\" trio, based on the short-lived 1982 TV show, \"Police Squad!,\" probably came the closest).The newest effort, however, \"Date Movie\" (a send-up of all of those romantic stories we love to hate), attempts to do to those tales what Dick Cheney did to Harry Whittington's face, pepper it with shotgun pellets without hitting anything vital.Making fun of such modern work as \"King Kong,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" \"Kill Bill,\" \"Meet The Parents,\" \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"The Wedding Planner,\" \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,\" \"Hitch,\" \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" and a whole slew of the hip black comedies seemingly being released every week. All much better movies than this one satirizing them.And while the scattergun approach has worked before, the multiple targets aimed at by \"Date Movie\" remain unscathed and the audience, for the most part, remains unmoved (by laughter, anyway).I tried my best just to smirk at some of the \"jokes\" here, but I could not even force myself. I've actually been to funnier executions. This movie makes France's Reign Of Terror seem like an episode of \"Rocky & Bullwinkle.\" I've gotten bigger laughs with MY jokes, and my jokes stink.I think you get my point.The plot (what there is of it) has one of the most untalented individuals ever to appear before a camera (including Al Gore), Adam Campbell as Grant Fonckyerdodder (get it?!), a nebbish idiot who is wooing Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan, \"American Wedding,\" as well as a host of bad TV shows) and the supposed comic misadventures they go through meeting his folks, Jennifer and Fred (Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard, both veterans of the much funnier films, \"Waiting For Guffman,\" \"Best Of Show\" and \"A Mighty Wind\").Grant's beautiful ex-girlfriend, Andy (Sophie Monk), however, wants him back.Other embarrassed clowns passing themselves off as celebrities appear in this travesty, wondering around like doomed souls on the deck of the HMS Lusitania just before a German torpedo smashed into her cargo of illegal armaments. These include the poor man's Wayne Brady, Eddie Griffin (he played the pimp in the \"Deuce Bigalow\" pictures, so you get an idea of what I'm talking about), Carmen Electra, Michael Brooks, Matt Austin and Michael Jackson impersonator, Edward Moss and, oh, who cares?It really doesn't matter one iota, anyway, you know.With Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Scary Movie\") sharing writing and directing chores (much like Loeb and Leopold shared in the killing of Bobby Franks \u0096 in fact, even Clarence Darrow wouldn't defend these directors), this will go down as nothing but a dull series of parodies that fails to parodize anything and does not even remotely approach the town of Humor.It just stops at Tedium, spends about 90 minutes (although it seems much longer) and ends. To be fair, I guess seeing a cat on the toilet, King Kong groping Electra or Griffin as a midget pimp (is that the only character this goof-ball can play?!) might make one laugh. Probably the same people who sneak into locker rooms to sniff gym socks or those who voted for Al Sharpton, but not anyone else.",

A nebbish (Campbell) is courting a sweet young gal (Hannigan, who should know better). But his best-est friend is a fem,ale and a knockout (Monk) who also happens to be a former girlfriend. She intends to spoil their marriage plans and win him back. A slew of familiar faces play various parents, other relatives and friends. Eddie Griffin is along for the ride, and he is singularly unfunny in this. Somehow, I don't think it was his fault. Let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn: When Hannigan first meets her beau's best-est buddy, Monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her too-tiny bikini and even pole-dancing with the shower. This is all done in slow-mo and seems to go on on forever. Hanigan even comments on it. Through it all, we keep cutting back to Campbell and Hanigan for reacti0n shots, but they are all too obviously staring at the camera and not at Monk, who clearly filmed her sultry scenes separately. If this is supposed to be funny, it isn't. And when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, Monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isn't funny or arousing or anything. You just want the damned sequence to end. Please pass this stinker by.",

People, trust me, this is a big miss movie that needs no viewing and that the makers should be ashamed of. Hollywood, you're getting too pathetic. To all the people who are reading comments just to see if this movie is a winner, trust the unfortunate fools who actually paid to see this flick, you might gouge your eyes out with a fork or loose all faith in Hollywood after witnessing this horrible mess they call a film.1/10",

In fact, although not totally spoofing My Best Friend's Wedding, The Bachelor, The Wedding Crashers, There's something about Mary, Meet the Parents, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Bachelor, this film almost replicates and parodies these films. It does so, with some good humor, some over the top moments, and no subtlety. But that doesn't make this a bad movie.The two leads are good - and there are interesting moments. The film's fault is that it tries too hard to be funny and can become irritating in its frantic bid to have laughs at any cost.That bing said, I do not think this is a bad film as such.

What does \"Lord of the Rings\" have to do with romantic comedies?Here comes a spoiler you must read, to spare yourself of the torture: Referencing the line from \"Meet the Parents\" \"I once milked a cat\", the father in law says \"can you milk these?\" and shows him his eight nipples. The horror, the horror!There were actually dramatic scenes throughout that had some room for puns, or any other joke. And they just added stupid pop-culture references. Who gives a damn about Michael Jackson?Just for the record, the awful scene with the cat taking a crap could have been at least watchable if it hadn't lasted it's full 10 minutes.Alyson Hannigan can actually act very well in the dramatic parts. The actors are not actually bad, they just made terrible career decisions when saying yes to this piece of crap movie.Damn you, Seltzer and Friedberg. You're hacks! You're inhuman!

Because of this, I put it on my queue for Netflix as I have an insane desire to see the very worst films of all time in addition to the best. I've already seen all of the films in Harry Medved's \"The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time\" and I am trying to see all of IMDb's as well...though a few simply are not available in the States or do not have English captions. So was \"Date Movie\" terrible? Well, like all these rotten parody films (such as \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Epic Movie\"), it is designed to appeal to teenagers and I cannot imagine adults enjoying it in any way. In fact, I really think most teens wouldn't enjoy it...mostly just the stupid ones.The film sends up films like \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"Hitch\", \"Meet the Parents\", \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" and a variety of other romantic films as well as the TV show \"The Bachelor\". A few of the jokes are funny...most are just gross and stupid. If you like fat jokes, folks beating up hobos and really, really crude jokes (such as about cats relieving themselves and anal sex references)...you'll like the movie.Overall, the film was about as bad as I expected....without any sort of redeeming value...unless you are REALLY drunk or extraordinarily stupid. And, I must admit that while I enjoy watching a dumb film from time to time, these sorts of things are pretty much impossible for me to enjoy or want to see twice...they're not just dumb but artless, brainless and will rot your mind.",

After all of that time, my friend looked over at me. I looked at him and knew we were thinking the same thing. He was the first to say it: \"Dude, this movie sucks.\"Well, I can tell that the makers of this movie were really trying to get something funny out of spoofing movies that WERE ALREADY FUNNY. Instead, they throw together some scenes that spoof those movies, add some nasty toilet humor and fat jokes, some sexual innuendo, some hot chicks, and some almost complete recreations of the scenes from movies they were spoofing and try to sell it off as funny. Well, sorry, filmmakers, but this isn't how you handle a movie. first of all, there is absolutely no attempt to connect these scenes by story. They just spoof a scene, move on, spoof a scene, move on, spoof a scene, move on... It is so annoyingly brain numbing (and have I mentioned not funny?) that after wards you will literally want to forget you ever saw it from the great pain it left in your head.Unless you are a fan of ridiculously dragged-out jokes, scene after scene of disgusting bodily function humor, bad acting (even from good actors like Alyson Hannigan), and comedy movies that aren't funny, don't see Date Movie.

With this kind of film, you really have to go down to the lowest form of intelligence you can ever be and fervently wish that the filmmakers had at least given you a justification of spending your money by an honestly funny script. It's one heck of a chore.Julia Jones (Alysson Hannigan) is an obese waiter at a Greek restaurant who meets his Prince Charming in Grant Funkyerdoder (Adam Campbell). She consults date doctor Hitch (Tony Cox), who transforms her into a proverbial swan. But before they can officially tie the knot, they have to go through a series of unfunny jokes that supposedly parody different scenes from \"Meet the Parents\" to \"My Best Friend's Wedding.\"The characters are totally impossible to identify with although it would be unfair to pin down the blame to any of the actors, as the script just doesn't really stand out with most jokes falling flat. Not one laugh comes across as funny because the jokes are so simplistic. Besides, writers and directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (yes, \"two of the six\" writers of \"Scary Movie\") don't seem to have any grasp of the importance of timing in creating a comedy nor do they pace the film in such a way that makes it an effective parody of the genre it spoofs.In the end, watching this film feels like you're trapped in a restaurant with some annoying loser who talks all evening thinking s/he's funny, and you wish you were at home instead, doing something - anything - else.",

For a reason unknown I thought about an original story about a fat girl who finds happiness or something like that. However, the fat girl was replaced with a thin girl, paired with a boy and a collection of unrelated idiotic scenes followed.The supposed meaning behind these unrelated scenes was a parody of scenes from all well known American date movies. The problem is that date movies are often referred to as \"romantic comedies\" and you really can't make a comedy being a parody of a comedy. Funny turned into \"funnier\" results in RETARDED and romantic/erotic element made into \"funny\" becomes GROSS.The cross-references to popular date movies are possible to grasp only if you remember a particular scene from this or that comedy. There is no parody of the style or genre, but only situations and gestures are copied from scenes from other movies and put in a different context or more precisely, into non-context. Every scene seems more pointless and less funny than another. Even if you are not a demanding viewer, in a mood for something silly, enjoying toilet humor and soft porn from time to time you may not be able to watch the whole of it. In my opinion to switch it off during a cat's attempt at sexual activity with a dried human corpse is already a few scenes too far. The question remains: when would YOU switch it off?",

The remainder of the cast whilst possibly talented had so little to work with they would fire their agents if they ever see this trash. I saw this movie because it was free (like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session).

Is that too much to ask for a comedy these days ?The premisce of Date movie is not bad in and of itself, as making fun of the self-aware and sometime pretentious \"Romantic Comedies\" shouldn't be too difficult. So where did DM go wrong ? Pretty much everywhere.First, it seldom relies on the foundation of any movie, also known as a script. DM pushes the spoof concept so far that it does not have -any- decent narrative structure. It's like the script writers took their favorite moments in a dozen different comedies and patched them out together in one hell of a mess that some people might call \"a movie\".Among the scenes copied, you will find Jinxer and the toilet flush from \"Meet the parents\", Jinxer and the Urn from \"Meet the parents\", The football match from \"Meet the Fockers\" (they did their best to remind people of famous Ben Stiller movies apparently) mixed with the basket ball scene from \"Along came Poly\" (in one of the few scenes that tore out a smile out of me), The Greek restaurant scene from \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", The Diary from \"Bridget's Jones Diary\", The Black dad from \"Something about Mary\" (they indeed are big on Stiller), The scene about \"he lost his virginity with the Maid\" from \"Meet the Fockers\" but with a gay twist, The old lady from \"Not another teen movie\" (you know they are desperate when they try to spoof a movie that was already a spoof) etc ...In that mess, they threw a bad copy of Napoleon Dynamite \"Gosh !\", a remake of the Paris Hilton Video, A scene from King Kong, a totally out of place jab at \"The Lord of the Rings\", and various other \"winks\" at the audience that make that mess feel even less coherent if it was at all possible.It is not only bad that they try (pitifully) to make fun of actually funny comedies (like \"Wedding Crashers\") doing it so bad it becomes un-funny, on top of that they go as far as possible in Sleazy and disgusting to keep their PG-13, to be able to (or so they thought) please their male teenage audience.At the end, we have a sorry mumbo jumbo of scenes, that I cannot in good conscience call a movie.Actors are OK, with Mrs Hannigan being really good very often.

That's how it was presented in the movie previews. Now viewers know the proud creators of those past movies aren't batting a thousand. The \"Band Camp,\" girl (American Pie movies) was the lead actor(Allyson Hannigan as Julia Jones). She was working with a script that went nowhere. If she has the talent to be a lead actor, it didn't show or save this movie.Date Movie is rated 14A in Canada: It's contents are suitable for those over age 14. Ironically, Date Movie would only appeal to people that are tweens & young teens. The laughter in the theatre came from giggly girls, & boys who's voices haven't changed yet. They were too young to \"get,\" anything like a cherry stem in the mouth. Go to this movie if you have not paid enough $$$ to see these topics: vomit, farts, coughing up of hairballs, and diarrhea.

Stretch out each \"joke,\" for 1.73 years, and you've got Date Movie.Even more disturbingly, was the outright intention to make viewers laugh at the lead actor's character. Physically harmful events happened to \"Julia,\" while the young audience roared with laughter. Being made fun of, jeered at, mocked, dangerous tools used on her body to alter it, being told how ugly you are, mistreated, and disrespected on all levels. Moms and Dads, that's what your kid laughed at this opening weekend.The movie incorporated parodies of major movies & celebrity events of the past year.

I'm not a PC person, but this movie went overboard in trying to offend various groups of people. The plot was simple; some of the scenes were downright gross.So many of the characters were stereotyped, others' characters were too far exaggerated, to the point of being caricatures. It might have worked once, maybe twice, but the writers tried this on a continuous basis, and it became gross-overload. We gave it about half-an hour, then gave up on it. It may have improved after that, but I really doubt it.I recommend this movie to anyone 16 or under; if you are below the age of 16, you will probably love it and laugh all the way through. If you are an adult, however, don't waste your money.",

This film at least has a consistent plot and there are entertaining moments.The comedy is still very silly, juvenile and does contain its typical gross toilet humor (the cat toilet gag went on a little too long).It isn't like Epic movie or Disaster movie (their worst film) where it completely fails at being funny and tries too hard in throwing a gag every second.At least Alyson Hannigan is likeable. The film's runtime is quite short. Nothing too funny (as expected) but it isn't nearly as bad as critics or some of these reviews claim.",

The story line was complete crap, and changed around a lot, I didn't know who was trying to impress who. The parodies were just silly and none of them were funny at all. They didn't even make sense. The Michael Jackson thing was stupid. They already made fun of him in SM 3. I just think the whole movie was a rush job and the plot was put together in about three hours by a few high college kids who had no idea what they were doing. American Pie was much better, but still anybody who has anything to do with this movie has committed an unforgivable sin. The only reason I saw this movie was because there was nothing else except The Pink Panther, and god knows how that would have turned out. Anyway, never ever ever ever ever see this movie if you have a choice. If your girlfriend wants to see it, smack her and dump her. If your friend wants to see it, smack him in the face with a rusty pipe and tell him never to talk to you again. If your wife wants to see it, take off your ring and shove it down her throat.

I like some romantic comedies but most of them are just a bunch of annoying clich\u00e9s so I was glad to hear about Date Movie. Unfortunately, the spoofs aren't creative at all. The film just recreates popular movie scenes without really adding anything special to them. A few of the jokes were funny while most of them were just stupid.The blame should got to the writers who weren't trying very hard. Scary Movie did contain some lame material and it seemed like Date Movie copied all that lame material and put into one film. They made the most obvious spoofs without much creativity. I was hoping the preview wouldn't be an indication of what was to come but it portrayed the film perfectly so I can't same the advertising fooled me.The acting was okay and there were a few funny performances. Alyson Hannigan was pretty pale and dull. She had a few funny lines but for the most part, her performance was pretty un-notable. Adam Campbell was okay, nothing special. Jennifer Coolidge was hilarious as Roz. She was defiantly the film's strongest point. Eddie Griffin was sadly underused and he didn't seem to be having a lot of fun either. The rest of the performances were all forgettable and they aren't worth mentioning. While Date Movie is a bust, it's also pretty harmless and it wasn't a complete waste of time. I really hate using that line but it's the best compliment I can give the film. In the end, the movie doesn't even warrant a rental, just skip it. Rating 3/10",

It's absolutely disgusting and it has no plot. It's a bunch of 3 minute gags all thrown together with the same characters.

I loathed Disaster Movie, Epic Movie was pretty much the same and while not as bad as the former two Meet the Spartans was pretty poor too. While mostly very unfunny, Date Movie is the best of these spoof movies, mainly because there are one or two decent gags and the fact Alyson Hannigan's in it. The focus is on romantic comedy, and admittedly spotting the references to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents and When Harry Met Sally is occasionally fun, the latter was one of the better gags as well as the stunt on the motorcycle, but the scenes where they featured in were in general very overplayed. Also there are some very cheap laughs, a scene involving a diarrhoea-afflicted cat hardly is going to spark any wit or imagination now is it? The plot line is on the lame and predictable side, and the direction is next to non-existent. The acting isn't as atrocious as it was in Disaster Movie, which was a perfect example of how NOT to act in a movie, but a majority of it was lifeless. I like Alyson Hannigan, I confess when I was 11 I was addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and still am, and I think she was trying her best with superficial material. It is just that newcomer Adam Campbell is extremely unexciting as her new boyfriend, and Carmen Electra shows visibly here that she can't act. The remainder of the acting is unexceptional.

            "content": "\"Date Movie\" is one really messed up movie spoof. Set against the backdrop of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" the film incorporates references to \"Hitch,\" \"Meet the Fockers,\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" along with TV hits like \"The Bachelor\" and \"Pimp My Ride\" to create a montage of really cheap, unoriginal and remarkably unfunny comedy sketches that are fused together in a way that is sad and predictable.Alyson Hannigan stars as Julia Jones, who starts out as a calorically challenged yet remarkably spry daughter of an African American father, an Indian mother, and a Japanese sister. Ironically it is in this form that Julia meets blond Briton Grant Fonckyerdoder (Adam Campbell), who is astonishingly attracted to her even though taxi drivers, firemen, construction workers and all sorts of others on the street have rejected her. This is ironic because after knocking him out with a coffee pot (you really do need to see it to fully disbelieve it), she fails to see he's on the ground, and in desperation she goes to see 'Hitch the Matchmaker' (Tony Cox) to get pimped out and so on.The cheap gags in this movie in themselves are enough to make you want to gag- from the absolutely stupid depiction of the cat on the toilet dealing with explosive bowel movements, to the sheer ridicule dished out at the expense of people who are fat, gay or have lots of body hair. Indeed, its so over the top that it actually works against the intended humor of the movie by the sheer nature of its primitive predictability.There are so many spoofs on DVD and video right now that work so much better- including the first \"Scary Movie,\" \"Airplane,\" \"The Naked Gun\" and so on. If you really must go to the theater to see this strictly amateur effort, make sure you pack a barf bag...because no doubt you'll be doing more dry heaving than laughing!",

            "content": "In the trailers and previews for this movie, they advertise \"From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\". They clearly could have used the other 4. Date Movie is a movie where once you get thinking about the concept, you realize there's no way it can actually work, mostly because it's trying to make fun of movies that were funny in the first place. The movie ended up being more clich\u00e9d than the movies was making fun of, recycling jokes like those of Lil Jon, Pimp My Ride, and the now-tired Napoleon Dynamite impressions. The movie references fall flat every time because they're presented so blatantly. While most parody movies may take a notable line and put a twist to it or in some cases copy the line, Date Movie's approach seems to be to rip out entire scenes from movies, add some lame punchline, and expect you to laugh like they thought of it all themselves and you haven't just seen a scene from a different film for the second time.When I saw/sat through the movie in the theater, sitting behind me were three girls who seemed to be talking the whole time. This was the first time I absolutely didn't care that people were talking through the movie, and what I also noticed was that they kept predicting what was going to happen, which usually turned out to be true. This speaks quite a bit for the film, which was so resiliently predictable. So overall, this film was just really awful. No one over the age of 12 should find this very funny at all, and in the rare cases where they land a joke that's actually funny or clever, they keep pushing it until they've drawn every last bit of life from it. And of course, there is the glaring lack of any originality. To say only two people wrote this movie is giving an unfair share of credit. I think the writers for Meet the Parents/Fockers, Along Came Polly, etc. are owed some royalties.",

It just fails on so many levels. Where NATM plays on the sappiness and idiocy of so many teen movies in sometimes dumb but usually successful ways, Date Movie just says \"Hey, remember this scene from that movie ten years ago? Isn't it cool that we're parodying it? Do you get the reference? DO YOU GET IT?\" and continues on with it. There's not one thing I can remember I liked about this movie, and I wasn't the only one. Honestly I didn't go in expecting much - I was just with my friends, and they thought it would be really funny and I didn't feel like seeing something else by myself.

Suffice to say, you did not obtain that elusive second date, and thankfully this parody-fuelled nightmare did not receive a sequel.Spoofs can be funny when intelligently incorporated into a story that do not rely on profanity and obtuse humour.

Jennifer Lopez is parodied in this, as is Michael Jackson. No idea why, they just are.At this point in time, nothing makes sense. Hilarity is non-existent. Vulgarity is everything.

            "content": "Much negative criticism has fallen upon 20th Century Fox's Date Movie, let me be one of the few who actually enjoyed the movie. The movie is about Julia Jones(Alyson Hannigan), an obese woman who wants to win over a young man named Grant Funkyerdaugther(Adam Campbell), whom she meets in the caf\u00e9 she works in. The movie is short but just long enough to keep you entertained, aside from the cute romance storyline lies an ocean of romantic movie spoofs, but that's not all, even kung fu movies aren't safe and lots of other movies are referenced such as Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, King Kong, Kill Bill,Lord of the Rings, Napolean Dynamite, Star Wars and others. One scene which is to die for, is when Julia and Grant are talking to a marriage counselor spoofing the notorious scene from Mr and Mrs Smith and here lies one of the great aspects of this movie, they actually made that scene better and much funnier. The movie never really drags and it's soundtrack is OK. There are some problems,however, some jokes are weak, you will notice them. I for one, can't understand what are the Scary Movie script-writer's fixation with Michael Jackson jokes. This was kinda of OK in Scary Movie 3, but in Scary Movie 4 is just wasn't funny, the same could be said in Date Movie(OK, enough we get it already, there's no need to rehash the same gags over and over again). Most actors give an OK performance, Adam Campbell overacts a bit and Allison is acting almost like a stripped down version of her American Pie character, but still funny. Tony Cox is OK as a midget parody of Will Smith's Hitch, Sophie Monk is also eye-candy and provide some laughs as Julia's rival, Fred Willard and Eddie Griffin have an OK chemistry, obviously poking fun at Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman's characters in Meet the Fockers. But anyway for those who love silly parodies(I mean Julia and Grant meet, date and marry all within a week) will likely enjoy this movie, if you're unsure you can always rent.",

            "content": "First off, some questions: Does watching a cat having sex with a corpse work as funny? No. Does watching a cat while excreting work as funny? No. Does eating someone's chest hair in slow motion, then spitting it as a hairball work as funny? No. Does seeing one shot for about 4 consecutive times, while Kill Bill's parody, work as funny? No. Does Eddie Griffin's ugly and freaky make up work as funny? No. Rather do Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg make good parodies with a material that anyhow works? Well, the answer for this question in specific isn't No. It's: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!Believe it or not, Date Movie is a smart movie in its core. Hollywood's romantic comedies have turned into one very predictable movie, being played continually with slight changes here and there. So, when the saturation happens, the interest decreases, the sarcasm increases, and so the parody is born. Seltzer and Friedberg, who have worked among many writers in the first Scary Movie in 2000, selected this subject for their first movie as independent dual, and that was about the only right thing they did. So why is that?Firstly, they choose \"comedies\" to parody?? The list contains: Meet the Parents (2000), The Wedding Planner (2001), My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), Meet the Fockers (2004), and else. Now how to spoof a comedy?! It's like eating an already eaten food! Then, they resorted to incredibly sick situations and jokes, which push you to puke, not laugh (masturbating old woman, licking pus????!!!!!!!!). And to make it worse, they put some toilet humor, and lengthen the basically unfunny gags (Jell-O dancing, the excreting cat). So, their movie ended up as promising comedy at heart, yet with emetic and cheap everything.The toilet humor used to be \"marginal\" part of the parody movie since its boom in the 1970s. But Seltzer and Friedberg came to make it \"essential\" during the 2000s. In fact, watching their solo movies exposes who were the ones responsible for the dirty stuff in the first Scary Movie. So, in their series of parodies, the idea of spoofing correlated with farting, feces, and the like; to an extent that makes any clever idea stray in the giant shadow of the toilet humor. This simply produced \"the dirty parody\", which is easy to write, mean to watch, and painful to remember, giving the parody movie its worst days ever!Truly this movie has a taste for the bad taste comedy. For instance: the cat excretes, in a long scene, then cut to the lunch scene?? How they dared to put eating food after THIS?! But the thing is, it even oversteps \"disgusting\" to \"creepy\". Still the scene of breaking the vase to see the decayed corpse of the mom shocks to the furthest limit. It belongs to a nasty horror movie, not a comedy. The moment of the cat having sex with the corpse later assures that Seltzer and Friedberg aren't super ridiculous only, but psychologically ill as well!Good points?! Well, I liked the \"Forever And Ever\" song. Despite being based on one of My Best Friend's Wedding moments, it was the sole inspired thing around. Aside from that, nothing was beautiful, rather human!Date movie is trivial stupid unfunny joke. However, compared to Seltzer and Friedberg's next movies; it's the most solid and creative to date. Now to a point that eats me; at one moment, the movie's heroine, played by Alyson Hannigan, says: \"as if I'm trapped in a bad Mel Gibson movie\", meaning What Women Want (2000). Ahhh, how impudent!! Because when Date Movie calls What Women Want \"bad\", then it's like George W. Bush calling Einstein dim-witted. At least, What Women Want had an original story, you morons!",

It drives me crazy because I HATE with a passion..spoof films especially the more recent ones (ie: the deplorable Scary Movie series, any spoof film Leslie Nielson did etc) They are beyond Spoof...they seem to have to be dirty, disgusting, and they force the spoofs down your throat and to a certain extent Date Movie does that for certain but it actually has an attainable story line with at least one decent actor. Date Movie still is not any huge work of art but I thought for sure it would rake in the millions and get acclaim from dim witted fans everywhere. I think maybe it didn't have enough jokes about toilets and bodily functions.Alyson Hannigan plays the lead as Julia Jones. Originally she is an enormous, misunderstood, and unloved girl who just wants to be a pastry chef and find the man of her dreams. After being \"pimped\" over by a rather different \"Hitch\" the date doctor, Julia finds her prince...only to have her romance thwarted by her own insecurity and a buxom blonde. Hannigan is terrific in the lead role. Comedy seems to come naturally to her and it's great to see her on the big screen (yes I was a big Buffy fan.) The role is very different from anything she did even on the American Pie films. Newcomer Adam Campbell plays her prince named Grant Fockyerdaughter and he does a good job and they are good together although his role is not really over the top comedy and fairly laid back so he never really gets to show off his stuff but nonetheless he's good. Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge are great as Grant's parents. They ham it up perfectly together. Eddie Griffin is also pretty good as Julia's father although this kind of slapstick gross out humor is usually his forte so nothing new for him. The story is actually kind of cute, a real romance amidst slapstick humor. They actually don't try to make the romance into a joke like most spoof films. Surprisingly the film was written and directed by two of the writers of the Scary Movie series, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer so already this is a huge step up for them from that utter crap-fest.The film is mercifully short (really short) so nothing ever gets to be too much really. The spoofs are really forced most of the time (The Lord of The Rings was practically jammed in there, as was Kill Bill, The Wedding Planner and a few others) and then there was some that were more subtle and humorous (My Best Friend's Wedding and Pretty Woman.) Date Movie was not really a laugh out loud movie...it was just tolerable and watchable which is okay by me. I didn't feel bored or disgusted or just plain brain dead when I was watching it and I think a big part of that is Alyson Hannigan who does a great job. For all the crappy reviews this one is getting on IMDb I must scratch my head and wonder why this was worse than any of the other stupid spoof movies out there that everyone loves. Scary Movie 4?? Kill me right now. Scary Movie 3 didn't deserve the popcorn I bought when I went to see it. I think Date Movie is tolerable and if you're not a fan of these films like I am and your friends wanna force you to see one...then let it be this one because it's at least watchable. The only toilet humor is the cat taking a crap and that's tolerable as well. I will warn you that 95% of the stuff you see in the trailer apparently never made it to the film and you won't see it so you'll be in for a surprise. Also the first scene poking fun at Napoleon Dynamite will certainly make you think you've made a grievous error but hang in there it gets better and her opening dance scene is without a doubt hilarious!! 7/10",

As many have pointed out, this movie does little more than re-create scenes from other movies. I expect SOME original material in a comedy. Endless copying of OTHER movies just doesn't cut it -- especially when you ADD nothing witty or satirical to the reference. To make matters worse, 'Date Movie' is also peppered with the most juvenile, witless \"gross-out\" humor I've seen in a long time. (SOME MIGHT CONSIDER THIS A SPOILER) The liposuction scene, ANYTHING with the cat, etc. When I saw this movie, the audience was doing more groaning than laughing.Any comedy -- even a low-grade \"satire\" like this -- still needs a coherent, logical storyline and some three-dimensional characters. This is just a bunch of repeated scenes from other movies with some junior high school-level gross-out humor thrown in. This thing barely ran an hour!This genre has been on the decline for a while, thanks to the 'Scary Movie' series and stuff like 'Not Another Teen Movie.' As far as I'm concerned, 'Date Movie' is the last nail in the coffin.Why did Alyson Hannigan do this?",

And of course the ultimate question: what is most boring, watching this movie or watching paint dry? Actually i guess pain might make some nice patterns or something while drying so...The truth here is that there are so many talentless people involved in this project. The two directors (also script-writers) Friedberg/Seltzer are responsible for the scripts to some real crap so i didn't expect much. But still the Scary Movie-franchise, boring as it may be, is still a lot better than this crap. This movie displays a complete ignorance as to what makes comedy work. Inane spoofs are mixed with plump jokes about fat people, sex and feces. Comedy on a low level can work but it needs to be done with a lot more style than here.Bad comedy is almost painful to watch, and this movie hurt. And when it didn't hurt it just produced a huge yawn. I'm still surprised that movies like this one actually get made and paid for by someone.",

Take it from me, folks, the best parts of this movie are the scenes used in the previews.This movie claims to be from 2 of the writers of Scary Movie, well I think they should have gotten the rest of the writers too; unless they were part of it and all but 2 bailed when they saw this ship sinking. Some of the highlights are: Jennifer Coolidge does a very accurate and funny Barbara Streisand, Tony Cox shows that he is the big man on campus when it comes to comedy, Meera Simhan is beautiful and funny, and Eddie Griffin was a trooper trying to put his best foot forward through a difficult situation. I got the feeling throughout the movie that Mr. Griffin was on auto pilot; not really acting or using his considerable talent but just coasting as if he knew the effort would be wasted. Wait until the movie comes out on DVD and then get drunk before watching it because that is the only way it will ever be funny. A thorough waste of 83 minutes of my life I can never get back.",

            "content": "When \"Airplane!\" came out in late 1980, it set the standard for the spoof movie, a motion picture that parodies a whole genre of others. In \"Airplane's\" case, it was the disaster film. It made fun of the Airport pictures, as well as \"The Posidon Adventure,\" \"Earthquake,\" and \"The High and the Mighty,\" among others.This comedy was followed in quick succession by \"Spaceballs,\" \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (which satirized sci-fi movies), the \"Naked Gun\" films, \"Spy Hard,\" \"Mafia\" and \"Repossessed\" (all with Leslie Nielson), \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It,\" \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights,\" \"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon I\", and the 'Scary Movie\" series.Many of these had their own special charm, although none has lived up to the dumb-but- hilarious high mark set by \"Airplane!\" (although Nielson's \"Naked Gun\" trio, based on the short-lived 1982 TV show, \"Police Squad!,\" probably came the closest).The newest effort, however, \"Date Movie\" (a send-up of all of those romantic stories we love to hate), attempts to do to those tales what Dick Cheney did to Harry Whittington's face, pepper it with shotgun pellets without hitting anything vital.This film attempts to make fun of such modern work as \"King Kong,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" \"Kill Bill,\" \"Meet The Parents,\" \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"The Wedding Planner,\" \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith,\" \"Hitch,\" \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" and a whole slew of the hip black comedies seemingly being released every week. Unfortunately, all of these are much better movies than this one satirizing them.And while the scattergun approach has worked before, the multiple targets aimed at by \"Date Movie\" remain unscathed and the audience, for the most part, remains unmoved (by laughter, anyway).I tried my best just to smirk at some of the \"jokes\" here, but I could not even force myself. I've actually been to funnier executions. This movie makes France's Reign Of Terror seem like an episode of \"Rocky & Bullwinkle.\" I've gotten bigger laughs with MY jokes, and my jokes stink.I think you get my point.The plot (what there is of it) has one of the most untalented individuals ever to appear before a camera (including Al Gore), Adam Campbell as Grant Fonckyerdodder (get it?!), a nebbish idiot who is wooing Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan, \"American Wedding,\" as well as a host of bad TV shows) and the supposed comic misadventures they go through meeting his folks, Jennifer and Fred (Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard, both veterans of the much funnier films, \"Waiting For Guffman,\" \"Best Of Show\" and \"A Mighty Wind\").Meanwhile, Grant's beautiful ex-girlfriend, Andy (Sophie Monk), wants him back.Other embarrassed clowns passing themselves off as celebrities appear in this travesty, wondering around like doomed souls on the deck of the HMS Lusitania just before a German torpedo smashed into her cargo of illegal armaments. These include the poor man's Wayne Brady, Eddie Griffin (he played the pimp in the \"Deuce Bigalow\" pictures, in fact,he plays a pimp in EVERY movie he's ever been in, so you get an idea of what I'm talking about), Carmen Electra, Michael Brooks, Matt Austin and Michael Jackson impersonator, Edward Moss and, oh, who cares?It really doesn't matter one iota, anyway, you know.With Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (\"Scary Movie\") sharing writing and directing chores (much like Loeb and Leopold shared in the killing of Bobby Franks \u2013 in fact, even Clarence Darrow wouldn't defend these directors), this will go down as nothing but a dull series of parodies that fails to parodize anything and does not even remotely approach the town of Humor.It just stops at Tedium, spends about 90 minutes (although it seems much longer) and ends. To be fair, I guess seeing a cat on the toilet, King Kong groping Electra or Griffin as a midget pimp (is that the only character this goof-ball can play?!) might make one laugh. Probably the same people who sneak into locker rooms to sniff gym socks or those who voted for Al Sharpton, but not anyone else.",

Some of the scenes referencing other movies last maybe a .5 second. It's like they tried to cram as many movies into this thing as they could. Rather than going for quality they went for quantity, and some of the attempted spoofs are just downright stupid, and not in a funny way. None of the group that I watched it with enjoyed it.

I don't get it, i'm normally the sort of guy that switches his brain off and can enjoy a stupid giggle, and sure thats what date movie gave me, the odd giggle ... + plus one laugh out loud moment, but that simply was not enough to save this film.The film really has a hard time pieces everything it is spoofing into the same story line - therefore resulting in failed jokes or just unnecessary ones. Most noticeably was the whole \" My best friend wedding\" spoofs. Another aspect that hurt the film was that it felt rushed, really rushed like they just slapped everything together in a couple of months.The Acting itself was in no great shape, I will say this tho..hats off to Allison for giving a very bad script some meaning, she did the best with the material she had and i can't help but smile every time she's on screen. The supporting cast was a little bleak, but they tried.So is Date movie worth it?... Well for me it poorly wasn't, but hey thats me, if your interested in a good 1hr 30mins of stupid giggles with the odd laugh out loud moment then i say go for it.

It's main purpose is to set up scenarios from certain movies just for the purpose of \u0085I'm not quite sure because humor certainly isn't the reason.One problem with the film is that its core demographic, those who would enjoy lame scatological humor, are teens and a number of the films spoofed are before their time.

The only downside to this review, is this is coming from a 16 year old. But all that aside, I surprisingly enjoyed this movie. It only looks stupid from what little previews that they chose, because all the real humor in the movie is about a good 25 minutes into the film.This movie is a parody of most of the date movies we've come to know and love, although there are some other movies that couldn't be really classified as date movie material, such as a scene playing parody to Kill Bill. It was clever, but the joke died real quick.This film is about a girl (Allyson Hannigan from the American Pie films) plays the main character, Julia (A play on the name Julia Roberts, the goddess of date movies of the 80's.) Who is large, not beautiful, and scares every man she sees, it even results in the death of a construction worker early in the film. She is unlucky that no one loves her, and believes that true love will never come her way, Au Contraire, for this is a Date Movie, Her Father (A bizarre twist, African American Actor Eddie Griffin) has planned out a lover, Richie (Judah Freelander), but doesn't want to date her, so she still feels left out, but that changes when she meets Grant, (Adam Campbell, the character, Hugh Grant, of course) who loves her, but then, she assumes he's ran away after seeing her face, After an EXTREME MAKEOVER on Julia, she's thin, beautiful, and still looking for love, she goes on a reality dating show, and she is chosen by Grant.From there, Julia's father doesn't agree with the new fianc\u00e9e, but his parents welcome up to the family quickly, (Grant's Parents, played by Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge, in a parody of Meet the Fockers) The chaos then ensues, and from there, you'll have to see to see it. True, is a schmaltzy romance comedy, but it's one I actually enjoy, It's not complete without the annoying reason why the two can't get married right away, as well as the embarrassing parents, and let's not forget the gay Puerto Rican character, which seems to be in most of today's romance films, but wait, there's more, there's also the musical number that is required by almost the whole cast to sing as some point.This movie's got it all, and then some more.

The real cameos did not work (Lil Jon or Carmen Electra). The fake ones are bad (Britney Spears, Barbara Streisand parody and Napoleon Dynamite parody. Sophia Bush is very attractive but that does not work either. Avoid this movie. It will go down as one of the worst theatrical releases ever made.It is on par with \"Freddy got Fingered\"",

She meets a young man (Adam Campbell) where they fall in love filled with gags that make you close your eyes and want to puke instead of laughing. Some scenes are also cruel like when Alyson and Adam's characters beat up a homeless man during a montage of \"Do You Believe in Magic\" that made me ashamed to watch this movie.Date Movie is too gross and cruel and I shame all those who watch this movie and their counterparts (Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, etc.).",

Now of course, my only reason for seeing the movie was that Alyson Hannigan was in it. I won't lie. But talk about wanting 1 1/2 hours of your life back. The movie barely had a plot, so it was just a bunch of unrelated, unfunny parodies, if you can call them that. I can take some crude humor, but this movie was just unnecessary. They really missed the mark in some scenes...someone should explain to them that a parody doesn't mean filming the SAME SCENE with different actors. There were a few snide remarks that made me chuckle, but everything about this movie made me remember why I don't like seeing the so-called mainstream movies. And the lead guy...not good looking. At all. If I'm going to be staring at some guy for 90 minutes, at least make it worth my while. So all in all, the jokes fall flat, and the movie really missed a chance to create something quite funny, since a parody of date movies, had it been done well, could have been hilarious. But this movie is far from that. You let me down, Alyson Hannigan. *Sigh* And another thing, it shouldn't be called Date Movie if it mocks every genre. Random Star Wars references and jokes about how advanced technology is stopped being funny...what, 5 years ago? I was hoping for something as on-the-mark as Not Another Teen Movie, but all I got was a big waste of time. Thank god it was free.",

            "content": "Some spoilers ahead.This movie does justice to humanity by mocking and spoofing the genre of romantic movies (I hesitate to call these tedious, sappy love stories \"romantic comedies\", as there's very little about them that is funny). It, like its successor films, \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\", is not very deft at spoofing specific films, and some of the parodies fall flat. This movie does succeed because it has competent, enthusiastic actors, and a coherent plot that includes the basics of what a romantic movie should have: conflict, a plucky lovelorn heroine, and a happy resolution, with all loose ends tied up. Allison Hannigan, of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" fame, is absolutely endearing, charming, and hilarious as the embattled protagonist, Julia. Adam Campbell, Sophie Monk, Eddie Griffin, and Jennifer Coolidge do their utmost to make this farce a success. It is because of them that this movie stays afloat, whereas lesser comedians would have tanked this film. Their talents, as well as their understanding that this is a farce that requires to be over-the-top, make this the most watchable romantic \"comedy\" ever.In spite of the superb acting in this movie, there are many gags that are awful. The \"Harry Met Sally\" gag is just too overlong and not funny in the least. Some of the \"Meet the Parent\" gags don't work. Ironically, it is the original story within the movie, rather than the parodies of any specific movie, that are the funniest parts of the movie. They balance out the poorly-written parody gags and somehow keep this comedy afloat. I recommend \"Date Movie\", especially to those who hate romantic movies or those who appreciate fine comedic acting in the same vein as a Mel Brooks or Zucker and Abrams film. \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\" are improvement, but \"Date Movie\" is still funny enough not to pass up.",

Its deeper than religion, deeper than self in most cases. So even though the movies are just as ludicrous, we don't grant it.Its easier to do when the joke is one that honors romance. The second \"Charlie's Angels\" was great fun in the segments that did this. But this movie is based on the \"Scary Movie\" template that has no respect for the sources.So you have to be ready to let them go. You have to be prepared to laugh not at the movie, but at yourself for every sweet emotion you had when watching the originals.If you can, you'll like this. I did. The jokes themselves aren't so funny. That doesn't matter. What matters is the relationship between the jokes and the original sources. You have to have seen a lot of movies, well over a hundred I guess, to get this. But the stuff comes so fast and is integrated so well, its great fun.Its sort of a reverse folding. The point of folded narrative is usually to get the viewer in the movie somehow so as to increase the effectiveness of the storytelling.

            "content": "From the folks who brought us Spy Hard (1996) and the Scary Movie horror spoof series (the first arrived in 2000), Date Movie is a spoof of modern romantic comedies. The flow of comedy material is similar to the Scary Movies. Roughly, from scene to scene, different films are spoofed, with a couple overarching spoofs acting as the vehicles, and the style of humor has an emphasis on absurdism and pushing-the-boundaries outrageousness. So if you've seen any of the Scary Movies, you should know what to expect here, and if you've enjoyed them and you have some familiarity with romantic comedies, you should enjoy this film also.I've seen the first three Scary Movies so far and I've loved all three. I also enjoyed Date Movie a lot. Anyone who knows me knows I love absurdist humor (well, and absurdist seriousness, too). I also like most of the cast here, and I've seen most of the rom-coms that serve as spoof material. You wouldn't need to be familiar with source material to find this funny, but I think it helps. I laughed aloud during most scenes, and I don't think my face was absent a smile very often. The spoofs are threaded together in a way that makes an amusing, crazy, rom-com like story. You could even find more intellectual themes and subtexts here, but that would be missing the point by a large margin. As Jerry Lewis once said on \"The Dick Cavett Show\", \"Sometimes a fat lady joke is just a fat lady joke\".What's perplexing to me is noting that as of this writing, Date Movie has a 2.7 average from 9,715 votes on IMDb and is currently number 67 on the Bottom 100 list. I can only guess that such a negative overall assessment will probably relax in the future, but what the heck are the complaints about the film? Are a lot of people really heading into a film like Date Movie not knowing what kind of humor to expect? Let me head off to some of the reviews to see what's going on . . .. . . Alright, I'm back. Well, the majority of negative criticism seems to fall under a couple categories. First, a few comments are complaining that the humor is \"crude\", \"disgusting\", etc. Similarly, some people seem to not care much for absurdist humor. It's fine to have those different tastes, but if those folks know that, why would they watch Date Movie (and especially pay for it at the theater or on DVD?) I guess those folks didn't know what to expect. They must have never seen one of the Scary Movies, or they're not aware enough to have realized that Date Movie would have the same kind of humor; there's hardly anything here that's more risqu\u00e9 or crazy than in the Scary Movies.For the second group of negative critics, a couple people seem to not have been able to follow the film. Also, a number of people seem to have been trying to read \"Date Movie\" as a legitimate rom-com rather than as a spoof of rom-coms. A couple people don't seem to understand the idea of a spoof very well. It's probably best if I refrain from commenting on these situations, as I wouldn't be able to say anything very pleasant about those folks' intellectual capabilities.The bottom line, like always, is to be familiar with your own tastes. Know what you tend to like and why. Then all you have to do is garner a couple basic facts about a film (such as its genre, who produced, wrote and directed it, etc., maybe a brief account of the premise, and so on), and you should be able to make an intelligent decision about what to watch so that you don't waste your time and money. Too many people seemed to have watched and reviewed Date Movie who weren't good candidates for the film. Of course, there were also some well written, well though-out reviews from people who disliked Date Movie and who were good candidates for it, but those are few and far between.As for me, I loved it, but I subtracted one point for the fact that it peters out in the end a bit. It doesn't help that this is a short film and feels it (the unrated version is only 85 minutes including about 10 minutes of credits). But otherwise, Date Movie is excellent for people who like this type of film.",

This film only tries to make the audience laugh and it does it. Some spoofs were funny, like Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Others were stupid, like Napoleon Dynamite. There is one joke to another. Some will make you laugh and some will make you think, \"Why did these people think this is funny?\" This film is good for many reasons. One is for Alyson Hannigan. She makes the film good. Another reason is that this is a new genre of spoofing. As to Airplane!, the characters don't act like they're funny, but in here, they try to act funny, which is kinda bad, if you ask me, but still, it's a new turn for spoof movies.If you just like to watch a dumb comedy, go watch this movie.

Hannigan, a proved farceur thanks to her work in the American PIE movies and the CBS series HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, plays Julia with sincerity and energy and Adam Campbell, who looks like David Spade and sounds like Hugh Grant, perfectly inhabits the role of Adam. There are also funny bits contributed along the way by Eddie Griffin, Fred Willard, Jennifer Collidge (in a dead-on spoof of Streisand in MEET THE FOCKERS), Sophie Monk, and Tony Cox.

Bad acting awful, jokes and disgusting at times it did not have any good parts and looked like a complete rush job. In all it is a disgrace. Most movies have enjoyable moments but this awful movie which wasn't worthy of 1 star. It should not be promoted or advertised and cinemas who allowed it to be shown should be feeling really guilty because there's plenty of good movies that never make it to mainstream cinemas. With the numbers of cinema go-Er's on the decline this movie will help that trend. This movie at no stage made any sense and was never funny and i pity anyone involved at any stage of the movie making process of this so called comedy.",

That movie had proper direction and some great jokes (and some hot exposure hehe) even though it specifically spoofed only Teen Movies.This movie had the wider canvas of all romantic comedies and even though this gave the movie more potential this also proved to be the movies undoing. This movie had no direction it chose to spoof almost any movie (such as kill bill and went of track a fatal mistake in spoofs) and spoofed movies that were not necessarily legendary. The spoofs were repetitive, to slapstick and focused to much on my best friends wedding.The acting was good (from the entire cast) given the limited premise of the movie but too much focus was given on Alyson who has no screen presence and is incapable of carrying a movie on her extra thin shoulders. She may have had some success in multi-star movies but she has neither the capabilities nor the charisma to be the star of a movie.The movie started of on a high not with the take on Shallow Hal and the opening scene was brilliant setting my expectations very high and making the disaster that followed all the more unbearable.The movie progressively got more and more stupid and after the 35th minute around where Sophie Monk manages to break up the marriage is where the movie becomes truly unbearable. The other half hour of the movie is hideous and you spend the entire time hoping this movie was over.The movie has its moments though such the hilarious opening sequence and the scene where the gorgeous Sophie Monk is introduced.Sophie Monk I daresay was the only saving grace in this movie with her spectacular looks and her hilarious take on Paris.This movie has a host of scattered moments throughout the movie they are few and far between you are probably better of watching the teasers or the 6 min movie (called the quickie) on the DVD.The songs in this movie were one thing that were well put to use and provided some relief when they were played.A few scenes such as the extended family dinner and the singing of say a prayer, the fake orgasm, and scenes involving the parents were absolutely unbearable.A movie that may have its moments provided you are able to leave all your senses aside but not even as funny as its teaser.Watch only if you are super lover of spoofs or if you want to torture yourself.+s short length, a few great scenes , good jokes but funnier in the teaser, Sophie monk -s no direction whatsoever, Alyson,s non-star abilities, misguiding unrated DVD, tooooo stupid in parts, TOTAL WASTE OF POTENTIAL.total 3.5/10",

Given that she was starring in this movie, along with Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Eddie Griffin I thought this would be sure fire. To put it simply this is the worst movie I have ever seen.The movie is a series of low level skits loosely tied together by a plot. Imagine if you will, sitting through a 90 minute series skits rejected by SNL or Mad TV. The scenes are only loosely associated with a plot.There is the obligiatory T&A and toilet humor you would expect in a spoof. None of it well done or even original. To call it sophomoric would be elevating it by an order of magnitude.As for the writing, if this was written by two of the 6 writers of Scary movie as the tag line suggests, we mus assume the other 4 writers had all of the talent. There are porn movies that are better written. I mean the cheap ones they sell in quick marts.After seeing this movie I felt like suing the studio to get my money back. Short of that I'll have to use a power drill to get the memory of it out of my head. Thats how bad this movie is.",

It also abuses many favorites, including the Ring trilogy and Napolean Dynamite (both of which should be thoroughly mocked until speaking of them puts you in a Village) and the Focker films, which combines with Big Fat Greek Wedding to serve as the running gags (including the cat).It is chaotic and sometimes seems to be going way off course, especially near the beginning, but it builds up to funnier scenes and everything ties in with the story, even if the continuity often fails.As with the American Pie films that have made Alyson Hannigan's film career until now, this is gross-out comedy. Sometimes so gross-out that it's impossible to believe. But it's hard not to appreciate the mocking of mediocre pimp films and studio crap like Mr. & Mrs. Smith.",

            "content": "A few years ago some people got the idea of making a spoof of horror movies by stringing some of the better known clich\u00e9s together in a kind of story (Scream) \u0096 well they didn't exactly think of the idea \u0096 it had been done for years better and on a tiny budget by the anti-establishment filmmakers Troma who parodied Hollywood relentlessly and achieved cult following. But the Scream series appeared to a certain crowd that enjoyed spotting takes on scenes from their favourite horror films delivered with Hollywood polish and comedy resulting from the similarities. They had a certain panache and were reasonably gripping at first, but by Scream 3 and Scary Movie 3, the device was wearing a bit thin. Some of the writers/directors/producers decided to milk it a bit further and try a parody of date movies but the formula doesn't appear to work very well for a number of reasons.Firstly the 'date' movies on which this film relies are mostly romantic comedies and contain reasonable humour and romantic tension, varying from superficial to award winning. Date Movie, on the other hand, is rarely funny, even when it is trying the 'joke that is so awful it's laughable' routine. As good parody, it loses any strength it might have had by making the films it imitates too obvious, even dressing and making up the actors to look like the stars. The resultant lack of subtlety means there is no satisfaction in guessing \u0096 it can only call on gross-out humour of the American Pie variety. The problem with this is that the extreme attempts at coarseness lose their impact early on for lack of story line and also that this type of extreme toilet humour probably repels the very audiences that went to see the original romantic comedies. Date Movie is anything but a date movie.It also pushes bad taste in a way that I struggled to justify. 'The Office' TV series parodied politically incorrect or obnoxious behaviour in a way that eventually made the viewer feel uncomfortable about it, achieving its aim with ingenious humour and a string of Baftas and Golden Globes; but Date Movie has none of the self-consciousness of The Office or even the Troma movies such as Tromeo and Juliet, Toxic Avenger or Terror Firmer. Even if the lampooning of overweight, ugly or midget people doesn't upset you, the callous scene where the happy couple play a romantic game of gleefully beat up a homeless man may raise your hackles to the point where you find it difficult to forgive the filmmakers (I had to search to find what this was supposedly parodying \u0096 apparently a direct to video DVD called 'Bumfights' that is one of the rare films banned these days by the BBFC.) I must admit that the following night, after consuming several pints of very strong lager, I was however laughing almost uncontrollably into my pint at the memory of blonde bombshell Sophie Monk doing a \"Don't you Wish Your Girlfriend Was Hot Like Me\" routine to upset the newly to-be-weds, but with that amount of alcohol probably even Chicken Little would have had me in stitches.A last dregs possibility for a drunken lads night out, Date Movie fails on most other levels, and hardly a movie to take your date on unless you are both very drunk, fed up with even good romantic comedies, and find each other's loud and uncontrolled rectal noises hilariously funny.",

I personally liked the scary movies and other films like not another teen movie (even though it was downright bad is several spots). The weekend of the release i went around and read several reviews stating how awful this movie was. Still, my friends planned on going to see it, so i joined them. I walked into the movie theater thinking that this may be a piece of utter crap. Was it? Well, yes and no. Before i go on, let me say this. If you have any decently or wit, stop reading right now. I will tell you that not only will you absolutely hate this movie, but you will despise everyone whose in it and every person in the theater who even let a soft chuckle leave their mouth. But if you found the scary movies funny, or any other crude comedies, there might be a chance you will find a laugh or two in this not-so-witty comedy. Sitting in the theater, i noticed that most kids were about my age, and I am 16. And during the movie (myself included) i was laughing, believe it or not. There are no surprises, there is no wit, and there is no standards in this film. If seeing a cat hump a dead body then pull out a pack of condoms makes you want to puke, then by all means, stay away from this film. And yes, i too found this in bad taste, which may be why i was sitting in my chair squirming and giggling at the same time. My two friends who i were with were also laughing at this movie. Many of the jokes fall flat, and some are outright disturbing to the point where you might want to leave the theater just to save the few brain cells you might have left. If you like stupid comedy (such as two people on a date beating up a homeless man for no reason) this is a film you'll want to check into. If not, then take heed to the critic's advice and don't touch this movie with a ten-foot pole. Should you run out now and chuck out 8 hard earned bucks for it? No, absolutely not. This is the movie to go see on a lazy Saturday at the dollar theater if at all. So pick away at me if you want and call me an immature teenager, but i did laugh at this movie during several places.And on a side note, the movie can also be looked at as some sort of a game. The parodies come by so fast, that it is sometimes fun to lean over to the person you are sitting with and try and guess which scene came from what movie. Also, these scenes that the writer's parody are usually the famous and recognizable ones. So, wait until this movie hits a cheaper theater, and watch the much better scary movie series (exculding number 2).",

I've heard horrible reviews about films I found enjoyable and vice versa, so relying on professional and/or amateur film reviewers is rarely the best way for me to gauge whether or not I want to see a flick.I knew that DATE MOVIE was directed by a couple of the guys who did the Scary MOVIE series', and my kids (17-year-olds, mind you) love them. I'd sat through the first Scary MOVIE and found it relatively funny at times, if a bit crude. But there was some care taken with the filming of it (the homage paid to THE EXORCIST was actually quite well done) so I thought maybe I'd find something similar here.No such luck....Like Scary MOVIE, DATE MOVIE takes its jabs at a film genre, only this time, instead of horror, it's romance movies of the past fifty years (all the way back to THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH which starred Marilyn Monroe). But, unlike Scary MOVIE, DATE MOVIE doesn't pay much homage in a very artistic or funny/flattering way to those wonderful films. The jokes are just thrown in \u0097 without rhyme or reason \u0097 and shot without regard for the surrounding environment (most teenagers probably won't give a flying whoopty-doo about that but others most certainly will). Bathroom humor rules the roost here as we see the infamous cat from MEET THE PARENTS taking a raucously loud dump in a toilet with full sound effects (yes, I did laugh here, but it was about the only place) and extremely, extremely, extremely forced sexual connotations are smeared in the audiences face by the beautiful Carmen Electra.Pulling skits from NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, JERRY MAGUIRE, and WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (among dozens of others), the film tried too hard to use the comedy it could've easily pulled off with a less heavy-handed effort. Alyson Hannigan, as the main character Julia Jones, gives the shallowest performance of her career. Adam Campbell as her love interest, Mr. Grant Funkyerdoder, was entertaining but obviously trying to make more out of the script than was possible.The supporting cast was equally terrible, unable to get any truly laugh-out-loud moments across to the audience.I think the race for Worst Film of the Year has officially begun.",

I didn't think it could get any worse than \"Scary Movie\", but was I sorely mistaken.I went to this movie thinking that it would be somewhat funny, but all I found were lines that had already been used, and overly exaggerated, gross out scenes. This is definitely a teen guy's movie. This movie isn't even worth renting, let alone buying.If the same producers hadn't used the same stupid lines for their other five bazillion movies, they might be somewhat funny.

            "content": "Well I have glanced through a few of the reviews and am astounded at the overwhelming negativity towards Date Movie. Yes its plot is extremely thin, yes it is nothing but a bunch of rather poorly done parodies of the more successful films over the last 20 years. But what I think you fail to understand is that is the point. It isn't supposed to be a cleverly made Oscar winning masterpiece, it is purely designed to give a few laughs. Now some of the scenes to be sure are more disgusting than funny (hairball), but many of the scenes do indeed have a lot of humour in them. The audience I attended the movie with laughed fairly constantly throughout and no wonder.I think it all comes down to a matter of taste in the end. Date Movie, like its predecessors of the Scary and Teen persona, follows the basic plot line of the genre it is spoofing very loosely, but with enough innovation to be enjoyable and the spoofs are in fact quite cleverly conceived. They aren't hilarious skits such as you would find in Flying High, but they are amusing enough and while it certainly helps to have seen the movies spoofed, most of the jokes are obvious enough to work on their own.In short, the film is funny as long as you don't go into it with high expectations. Not as good as its predecessors, but it still works. I won't be buying the DVD, but I'll be sure to watch it on TV one day. After all, it is in the end a cheap laugh and a good way to wind down of the evening.",

Well it's a romance and they tend to talk a lot and you do get bored when they don't add any jokes. Alyson Hannigan does a great job of here character. Data Movie totally rips Meet the Fockers which is hilarious because 50% of the jokes are inspired by Meet The Fockers. It's a shame so many people didn't like it. But worth a look, definitely.

Some may say the whole cat scene was way too long or over the top, but it was absolute comic gold. Just about every moment with Tony Cox was absolute gold, especially the first scene we meet him as the Hitch wannabe.

That movie was definitely \"The Shining,\" and no movie, comedy, horror, action, drama, whatever, will ever beat \"The Shining\" in my mind. But that's not the point. The point is that there were some very immature but funny jokes in the movie. There were also a lot of smaller, hidden movie references embedded in the larger ones, for example \"The Seven Year Itch\" where Julia is trying to seduce the firemen, \"Rear Window\" when Julia and Grant are in Jell-o's office, and \"Mean Girls\" where Julia grabs Andy's hair and throws her down the stairs. I really enjoyed the Kill Bill sequence, and the singing at the rehearsal dinner was also really funny. Everything (EXCEPT the hair sequence, really gross!) at Fonckyerdoder Isle was funny, especially because Jennifer Coolidge looks so much like Barbra Streisand here. One big problem: the trailer is pretty much the first four minutes of the movie, and it is pretty much the funniest part. But also I really liked the Mr Jones/Julia exchanges, they were pretty interesting and held the movie together (loosely). Rating: ***/*****",

Basically Julia Jones (American Pie's Alyson Hannigan) is a big girl writing in her diary about wanting to find her prince charming, and she finds English posh git Grant Fockyerdoder (Adam Campbell) in the caf\u00e9 she works in for her Dad, Frank Jones (Scary Movie 3's Eddie Griffin). Julia knows there was a momentary connection, but she wants to feel better about herself by getting love doctor Hitch (Tony Cox) to pimp her up to compete on a dating show with Grant looking for a fianc\u00e9e. They go for dinner and much more besides, but then it comes to the time to meet Julia's parents Frank and Linda (Meera Simhan), and of course Grant's parents the Fockyerdoder, Bernie (American Pie: The Wedding's Fred Willard) and Roz (American Pie's Jennifer Coolidge) before the wedding. Julia is shocked to find out though that Grant was engaged only three weeks ago to Andy (Click's Sophie Monk), and a quick electric shock to Julia confirms hearing her voice that she wants to steal Grant from her. In the end, after seeing the wedding planner, some squabbles and a near break-up, everything is settled, Julia and Grant are happily married in a big fat Greek style wedding. Featuring pathetic spoofs of recent (and some old) films and celebrities, including Rear Window (the lonely old neighbour falling for Jinx the cat), The Seven Year Itch (skirt blowing), An Affair to Remember (meeting on top of the Empire State Building), Fatal Attraction (sex in elevator), When Harry Met Sally (fake orgasm), The Lord of the Rings, Pretty Woman, Sleepless in Seattle, Dumb and Dumber (circular sander for toenails), The Nutty Professor (loads of flowers in room), Jerry Maguire (\"you had me at hello\"), My Best Friend's Wedding, Notting Girl (\"I'm just a girl standing in front of boy asking him to love her\"), Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers, Cast Away, The Wedding Planner, Bridget Jones's Diary, Shallow Hal, The Bachelor (reality show), How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Kill Bill Vol. 1, Along Came Polly (basketball sweat), Napoleon Dynamite, Pimp My Ride, Dodgeball, Hitch, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and King Kong.

I tried to sit through the entire movie, not wanting my money to go to waste, but about an hour in I realized that my money was already wasted, so I might as well not waste another 30 minutes of my life sitting here. The gags were unoriginal and unfunny. A character unknowingly hitting and knocking someone over was funny maybe the first few times it was ever used in a movie. But it's not anymore. Stop it. None of the humor was clever, it was basically just being as gross as possible within the boundaries of a PG-13 movie and passing it off as funny. Matt Stone and Trey Parker manage to effectively use gross out comedy, because there is a passiveness to it. When the characters have a more subtle reaction to the vulgarity of the action at hand it just works as funny. But when people use it, like the people in this movie, where the characters have huge reactions, it just comes off as trying way way to hard to be funny. I hated the movie, but at least my popcorn was nice and buttery. I give my popcorn 8.5 out of 10 and this movie 1 out of ten. I'd give the movie less if I could.",

Newly thin, she sees that this man truly loved her even though she was fat, and blah blah blah, you know the rest.The writer makes 29 references to other films (either by parody or flagrant ripping off design ideas or whatever), which might've been OK had they all been \"date movies.\" Then maybe the concept would've stuck a little more. Next, the tired gags of fat people being funny (the director ripped off the internet's well-known video of Kelis' \"Milkshake\" song added to a fat girl dancing), having Lil Jon in anything, boring callbacks to other films (such as having Napoleon Dynamite there to say \"Gosh\" about 10 times), the worst and most out-of-place reference to Michael Jackson baiting children for no reason, dumb gags about chicken wings being stuck in your teeth and gross physical comedy when Julia is fat, and other movies'/television show's jokes played out as if some of us maybe never heard or saw them (refer to the 2 BASEketball jokes about the over-sized underwear being in a dresser drawer and sucking fat out of a bag for food purposes) like the Pimp Your Ride parody was redone on the TV show Robot Chicken as Pimp My Sister (whereas in this film, they get Julia pimped out).The only time I sincerely laughed was at the absurd shotgun-shooting of the eliminated guests on the Bachelor to the tune of the Price is Right show-theme. Other than that, Julia as a main character was confusing (her personality was always upbeat but then whirl-winded around to being depressed and then back to joking around). I feel bad for Tony Cox, who plays as a shorter-than-normal Hitch (taking Will Smith's place from the original), because he gets these roles where his size is always the humor, never the writing; he was pretty good in Me, Myself, & Irene.This movie gets a 2. This movie makes me sad when I think about the \"talented people\" they got for a movie and then squandered their help with a lame script which could've benefited from fewer gags and more thought put into it. This one, I've decided, was a movie made for 10-year-olds who love dumb references one after the next to keep their ADD-ridden minds going like a sugar-high.",

I found \"Date Movie\" at times hard to watch, because it, perhaps more than \"Scary Movie\" and \"Not Another Teen Movie\" relies much more on other films, and spoofs far more, or so it seemed, films than its predecessors. At times it was difficult to watch because I was trying to work out where the scene was from, while paying attention to all that was going on. But it was fun nonetheless.The cast are certainly a mixed bunch. Alyson Hannigan deserves a lot of praise for her work here as she carries the film, not to mention having great hair. Adam Campbell is rather boring as Grant Funkyerdoder, but Jennifer Coolidge is terrific as his mother, Roz, and she spoofs Barbara Striesand so well. Eddie Griffin is okay, but sometimes annoying as Hannigan's character Julia Jones' father, Frank, yes, weird, he is black and she is white, well it gets weirder - her mother Linda, played by the fabulous Meera Simhan is Indian (and doesn't get nearly enough screen time), and her sister Betty, played by Marie Matiko is Asian, (and also doesn't get enough screen time).Tony Cox is okay as Hitch (spoofing Will Smith), while Valery Ortiz is awesome as Jell-O, spoofing Jennifer \"J-Lo\" Lopez and her \"Wedding Planner\" film - seriously she's probably the best spoof in the entire film! Sophie Monk from Australi's Bardot is hilarious as Andy. Also look out for Beverly Polcyn as the Old Cat Woman - some might remember her as Sadie (the Never Been Kissed old lady) from \"Not Another Teen Movie\".At times the film goes a bit over the top and can be very crude - like the whole thing with the cat, a spoof from \"Meet the Fockers\". Two of the best scenes by far would the opening dance scene to Kelis' \"Milkshake\" song, (though it is a bit disturbing too), and the singing scene at the wedding dinner, which is taken right out of \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", and is hilarious. There are heaps of references to \"date\" movies and actors that have worked in them, and also a sort-of out-of-place scene taken from \"Pimp My Ride\", which works well however.

Pretty much every joke is horribly unfunny, the acting (from decent actors such as tony cox, Alyson Hannigan, and Fred Willard, who have all starred in actual funny movies) was well not very good, you could tell some of the actors were bored out of their minds reading this utter garbage, and this movie was honestly really boring as hell. I didn't laugh once which made every (unfunny) scene painful to sit through. I hate to wonder how much worse Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans or their new crap fest Disaster Movie could be. I have a feeling it gets much much worse then this. I'm gonna be nice and give this a 2 rating as one joke did make me smirk which is why i'm going to give it a 2, sadly that joke came in during the first five minutes so I had to sit through another 70 minutes of bad comedy..",

The story is seriously lame, it just didn't work at all, it was like having your teeth being pulled out one-by-one. The acting was absolutely horrible except for Alyson Hannigan, which isn't saying much because she was the only one who could actually act. The characters are made to be dumb and stupid just for cheap laughs but failed. The 'jokes' and the 'funny' scenes were absolutely awful (maybe except for one or two scenes) and actually made you feel embarrassed for the actors who had to endure this heap of trash. The worst thing about the movie is the writing, how can anyone write something so bad? I didn't think it was possible! I wonder if the two of the six 'writers' of Scary Movie actually took part in Scary Movie because that was a hell of a lot funnier than this. Believe it or not, this is actually their best movie out of the four they've done on their own. I find it weird because I have a brilliant sense of humour, I can find something funny in the worst comedy movies but this was just not that funny.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",

I recommend watching this movie when it comes to television. Also, this movie is filled with adult sexual-related context and was surprising to see so many younger patrons there not understanding the sexual content. The actors were not too bad, however, the script really was just an attempt to gain cheap laughs and spoof classic movies. It was a disappointment to see this movie, in my opinion.",

            "content": "Anyone even remotely familiar with the quad-logy of Scary Movies will know the basic outline of the new film, Date Movie (Alyson Hannigan; American Wedding, 2003).Filled with spoofs from thirty plus comedic films, Date Movie tells the tale of Julie Jones (Hannigan) and her love, Grant Fonckyerdoder (Adam Campbell; \"Commando Nanny\" TV Series, 2004), as they try to have their Big Fat Greet Wedding. Prior, they must Meet The Parents; work out complications with The Wedding Planner; stop Grant's best friend Andy from ending her Best Friend's Wedding; while hoping for no Wedding Crashers.Co-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer put together a successful first movie. Both only previous work being writers of Scary Movie (2000), Scary Movie 2 (2001), and Scary Movie 3 (2003), debuted as directors with Date Movie.Evaluating the acting was simply predictable. Acting-wise, Hannigan was identical to her acting patterns from the American Pie films. Newcomer Campbell was a decent actor and has an accent that acts as his signature. Supporting acting, which was surprisingly well acted, came from Jennifer Coolidge (Legally Blonde, 2001), Eddie Griffin (Deuce Bigelow European Gigolo, 2005), and Fred Willard (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, 2004).This teenybopper flick was rated PG-13\u0097loosely. There was continuous crude and sexual humor, including language, throughout the entire film. This is obviously a movie given a low rating to attract more audiences.If you enjoyed any Scary Movie or any recent comedy, then Date Movie more than likely won't be a waste of 82 minutes. The shortness of this film utterly shocked me. I felt like I was in the theatre for literally 20 minutes.For a laugh-out-loud comedy with some friends or an uncomfortable-free date movie, this film will suit you. However, if you prefer an awkward first date flick, The Pink Panther, with that ill at ease combination of Steve Martin and Beyonc\u00e9, can almost certainly fulfill your peculiar necessity.",

King Kong, The Wedding Planner, Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, When Harry Met Sally, Kill Bill, Along Came Polly, Meet the Fockers, Meet the Parents, Bridget Jones' Diary, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Sleepless in Seattle, Say Anything, My Best Friend's Wedding, and others. It also included a spoof on the hit TV show, The Bachelor and a spoof on Paris Hilton's burger commercial and Jessica Simpson's car wash scene in her video, 'These Boots Are Made For Walking'. Basically they put too many spoofs in one to make something that should have been funny into something awful. And these are the people who wrote 'Scary Movie'. Perhaps spoofs on scary movies are funnier to do then spoofs on romantic ones.The one thing I'm thankful for is that I waited to see this movie at the $1.99 movie theater in my hometown. The ending was better though. the one scene I loved was the Britney Spears/ Kevin Federline scene, in which Britney says she made a mistake hooking up with a back up singer and Kevin saying, \"I got Britney Spears.

It was so awful because it was poorly constructed and written, it took no talent to take parts from other movies and changed it ever so slightly to make it 'funny'. It would have been funny to the writers when they've gone out and gotten drunk, which is probably how they went about to get this piece of rubbish written.We've all gotten drunk and discussed how to make something funny, however we wouldn't make a movie out of it.The only thing that was good about the movie was it's cast. They chose the best actors to suit the job and that's the best they could do.God help them if they chose a different cast that did a poor job on the movie.The humour was very immature, admittedly I like immature humour but they did a ghastly job on that too.This movie suits a person with a simple sense of humour such as a 12 year old or someone who prefers a different genre of movie who seeks out for a funny movie.Ironically this movie is rated for over 15 years old and even people with simple tastes cannot bear this movie.So I'll warn you now not to go and see this movie at the cinema, I suggest getting it at a very cheap cost such as rental or digging it out at your local video shops bargain bin.",

People would ask me why...and I would find myself speechless, without any memory of reason.That is, until, I got a free pass to go see DATE MOVIE (yeah...free and I still felt robbed...robbed of an hour and forty-minutes or so I could've spent sitting on my couch watching \"REN and STIMPY\" cartoons I got the night before).My first question was this: how can a comedy spoof other comedies? It's unheard of and useless. I guess, in this case, all you do is take material and scenes from those films and mash them into a loaf, making once entertaining sequences and quotes a bleak excuse to waste a few hundred million on placing a roll on a reel.Hey...It's not the cast's fault. Alyson Hannigan, as cute as she is talented, does what she can with the script that was thrown at her. It is nice to see her back on the screen, because I kind of dislike CBS's boring sitcom, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER (trust me, she's the light on that otherwise dark, dreary Monday night time slot). Tim Meadows, a fine comic actor, seems to be out of work these days. Sure, we all loved him in LADIES MAN, and I was taken by surprise when he showed up in MEAN GIRLS (shut up...I liked that one, too). Hee hee...TV legend Fred Willard shows up a bit. Sadly, it's a far cry from his amazing performance in ANCHOR MAN and ends up just being a pitiful desperation to star in more movies. All else...none of the other cast members are worth mentioning. In fact, the whole movie in general isn't worth mentioning. The only thing I enjoyed here was Carmen Electra's nice cameo (it was ruined, however, by a KING KONG parody and a sex-crazed 12 year old native boy snapping pictures with his cell phone camera. The nerve).I don't want to offend, but when I sat through what they claimed was a motion picture, I began to envy the seeing and hearing impaired, praying to God to have both placed upon me until the film's rolling credits were either starting or gone all together. Truly...I was that depressed by it.Not laughing a single time reminded me of watching episodes of WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY? or THE NANNY...hell, especially GIRLFRIENDS.Hollywood seems to let it all happen: Scientology, Hugh Grant's blowjob, gay cowboys, and DATE MOVIE. Nothing works anymore. It's as dry as a hillbilly's shower curtain. I used to want to fight for the return of Hollywood's Golden Age...but right now I ask: is it worth it?Face it folks, DATE MOVIE is proof that filmmakers will make anything and viewers will view anything.

The Willow girl did pretty good in this film though. This is just a straight up laugh your a** off movie.I'm not one to like comedies because I don't find most of them very funny, but I did like this one. So if your looking for just a fun time, you'll enjoy this one.",

It would, in essence, be a 86 minute long single shot of a large fat man farting. Toward the end of the movie, a midget would come in, riding a chimpanzee, and they would both turn to the camera and say \"Balls.\" Oh, and it would of course have to be directed by at least 5 of the Wayans brothers, and Eddie Griffin and Leslie Neilson would have to be in it somehow too. Seriously, between Date Movie and the upcoming Snakes on a Plane, 2006 is shaping up to be the most surreal year in horrible movie history. 2005 was just a warm up folks.",

The reason most people probably think it's crap is because they're so used to mainstream movies and idealisms of what comedy should be about, and aren't open to different comedy styles. This movie was hilarious in many different ways. I dunno, maybe people just didn't want to watch it because there was no violence. Yes the Scary Movie quadrilogy is very unique and amusing, but that doesn't mean you have to base your opinions of every other movie apon them. The style of this movie is very well done and smart for those of you who are interested in paying attention to the plot line, which isn't half bad for a romantic comedy. If you want to watch a good, funny movie then I suggest you watch this movie, it has a lot of parodies and is very enjoyable.",

And Alyson Hannigan is in the plus column, so... what the heck, maybe I'll even like it if I let go of my prejudice.\" I was so, horribly wrong.I consider spoof humor the lowest form of comedy; lower even than slapstick and fart jokes. And \"Date Movie\" is only spoof humor. Well, that's not true; there is some slapstick and a fart joke, too. But really, just because you recognize a scene as being lifted from another film, that does not automatically make it funny. You have to work a spoof a little more than that to get a laugh from me. Spoofing a genre is fine and can be funny; just recreating a scene from another film or quoting a line from a different, better movie is lazy.Rarely (if ever) have I seen something so uninspired, so by the numbers. Back in the golden age of cinema, they used to call something a \"programmer\" if it was made to fit a particular genre and niche in the marketplace. At least most of those were made by professional, competent filmmakers. \"Date Movie\" isn't even that. It's just something to fill up the multiplexes between the last \"American Pie\" sequel and the next Tom Cruise picture.\"Date Movie\" is the worst thing any movie can be: boring. And at only an hour and thirteen minutes, that's no mean feat. Stay away from it. Please.Oh, and Carmen Electra? She's in the final sixty seconds of the film getting fondled by King Kong. Har. Har.

Starring Alyson Hannigan as a fat waitress who is transformed into a looker and matched up with a potential date. Obviously inspired by the success of Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie. Director Aaron Seltzer proves to know the date movie clich\u00e9s and exploits them. The premise works but story is standard fare. Hannigan is perfect as the hopeless waitress yearning for love. Adam Campbell plays a good foil as the potential Mr. Right. Their relationship is standard and predictable but they have superb comic chemistry. Eddie Griffin is hilarious as Hannigan's father in a jab at There's Something About Mary. Tony Cox plays the progressive Hitch but it is a one joke performance and the Will Smith reference is of little amusement. Jennifer Coolidge is another fine comic talent often ushered into these films and she will always be funnier in American Pie as Stifler's mom. Whether one wishes to share this film with a date doesn't divert the fact that it knows the clich\u00e9s. Score: 6 \u00bd / 10",

            "content": "That my friends, was what actually put me on a theatre seat to sit through the crass comedy Date Movie, with an incredible fat (courtesy of a fat suit) Alyson Hannigan gyrating to Milkshake. Like Scary Movie (hey, written by 2 of the 6 writers you know?), it spoofs its own genre of movies, and here, it's the romance genre.What's the plot? There is no plot to speak of. It's just stringing together a series of spoofs into an 80 minute movie, drawing its material, and this list is not exhaustive, from movies like Briget Jones' Diary, Kill Bill, Meet the Parents, Dodgeball, Meet the Fockers (down to the kid and cat), Pretty Woman, When Harry Met Sally, King Kong, Hitch, etc. Some celebrities also get ribbed, like Mr and Mrs Britney Spears, and Michael Jackson.But basically, it's about a fat girl, Julia Jones (Hannigan) working in a Greek Diner (familiar?), having extremely mixed parentage, who falls in love with a Jude Law lookalike - Grant Funkyerdoder. She enlists the help of guru Hitch, and gets herself trimmed down in a car workshop (don't ask). Struggling with constant insecurities, and extremely huge zits, of course don't help. And to make things worse, Grant's ex-fianc\u00e9e Andy (an extremely curvy Sophie Monk, taking the usual sex-kitten turns in washing cars, munching burgers, and scantily clad, if not at all), turns up the heat and tries to wreck Julia's and Grant's upcoming marriage.What else can I say about the acting - it's essentially non-existent. Some sequences, like the Mr and Mrs Smith one, are done pretty accurately, like right down to Brad Pitt's crew cut hairstyle. And if you're not a fan of toilet / crass humour, then you might want to give this movie a miss, especially since it plays up the scenes in the original movies, a way lot worse than intended (swallowing sweaty chest hair anyone?) The only way to possible enjoy a movie like this, is like the old clich\u00e9 goes, by leaving your brains at the door. There are many laugh-a-moments, but after the movie, they're mostly forgotten stuff. Good for destress after a long hard day. And I think my friend Richard would probably enjoy the Kill Bill bits, and oh my, the burgers :-D P.S. Stay a while during the end credits, there's another Mr and Mrs Smith spoof scene.",

Although I have to admit that I didn't like the \"Scary Movies\" and was prepared for probably not liking this one, it was worse than I expected.This movie is supposed to make fun of more or less popular romantic comedies. The basic story is a mixture of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", \"My best friend's wedding\" and \"Meet the parents\", but there are also parts out of \"Bend it like Beckham\", \"A lot like love\", \"Harry and Sally\", \"Bridget Jones\", \"Hitch\", \"Notting Hill\", \"Pretty Woman\", \"Sweet Home Alabama\", \"What women want\" and \"The Wedding Crashers\", just to name a few. The problem is that the jokes are not funny. They are either disgusting or stupid, so instead of making the people laugh, it makes them look away nauseated or roll their eyes. I mean, does anybody think beating a homeless guy is funny? Another problem that I had was that I liked the movies that this one is trying to make fun of. So it made me kind of aggravated. I can understand that people parody real bad movies and make a great comedy out of it, but why turning a lot of great movies into one that only the word \"cheap\" could describe properly?Why is the movie cheap? Firstly, you can see that it is a low-budget production. This is really obvious, because the special effects and the fighting scene look totally faked. Secondly, the many parts of that movie don't seem to belong together at all. It's like watching a comedy show on TV consisting of a lot of funny clips. The third thing is that a lot of times the faces of the actors change in different shots. Filmed from the front, the actor is smiling, in the next shot, filmed from the right, he is not anymore. Really bad directing! Of course, they chose B or even C-actors for this production, probably mainly because of the budget, but definitely also because nobody else would participate in such a crap. That means, don't expect too much from the actors, except from Alyson Hannigan. I still can't find a reason why she took this part. She did her ridiculous job perfectly, I suggest she should try a serious movie next. Also Jennifer Coolidge sticks out of the bad ones. I can't see why she agreed to take part in this movie. It also makes fun of \"Legally Blonde\", a film she had a part in and that was successful.The whole film is absolutely stupid, only a few teenagers in the back got a kick out of the scenes in the fat-suit at the beginning. The other people in the theater didn't even smile a little. I guess that's the first and last movie the two directors will ever make!",

Spoofs can be funny, but this one seemed to only be produced because somebody ran out of ideas for an original film. \"Scary Movie\" and it's sequels were funny because they parodied popular scenes. But honestly, I see a LOT of movies, and I think they just didn't pick the right ones to make fun of. I found myself just plain not getting a lot of the \"jokes\" in the film because I hadn't seen the movie that they were making fun of. The smut comedy audience is pretty far from the \"date movie\" audience, so many of the folks in the theater seemed to not get many of the jokes. Hollywood is just plain running out of ideas for movies...they're all sequels, remakes and crappy parodies, like \"Date Movie\".",

However, it is probably the rather controversial and perhaps ill-advised, politically incorrect depiction of fatness (unlike Shallow Hal) at the very beginning of this film that turned a good portion of the audience elsewhere. In terms of a consistent and common thread throughout this movie, it adhered to the spirit of parody with good use of playing on stereotype, on a mostly high level without the extreme-outrageous use of weird. Sometimes erratic, the movie still manages to reveal wit in its intelligent use of script comedy than grossness. Six out of Ten Stars.",

            "content": "\"Films\" like Date Movie are the lowest of the low; the lowest form of sludge churned out, stretched out and then given cinematic releases for whatever reason. Some films create rifts between the public consensus and the critical consensus; other films split people of both ilks straight down the middle; others may even come with the odd flaw here and there, but generally do enough to garner necessary enthusiasm from whichever camp. Whatever disagreements or deliberations people have with whoever about whatever, surely there has to be some sort of common bond between all cinema-goers alike, regardless of academic level; age; experience in film-going. This bond is born out of the fact that: Date-Movie-is-an-a-bom-in-a-tion; a woeful, disgusting, humiliating and sordid affair in which nobody comes away for the better. If there are half a dozen or so worser films from the last decade; indeed two decades; indeed half a dozen decades; indeed EVER; then we all, collectively as a human race, ought to hang our heads in shame.The sheer levels of stupidity Date Movie reaches is matched only by its uncannily moronic ability to scale new lows as each cringe-inducing sequence arrives, all the time scratching for new depths of depravity in a spoof; a jibe or a pastiche. Here is a film that says if you're not thin; not somewhat easy on the eye; not Caucasian or if you are somewhat physically deformed in some way, then there is absolutely neither no space nor no hope for you in this world; and if you DO NOT see to these 'flaws' immediately by way of 'correcting' them, then it's encouraged that you find some small space somewhere so that you may crawl up inside of it and die. Failing that, stay out of everyone else's sight at all times. Here is a film that has hopefully, in the past, had its cast members wake up in the middle of the night knowing they helped in producing this pile of garbage.From it's distasteful opening of a gentleman committing suicide at the mere sight of Alyson Hannigan, who's wearing a lot of padding to make her appear obese, to an altercation on a mock-Skull Island in which sexual assault is rendered both an item that is something to giggle at and actually somewhat enjoyable from the female standpoint, Date Movie's pro-Fascist agenda is there for all to see. Its reliance on sight gags sees it target overweight people; black people; physically impaired people (I believe the politically correct term is 'dwarf', but I'm not sure); people of a Mediterranean descent; people of an Hispanic descent as well as homosexuals. The film's idea is that you can be beautiful, but only after a severe makeover in which your physical appearance conforms to what makers Friedberg and Seltzer would want \u2013 they have an idea of a perfect man, as well, and that is in the form of the handsome, white, Aryan character named Grant Funkyerdoder, a character played by British actor Adam Campbell. Is this all starting to sound a little dodgy? Is it a coincidence the two guys that came up with this stuff have surnames of German descent? Creepy stuff. Probably all a sick coincidence, though.So anyway, if you're fat \u2013 you've got no chance in life with finding that special someone. If you're not of an ilk that sees you immediately light up the room with your radiant looks and charm, again, you're additionally a no-hoper. Good grief. It's a film that takes serious issues like love and relationships between people and renders them mere items worthy of a laugh or two; it's a film that thinks potential sexual relations between an old woman and cats are \"funny\"; it's a film that has created the most grotesque cinematic spectacle/character I've certainly ever seen by way of a cat that has severe diarrhoea; it's a film that clocks in at about 80-85 minutes depending on end credits and needs a triple take of the same gag Kill Bill-style to boost its runtime. On another note, apparently there exists this person called Jennifer Lopez, and apparently she has rather large buttocks, and apparently I need Date Movie to tell me this. People sat down at word processors and TYPED this stuff out; they printed it and PROOF READ it; it was GREEN-LIT; it was SENT to people auditioning for parts; it was SHOT and RE-SHOT and then EDITED to form some sort of basic sequence of moving images along with everything else \u2013 how on EARTH does this manage to happen? If one wanted to stir controversies, one might liken such a chain of events to the coming of power of {insert name of brutal dictator here} in {insert nation} and everything that {dictator's name} did and how it all went seemingly entirely unnoticed. This disastrous process of immorality and deathly attitudes to life and those around you just being breezed through for sake of riches, power, glory \u2013 it's disgusting.Films have been banned for less than what Date Movie does. People sent Stanley Kubrick death threats back in the early 1970s upon the release of A Clockwork Orange, which forced him into pulling from cinemas what was one of the greatest films of that decade. People lobby to get, what is to them, grotesque and disgusting films censored; banned; pulled; destroyed; locked away in a vault somewhere so that no one can find them \u2013 but where are these people when Date Movie is released? Where are these people, in their infinite wisdom, when this faux-harmless spoof comedy is released into the mainstream multiplexes, capped at PG-13/12A, for everyone to roll in and get their kicks out of? Nowhere, that's where \u2013 they're too busy attacking films like A Clockwork Orange, Natural Born Killers and the-like. British based Channel 4 critic Leigh Singer describes 2008's Disaster Movie as \"Anti-comedy. Anti-cinema. Anti-life.\", an additional statement that rather aptly sums up this piece.",

After some non-starters such as action movie spoof Action! Or high concept comedy Happy Place failing to gain traction, the duo landed their first directing gig with an untitled rom-com pitch for Regency the duo were also slated to direct. The movie became a hit thanks to its low budget and success among teenagers and despite the critical derision gave Seltzer and Friedberg a foothold in cinemas with more \"spoofs\" coming through and defining their legacy.Most of the jokes can be boiled down to References, unfunny and uncoordinated slapstick, mugging. Despite some good comedians being in the cast like Alyson Hannigan, Fred Willard, and Jennifer Coolidge, they're all pretty much floundering with Hannigan's opening credits dancing sequence in an unconvincing fat-suit setting the tone and expectations pretty low for what's to follow. On occasion maybe one or two of the sight gags will be amusing such as one restaurant being literally named \"A Restaurant\", but mostly the gags and spoofs are pretty surface level servicing at best. As a spoof of romantic comedies there's tons of cliches, tropes, and trappings you can do with the genre to make a good parody, but becomes Seltzer and Friedberg target movies like Legally Blonde, Meet the Fockers/Meet the Parents or My Big Fat Greek Wedding, their go-to ere is basically taking scenes that were already played for comedy in the original context and amping up the mugging and grossout.Date Movie isn't even really a \"movie\", it's a parade of lowbrow gags daisy chained together into what resembles a movie, similar to the liquids and scrapings of a meat processing plant coming together on the edge of the kill line and forming \"meat product\". As a time capsule of what was once deliverable to audiences in cinemas there's a certain curiosity factor, but for anyone else: keep a distance of at least five feet.",

But thanks to a poor script, it seems the usually good comedic cast have trouble making this flick amusing, At times, it doesn't seemed... they tired at all. A few hilarious moments but nothing more. Seltzer, who co-wrote the script with Jason Friedberg (Who co-directed the film, who is uncredited) are not even close as The Zucker Brothers, The Farrelly Brothers or even Keenan Ivory Wayans (Which Seltzer and Friedberg worked on \"Scary Movie\").The DVD is the Unrated Version of this movie. The DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (.185:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD also includes an poor commentary track by Seltzer and Friedberg, a decent second commentary track with cast members Hannigan, Campbell, Monk, Tony Cox as Hitch and Varely Ortiz as a parody of Jennifer Lopez's big butt. The most amusing commentary is from Los Angeles film critics Scott Foundas and Bob Strauss offers more laughs than the movie. The DVD also includes a laugh track (If you thought the movie was hilarious, it is a matter of personal taste), featurettes, Deleted/Extended Scenes and more. \"Date Movie\" is a OK Spoof to watch at least once. I didn't think much of it, since i watched three years ago. Now watching it again, it was unnecessary (Although i liked it slightly better the second time).

Some of the gags were too crude and just kind of fell flat and it wasn't really a funny movie overall.

After fifteen minutes, I was so bored, so disgusted, so annoyed, and so absolutely infuriated with this wretched piece of cat bile that I couldn't resist the urge to switch the DVD player off and go off to do something else.Some movies are dated immediately when they come out. For a while, I thought that this was only for decades past: the 50's, the 60's, 70', 80's, etc. This is one of the few movies I can safely say future generations will look upon and immediately shout \" 2006!\" Really! ' Milkshake', 'Pimp my Ride', 'Hitch', 'Napoleon Dynamite', 'The Bachelor', and so many more. ( So, so, so many more.....) This would be acceptable, if it managed to be funny. But this objective was apparently so alien to the writers, they seem to take great strides to avoid this goal.Take the beginning for incident: corpulent protagonist is in a park reciting nuptials to.....wait for it....Napoleon Dynamite. He cranes his head, scrunches his face, and utters, \" I won't marry you! Gosh!\" ( Something to that effect, it's been a while since I've seen the movie, and it sure didn't strike me as memorable.) I was sitting there, nodding my head. Indeed, I had seen Napoleon Dynamite, and that was sorta how he behaved. So what's funny about that? That's how Napoleon Dynamite behaves! There's no joke in there! I was waited for a little while for the punch line, but it never came! There are so many things 'parodied' in this mess that the plot seems to lose track over itself. In the Scary Movie series, it seems they would take several horror movies and focus on them primarily, ( In number 3 it was The Ring and Signs,) while all the others references were pretty much sidebars, nice little snippets that came and went. Not so in 'Date Movie'. I was assaulted with the darkest parts of modern pop culture in such a short span I got nauseous, fast.All in all, avoid this catastrophe. Check out the 'Hot Shots!' series or 'Top Secret' to see what the parody genre is all about.

Humor many times is pretty stupid, and when you see someone reenacting a scene from a major movie, you even wonder about their creativity, but it's also a way to make fun of some blockbusters that everyone loves and no one dares to question.

It's supposed to be a comedy, but not only were the jokes not humorous, but disgusting and outright offensive. They made fun of other date movies, the main one being 'Meet the Parents', but they made fun of 'Wedding Crashers', 'The Wedding Planner' and 'My Best Friend's Wedding' (a step in the right direction). But then they made fun of movies like 'Kill Bill', 'Napoleon Dynamite' and 'King Kong', movies that simply didn't belong here. I didn't particularly like any of the characters, but the one I hated the most was Andy. Yes, I get that she was totally hot and was there to advance the plot by trying to steal Grant away from Julia, but the movie was half over by the time she was introduced. If they were going to bring in a jealous ex-girlfriend, she should have been brought in much earlier. Another thing: it wasn't necessary to keep replaying that scene with the Hardee's burger; it wasn't funny the first time, so why put it in there three more times during the afore mentioned 'Kill Bill' segment? There was one original idea (just one unexpected moment) that worked, and that's the two deaf people making out in the elevator, and that was immediately killed because they showed Eddie Griffin coughing up the hairball again. Anyway, one moment (which was all of 7 seconds long) doesn't make a movie any good, and this really isn't any good. To sum it up, if you like your comedies with lots of disgusting humor, *maybe* you'll like this. As for me, they got me to watch it twice; I'm not stupid enough to fall for it a third time. For all of you people out there with normal IQs: Don't walk, RUN from this movie!",

When I see people posting about how this movie sucks, I laugh because they can't give a good fact to back up their statement.

The producers might as well have just cut and pasted together the excerpts of the films they were *supposed* to be parodying.

This film is just a collection of scenes, directly ripped from films like Bridget Jones and Meet the Parents and pasted together.

This has got to be the most horrible movie I've seen. Even worse than \"White Chicks!\" Julia Jones is a 389 pound woman dreaming of one day finding true love. Working at her Greek Indian Jewish Japanese family's restaurant one day, she meets Grant. Grant finds her beautiful, even though she is a 389 woman. Desperate after being told by her father that she is marrying Nicky, a dim-witted employee, she rushes to Hitch. Hitch is played by Tony Cox, which I have to say, was kind of funny. Hitch \"pimps Julia out\" with the help of the West Coast Customs crew. Julia suddenly becomes a slender woman.Meeting both sets of parents, you never really get to know anyone because the movie goes by too fast. Well, as you know, spoofs of \"Meet the Parents\" and \"Meet the Fockers\" reveal that Julia's parents don't like Grant at first and Grant's mother is a sex therapist and his father enjoys dance fighting.With parodies that are just scattered throughout when unneeded and gross out humor that isn't funny one bit, \"Date Movie\" could easily win every Razzie for 2006. The MPAA obviously was mistaken when they gave this film a PG-13 rating. I've seen R-rated movies that weren't even this bad (content wise.)

After the first few seconds I was literally yelling at the screen \"I get it! That cat used the toilet and this cat really really uses the toilet!

            "content": "Parody films have been around for a very long time. Many of the original trendsetters were hilarious films that knew just how to parody certain films to their advantage, and make the audience have a good time. But as time went on, like all genres, it became stale and became unfunny. Now with Date Movie, we have begun to move into the beyond unfunny territory.Explaining the film would just be a waste of time, but basically, Julia (Alyson Hannigan) wants a boyfriend, but is totally hideous. She gets a makeover, and meets the man of her dreams, Grant (Adam Campbell). From here, they decide they want to get married, but they have to get through a number of obstacles first.That was just skimming the top of a movie that just throws in subplots just for the hell of it, just to parody more films. There is no real key film being parodied here, but a number of them. From recent films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents/Fockers and Hitch, to classic films like When Harry Met Sally... and Say Anything. It does not even stop at romantic \"date movies\" as their parody material. Kill Bill Volume 1, Napoleon Dynamite, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings and more have a couple of dedicated minutes thrown in for good measure.And while much of these parodies are totally incorrectly done, there are some that are genuinely hilarious. I was laughing so hard at a few parts, that I felt almost sick to my stomach to think that the majority of the film is just totally unfunny and downright silly. Classic parody films were never as bad, overdone or terribly unfunny as this. Even worse is the fact that the writers/director were involved in the original Scary Movie, which was a great parody film that was downright hilarious (unfortunately, the sequels deteriorated as they went on). In that film, they focused in on their parodies, and crafted them to be funny. Here, they barely do any focusing, and it all feels rushed and just thrown together in an attempt at hoping for the best results to come out of it.But what disturbed me the most about this movie was not the lack of hilarity, or the fact that some of the most unfunny jokes in the film were totally overdone, was the fact that much of the film just feels more like a rip-off remake, than a parody. In more than a few instances, it looks like they just ripped the scene right out of the film they are supposed to be parodying, and got the cast to just re-do the scene. This is not parody. This is a rip-off. It upset me to think of how much work many writers went through to make sure they were parodying and not just bringing the same scene back to the screen with new actors. Here, they do exactly what those writers set against doing, and they do it so often, that it just cannot be anything but blatant.This film could have been great, had the filmmakers wanted to make a parody and not a rip-off. It's sad and it's makes for an unfunny movie, marked by random points of hilarity. While the cast tries it's best at being funny, the script just will not allow them to be. I feel sorry for them, and I could only wish that the Fox executives spent more time telling the writers how much of a sad rip-off the film was, and how unfunny it was. Maybe then, it would not have left such a rotten smell after leaving theatres.2.5/10.",

Her love interest here is Adam Campbell, a new face to the movie world. We see virtually most of the Dating / Couple movies parodied, from small scenes to full out and out copies, from Hitch, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, When Harry met Sally, Bridget Jones's Diary to Meet the Fockers. This is done well, in places, but you know, in the back of your mind, that you really have seen it all before. Date Movie seems to be hanging by a thread of desperation, for the feeling of Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel is never too far away, when the gags fall flat and are too thin on the ground to even provoke a whimper of a laugh. There are some, but not many, funny gags here, the Cat Jinxters does it for me, but unfortunately, they are few and far between, shame really. An added bonus has to be the very funny actor Tony Cox, his movie pedigree reads a little like this, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), playing a Ewok, Space Balls (1987). Followed by Beetle Juice, Willow and Clint Eastwoods Bird, all from 1988. He continued with Me, Myself and Irene (2000), and the very funny 2003 movie, with Billy Bob Thornton, Bad Santa. There is a Michael Jackson (post court case) reference in this movie that I thought daring and it seemed to work, as well as a pointless Britney Spears scene, post wedding and baby days, which did not. Toward the end Date Movie started to drag, the gags were running thin and in the end, it seemed a relief that this date was over, what was a total shock was the length of this movie, some one hour and twenty minutes long, or short is the case here, way too short for a movie.Date Movie had brought you back home before you had left your driveway. No, Date Movie was, by accident, a Blind Date of a movie, we had turned up at the Cinema with absolutely no idea what to expect to see, and in the end if anyone asks, I'm staying home to wash my hair.Sorry, Date Movie is just not my type.",

Some parts are so funny that you won't be able to stop laughing for several minutes while others have you shaking your head in disapproval. DATE MOVIE had such potential, but only ended up being an average comedy. If not for Alyson Hannigan, the film would be nothing more than TV-movie garbage. Part of the film's problem was that it was trying to spoof way too many movies. Parts of it were clustered and seemed somehow clunky. Overall, the film just didn't all click together in the end.",

But there's very little else to say about \"Date Movie\" it's not as funny as the scary movie movies, it's just flat out rude, and plain stupid.

She's done some good stuff on \"Veronica Mars\", \"Buffy\", \"Angel so why would she do this? Your guess is as good as mine.To top it off the movie was not released to critics to see, so yes it got the wagging finger of shame from Roger Ebert, not that it needs it, \"Date Movie\" along with movies like \"Havoc\" are one of the more mediocre and bad movies this year and past year.",

It's a shame, because Alyson Hannigan always seems to make me laugh, and she does make me smile a bit, but not enough to save this film.The plot, if you can call it a plot, goes as so: Alyson Hannigan plays an overweight girl who's father (Eddie Griffin....I know, she's white, he's black, and the character's mom is Indian and Greek) wants her to work at the family diner forever. After a Pimp My Ride makeover from Hitch (little actor Tony Cox), she turns into the normal beautiful Hannigan. Now it's off to find love, and Adam Campbell is the best she's got. Only problem is that his ex-fianc\u00e9, Andy (Sophie Monk), wants him too.The only thing that keeps 'Date Movie' from getting a '1' is the fact that Sophie Monk and Alyson Hannigan are a lot of fun to look at. The jokes are not funny, even though they include spoofs of 'Wedding Crashers', 'Napoleon Dynamite', That Burger King commercial with Paris Hilton, 'Hitch', MTV's 'Pimp My Ride', and Ben Affleck's love life, the film is still horrible. AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. Guys, don't take a girl to see this, unless you want her to dump you. It's stupid, pointless, and extremely unfunny. Huge disappointment.2/10 --spy",

Very few people are afraid to talk about movies like this because if they say they like it their opinion is silenced with death threats. Stop being ignorant you guys.

The Casting for this film was the start of casting the same people in all of their movies. Tony Cox, Adam Campbell and Carmen Electra are most of the people who show up in these kinds of movies.Friedberg and Seltzer prove that you don't need good jokes to make a good movie. You can have good and bad jokes as well to make a good movie. I love slapstick in these type of movies because they work so well. For me that is, because my taste in comedy is different then everyone Else's. One of my favorite jokes is the beginning of the film where Julia dances on the street to get a man but fails and falls flat.But the second half and third act of this film isn't quite that funny.

There's a scene in Meet the Parents where Greg Focker opens a bottle of champagne and accidentally knocks over an urn which holds the remains of Jack Brynes' mother. The Byrnes' family pet, a cat named Mr. Jinx, pees on the ashes that are scattered on the floor. So how can Date Movie top this? For one thing, the character in Greg's place now has the surname \"Fockyerdaughter.\" And instead of ashes, the entire decayed body falls out. The cat has sex with it. Fantastic.That is just one example out of a sadly large, large number of scenes that are just as bad and even worse. Years from now, film scholars could go through this movie scene by scene and lecture on just how terrible it is.The jokes are bad, most run too long and become not only unfunny, but genuinely irritating.

The upcoming release of Epic Movie is further proof of this.I think I laughed once during the movie.

Alysson Hannigon, I dunno why she signed up for this movie, its a sheer waste of time and energy. Carmen Electra does a stupid cameo. The background hip hop/pop music is enjoyable but that just sets the tone of the movie. Its a sheer stupid movie, a real waste of time, people if you are looking out for some comedy watch some other titles, this one ain't worth it.4/10 !!!",

If you're looking for an intelligent comedy then put this one back and look elsewhere.

The problem is really that instead of making fun of the films it's \"spoofing,\" \"Date Movie\" simply takes scenes from other movies and adds them in it random times, using its own characters. For instance, the leading man and leading lady have a moment where they exchange lines from a variety of romantic comedies, but they don't actually poke fun at any of them. They basically copied and pasted random moments from the other movies.The main plot is not worth mentioning, except for that it is a spoof of mainly \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" and \"Meet the Fockers.\" The film does poke fun at the former, but the latter is already so ridiculous that \"Date Movie\" simply steals its jokes. Among the other films copied and pasted are \"Jerry Maguire\", \"Say Anything\", \"Kill Bill: Volume Two\", \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", and \"King Kong (???)\".I'm not giving this film a 1 because, I have to admit, I saw this film with a few friends and we did laugh out loud a lot, until we recognized that it was too long and too stupid to waste our time on.3/10 PS: Carmen Electra is in the film for about two minutes, and she gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen!

However, I've never left a cinema so full of anger and hatred in all my life and merely replaying this movie in my head for the benefit of this blurb causes bile to rise in my throat.If I can prevent just one person from seeing this then I feel I'd have performed a valued service and will surely then be allowed access to the Holy Afterlife TM Even armed with the knowledge that Date Movie is written by two of the brainless goons who excreted Scary Movie you will still find yourself stunned by how utterly, mind numbingly, excruciatingly poor this film is. Confusing itself with a spoof it's forced to string together its random and oh-so-apt gags with what is essentially a sincere romance storyline. So the essence of what this film is spoofing is exactly what it relies on to lifeboat the audience from one poorly executed reference to another.How on Gods earth they thought they could spoof a comedy (Meet The Fockers) keeps me awake at night. I have actually witnessed better executed satire on \"The Amanda Show\" And even as a fellow Australian, if I'd seen Sophie Monk's leathery, malnourished form, greased up and clutching the worlds most unappetizing burger you would had to have pried the ready cocked gun from my mouth.Of course there are people who will think this movie is great and hilarious, however if you're over 14 my strong and forceful suggestion is; do not donate another cent toward this film. If you must, do so only so you can demand it back once the midget joke forces you from the theater.",

It is a terrific spoof of loads of love movies about a woman called Julia Jones (spoof of Bridget Jones) who is trying to find a husband when she goes to a love doctor (Hitch, obviously!) Hitch pimps her up and the next you know shes going out with a cute English bloke and so they begin to plan the big day(the wedding planner) for their big fat Greek wedding!

There are probably 3 minutes of 'good stuff' in this movie and roughly 1/3 of the material might have been usable in talented hands. I still gave this a \"3\", because I've got the hots for Ms. (I hope!) Hannigan.The \"writers\" had a few jokes on the subject, just enough for a credible pitch, but in the end no talent or even real enthusiasm to fill it up right. So they did what the \"writers\" of spoofs do today. Have been doing for the past 13 years, starting from \"Fatal Instinct\": steal familiar scenes from movies of the genre and other current movies. Add in a bad joke - or just act it out bad, and PRRRESTO! ...that is, IF the \"writers\" even needed that. They could have just walked up to their buddy at the studio and said \"we wrote Scary Movie, right? Now we gonna write a Date Movie spoof! Cough up the dough, DOG!\" The end product is 80 minutes of forced and excessively lengthened scenes, most of them unfunny, just linked together. Did this even look good on paper? Well, if the ZAZ guys are making movies like \"Scary movie 4\" these days, what can you ask for? Obviously NOT a spoof worth the ticket. \"Airplane!\" \"Top Secret!\" \"Naked Gun\"... *sigh*",

What these folks don't get about parody is that parody really works when you are making fun of serious things. The strange thing about this is that this film got greenlit and made it pass some approval board. Everyone tried so hard to make this funny and that is where the problem lies also... when you have to try that hard, then its normally not going to be any good. Is as if this film was written and directed by a 12-year old. It's one gag after another, but calling what was on screen a \"gag\" is to imply that this was funny and it clearly was not.

Both the Wayans' and Zucker made their movies unique to their own style, and on most levels, they each panned out to where you can enjoy them if you just turn your brain off and smile.Unfortunately, with this movie, that luxury does not exist. It really, really, does not exist. I'm going to take a guess and say that the two of the six writers from the Scary Movie series that took on this project, were the ones who had the luxury of writing the most obvious jokes from the film series (i.e. the 'i've taken balls to the face before' line from Scary Movie 4).Unfortunately for everyone, or maybe fortunately if you think my writing or opinion is crap, I can't give this a full review. What I can do though, is honestly state that this is the only movie in the past few years that I have purposely turned off. Oh yes, I sat through Phat Girlz, and yes, I sat through Kangaroo Jack. This one, however, I just could not muster up the strength to make it. I got maybe a half hour in before I just walked away.If you're a parent, or are around a child of about ten-twelve years old, imagine every joke that you have heard from that child, and you've pretty much got the script of this movie. And unless said child is a miniature George Carlin, you know that is a bad sign. You can see every joke coming about ten miles away. Even if you know what movie they're about to make fun of, you can still accurately guess which parts they will be parodying, and I use that term very loosely. Not only is this movie obvious in its attempts at mustering up laughter, it's sometimes just painful to watch because the jokes are so rehashed that you might find it uncomfortable to view because you know that at the time, these people actually thought this would be a good idea.",

The scene when they parody, \"When Harry Met Sally\" was the most memorable to me, along with a few others.All in all, I thought this movie was great, I'm giving it a 6 though, because it's not the best, but it's definitely not the worst.",

            "content": "Going into Date Movie, I was not expecting anything high class. Directed by the same people as Scary Movie 3 and 4, it seemed like it would be fairly funny from the previews - something I would wanna see in theatres. I had enjoyed Scary Movie 3 and 4 very much, and was pretty sure I would love this one just as much. Fortunately for me, I waited till it came out on DVD - if I had spent ten dollars on this trash, I'm not sure I could forgive myself. Date Movie is a film that fails on most levels that it tries to attain - and considering it doesn't attempt to get to many levels in the first place, this is saying a lot. It is a mostly boring and unfunny attempt to lampoon more than a dozen movies in an hour and a half, but only manages to succeed in limply poking fun at about half of them.We begin with a scene in a beautiful garden, where a rather large woman is walking down the aisle wearing a wedding dress. And guess who she's walking up to? A cheap imitation of Napoleon Dynamite. Now, besides the fact that Napoleon Dynamite ceased to be funny about a year ago, this \"parody\", if you can even call it that, is so wooden and clich\u00e9 that it's barely funny for half a second, and then you realize how stupid it is and begin wishing for the scene to end. Fortunately it does, and then we are \"treated\" to three minute scene during which an obscenely overweight Alyson Hannigan, or Julia Jones as she is in the movie (haha get it Bridget Jones haha that's so funny not), dances to \"my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.\" If you have not vomited in your mouth by now I applaud you. Aside from being WAY too long, this scene is completely unfunny and disturbingly disgusting. I know that is what the filmmakers were going for, but there is a line that one does not cross, and they crossed it. An overweight woman dancing provocatively is NOT funny.Look at my review. I'm five minutes into the movie and I already have an entire paragraph of criticism against it. Basically put, the filmmakers have the illusion that \"parodying\" something means mentioning it. This is completely untrue. That is basically all that Date Movie does. It mentions the movies and then does something funny with it that is completely unrelated to the movie itself. And half the time the jokes fall completely flat. They also use the joke of someone saying \"why is she moving in slow motion?\" I believe this joke can now be classified as \"dead\", having been used in all the Scary Movies. It just isn't funny anymore. Most of the humor relies on sex-related jokes as well, and when a movie uses that as a crutch, you know it's desperately clawing for something the audience can laugh at.I am judging Date Movie based on what its filmmakers wanted it to be: a hilarious movie that makes fun of date movies. Unfortunately, it just feels like this film was a cheap way to make a quick buck. The entire movie has the feeling of being slapped together like a science project done at the last minute. Most of the jokes fall flat, because the actors themselves don't really seem to be into it. Also, Date Movie doesn't really parody - it imitates and ends up being much less funny than the movies it is copying, and considering it is copying romantic comedies like The Wedding Planner, which aren't that funny in the first place, that is saying a lot. Go see Date Movie if you have to. If you don't have to, you should pretty much avoid seeing it. You may laugh a few times, but for most of the time you'll just end up sitting there and saying to yourself, \"This is supposed to be funny?\"",

When I was waiting for the movie to begin I started to think maybe I had made a mistake. I had flashbacks of Ali G: The movie going through my head. Date Movie begins in a decent way with a parody of Napoleon Dynamite and the dance scene which you pretty much see completely in the trailer. That's pretty much all that there's decent comedy in the movie. Otherwise the jokes don't hit the spot or are just plain embarrassing in how stupid they take the audience to be. I have to admit that the cat made me laugh a few times but otherwise it's not worth it.. It's not worth it! I was disappointed I wasted my time although I expected it to be bad.. but not this bad!

            "content": "I'd heard all the bad press when it came out. But tonight, while surfing the TV, HBO played it and, well, I decided to see for myself just how bad it really was. Why not, right? There was a chance I could like it. \"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist\" seemed to bring out the worst in everyone, but I thought it was a hoot. Lightning could strike twice...Right? You can't blame a boy for hoping. Sadly, everything you've heard is true: this isn't just BAD - they haven't even come up with words to describe just HOW BAD this movie is! I love parody movies, even if they HAVE been done to death. Some of the \"Scary Movie\" series was laugh-out-loud hilarious. Mel Brooks, of course, had it down to a science (though, thankfully, he stopped after that lead brick, \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\"). The makers of this film have apparently watched every parody ever made...and promptly forgot everything that made the great ones great, while simultaneously remembering everything the lousy ones did wrong. The ONLY thing \"right\" they did was in hiring Alyson Hannigan as their star; like Anna Faris in \"Scary Movie\", she has a winsome style, a real charm, not unlike a young Goldie Hawn, complete with spot-on knack for physical comedy. With a proper director and good, tight script, I'd bet money she'd be a bigger star today. She has that potential. Wait. I lied. They did one other thing very right: also hiring Jennifer Coolidge, here channeling Barbra Streisand as the 'Roz' character from \"Meet the Fockers\", and she is, as usual, a real scene-stealer. In fact, while they have nothing in common physically, she, Alyson Hannigan, and Anna Faris (who is NOT in this movie) DO share that same quality Lucille Ball had: that willingness to make a fool of herself on camera for the sake of a good laugh. Alas, I'd like to say that despite this quality, poor Alyson is given nothing - oh, and I do mean NOTHING - to work with here; I can't remember a single laugh, though she tries manfully to make it work, despite itself. Beyond her, and Coolidge, the rest of the cast is pitiful. Yes, even the ubiquitous Fred Willard is substandard, and THAT is saying something about the state of this movie! Adam Campbell, as Alyson's love interest, displays near-zero comedy abilities, a trait shared by one Sophie Monk (as the supposedly-hot love rival of Hannigan). Worse still is the appearance of a man who can bring ANY film down with one fell swoop: Eddie Griffin. HOW does this man maintain a career as a \"comedian\"? Like Jerry Lewis at his very late-60's worst, he's truly convinced of his own \"greatness\". Uh...yeah. Right. He's as laugh-free here, as ever. The film makers further scrape the bottom of that barrel by tossing in, at the last moment, Carmen Electra, who, just like Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy before her, seem to believe they're funny just because they're buxom, and ready and able to disrobe in half a heartbeat. But I digress from what TRULY makes this movie one of THE very worst ever made - and I don't make that assessment lightly: as a lover of bad-bad movies, I've seen hundreds, maybe even thousands - the (ahem) \"jokes\". I will do my best to offer up a partial list of the films parodied within its 80-or-so minutes: \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Napoleon Dynamite\", \"Hitch\", \"Kill Bill\", \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", \"Meet the Parents/Fockers\", \"Dodgeball\", \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"Mr & Mrs Smith\", \"Say Anything\", the latest \"King Kong\", \"Lord of the Rings\", \"Legally Blonde\", \"Sweet Home Alabama\". Yes, there are more, and no, I'm sure I didn't get all the references. But think about it: how many of those movies listed is SO iconic that it is RIPE for making fun of? Yes, a few MAY be big enough but...well, so bereft are the writers, director, and producers that they even stoop to copying off the very scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\" that you'd expect them to. And it goes on. And On. And ON. AND ON. Adding insult to injury, some of those films are just TOO OLD to be referenced successfully! I swear, it's like they went through a movie-review book, opened a page, stuck a pin in, and mocked whatever flick they landed on! One user here said it's as if they copied scenes whole, note for note, and, unfortunately, that's right on the button. But simply replaying scenes, note for note, but with a funny face, or tossing it in without any reason, or throwing in potty humor, doesn't make it funny. These guys wouldn't know \"funny\" if it bit them. Seems they also made the current, \"Epic Movie\", the previews of which look like a walking, talking DISASTER. If Uwe Boll can be ripped a new one for HIS craptastic masterpieces, these doofuses SURELY must be next! To be avoided at ALL costs.",

Also under the spotlight are Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Simpson and, of course, Paris Hilton.This film puts these (mostly funny) movies together in one plot, where a large Greek girl who works at the family diner is ignored by all men. She visits the date doctor, Hitch, who takes her to his mates down at the garage where like in MTV's Pimp My Ride, she has the fat sucked out of her and is now a pretty young woman.She embarks on her journey by entering The Bachelor: Desperate Edition where she meets her true love, meets the parents, then vice versa. They begin planning their wedding where a woman with (gasp) a bigger behind than J-Lo helps them.The film is filled with plenty of other laughs. Carmen Electra, as beautiful as ever, plays the sultry Andy who tries to break up the couple.

Nothing more than that. That's comedy? I'm not asking for great satire, but at least some effort should be made.I don't object to lowbrow humor. The farting scene in \"Dumb and Dumber,\" for instance, is a great. But in \"Date Movie\" the best they can do is have the same scene taking place with a cat. Umm, OK. And this is a parody why? Because of cats? In some cases the film attempts to \"parody\" other comedies by virtually lifting entire jokes from other movies and rewording them slightly (for instance from \"Meet the Parents\").

It had a few funny moments, but a few of the spoof scenes were more like reenactments other than actual spoofing.Alison Hannigan (American Pie) was delightful as a girl who went from frumpy to fabulous--Pimp My Ride style--with a little help from Tony Cox. She gets attractive enough to be chosen by a Bachelor on a TV show, and they decide to get married despite objections her multi-ethnic father (Eddie Griffin). Not to mention the fact that the fianc\u00e9's ex-girlfriend wants him back (Cliche much?).This film spoofs (or emulates) such movies as My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Bridgete Jones Diaries, Say Anything, My Best Friends Wedding, Lord of the Rings, Kill Bill, Meet The Parents, Pimp My Ride, & Hitch.It's not the greatest movie, but it's not the worse. It's good for a few chuckles, though. I give it 5/10",

And when it was all said and done, it was as if nothing was accomplished. Very average, nothing special, nothing laugh out loud funny. Not painful to sit through, just not good, either. A fraction better than the disappointing Scary Movie 4, which isn't saying much. What happened to these spoof movies? They used to be funny. It's almost as if Hollywood is afraid to be funny, for fear of offending someone. What they don't seem to understand is, they offend EVERYONE with the same ol' ho hum crap that seems to get pooped out on a regular basis.",

The previews looked like the stupid, mindless humour I enjoy from time to time, but the movie was pure drivel. Then I remembered it was from \"two of the six writers of Scary Movie\" and it occurred to me that Scary Movie was nothing more than stealing scenes outright from other movies and putting in blue humour, I did not think that worked for Scary Movie and it certainly does not work for Date Movie. I think a good rule of thumb to follow for future spoofs, aside from actually being funny, would be to not spoof comedies. Maybe it can work but it absolutely falls flat in this waste of film. The only good thing that came out of going to see this was when we walked out we snuck into Firewall which was just starting. Not a great movie, but in comparison to what we had just left we agreed it should have gotten an Oscar.",

Think of half-funny scenes from other movies, poorly re-enacted, all pieced together with ginger minger Alison Hannigan and the result is Date Movie.I rented this and watched it with my bro. From the very beginning I kept thinking \"this isn't funny... this isn't funny\", but wholeheartedly expected it to pick up. It didn't. And after about 40 minutes of lame jokes I just couldn't take anymore and switched it off.I met my friend the next day and said \"I just watched the worst movie ever\"... and he instantly asked if it was \"Date movie\"...Since then if I'm ever in a video store I always put other movies in front of the date movie box so other people don't make the same mistake and rent possibly the worst movie ever.Interesting side-note, my sister went to Epic Movie when it was released in the cinema and said it was the worst movie ever. I'd love to see which is actually the worst movie ever, but I just couldn't bring myself to watch Epic Movie knowing it was made by the same losers who made Date Movie.",

The jokes are just forced. They just throw in every joke possible as soon as possible until we laugh. I mean, take this for example: A fat lady (Who's obviously wearing a suite) dancing on the streets. Okay, that's not funny. What they did, they kept that joke as many times and many ways as possible until we laughed. They reference all these love movies and not one of them is funny. Tony Cox as Hitch was kinda funny, but that's it. I could keep this review going forever on all these failed jokes. My theater was full when I watched it. Not one person was laughing at it except for these annoying little year 10 kids that had just left school laughing at any joke thrown in their faces. I mean, they were laughing at a cat puppet (Jinxers from Meet The Parents and Meet The Fockers) pooping in a toilet. The only joke me and the audience was Lil Jon playing himself. I've always loved his rap and find his voice hilarious. I actually never even saw that coming. That was a great surprise and a great joke. I normally don't give movies a 2/10, but because of Lil Jon and Tony Cox being KIND OF funny I decided to give it a 2.This movie tries to be like Scary Movie 1, 2, 3 and 4 and fails miserably. You see, the random jokes work with Horror movies where as with Date Movies it doesn't work at all. Don't get me wrong, I understood where all the references were. I just thought they were poorly used and tried too hard to be funny. I don't recommend this to anyone unless you love any joke thrown in your face. 2/10",

However...the storyline is stupidly awful, most of the scenes in Date Movie are just disgusting. I don't know in some funny scenes I should laugh or just feel \"unconfortable\". Perhaps, that's the best euphemism to appreciate the film director \"great work\". Personally, I think this so-called film should never be released to theaters. Maybe the surprisingly box office success is because of Alyson Hannigan and the title Date Movie, but that's not what a comedy or romance should be done like this. This is a rip-off. Beware of it.",

Bad plot lines, things that make no sense (Like the lead getting Liposuction as part of \"Pimp My Ride\".) , ridiculous names, ugh it goes on and on. I mean I guess you could argue that the \"Andy\" character provides some sex appeal or something but this movie has very little appeal.

This movie is just like many other parodies after a while some of the jokes just get old and the movie gets boring. Still I would give this movie a 5 out of ten. It was entertaining in certain aspects and had a few jokes which kept you going through the movie. Some of the jokes that were put into the movie were stupid and had no point, one being the Star Wars scene during the make over. But jokes like the dating reality show where Grant shoots the ladies he wishes to eliminate made me chuckle. Throughout the movie there was a number of good and bad jokes that basically evened the movie out to a rating of 5. Remember, parodies are never the best made movies.",

The only good thing about this movie is that it is only 85 minutes (unlike some other horrible films that last over 2 hours such as Napoleon Dynamite or 40 year old virgin). In 85 minutes they managed to spoof Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers, Napoleon Dynamate, Hitch, Bridget Jones Diary, My best friend's wedding, Wedding Planner, My big fat Greek wedding, Wedding Crashers, When Harry met Sally, Pretty Woman, Shallow Hal, Sleepless in Seattle, King Kong. Shall I continue? Oh, yes, how about Michael Jackson parody for his album Thriller. The movie is about a shy girl Julia Jones who works at her parent's Greek Restaurant and dreams about finding a prince. I have to admit that there were some funny moments in the movie. Case in point - Julia's dance in the very beginning of the movie, the scene with the cat in the bathroom, and the elimination round during the Reality Show. Some moments were flat out disgusting and very distastefully. Julia is fat... then she is suddenly \"pimped out\" to be this gorgeous woman. Some characters were totally misplaced and unnecessary. Why Chinese sister? If you are a fan of parodies, maybe you'd like this film. But I have to warn you the commercial for the movie is way better than the movie itself. Good luck",

You've seen them all right? Budweiser, Miller Lite, Old Spice, Axe, and Wendy's come to mind. These commercials all had a surprise element to it, and that's what made these so funny. This movie had absolutely no surprise element to it. Even a history textbook has more surprise element than this junk.But perhaps Date Movie's greatest problem springs from the fact that they try to spoof way too many movies in 80 or so minutes. The problem arises when they try to reenact, superficially, all those scenes from twenty other romantic movies... not to mention Kill Bill (???), and try to be funny. Well, they can't be funny when all they're doing is reenacting them. Remember, reenacting these other films is just like having us see it all over again, and a joke is not funny when told the second time.Date Movie could have remedied this by just concentrating on two or three movies, not 20, and try to make the scenes more unpredictable and clever.

The best part about this movie after that was a wonderful thing I'd noticed on the website where I'd looked up showtimes- a running time of 83 minutes. Since the opening took about twenty of those up, I figured after enduring five minutes of this festering pile of excretement- which began at that point to really stink up the screen with its tired, played-out gags that weren't relevant in any way to the story- I could at least salvage my $8.50 by getting in a good nap.

Copying every scene from other films, with more exaggeration and grosser humour, does not make a good parody. Likewise, gross out humour in films can be funny (i.e American Pie, Bridesmaids, etc), but using it in every scene and overdoing it is not funny. It seemed that the writers were just trying to be as gross as possible, as that was the only was they could get a laugh.

I really like the Scary Movie's, they are not comedic genius by any stretch of the imagination, but they do do a good job at mocking the cliches which plague the horror genre. Based on this, Date Movie seems like a good premise - as there are countless bad troupes and cliches in the romance and rom-com genres. However, Date Movie almost always failed to exploit this. It is difficult to describe how bad most of the jokes are in this film, because they are superficially the same as the jokes in Scary Movie except they are just not funny. The comedic timing is totally off, and most of the jokes are so obvious - without self-awareness - that they cannot be enjoyed by people that would ordinarily appreciate that sort of humour. This leaves the film feeling extremely cringey and honestly difficult to watch. Without good jokes, the film is completely pointless and a total waste of time. Do not bother watching, re-watch one of the Scary Movie's instead - they are so much better.",

Scene's including an orgasmic food order and a cat defecating for several minutes in a toilet, are juvenile at best, yet deliver the chuckles!

A brief attempt at Parodying \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was made, unfortunately it failed to be as funny as the already comical original.

If popping huge zits, cats taking a poop in a toilet, and loud obnoxious farting are your thing, than you may like this. I think possibly teenagers would enjoy this movie, but even they may think it's stupid. The scenes from the romantic comedies they spoof are not even the funny scenes from those movies. I don't understand how somebody would make this and think it is good.I found out right before going into the theater that this was a PG-13 movie, and my expectations fell right there. If you are going to do a good parody, in my opinion, an R rating is needed.

Yoda already said no more Jedi's. Why make a film about what, life after Yoda? The \"2 or 3 producers of Scary Movie\" should have actually READ the script before signing the contract. Same with the actors.I will admit. There are a FEW funny scenes. And when I mean few, I mean like 3. One was the part where in the commercial, shows her running down the street trying to get a guys attention while being obese. I find that offense to people who are obese, like Shallow Hal, not funny. Another was when Funkyerdooter (i believe that is how you spell it) tosses the luggage out of the car, including a toddler who said his first words a few minutes prior, \"biotch\". And as the toddler is being thrown out onto the dirt road, he says, once again, \"biotch\". And I personally did not think it was that funny. However, I was sitting next to one of my good friends, and she started laughing, thus causing me and the people next to me to laugh. Last, was when Alyson Hannigan (spell check?) rides the motorcycle to find her love, Funkyerdooter, and automatically changes to a black man? Wow. If you call that funny, then eating salad is hysterical.Date Movie was a complete bust, and I PRAY not to see a sequel come in to affect.

Crude, ridiculous and so unfunny that you'll feel like walking out every 5 minutes until the film is finally over and you're put out of your misery.After the novelty of the fat suit is milked for everything its worth, the writers decide they need some eye candy to stop the boys tuning out, which is solved by a ludicrous \"pimp her out\" section where stereotypical black mechanics \"pimp\" Julia, and, voila! One rap song and a tool box later and Julia is a sizzling sexpot ready to embark on a journey of finding true love, on a game show where the bachelor is told to \"shoot the girls you don't want to bang\".The bachelor, Grant, and Julia then soon fall in love after a date of beating up homeless people, and become engaged which is complicated by Grants best \"man\" Andie- a conniving blonde bimbo out to steal Grant back.Whilst films of a similar vein, such as Scary movie, are well observed and actually funny, Date Movie takes the concept too far. It is TOO gross, TOO unrealistic and tries far TOO hard. The writers of this drivel, who happen to be two of the writers of scary movie (apparently the worst ones) fail to realise that the genre of romantic comedy spoofs has been done. The under-rated \"not another teen movie\" is a witty film which exposes Date Movie as utter, un thought-out tripe.One of the many bad bits of the film is a scene in which a constipated cat is sat on the toilet for two long minutes, with accompanying facial expressions and repulsive sound effects. This may fare well with people aged 11-13 with an immature sense of humour, but its likely most people will sit in stunned silence throughout this entire saga.In fact, said cat is likely to become an icon for the younger, less intelligent teenagers in the audience. After his toilet troubles he also rapes a skeleton and has sex with an old lady. Think I'm lying? Unfortunately I'm not.Remotely intelligent viewers may also wonder why Caucasian Julia has an African American dad, an Indian mum and a Japanese sister. Well the answer is simple. It invites racist jokes and is used as a window for unimaginative character stereotyping.A parody of \"Hitch\" is also a low point. A midget love doctor named Hitch helps Julia with her dating techniques by flossing a chicken wing out of her teeth. I was expecting the writers to rename him \"Titch\" but perhaps that kind of joke was too sophisticated for them.A parody of The Wedding Planner starring a Latina named Jell-O, with a cushion shoved down her trousers, also misses the mark and is yet another cheap ploy for laughs. Cue the tumbleweed.The acting in Date Movie is also well below par. Julia is far too whiny whilst Grant's accent starts to grind after the first few minutes. But does it really matter when the actors look the part? The casting directors seem to think not, yet evidently, yes, it does.Of course, tired Michael Jackson jokes where he moon dances and tries to seduce a young boy are featured too, which should please the youngsters who have read Michael Jackson's exploits in The Sun, but many will simply roll their eyes at something which is overdone and usually more effectively done.Male viewers may be momentarily entertained by the three minute scene where Andie- a Paris Hilton clone- dances around in a bikini, washes a car and eats a banana, simply to drum into the audience that she is Julia's love rival and is conventionally sexier, but Date Movie is generally not at all entertaining.Of course there will be exceptions. I'm sure young teenagers seeking non-intelligent films full of fart jokes will lap Date Movie up, but chances are everyone else will leave the cinemas bored, disgusted and wanting a refund.To sum up, the best thing about Date Movie is that it only lasts 83 minutes, the worst thing is everything else.To those of you considering going to see date Movie, one word of advice; DON'T.",

Every joke in the movie that had potential to be funny, was extremely dragged out to the point where you just felt awkward that you were watching such a horrible movie. The thing that just really screwed up this movie was the opening. Where Napoleon Dynamite is there and he keeps saying gosh. THAT WAS SO STUPID! Its wasn't even funny. \"DOn't vote for Pedro\" I meen seriously, who wrote this? That seems like something a 5 year old would think is funny. Stick with Not Another Teen Movie or the Scary Movie franchise. Date Movie is the most horrible thing that has happened since Carrie Underwood put out that Jesus take the Wheel song.In case you couldn't tell by the trailer, this movie sucked!

No mention as to where he was born, but if I remember correctly someone else from his family was in the movie and had no accent. I don't remember with 100% certainty because I wasn't paying attention closely because the movie absolutely sucked. The whole \"pimp my ride\" tie in to her makeover was a lame ass attempt to be creative and funny. Alls this movie did was make me realize that Allison Henigan is actually not bad looking when she is all \"dummied up\". I used to just visualize her as the band geek from American Pie. The sad thing is that the Director, producer, and everyone else must have thought \"this is really funny, we've got a hilarious movie here\".",

She finds help from Lil Hitch(Tony Cox) who helps her find the man of her dreams, Grant Fonckyerdoder (Adam Campbell). After they fall in love they decide to get married but Julia's father Frank Jones (Eddie Griffin) tries to stop her daughter from getting married along with Grant's ex-fianc\u00e9e Andy (Sophie Monk). This movie spoofs every love movie and other movies such as Revenge of the Sith, King Kong and Kill Bill. This movie has its ups and downs. The spoof's are quite funny, but the movie seems to count to much on the spoof's. A lot of spoofs are predictable, but most times funny. I loved the Mr and Mrs spoof which was hilarious, but spoofing ''What Woman Want'' was quite pointless because she can read minds for like 4 minutes but suddenly with no explanation she doesn't hear peoples thoughts anymore???? OK so its mean't be slapstick and goofy but still. This is worth seeing but not the best prodigy ever!!! I give this movie a 6/10.

The main argument against it is its not original. NO FREAKIN DUH! that is the point of this movie, to mock others. Not be original. Of course a movie mocking others doesn't have jokes not from them.

Luckily, I'm viewing it on cable--Cinemax- and didn't actually go to the theater to pay to see it. If you want to see Alyson Hannigan; watch American Pie or some old Buffy's.

After all, I swore off the Scary Movie series after #2, which was indisputably the most putrid film I have ever seen. Date Movie, at least, should have had plenty of movies to choose from for parodies, and hence provided some humour. But where were the jokes? Where was the wit? Where was the coherent storyline? I laughed maybe three times during the entire film, and spent the rest of it wondering how mature adults could possibly try to pass this off as entertainment.The most pathetic segment of the film was the Meet the Parents parodies. These scenes were literally nothing more than exact replicas of the originals, with slightly more extreme visuals. Fockyerdoder instead of Focker - that's not funny. A two-year-old could do better. The \"I've got nipples, can you milk me?\" skit was even shabby, leaving out key lines. Of course, the pimple-popping segment was not much better; simply puerile.The only positive comment that can be made is that this film was better than Scary Movie 2, because I laughed three times instead of zero times. I just feel sorry for the cast: Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Griffen, and that midget whose name I don't know are all good actors, and acted capably in this film, but the script was such trash that it could ruin Johnny Depp's golden career if it wished to.",

I had seen a preview for that, and I figured if I saw it I'd get insanely annoyed by Steve Martin's accent and would have to leave.Anyway, I was hoping that this would be like Scary Movie 3, which I saw and enjoyed. Not even close. The beginning was terrible. Well, so was the rest of the movie, but right when it started I wanted to leave. But I thought that it might get funny, so I stayed. Nah. This movie had some of the grossest, least-funny things I've ever seen. The whole hairball scene made me want to throw up. And the old lady making out with/being fed strawberries by a cat? Sick. Few people laughed during the movie. I laughed here and there a few times, but mostly I was just extremely bored. And the part where she \"kissed\" the little hitch guy--that was disturbing. The last part with Carmen Electra was possible more disturbing. Honestly, when I left the theater, I felt like I had lost brain cells. Then, as we were walking out, I saw some 7 or 8 year old looking kids walk out. What kind of an idiot takes their 7 year old kid to a PG-13 movie--especially that one?

            "content": "Date Movie was just that. One date to see a movie. There will be no more dates to ever see this movie again. After viewing this movie, myself and others walked out looking half dazed, half wanting to vomit in our wallets for ever taking the money out to invest in such a ticket. From the beginning to the end, this movie was shocking. I'll give it to the directors for being so spot on with theparodies, but after at least 50 references to movies of the past 5 years, it gets older then the stench of pure hate in the theatre. The first few minutes show a spoof of Napolean Dynamite. How dare they. That was when I realized that it was indeed a waste. The minutes that followed involved crude humour, revolting antics, and was very very unfunny. The funniest bit was Grant imitating Mr and Mrs Smith and talking about smothering Julia. The rest was complete and utter crap. The ending was not expected. Just kidding. The plot outline had nothing but gooey love crap behind it, and maybe some hair balls and penis references. Michael Jackson spoofs were quite funny, simply because he was in the background, whilst the nauseating \"actors\" were int he foreground. Sophie Monk, that hideous bucked tooth woman, took up about a good 40 minutes of this movie. Not only can she not act, but she also can't sing, dance, or look good. Her part in the movie didn't so much as make it better, it made it dreadful. Too much Sophie Monk makes any person want to be propelled into a brick wall. Fair enough she's Australian, but also fair enough she is scamming into any movie she can get her hands onto. If you like seeing movies, don't be swayed to see this one. This is not a movie. This is some retarded puzzle that no one quite can fit together. Not all it's cracked up to be. The ad's lie. Your friends lie. I don't.",

This has to be the worst comedy released in years, zero out of ten would have been too generous. Part of me hopes that this film has lost something in it's journey over the Atlantic and that it may make someone laugh in North America. I'll give that continent some credit and I'm pretty sure that it won't.I don't remember laughing once throughout this (thankfully short) film. Date Movie is a new super-hybrid genre of comedy that must only amuse Hollywood Executives during their pitching meetings - like a dog whistle it's gags are totally inaudible to humans.In short if you want to see something better than this, de-tune your TV and sit and watch static for 83 minutes.",

I think i might of barfed at some point if i didn't cover my ears and get my friend to cover my eyes. The date movie is said to have 2 out of the 6 writers of scary movie, but it seems as though all 6 are needed to produce something as funny and good as the scary movies. I personally like the scary movies and thought this would be something like them. But the date movie dosn't compare. The scary movies use one movie for the basic plot, and then use a few other movies for basic jokes. The date movie has its own plot line, and uses too many movies to get jokes. It makes it seem as if they were desperate to make a funny movie, so they had to stick all these other movies to try and make it funny. I rate it a 3/10 because it was disgusting and not funny at all. The only fun I had watching it was naming the movie(s) it was referring to in EVERY scene. I recommend you don't watch this movie. Or at least wait until your friend buys or rents it so you don't have to spend the money :P .",

But the sane people surely will accord to me with the fact that if anyone want to see a real romantic/comic/action movie can rent it and stop.

Where there any writers involve in this? They just throw parts of other movies randomly and they didn't even try to male it funny. I really can't explain what's happening lately with all these Teen Comedies coming out from Hollywood, hardly any of them are worth watching.

Things like a cat taking a really noisy and long BM on the toilet. In concept that sort of thing is hilarious to me, yet the filmmakers of Date Movie managed to somehow make this extremely unfunny. One of the biggest downfalls of this is that they are spoofing comedies. I'm not the smartest fella, but isn't the point of spoof to poke fun at something that takes itself seriously?

The film is vulgar and pointless and it is like a broken record, and it repeats the same unfunny gags and jokes again and again. The movie makes no sense. The movie makes fun of romantic films and it is about an overweight girl who falls in love with a man with a British Accent. Many unfunny gags are used such as a cat making bodily dysfunctions on the toilet and a girl with an over sized butt. The film doesn't even parody the romantic movies, the film just makes them look far better. I didn't laugh once during the whole thing, and the definition of a parody is to make laughs. And that I didn't laugh at all is saying something because I thought that Epic Movie and Vampires Suck were both funny. To summarize this, this movie fails to do what other parody movies have done:exaggerate the parts/elements of a movie to the extent that it is funny. They don't exaggerate, they come up with non-relevant scenes that doesn't pertain at all to a parody movie. This movie is not worth your time. I am trying to save you from this horrible movie.",

I'm not at all offended in any way by constant fart jokes and jokes involving squeezing spots, but is it really necessary to make an entire movie out of these two subjects? I felt truly embarrassed to watch this film, and in the scene where the old lady is kissing a puppet of a cat, I couldn't help but think, she's probably someones grandmother, I hope she got payed well for this film.Neither my Brother of I laughed even ONCE during this film, the thing is, if you like this kind of thing then the Scary movie films do it much better, or even just watch Meet The Parents, it's way better than any part of this film.The plot is rubbish, the acting is okay, but they don't really have much to work with, and the scenes are not tied together in any sort of coherent fashion, they seem to have been thrown together with little to no attention payed to pacing or character development. I know this is a spoof movie, and I know you should definitely suspend belief before watching anything like this, but this film is an INSULT to cinema goers the world over. I really don't feel I am over stating myself at all there, neither am I being too harsh.Give this film a seriously wide berth, the only positive I can offer up is that on the DVD there is a commentary track by two film critics who quite obviously thought as little of this movie as I did, and listening to them is in fact much funnier than the film itself.I only wish there was a negative points out of ten option on this site, and that it went way over 10.",

Alyson Hannigan is not a leading lady, she cant carry it off unlike other teen movie stars (eg, Gellar, Love Hewitt), let alone in a movie like this.

The movie used extremely crude and disgusting humor that only appeals to people who are 10 years old or younger, but contains many scenes not suited for that age group, so I have no idea who the target audience for this movie was. I thoroughly enjoyed Not Another Teen Movie, but this movie was nothing like it. This movie took funny jokes from good movies such as Meet the parents and turned them into awful jokes that were done in extremely bad taste. The best way to describe it is that the crude and disgusting humor in this movie was way over the top. I went with some friends to go see it and it was my suggestion to go. I am completely embarrassed. I watched the entire first hour and the only reason I did was I kept hoping the humor would improve. In the end I gave up and left.",

            "content": "Rarely in the course of cinematic history has a film attempted so little while simultaneously accomplishing so little of what it attempted. Date Movie ostensibly parodies dozens of films, prominent among them My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers, and Guess Who. This may sound ambitious, but that proves not to be the case. Rather than exaggerating these superior films for comic effect, Date Movie settles for merely incorporating their basic plot elements in a stupid way. Entirely absent is the creative spark which enlivened comedy classics such as Airplane, Top Secret, The Naked Gun, and even to some extent Scary Movie 3. Instead we have a film which is better made but actually less entertaining than many of the unintentional comedies on the IMDb Bottom 100. After watching this, I truly longed to see Manos: Hands of Fate.Date Movie has reasonably strong performances and production values, but wastes them on an utterly banal script. Poor Alyson Hannigan deserves better than this, a film which causes viewers to reminisce about American Pie with reverential awe. I would damn this film with faint praise, and say that it contained a handful of funny moments; however, it contained only five, precisely one for each finger. That works out to about one laugh every fifteen minutes in this mercifully short movie. Mostly Date Movie just induces cringes: cringes of embarrassment for the producers, screenwriters, actors, and director.To its credit, Date Movie is not nearly as raunchy as it could have been. However, if any couple on a date actually watched it, they doubtless ended up acting out all that the movie failed to show, in a frenzied attempt to distract themselves from the enervating images on screen. I don't endorse \"nookie\" in theaters, but if a child were to be conceived during the course of this movie, it would at least represent the creation of life - an eventuality more satisfactory than this listless, lifeless, languorous waste of celluloid. That's what ultimately makes Date Movie such an inexcusable film: not that it's so bad per se, but that it's just so boring.",

Also, I happen to like Alison Hannigan, so I was quite happy when I heard about it. I was excited, until I had a chance to go see it in theaters. It started strong, but it lost me about halfway through the movie. Although it did spoof many of the romantic comedies out there, I was kind of upset that it did not go after some movies that were screaming to be spoofed. I would have loved to have seen a spoof of Duece Bigalow. I think that would have been excellent. Something else, I did like the Napolean Dynamite character. I would have also like to have seen a spoof of Maid in Manhatten somewhere in there. The male lead was poorly cast though, I did not like the gentlemen playing her fianc\u00e9.

The rest was too rotten for words. I guess many have erased that film from their minds.I think Date Movie does have some amusing moments. I didn't feel the Napoleon Dynamite send up was dated, I chuckled along with that one. The nod to Mr and Mrs Smith raised a genuine smile or 2 and I think the 2 actors acting in THAT scene was effective. Allyson Hannigan is likable, but you couldn't help but feeling sorry for her in most of this movie. And Eddie Griffin has some talent with comic roles, although no one could save that awfully stupid hairball out of the mouth scene.But I agree, this film mostly just took already good scenes from other movies and took those jokes too far, to embarrassing awkward extremely unfunny levels. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And the pacing and flow of the film was all over the place. Oh yeah, and wasn't it just hilarious the cameo from Lil John, the guy knows how to turn on the wit and charm, for sure!

There wasn't a single original thought in the film. The point of a parody is to take a scene from another movie and add a satirical element to it that generates humor. This movie seems to be content in just shoving in scenes from other movies, without any humorous elements added. For example they were in the middle of a Kill Bill parody scene when they cut to a flashback sequence of alyson hannigan in bed getting hit by a character from dodgeball, then back to the kill bill parody which in itself ended up being pretty poor. In the end, all the parodies were less than funny. Nothing like the fun \"Not Another Teen Movie\" and the \"Scary Movie\" franchises.

Although Alyson Hannigan does a yeoman's job of holding it all together it is really nothing but one gross out joke after another. Many of the gags are dragged out way beyond the limits of tolerance. I can see this appealing to the very mindless...and I even laughed a few times... but the only joy in this movie is watching the skill of the actors in working to try to pull it off. Hannigan, Willard and Coolidge were all abused in the making of this movie, in my mind. It is hard to believe the \"writers\" (in quotations because I don't think they wrote much here) have a respect for Hannigan as presumably indicated by the fact that they went to her saying they wrote this movie for her. Her talents far surpass the level of this movie and I am embarrassed for her having done this movie. In writing this movie for her was their intention to kill her career?

This movie can be compared to the Scary Movie series but spoofing romantic-comedy movies and turning them into senseless humor. The jokes are funny, some scenes made me chucle more than others, and a few made me laugh till i cried (yes.. i do that..). my advice is don't judge this movie before seeing it. it deserves to be watched.",

            "content": "To start off, I knew exactly what I was getting into by choosing this film. My girlfriend and I saw this about 2 weeks ago. We'd been dating for awhile, and realized that we had yet to see a movie together. We come from a fairly uneventful town known as Knoxville, TN, which is severely lacking in things to do (unless you're into \"frat-boy\" type clubs). But about a year ago, they built this HUGE theater with 20 or so screens. So it's not so much that \"Date Movie\" was a bad film, but rather, in a list of roughly 20 films, it was the only thing we found that looked remotely enjoyable. How sad is that? Anyway\u0085 As far as the film goes, it breaks down like this. For every laugh (and to be fair, there are some), you have to sit through roughly 15-20 minutes of nothing in between. While I'm sure I'm in the minority here, I thought the stuff with the puppet cat was pretty funny. Unoriginal? Sure. But what can I say? Call me a moron, but I got some laughs out of it. But I found myself wishing I was watching a whole movie about this cat, because unoriginal as it may be, it was a VERY convincing puppet. Think about it. Coming this summer\u0085 \"Jinxers!\" This cat could go on an adventure with other animal friends, kinda like a \"Milo and Otis\" parody or something.The rest of the movie, however, was worse than when the SNL cast is in the middle of a skit, no one is laughing, and they still have 12 minutes to fill before a commercial break. I totally agree with one of the previous reviews, in that the jokes are uninspired, and just flat out make no sense whatsoever. I mean, I could whip out my camcorder, run around my house farting and burping, post the AVI on the internet, and I'd get about the same reaction. Again, pretty sad, no? It should also be noted that sitting in front of us was a group of kids (about 5 or 6 of them, the oldest of which couldn't have been more than 13), and they weren't laughing AT ALL. Maybe because they're more amused by the jokes they tell to each other in their grammar school cafeteria. So they've either got the next Chris Farley sitting at their table during lunch, or this movie just sucks that bad.Stay home.",

Not nearly as good as any Scary Movie, but still doesn't deserve to be on the bottom 100. I agree, almost every part involving the woman was pathetic, and very boring.

The film has no sense of high-brow comedy that can be expected from a parody or satire. It even lacks the quick pacing of a farce. It is slow and droll, and the constant repetition of rap/r&b music for laughs is so see through. \"Look, how funny!! Two stuffy white people speaking the lyrics of 'Candy Shop' by Fitty Cent!\" ... err... not funny at all.Film could have been easily been more high brow and layered but it was stupid, low-brow comedy (and even lowbrow comedy can be appreciated sometimes, but not when its as in-your-face and repetitious as this.)

I honestly believe that the best parts of the movie were for one, the previews, and two, the 10 second period of having my eyes closed out of sheer disgust. I highly suggest that anyone thinking of seeing this movie should first be warned that those few moments between scenes when nothing is going on will be the best parts. Yes, i did laugh, but the reason i laughed the few times i did was because some parts were mildly funny but they were so overpowered by the sheer badness of the movie that I believe that i actually cried, and thats not a joke. Movies like this just make me wonder how such HORRIBLE movies can make fun of some decent movies. Its actually funny, that i like almost every movie that i have ever seen, except this one. I walked away from the theater terrified and wondering if I will ever be back. I lost all respect for all actors in that movie, most of whom i liked before.

I don't think there was one point where i got bored from all the randomness and laughter that came out of me and my friends. We had good fun identifying which movies were being spoofed. Its not a completely serious movie which is a good change from all the serious movies out these days. I'd say this movie is for people who don't take things seriously and can relax and have fun. Aimed at the whole teen generation and anyone who's up for a laugh but not for people who take things seriously. So sit back, relax an get some cold beers on the go!",

Without a doubt, THE WORST movie I've ever wasted my time and money on!There is nothing else that I can say except that it was a waste of time. You could just go out and rent all of the romantic comedies that it was supposedly parodying and watch them. There was really nothing about this movie that was unique or in any way entertaining... (except maybe when the two characters beat up that bum. That was kind of funny, but if I hadn't laughed at that, I would have nothing to laugh at.)Date movie contains references and plot thefts from the following movies: Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents/Fockers, The Wedding Planner, My Best Friend's Wedding, When Harry Met Sally, Hitch, and I think even Wedding Crashers. Rent all of these movies, they are all GREAT romantic comedies, and are wonderful to watch. Date Movie, however, cut-and-pasted these films together, stringing in some different forms of vulgarity, and ended up with a choppy, sloppy, ill-directed, poorly written pot of junk. Slap a claim that 2 of the 6 writers from Scary Movie(s) participated, and I fell for it like everyone else who went to see this monstrosity. Do yourself a favor and pretend this was never released, and you will be blissfully ignorant to the horrors encountered while watching Date Movie.",

I thought it was pretty funny too!**may be spoilers below, but not sure**There is a spoof of King Kong at the end of the movie that is great! Carmen Electra plays the Anne character, like in Kong. And I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a cat taking a dump! The fart sounds were explosively hilarious, emphasis on explosive. I would say that it is also, for a spoof movie, incredibly \"chick flicky\". So not only would a guys like this, see above stated jokes, but I think a girl might like this too because they spoof A LOT of chick flicks, \"at least from what I've heard O:)\" and girls might have a good time laughing and recognizing their fav. type of movie.

            "content": "Before reading, please note that this review reveals a few plot details and jokes in the movie.Spoof movies aren't really common enough today, so whenever I see a trailer for one, I am immediately enthusiastic for it. Date Movie was no different- I thought it was about time somebody made fun of Romantic movies, and I was really ready for a movie to put the hammer to the Napoleon Dynamite craze- I thought this movie would probably do these things perfectly, and rank right up there with the original Scary Movie... For the most part, I was dead wrong.Date Movie tries so desperately hard to generate laughs- it seems that jokes happens constantly. The problem is that most of these are not really jokes, because they are not funny. Most of the jokes are lame and immature, things that my buddies and I could've thought of in Seventh grade. For those of you who have moved on since Jr. High, I think its safe to say that watching an hour and a half of this stuff is would not turn out to be a good time. From the point where you watch \"Jinxers\" take a nice, 2 minute dump (seriously, the scene is like two minutes of a cat sitting on a toilet farting), till you see the Paris Hilton clone rubbing a cheeseburger in her cleavage, you'll know that this is immature comedy- and probably at its worst.If you're expecting a mind blowing story, I don't know why you're considering to watch a spoof movie. However, this is really bad, even for its genre. Usually a Spoofs storyline can at least be enjoyable. Not Date Movie's! This really doesn't even seem to have a storyline, just a little path it follows while it bombards you with jokes. For what little there is, you can tell that the movie is basically about a girl named Julia (Hannigan) who is struggling with her love life until she gets \"pimped\" (one of the funnier parts of the movie) and meets the man of her dreams, Grant. (I can't think of his name, and I don't want to look it up- He sucked.) throughout the movie you see them going throug their relationship, meeting each others parents, that sort of thing. Then Grants ex girlfriend (Sophie Monk) butts into the relationship, and other stuff happens... as you can tell, not a whole lot of thought put into the storyline, they didn't really even attempt to make the storyline itself funny. Perhaps the whole point of a crappy storyline was to illustrate how terrible most romantic films storyline's are- doubtful, but it would make sense I guess.The acting in this movie was pretty bad too- Alyson Hannigan does a decent job as the main character, and Eddie Griffen (who seems to be the bright spot in a whole lot of crappy movies) is pretty funny, but his role isn't big enough to give the movie a bit of a boost. Other than that, every other actor in the movie seemed to do a pretty crappy job, although I liked the spoofs of J-Lo and Barbara Streisand's Meet the Focker's character. Oh, and to Josh Myers, I've seen 8 year olds do better Napoleon Dynamite impersonations. Give me a break man.Now onto the part of the review that looks on the bright-side of the movie (also known as the short part.) A few jokes are pretty hilarious once you wade through the onslaught of crap the movie throws at you. I'll admit that I was laughing my head off during the Michael Jackson part, and a lot of the Meet the Parents/Focker's scenes were good, but perhaps a little too gross. The movie doesn't start out terribly either, but after the Meet the Fockers part, the movie starts getting boring and sort of drags its heels the rest of the way.In conclusion, for a movie that makes fun of everything from Bridget Jones Diary to Hungry Man TV Dinners, Date movie was a disappointment, and just not very good. I first watched this movie with two of my friends, and we laughed quite a bit, but for each laugh there seemed to be 3 or 4 groans of disgust at a stupid part. This movie probably isn't worth seeing at all, but if you see it on TV one day and you're really, really bored, you might not have such a bad time. But I don't recommend spending money to watch just it, the movie is just not good enough to trigger the use of your wallet.",

When they approached something that had a shred of potential, they took it so far that it was painfully annoying. I actually stopped what I was doing right now and logged on to IMDb just to comment on how terrible this movie is. I watched it with three other people; we're not even sure if two of them are going to make it after this. Please please please, don't watch this movie. I am a firm believer that one can take something from every movie. This film destroyed that theory. Just Google pictures of Sophie Monk, and you'll have everything this movie had to offer.

I've walked out of movies better than this, but it's suckiness was hypnotizing, and I kept waiting for it to get better. Sadly, it never did. Instead you have a movie that was written by people who lack any sense of humor. A woman washing a car is sexy, but when you make her rub herself during that scene with hamburgers, it's not sexy. Nor is it hilarious, funny, or even mildly amusing. You end up wondering why someone would really think this is funny, or that they wasted a perfectly good hamburger to make this garbage pile of movie.If your faced with a choice between this movie and swallowing 23,000 cyanide pills, suicide is your only option.",

I hoped for parody movie that would be halfway as good as \"Airplane\" or the original \"Hot Shots.\" This movie made those above-average films look like a Hollywood legendary comedy like \"Dr. Stranglove\" or \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.\" To be sure the movie did have a few chuckles, but the comedy was mostly an exercise of crossing the line of crudeness into just embarrassingly bad and just mean. If you find fat jokes ad nauseum and beating up on homeless people hilarious, enjoy. It was one of those movies that you walk in the theater with a premonition that it would suck.

It was also nice to see Fred Willard which proved his valuable comedic role as Ed Harkin in the movie Anchorman.

If you're looking for a seriously stupid comedy with some bathroom and sex humor, you should see this.

The whole point of this movie is for it to be a bit childish and vulgar. It's thriving on the American Pie wave. I don't know what people expected when they went to the theater and got disappointed.

The fat jokes at the start are a case in point - though the bit where they pimped her up was reasonably funny.

From the messed up music sequences, crappy sentences, awful dialog, and worst comedy that ever came to film this peace of master crap doesn't deserve to even be stored into a videostore; that's how bad it is. I kicked myself in the head for a good 2 hours after watching this wanting to kill my girlfriend for making me see this + I also smoked about a pack of cigarettes in order to calm down and try to forget what I saw.Basically, the movie is supposed to be a parody, mostly like the \"Scary Movie\", well it came from some of the same writers didn't it. However, it fails so miserably in laughing at others as that it turns the laughter back at itself, and after a while the laughter becomes a sorrowful look on the face while holding your head with two forefingers and shaking it from side to side in awe how can someone make something that gazantously and horrifically bad. The movies that are 'made fun of' here are about 4 years old and have already been laughed at. Some of the movies being 'laughed at' are actually comedies with actual total copying and sequencing of parts of those comedies, e.g. Meet the Parents which was made in 2000, making it 6 years old... yea they copied ENTIRELY the scene where Ben Stiller knocks over the vase of girls fathers grandmothers ashes.I have probably already mentioned how bad this movie is, this is why I gave it a 1, but I would actually like to give it a minus billion if I could and I am not gonna stop at that when I say this was the worst piece of s*** the film industry has ever made.

There was hardly a plot and the movie jumped around completely from scene to scene just to include a reenactment of a scene from a movie. Actually, most of the movies they did \"parodies\" of weren't even romantic ones. They were just movies that happened to have some sort of love scene in it at one point or another. As I watched the movie I began to wonder why good, funny actors such as Fred Willard were in such a horrible, awful movie. I don't remember laughing once. Of course, that's excluding the times I laughed AT it and how stupid it was. By the way, I've never seen so many white people trying to be black in this movie either. The directors of this movie were trying way to hard to get a laugh out of people.

The one funny thing in the film was a background shot with Michael Jackson luring a child with a teddy, but that joke has been done already, a million times. I expected more, scary movie was sometimes too stupid too laugh at, but in parts also made me crease, this made me want to start a rampage to get the film taken off the screen. I love films and have never wanted to walk out of the cinema, until i saw this film, because oh my god, it was crap. this film should come with a warning, telling you just how bad it is, and to stay away if you have any respect for the art that is film making.

Me and my friends are only 15, and we found that this movie was absolutely awful, unfunny, immature and, to be frank, embarrassing to watch. There were points when i wanted to walk out and ask for my money back, such as in the Meet The Parents seen where the cat is crapping on the toilet for about 3 minutes and then humping a corpse. I think that Alyson Hannigan has really degraded herself by starring in this film, and if i had been involved with the making of this film in the slightest i would be too embarrassed to go outside ever again. It was truly awful. And it didn't help that the cinema was full of kids laughing hysterically at the most unfunny hings, and loudly going \"urrrrgh\" at all the disgusting parts.

Unfortunately the cinema was full of chavs who found it hilarious. One part of Date Movie nearly made me heave. I am not joking. In the millionth parody of Meet the Fockers during a basketball scene whoever plays the father of Alyson Hannigan gets chest hair in his mouth. It was truly disgusting. I chose this moment to close my eyes and i thank fully fell asleep. Sadly when i woke up the film was still going on. The spot squeezing scene was unnecessary and childish. That description could be used for every scene in the film along with the words, pointless, cringworthy, degrading, unfunny and plain stupid. The jokes are unthought through untopical.

In fact, I really enjoyed reading the bad reviews, i've never seen a movie so conclusively and consistently panned before.The reviews were so uniform I almost didn't watch the movie. But what the hell, I just HAD to see for myself. Could it REALLY be THAT bad? Well... no. Actually, not only was it NOT as awful as people were saying, I really rather enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't an instant classic or a literary masterpiece, but what spoof is? This made me think... how come I enjoyed it when so many people seemed to hate it? It almost suggests that either I'm utterly weird (I don't really think I am), incredibly childish (um.. no... not that I know of) or the people who write reviews on IMDb are cut from similar cloth.In fact, the movie really IS quite funny, as long as you enjoy this sort of comedy. The person who compared it to Kung Pow was on the mark, I think. If you liked Kung Pow's humour, you'll probably like this. But I don't agree that it was anywhere near as sick as most people painted it. Some of the American Pie stuff was as gross as this, and don't even get me started on \"Freddie Got Fingered\" or \"Something About Mary.\" This is no worse than the nasty bits in those, so if you can get behind this sort of humour you won't come out morally outraged.The comments about it \"having no plot\" and the parodies seeming \"pointless and too sudden\" are, in my opinion, absolute nonsense. It's a very silly movie, don't get me wrong, but it WANTS to be a silly movie. It was made for people who like silly movies. It's the perfect counterbalance to the bloated full-of-their-own-importance movies of the moment.As for the \"awful degradation\" of the homeless, the fat, midgets etc etc etc.... I can't help but think the people who write these reviews aren't anywhere near as smart as they like to think they are. This is a SPOOF. All the things that this movie takes shots at come from *other* movies, or TV shows, or whatever. This is just putting a light on things that are done elsewhere. That's what a parody DOES.Lots of people complained that the movie Parodies good movies they enjoyed like \"Meet The Parents\". Sure, it does. But a parody isn't an insult. A parody is a poke of fun which carries with it some respect for the original, or at least an appreciation that the film is worth a parody. I can't understand the comments that \"it just repeats the scene and adds nothing\". That's completely wrong. Take the scene where the Vase is hit thats from Meet The Parents. That's not a copy. Something is definitely added, and I thought it was pretty clever and very funny. All the clips from other movies were well done and amusing.If you are a fully-paid card-carrying member of the politically-correct brigade you will hate, hate, hate this movie. And you will try to run down anybody who doesn't agree with you.The main problem with this movie is that its a little TOO clever and subtle to reach some of its audience, but its way too puerile to satisfy the intellectuals. Oh and the liberal crusaders are going to hate every second of it. So, whose gonna like it? Well... all those people in the middle, I guess. And me, for sure.",

My favorite part of the movie is the \"Pimp My Ride\" segment, ('corse I love that show anyway). If it were only that easy in real life... Thanks in advance if you know the answer.",

Any way, sure Scary Movie was funny, not another teen movie was funny, but this one outmatched them all! Not only does it make fun of the corny other movies but it makes them seem funnier! Like Jlo's butt in The Wedding Planer, and in this movie it makes it seem more hilarious! Meet the Fockers is made fun of, Hitch, Meet the Parents, etc. It makes fun of them while there trying to have humor in it as well!",

However, to the teenage American populace I believe this movie would be quite funny. Although I do agree that certain scenes were carried on for too long, and that others yet may have been done better, one must take into account that all movies have shortcomings. There is no such thing as a perfect movie; Someone will always find something wrong with it.Anyways, people who should watch this movie include teens who found the Scary Movie series funny, as well as persons who have actually seen the films it parodies and are up for a good laugh. - A good (and probably crude) sense of humor is required to enjoy this film.It is not the best comedy I have seen, however it is also not as bad as the previous commenter makes it out to be. Personally, I find butterfly effect to be much worse.Also, box office sales are not falling because of movies like this one, they are falling because of people who cannot distinguish between movies to see in theatres and movies to see at home.",

In a nutshell, the film is about an obese woman who gets an \"extreme makeover\" and continues to join a bachelor show. After meeting her knight in shining armor, she experiences a bundle of knock offs of other comedies including Meet the Fockers, Napolean Dynamite, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Kill Bill.

I know a spoof on movies loses originality, but come on you already have the material in front of you and you can't even put a slight spin on it to make it funnier than it was when we first saw it in the original film.

The \"Kill Bill\" parody is the extreme low point of this film. The parodies are thrown together one after the other, with no cohesion at all. I understand that parodies need not have a masterful storyline; I did not pop in \"Date Movie\" expecting to see \"Citizen Kane\". However, I did not pop in \"Date Movie\" expecting to see a storyline that an episode of \"Boobah\" could put to shame. There is nothing holding this plot together. We run haphazardly from a \"Wedding Planner\" parody to a \"Meet The Fockers\" parody to a \"Kill Bill\" parody right back to \"The Wedding Planner\".

Date Movie takes every potential gag too far and, after it's finished ruining just about every decent romantic comedy, it even resorts to shamelessly parodying TV shows and adverts to try and get a few cheap laughs (which it doesn't). Just when you think that 'Date Movie' can't get any worse, it does, as it progresses from a terrible 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' parody to an even worse 'Meet the Fockers' spoof. The only thing less funny than this movie is the knowledge that I wasted \u00a36 and 2 hours of my life watching it. 'Date Movie' is without doubt the worst parody movie ever made. Don't go see this movie under any circumstances. It ruined my day.",

That is what you should expect, and if you want more you will just be disappointed.If you are looking for something to stimulate your intellectuality, then perhaps you should try books instead?

Now I wish I had returned it unwatched! While there were maybe two scenes that produced a laugh, most of it was gross, offensive, boring, confusing(did anyone else understand the \"Kronking\" dance scene besides Lil Jon?)and uncomfortable watching the expressions on the actors' face as they asked themselves \"I went to Juilliard for this?!?\" Why Alyson Hannigan was in this \"film\" at all was a mystery. Shes so pretty and talented - she obviously is trying very hard to do a good job, which she did with the little material there was there. On the rental box, it showed \"Napolean Dynamite\" and the Owen Wilson character from Wedding Crashers as if they were main characters - they were on screen for like two minutes. Everything was cobbled together from the \"J-ello\" character to the odd, out of place \"Kill Bill\" and \"LOTR\" references. Yes, it was a funny idea that Frodo would sell the ring to get some booze and hookers, but the way it was written was NOT funny at all. Most date movies need to be parodied...unfortunately, this was not even a passable parody.(That would be Scary Movie 3.)The oddest scenes didn't even seem funny - from \"rolling\" the drunk on their first date to the so disgusting I shut my eyes(really, I did)scene where Eddie Griffin gets a hairball from Fred Willard to the Jinxers and the corpse (horrible! shame on you \"two out of the four Scary Movie writers\" that wrote this crap.) However, I did think the cat on the toilet scene was hilarious as well as the Kill Bill scene where the answering machine is thinking of the hot girl, Andy, along with everyone else. Why Lil Jon and Carmen Electra were ever in there was beyond me. Lil Jon is awesome, but wasted by just saying his tag-line and going home. And Carmen Electra being stroked by Kong's finger? I was like what the heck? Carmen was reduced to basically a Barbie doll in the small scene she was in! A friend and I used to write movie parodies in high school, but we were basically screwing around. Now I think maybe we should be Hollywood writers as our worst material was better than this stuff!

            "content": "Firstly, I would like to say that, as a lot of other people, I had that sinking feeling in my gut even before the movie was released. Why, you ask? Well, I'm not usually a person who gets influenced by reviews a lot, but looking at the comments and score on this site really set me thinking.Secondly, over here, the movie was rated as 'NC-16', which translates to 'No-Children Under 16'. At first, I was cursing, once again, the wonders of the ratings system, which supposedly prevented precocious and naive young kids such as myself from getting influenced by too many swear words and a whole lot of nudity/\"sexual content\".And so, I come to the main point: For once in my life, I say thank you to the ratings board for rating this piece of ATROCIOUS, DISGUSTING crap as it is. Resorting to watching the movie via another method *whistles*, I was relatively happy at the thought of getting such a gem, as I thought, for free. When the first scene with Napoleon Dynamite appeared, I wasn't sure of what I should do. Laugh? Possibly. I had had a good time watching ND, so it seemed like the safe choice. So, laugh I did, but it was more to make some light out of the situation, especially when he started his 'GOD!' rampage.But what is a typical American movie without its gross-out and tasteless moments? When the cat started having sex with the corpse, I felt sick to my very core, and as all of my friends tell anyone, I am a very big sadist and lover of gore and morbidity. I was watching this instead of studying for my examinations, which were the next day. I'll admit: The LOTR scene elicited a laugh or two from me. The Owen Wilson lookalike at the end was also relatively funny, but that's about it for half-decent scenes. If beating up a vagrant is the writers' idea of 'funny', then all of us might as well drill a hole in our heads and were hats on our bottoms right now.I probably should end this little tirade with a tinge of sympathy for those who paid to watch it. You should probably request your money back, and I should go and make the producers retake my examination for me if I do badly. How about making a movie out of that? We could call it, say, Dead Movie?",

            "content": "If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh hard and has a jumbled story line, then Date Movie is for you! Around every corner of every scene there is a twist or turn that will leave you tickled pink, but don't plan on seeing any true story line that adds up and makes much sense. If you have seen any of the Scary Movies, then you will have an idea of why this film was made and what it is comprised of. If not, this movie was made to poke fun at some of the most adored date films, and other super-crazy events that have happened with celebrities. This film is full of giddy, and professionally funny actors and actresses. The movie follows Julie Jones, actress Alyson Hannigan, on her quest to find a true love that she will hopefully someday marry. The versatile Adam Campbell plays the man of her dreams Grant Funkyerdoder. Julie has a quiet, yet straight forward mother, and a stubborn-minded, determined father Frank, who is played by Eddie Griffin. Grant's mother is sexually funny and played by Jennifer Coolidge. His hairy, simple-minded father is played by Fred Willard. Finally, the sexy, mean antagonist Andy is portrayed by Sophie Monk. With a magnificent cast and a plethora of movies to make parodies out of, this film was thrown together and into the theaters.As soon as Date Movie began a horde of movie titles ran through my head, and I tried to imagine what was in store for me. As the movie progressed I was amazed at how many different movies were incorporated within an hour and twenty-five minutes. My Big Fat Greek Weeding, Hitch, Pretty Woman, and Meet the Fockers are just a few of the many that were reinvented in a humorous way in this movie. There were even some little surprises that stuck out like a sore thumb and caught my attention that dealt with celebrities in the news. For example, the Michael Jackson's ordeal got a pun in the movie. It was extremely easy to realize what movie was being used for the parody in each scene because of the excellent choice of costuming by Alex Friedberg. The choices were astonishing and helped distinguish who the actors were imitating. For instance, a flashback takes us to the movie Pretty Woman where the actor is wearing almost the exact outfit that Julia Roberts wore in the beginning of her film. If the actor would have been wearing anything different, it would have just been a weird scene with no connection to another movie. Costuming also played a favorable part with the character's moods and meaning in the film. Julie Jones played a woman who had a great outlook on life, and therefore she was always shown in bright colors. The only times she did not wear the colors of the rainbow was when she had a makeover and was then a mystery, and when she was feeling the blues and wore a dark green top and black skirt. Andy, the envy of Julie, seemed to always been in black depicting the hate relationships between the two. In one scene, where the majority of the cast were eating dinner, Andy was the only one in a dark color which made her evil noticeable. In all, this film encompassed an assortment of date related movies that were hilarious and highlighted through costuming.Any normal movie critic is going to bash this movie because of its lack of a story line. What people fail to realize is that this movie wasn't supposed to be this super awesome dating movie that would make sense. It is a movie that makes fun of a multitude of other dating films. The targeted audience was set for people who are looking for a good laugh, and possibly have ADD (attention deficit disorder). There are so many jump cuts in this film that you can't imagine what is going to happen next. What would you expect from a film that is trying to incorporate numerous scenes from different movies into one? Being surprised by what just happened in a scene is what the directors looked for, not for the movie to make total sense.In conclusion, if you are looking for a good laugh and don't plan on analyzing this entire movie for a story line, then Date Movie is for you. I enjoyed this movie to the fullest extent. Maybe it is because I have a sense of humor and a little ADD, or it could have been because of the simple fact that it incorporated a multitude of movies where the costuming connected each one, and the jumble story line the let the directors make the film ridiculously funny.",

The whole movie simply falls flat and I won't be surprised that movies critics won't even waste their time commenting it. Do yourself a favour and skip this for something more meaningful to your life.Date Movie will go into the history book as the lowest film standard a Hollywood film can be. I don't usually rate anything as 'awful', but I simply cannot find anything nice to talk about it. Feeling sorry that my first comment on IMDb has to be this depressing. If after seeing so many warnings here you still pay to watch this film, I'd think that's utterly foolish. And if you find it funny or interesting, I would suggest some serious mental check-up.",

            "content": "Possibly not the worst movie I've ever seen, but pretty close.I went with a large group of friends (aged 15-17) and I must admit, we did laugh a few times, and we did manage to watch the whole movie, but the number of times the entire group laughed didn't seem to outweigh the number of times we winced or said \"Ew!\".The entire movie was a string of cheap laughs and badly done parodies, some of which were an exact replica of the original films, e.g. the Meet The Fockers scenes. Also, the Kill Bill scene didn't make sense because it's not even a date movie, and it wasn't like it led anywhere, so it was completely unnecessary. As for the jokes; occasionally funny, usually disgusting. The cat, Jinx, caused most of my disgust. The toilet scene was gross and dragged out and the scene with the remains of the dead mother was just corrupt. After that scene, we saw an elderly woman leave with what seemed to be her granddaughter, which was not a surprise. Even Julia's father coughing up a hairball turned my stomach slightly.The film should not be a 12A, meaning that children under 12 can see it with parental supervision, which I find shocking, it should be a 15, in my opinion.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless I warned them about all of the above and I knew that they could stomach the films content.",

I'm not even sure if the plot had any meaning at all. The characters also had confusing personalities. I mean, at one point of the movie, the characters had a specific attitude, and all of a sudden, they would be a completely different character. It's like the viewer can't even have a chance to sort of \"get-to-know\" the character.I suppose this movie isn't like other movies that would create an impact or give a different view. And to me, this movie seemed a complete waste of film. All in all, this movie was just pointless.",
