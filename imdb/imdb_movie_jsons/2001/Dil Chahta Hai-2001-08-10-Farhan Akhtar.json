            "content": "DCH is like a breath of fresh air. It shows how bringing youth into an industry is always a good thing. Just compare this film with Yaadein, from Bollywood veteran Subash Ghai.Where as Yaadein is probably one of the worst things to come out of a camera, DCH is one the best. It's just one of those films you'll find hard not to like, basically because it's exactly how the medium of Indian films should be used.Rather than just cut and paste a song into the film, the filmmakers have done very well to make each song feel wanted, visually interesting, and they never drag. The result is a near 3hr film that just flies by. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work, and some truly excellent casting. Everyone carries the film, and the 3 guys, Safi, Akshay and Aamir are too good together!Hopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. Technically DCH can easily stand up against anything from the West. Editing, Directing, Cinematography, lighting, set design -- everything just works so well.Sometimes Bollywood can produce some truly great films, and this is most definately one of them!! You must watch it.",

            "content": "Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident. The acting is just phenomenal. All-star cast. All-good film. The story is great - plenty of laughs to be had here, with sad moments, too. The acting is A-Grade",

            "review_title": "the most realistic depiction of Indian youth in Bollywood",
            "content": "After a string of Bollywood stinkers, this film was a breath of fresh air! Upon first glance, it might seem like the story has been rehashed from the plotlines of several other Indian films. But the presentation blew me away! Yes, I agree that Dil Chahta Hai has been heavily influenced by the Hollywood style of filmmaking. But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning, thus making DCH a thousand times better than other \"Hollywood-wannabees\".Another thing that you might notice while watching the film is that there is not much of a plot. It just... floats along. But that's what makes it great; you never know where the next scene might lead you. What ties the story together is the bond of friendship shared by the three main leads. All the performances were terrific, especially Aamir Khan, who is probably the most respected actor of his generation.Ultimately, what's great about the film is that it connects to the youth. The depiction of youth is so dead-on and realistic that you would be disgusted at the way youth is treated in other Bollywood films, where every college student aside from the hero/heroine are party-going idiots or jittery nerds! In DCH, however, the people talk like how they're supposed to talk, and nothing seems unrealistic about their personality. While watching the film, it becomes quite evident that Farhan Akhtar belongs to a breed of young, talented directors. What they lack in experience, they make up with an ambitious vision and raw talent.If you haven't seen the film yet, go watch it. You'll be surprised at how much hope is still left in Bollywood.",

            "content": "I am not a fan on Hindi movies at all, but since I decided to study in India, learn a little Hindi and whatever else, I have expanded my Hindi film repertoire from just Lagaan and Amar Prem to include Dil Chata Hai.The story is simple \u0096 at first, and is largely interspersed with a lot of English. Even I could understand the story without any subtitles. (Although you might turn it on for intense moments of extreme speed Hindi) Three spoilt rich best friends grow up, and in doing so, learn that their relationships between themselves, women and their families becomes tense as they mature and travel.\"What the Heart Wants\" is a sort of theme that persists throughout the film. One friend is stuck to a girl he cannot get, another to an older woman, and the last one is just struggling with many girls he cannot choose between. For a Hindi film, the dance-music numbers are not terrible (but of course not great) and the music without the dance is quite nice, with a lot of meaning attached to it. So after a major fallout they realize many things separately, and learn about their own relationship in turn.I recommend this film to anyone as a primer to Bollywood films \u0096 I know I used it as one. High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.\"Can what the Heart Want be controlled?\" RATING: 9/10",

            "content": "This movie was released in the year 2001, the time when bollywood seemed to be in doldrums, producing one trash after another, the same year when another masterpiece \"Lagaan\" was released from bollywood and the year I finished my college and entered my first job and wow what an experience - it was just like a fresh breath of air.The first movie by an unknown young guy Farhan Akhtar (may be known earlier because of his famous parents Javed Akhtar - lyricist in this movie - and Honey Irani) and what a fantastic job he did both in direction and script writing. For me, he did a great job by experimenting with a novel idea, moving away from the well established norms of the bollywood industry and not presenting yet again melodramatic bollywood plot.The story revolves around three friends (supposedy born to very rich parents) - their relationship and their personal lifes - the guys with totally different natures and with their different meaning of life. However, the only thing that keeps them ever together is their never ending friendship.The story is not so great, doesn't convey any specific message but it keeps you glued and is refreshing as many times you watch it. In fact, many of the college going Indian youth (and even from other countries) would be able to relate themselves with the three main movie protagonists.All the actors have given very good performance. Aamir Khan simply reaffirmed his talent. He plays a prankster, who has knack of turning every thing into funny and the one who doesn't believe in the institution of love, but ultimately falls for it. For Saif Ali Khan this movie may even be called his re-birth. He plays a character who falls for every other girl, but is unable to express it when he really starts loving the one. Akhshay Khanna playing a bit mature and serious character may have seemed slightly weaker than the other two, but he played his character very well. This guy has a very different meaning for love and falls for an older woman. Preity Zinta looks amazing (as always) with an all different hair style. Sonali Kulkarni didn't seem so much at ease with the commercial cinema, but then too gave pretty good performance.Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy combination was also refreshing and different from all that mushy mushy Hindi film music. The great thing about songs that they didn't break the movie rhythm and seemed more to be part of the movie's story.In all, a must watch movie.",

Fresh, invigorating, romantic, bizarre even!They don't make films like this in the West - and more's the pity but hence the freshness. The three lead actors are gorgeous - so it hardly matters that they must be the oldest students in town. The cinematography is beautiful - especially in the Australian sequences. The song and dance routines are as welcome as they are surprising.As with all Hindi films, it is pure melodrama of course. The ability to suspend one's disbelief is a necessity. But that aside, it has all the attributes of a good old fashioned Hollywood romance. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl... etc., times three.The core theme of friendship is a delight - as are the subtle homo-erotic overtones of Akash and Sid's relationship. Intended or not, I wouldn't have minded if they'd ended up together - but this is Bollywood remember!All in all, fantastic fun which I plan to watch again and again. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Indian movies tend to have a reputation for (a) being musicals and (b) having overmodulated, distorted sound tracks, as if everyone was singing and playing through a guitar fuzzbox. Fuzz is fine in its place (heavy metal rock music, for example) but a surfeit of it can readily wear down the listener.Dil Chahta Hai is a welcome breath of fresh air in the genre. It does have musical numbers but they're very pleasant on the ear, as is the sound track in general - modern musical styles, in some cases mixed with more traditional musical instruments (even a didgeridoo, the presence of which is explained below).I have an absolute hatred of musicals so for me to find this movie likable it really has to be something special. The awards it has already won demonstrate that it IS something special.The storyline is a little convoluted (which may explain why it takes 3 hours to run its course - around twice as long as its western counterparts, although Indian audiences may prefer the much longer format) but the acting is excellent throughout and the viewer is kept interested as the multiple interwoven plots twist and turn.This movie demands concentration though, to get the whole picture. There is a good deal of spoken English mixed with Hindi, so the subtitles are a must for those who don't understand Hindi, but the English speech is not often mirrored in the subtitles, so one must both listen carefully and watch carefully in order not to miss a beat.The subtitles themselves are not perfect, using unusual punctuation at times to emphasize a point (a word bracketed by a plus or minus symbol on one side and a two thirds fraction on the other takes a little time to absorb, for example).But these are only minor niggles. This movie is richly textured and provides a visual a feast throughout, especially if, like me, you are not familiar with the sights and sounds of places like Bombay and Goa. A good part of the movie is also set in Sydney, Australia, providing plenty of material to keep the interest going (and hence the presence of the aboriginal instrument noted earlier).This is very much a westernised production, with characters and behaviours that are possibly harder for traditional Indian audiences to identify with; I had no difficulty though with identifying with the three main male characters - three guys who are firm friends and have been for some years, and who may separate but somehow always manage to come back together when circumstances demand it. This kind of theme is pretty universal - the British TV series \"Last of the Summer Wine\" operates along pretty much the same lines, albeit fifty years on.One of the themes is the conflict between traditionalist parents and modernist offspring (in particular the arranged marriage) and the author leaves the audience to make up their own mind about which is \"right\", but maybe with a slight nudge in the direction of the traditionalists.The only gripe I have is with the choice of the anglicised title \"Do Your Thing\" for the US market. I think that totally misses the point of the movie. From the subtitles, Dil Chahta Hai translates as \"The heart wants...\", which would be more accurately and pertinently translated as \"What The Heart Wants...\".In other words, the storyline is more about following your heart in love than it is about leading a self-indulgent life (which, obviously, these characters do most of the time - courtesy of being very well off and generally able to please themselves what they do; not quite the little rich kids, but verging on it).This movie is that rare beast, a guy flick that is also a chick flick. Guys will enjoy watching it for the macho moments, girls will enjoy it for the soulful scenes (and the fact that the women generally behave with more maturity than the guys) and the weepy bits.All in all a very enjoyable, watchable movie. If this is a new direction for the so-called Bollywood cinema, then it is very welcome and I would like to see more of the same.As a professional writer I'd even be interested in contributing to that new direction...",

            "content": "Less is more in Farhan Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Strip away melodramatic plots which always drag on longer than they are supposed to. Get rid of unbelievable protagonists who have all the answers and can fight off a horde of villains. Have no 'villains' to speak of, with the exception of the dude engaged to the girl you fancy, who acts like a bit of a prick.Build a story about the people you spend most of the time with - your friends, your dawgs, your posse, and ponder how you guys are going to sort out the really important things in your life. Like falling in love. Cracking on your friend who seems to fall for every girl he sees. Or your sensitive friend Sid who is in love with a much older woman - is he crazy? Wince as two of your best friends get into a very heated argument which splits them up and wonder what you will do now that you're caught in the middle. Hope for love and friendship to find a way through to reconciliation.Make a smart movie, without elaborate dance pieces set to a sweet soundtrack that remains in the top 10 a year after the film's release. In fact have a song that parodies the 'running around trees' segment that every other Hindi film since the 1950s has had and that the guys at school used to kid about. I mean, guys don't express their love for girls that way! Keep out guns, drugs, politics, strife, and family melodrama. Lace up your script with generous doses of humor which brings to light the hereunto underused Saif Ali Khan. Finally make sure the 'heroes' have shown some growth at the end of it. Of course it's been done to death in LA. That it could have been done so well in Mumbai is the astonishing thing.Finally, make reality cool again. Whatever your heroes wear, however they cut their hair, right down to the way they interact has to be believable. Make short hair and a goatee beard the national craze amongst guys. Put some real thought into color coding and matching outfits and give a laid-back style to the proceedings.Welcome \"Dil Chahta Hai\". The film that has had the largest influence of the look and hopefully the story of the biggest Bollywood films to follow it. A film that many people have been able to relate to. It seemed so obvious until Farhan Akhtar did it. Now watch how his ideas permeate through Bollywood.Here's looking forward to \"Don\" in 2006.",

            "content": "Before getting into the details, I must admit that this is certainly one of the best and most entertaining films I have ever seen!RATING: ****1/2 out of *****Plot ---- The story is about three very good friends and their relationships with each other. Aamir Khan plays a sociable and mischievous Akash, Saif Ali Khan plays a confused, often 'love-struck' Sameer and Akshaye Khanna plays a mature, confident Siddharth or Sid. Preity Zinta plays Shalini - Akash's love interest, though throughout the film Akash claims that he does not believe in love. Sonali Kulkarni plays Pooja with whom Sameer finally (really) falls in love and Dimple Kapadia is Tara Jaiswal, a divorced middle-aged alcholic. Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.Review ------ Full credit must go to the director Farhan Akhtar who has broken many of the Bollywood production norms in order to make a technically perfect and enjoyable film. It would be unfair to call Aamir Khan the life of the DCH though his popularity in India and abroad would have drawn a substantial part of the film's audience. He gives a brilliant performance as usual as Akash. His scenes with Akshaye Khanna and some scenes shot in Australia (Opera, phone call to Sid, etc) are mind-blowing! SAif Ali Khan is the surprise packet of Dil Chahta Hai and there is a lot of untapped talent in him especially where comedy roles are concerned. But I felt that the best performance came from Akshaye Khanna who plays the character of Sid to perfection. His mannerisms, thinking, behaviour is very authentic and makes us all identify with his character closely. Preity Zinta looks gorgeous and is her usual chirpy self. Sonali Kulkarni could have certainly looked better without all that makeup. Dimple Kapadia shows how a good role can bring out an elegant performance from a seasoned actress.The best aspect of Dil Chahta Hai other than the actors' performances was the music. This is hopefully the start of more non-run of the mill compositions in Bollywood. Ofcourse, I hope for a lot more compositions like these from the music directors Shankar-Eshaan-Loy. The title song was the best and gels really well with this trndy film. Other good songs are 'Jaane Kyon', 'Kaise HAi yeh Rut' and 'Tanhayee'. 'Woh ladki hai  kahan' - a parody of old Hindi songs is simply hillarious. The lyrics provided by the director's father, veteran Javed Akhtar are simply amazing and complement the story of the film to perfection!Overall, a very entertaining feature and I hope to see more films like these in the near future. Three cheers to Farhan Akhtar and his team!!!",

            "review_title": "A very fine and realistic depiction of modern urban India and its youth",
            "content": "Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai is a true example of cutting-edge cinema. It is a groundbreaking film in that it realistically portrays the life of Indian upper-class youth and shows the urban and modern India in the most precise way through the story of three close friends and their experiences. The characters are real and very easy to relate to, the dialogues are simple and genuine, the proceedings are dramatic yet realistic, and the film is extremely interesting and entertaining. The film is emotional, but it never goes over-the-top. Farhan Akhtar makes an impressive directorial debut. His excellent direction is aided by extraordinary music, brilliant cinematography, effective editing, fantastic city locations and some very impressive performances by the ensemble cast. The camaraderie between the three friends looks most real and believable. I can't recall any other Indian film I've seen before or after Dil Chahta Hai which portrayed true friendship as well as this one.Aamir Khan, though initially seems to be miscast in the role of the completely cynical womaniser Akash, demonstrates a very fine versatility in this role and successfully shows the gradual growth in his character with depth and humour. Saif Ali Khan, in his best performance up until that point, is just brilliant as the insecure and very kindhearted Sameer. He displays confusion and fear with great conviction and a fantastic pinch of comedy. Akshaye Khanna is outstanding in this wonderful dramatic role of a serious and sensitive guy who falls for a woman much ahead of his age. Preity Zinta is marvelous as Shalini and skillfully sensitises her character. She plays the part with grace and restraint, and her inner feelings are perfectly understood thanks to her expressive eyes. Dimple Kapadia adds another accomplished performance to her vast repertoire. Sonali Kulkarni's real talent is unfortunately wasted, though she does try to do the best of what she is given.Overall, Dil Chahta Hai is a remarkable picture about life, and it should provide a great deal of quality entertainment to each and every viewer, whoever and wherever he is. A great film which is according to me the best Hindi film of 2001.",

Debutant director Farhan Akhtar's (son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani) Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three friends and their respective thinking of love. It has a new, trendy and youthful look, completely different from the standards norms of the Bollywood film.Akash (Aamir Khan), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) and Siddharth aka Sid (Akshaye Khanna), three close friends, have completed their education and are on the threshold of life. Akash does not believe in love. He is a flirt and his love affairs do not last for more than a month. Sameer believes in love. He is always carrying his heart on his palm and falling in love every time. But he still has not found that special girl. Sid, a painter, is the most sensitive and mature among the three. He knows the true meaning of love. He finds love in everything, everywhere and everytime.All three are enjoying life. Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an interior designer, who is a divorcee. Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid's love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash, thus creating a rfit between the two friends. Sameer tries to bridge the gap but is unsuccessful.\nSid leaves for a painting workshop at Kaushali. Akash leaves for Australia for his dad's business. On the flight, he meets Shalini (Preity Zinta), who he had briefly known earlier. Their friendship slowly blossoms into love. Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja (Sonali Kulkarni), whom he wants to marry. Time has passed. All three friends are again in the same town -- but things are different for them now.Full marks to director Farhan Akhtar for giving a completely new and fresh look to the film in his debut film. The storyline is different from the run-of-the-mill fares which we are used to seeing for such a long time. Farhan is a welcomed entry in the list of talented and young directors. He has also dared to be different. He has taken care of the minutest details in the film. Technically, the film is no way behind some of the best Hollywood movies.Now the performances -- all the three leads are fabulous. They all fit their roles to a T. Aamir Khan as expected is the best. He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father. He definitely is the best among the current lot who does his work with precision and utmost dedication. Saif Ali Khan is a wonderful surprise in this film. This is his career-best role and one cannot imagine anyone else playing Sameer's role. His sense of timing and facial expressions are very natural and makes Sameer a very adorable character in the film.The least significant role was of Sameer but Saif made it very important. Now comes the final winner -- Akshaye Khanna. An actor-par excellence and very natural in front of the camera, Akshaye has played the role of Sid to perfection. His emotions and expressive face say a lot. He has given a spell-binding performance. Preity looks great in her new look and has acted well. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.Music and the picturisation of the songs flow with the mood of the film. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been brilliantly shot. The first half of the film has some of the light good moments. The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy. But one thing is sure -- Bollywood has got one more talented director in Farhan Akhtar.",

Unlike the Hollywood or Euro films, the difficulties that the three young men encounter are not presented in a realistic and sometimes brutal way but highly musical and artistic way.  Besides the stunning length, this is another feature of Indian movies.The boys are from middle class families, obviously, or even higher society. They have time and money to go to Goa to spend their holiday, go to chic places to spend their past time, have nothing to worry.  Just like any well-to-do Asian families, (I mean those in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan....) the old man of the family would send their children to their own overseas company to receive \"wilderness training\" so that later they can take over the family business.  Akash just cannot escape this and stays in Sydney.Once again, the songs, the dances, the plot and the script are all marvellously put together.  Who is able to resist pretty and young faces, right?  Who wants to see the real McCoy of the true India?  Movie is always a dream.

Yet, I am just wondering it would take how many years for the mainstream (like Hollywood) center to \"digest\" Indians after taking in Chinese like Jacky Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung.  Through Hollywood, the Indians actors would be more widely known because it is a place to rocket people's name over one night.The 1994 Miss World Aishwarya Rai caused a frenzy in Cannes in 2002.

These situations will make things difficult for all of them and they will change their friendship too.I liked this movie because it combines very well comedy with drama and from this combination we can see and observe the true meaning of love either is erotic or is between friends. I also liked this movie because it shows us how things change when people fall in love, how their personalities change and how this influence them. Once more Aamir Khan's interpretation played as Akash Malhotra was very good but equally food were the interpretations of Saif Ali Khan's who played as Sameer and Akshaye Khanna's who played as Siddharth Sinha.Finally I have to say that \"Dil Chahta Hai\" is a very good movie to watch and if you like movies that show the influence of love into relationships and what are the results of this then this is your movie.

I would prefer the opening first act to be only about the three friends by themselves. They need to establish their friendship as the opener. Their chemistry is the most important aspect of the movie. It's more important than the romances. They need to show that they're the drive-to-the-airport friends and even bury-a-dead-body friends. They need to open by explaining their friendship. Sometimes, movies do this by showing their first meetings. I don't feel that connection has been established.This is a long three hour movie. There is the regular Bollywood song-and-dance. It's still long even without the songs. I like the guys. They seem like really nice fun guys. The movie kinda works by hanging out with them. It's no masterpiece by any means.",

If you've never seen a Bollywood film before, this is the best place you could start.Akash (Aamir), Siddharth or Sid (Akshaye), and Sameer (Saif) are best friends. They are all different; Akash is very critical and a prankster, he believes that love doesn't last more than a couple of weeks. Sid is the most serious and mature of the three, he is a little shy and often disappears in his own world of painting. Sameer, is desperately romantic and \"falls in love\" a lot. Often this ends in heartbreak...Nevertheless, despite their differences, the trio have something in common: their love for each other. Soon, the three find their own lives dragging them forward, forced to leave the others behind, and they realize the value and seriousness of life. They discover many things along the way, like true love, and true friendship. When their lives collide again, their individual worlds are shaken up once more, leaving them with the support they really need: each other.Aamir gives a very fun-filled, suave performance, he is comical and the audience will always love him, its brilliant. Saif Ali Khan does an awesome job, it's comedy, but it's a very strong performance too. Akshaye Khanna, gets full credit for the best performance in this movie. Not only did he get the best role, but he played it to perfection, the fight scene with Akash, was brilliant. I give him my full applause. The pretty Preity Zinta, also gives a noteworthy performance. Her cute smile and charming personality light up the screen and makes the movie refreshing. Sonali Kulkarni gives a gritty performance. She is forgettable, but she does play the role well. Dimple Kapadia plays the depressed alcoholic mom easily. Ayub Khan, Rajat Kapoor, and Suhasini Mulay give small, but important roles.The music is amazing. Certainly the best part about the film. Farhan Akhtar has done a fantastic job.I'd say 8 out of 10 stars...WATCH IT!",

Virtually all of them run an average of two and a half hours or more, and almost all of them feature Aamir Khan in a leading role. So I pretty much expected that with \"Dil Chatha Hai\", and on that score I wasn't surprised. Khan himself is part of a buddy trio that appears aimless during their young adulthood, living the good life with not much thought for the future. Each in their own way is confronted with the stirring pangs of love, and how they react to those feelings provides some resentment among the men, causing them to go their separate ways.The subject of arranged marriages is also broached, similar to the way it was handled in the film \"Swades\", with the modern day view of marrying for love taking precedence against a tradition of marrying to further business or extended family relationships. As typical with Hindi films, there are a fair number of musical interludes featuring song and dance led by the principal players, each in turn long enough to allow a wardrobe change as it plays out, which occurs quite vibrantly during the 'Love Brings Color Into Your Life' number. As a three part love story, the film manages to appeal to both men and women, and in a way, approaches it's goal of fulfilling the message of the movie's title, loosely translated as 'What the Heart Wants'.",

I laughed out loud and cried like a small child. What a great story with great actors. Aamir Khan is one of my new favorite actors. The man has skills and talent that many others can't even come close to touching. The music fits. We make fun of it over here in America but once I opened up my eyes and saw how well it helps to tell the story. Man we Americans can be so judgmental. I believe it is because no American studio can pull it off so they make fun of it out of jealousy. Aamir Khan provides another unbelievable performance.

Its a milestone, an epic of a movie which keeps you entertained even after more than 10 years of its first getting released... A cult classic, the concept & execution of which was unheard of in our film history.. Writing anything about it can never explain the greatness & artistic work, one got to see it.. I still laugh,cry & marvel at the cinematic excellence put by the d\u00e9butante director .. Pepped up with one of the greatest compositions by the trio of Shankar ehsaan & loy ,so beautifully penned down by javed saab... A story about three best friends & their respective takes on life.. It winds up through their fun college days & takes us through the turmoils one faces as far as that great feeling called love is encountered.. Mind you it ain't just another romantic flick but thanks to the crisp editing & direction ,every emotion in the book is dolled out in equal proportions..though one may feel that best portrayed was one between the lead pairs... Its the camaraderie & the emotional quotient that the trio have in between them ,sharing everything & inspite of differences coming between them, coming together & reconciling.. The goa part is very aesthetically captured .. Getting some not so known actors together & giving them the roles of their lives is an uphill task & the director has so very rightfully succeeded in doing just that.. Roles that changed life for many.. All three have been able to carve out a niche for themselves , Akshay in his serious thinking man character gives a very good praiseworthy & restrained act.. Saif as a happy carefree ,a not so smart guy gives a decent performance but the star of the show is undoubtedly amir Khan who even amongst so many characters has given a spellbinding performance.. Had it not been his other outing as the patriotic hero the same year, he would have got the best actor for his meaty role... He has lived his character virtually , what with his histrionics, antics, goofups, confidence , friendship & his chemistry with the lead actress, one tends to love him.. Watch him utter his lines or proposing his girl in someone else marriage, he indeed is the captain of the ship, a link by which all are connected... Not to forget the perfect casting & works of other actors.. Preity in her subdued role torn between her allegiance to her proxy parents & her love of life gives a controlled performance & looks so adoring in those curly hair.. Even the music lost out that year , but that does not mean it ain't good.. It was & still looks n feels fresh & ruled the charts .. Especial mention should be made of extremely heart rendering composition with soulful wordings by Javed saab & sung by none other but the versatile Sonu who gives the song such melancholic feel & effectively captures the mood of the movie... Sir, I really feel privileged & grateful to you for giving us such a fine piece of work.. What I wish is more of such movies from your hands... ..",

It is the story of three friends, just graduated from college. Akash does not believe in love, and seems to facy himself a player. Throughout the film, you can almost see through him... he is afraid of being hurt. Sameer wants nothing more than to love and be loved. However, he is just as foolish as Akash, as he throws himself at all the wrong girls. Siddharth is the shy one, who seems to comprehend the complexity of love. When he falls for an older woman, he brings a new aspect to the story: love is selfless and asks nothing in return. Throughout this movie, you see these three stories develop, causing the audience to wonder, 'What is love?' It has been hailed as a hip movie with modern clothes and hairstyles. While this is true, it is also a highly artistic movie that never misses a beat or an opportunity for depth. An actor once said that an actor should be a person who holds a mirror, so the audience can see themselves. I hardly think it possible to watch this movie without seeing a little bit of Akash's cynicism, Sameer's naivete, and Siddharth's willingness to fight for love in ourselves. This is a must-see not only for Bollywood fans, but for hopeless romantics and cynics alike. This one will make you think.",

Farhan Akhtar is brilliant, and this will always be one of his master pieces, no matter how many movies he makes in the future. The movie starts with the present, with Dimple Kapadia being admitted in the hospital, and then a flashback sets in. Farhan Akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus, has created characters that the youth in India can relate to. The protagonists are not extra-ordinary heroes, nor are they spoilt brats. They are just normal young Indians with new ideas raised in affluent families. They have the right blend of traditions and modernity. The movie consists of a strong plot, good characters who are believable and yet, interesting. The songs of the movie are excellent too. The picturizations and script is great. Overall, a well done movie with good acting from all the main actors - Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni and the ever beautiful Dimple Kapadia.

I told my sister who was with me at the time, \"I think that is the BEST Bollywood film I have seen so far\". I recently saw this film again, and I remembered again why I loved it SO much the first time. This movie is a credit to Farhan Akhtar who has since directed the spectacular movie \"Lakshya\".He is a true talent to contend with in Bollywood,and certain more experienced directors, can take a leaf off his book. \"Dil Chata Hain\" works on SO many levels. It's an attempt at telling a mature story. NOT the same old plot exhausted to death, and no \"over blown\" Bhangra numbers either! The movie was content and script driven. It explores the many faces of love, and the changes that occur in friendships as people mature and move on with life. But what it shows also is that true friendship can overcome many an adversity, misunderstanding, and even time.The first movie about \"Male-bonding\" to come out of Bollywood!So beautifully told, this story captures the lives and loves of Akash, Sameer and Sidhart (Sid). Played brilliantly by Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Akshay Khanna.They are supported by Dimple Kapadia, Preity Zinta & Sonali Kulkarni. All the main actors give their best in this movie, and I cannot say one thing negative about any of their performances. (Except maybe that Sonali didn't have enough to do). The movie also includes a few characters that have only a few scenes to play but they play them well, and they ALL add value to the story. This movie was the turning point in Saif's career. Since DCH, he has gone from strength to strength, and his versatility as an actor has finally been recognized. As for Aamir Khan... what can I say? His performances are always stellar,as he is a \"thinking\" actor who gives his all to a character he plays.I have yet to see a \"bad performance\" given by Aamir. He never does things by half. Akshay is great and he too has always given fine performances in all his movies to date! Preity and Dimple play the next most prominent characters in the movie. Preity gave a very controlled performance, and Dimple was superb. She gave this movie that extra bit of \"Oommf\". I also love the way the story did not portray a clich\u00e9d relationship between an older women, and younger man, and how they kept both the characters dignity in tact. The Akash-Shalini love story was touching too,as these are two people who never intended to fall in love with each other,but did.Akash,who does not believe in love, and Shalini, who is engaged to her surrogate parent's son.The scene in which her father tells Akash, \"please look after her, as she is my daughter\" was very emotional.But the best part was that it was not \"over-dramatized\".The emotions of the moment created it's own drama. All in all, this was a \"coming of age\" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from \"boys to men\".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound. In conclusion,all I can say is PLEASE make more intelligent and enlightening movies like this one!Farhan,very well done indeed!All the best!",

The array of suave stars and popular songs that are situationally placed, add to this allure. The direction is deft and the script is tightly paced. What's not to like?While I enjoyed all of the above and the breeziness - as the movie ended I was struck by a sense of disappointment, that for a cult classic hailed as a turning point in urban cinema, something was missing and unabashedly gone unnoticed.For one, the whole obsession with marriage. The movie centers around the coming of age of 3 friends (played by Aamir, Saif, Akshaye) - fresh out of college. The Aamir and Saif characters have no achievement monies or passions and the only growing up is that in the 1-2 years spanned by the movie they go from chasing all and sundry girls to finding a wife!Akshaye's understated romance with the older woman, and his sensitiveness, especially when he vouches that not all deep relationships in life can be given a name, form the most refreshing part of the movie. Yet here too, the director falters and badly. While the older woman is perceptive enough to give a deeper meaning to his paintings, the way she handles the situation on discovering his feelings for her is inane and disappointing. Add to this how quickly after her death Akshaye finds a perfect girlfriend and plummeting of this refreshing track into triteness is complete!The classiness and realism are truly over-hyped!",

Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna did great and fit their roles nicely; Saif did great as the helpless flirt and he gave a good natural performance. This performance revived his career. Akshaye Khanna played the quiet Sidd very well, he handled emotions well and his performance was also very good. Preity Zinta also impressed. But it was Aamir Khan who stole the show. He portrayed Akash very well, to the point where you could not even imagine that it was originally Akshaye Khanna who was supposed to do that role. Aamir became the character himself. He showed everything from perfect comic timing to excellent emotional display. Another thing I really liked was the entire cast's chemistry. It made everything look so real and natural.

His love, Tara, is dying and Sid hopes that his two old friends join him. Then, the film jumps back to the past--when the three guys had just graduated from school and were looking forward to their lives.Sid's relationship with Tara is first in the film. He's an artist and is hopelessly in love with her but Tara is damaged goods. She's lost her daughter to her ex-husband and while she blames him for this, it's clear she's an alcoholic. Sid's falling for her is NOT healthy and this leads to a falling out with his friends-- particularly Akash.Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) is a complete failure at love--so much so that his friends joke about this. However, this lovable loser falls even harder in love with a woman his parents are trying to arrange a marriage with--and he foolishly says he didn't want it before he met this beautiful lady. She hears him say this and feels free to marry a man she's already in love with...so what is Sameer to do?As for Akash (Aamir Khan), he's a cynic about love. He gets girls all the time but it means nothing to him. So why is it so important that he be with Shalini--particularly when Shalini has a very jealous fianc\u00e9 already?!How these stories all work together is very nice--even if the audience already knows that somehow it will all work out....well, at least for Akash and Sameer. We already know that Sid is screwed! Overall, this is much better than the typical Indian romance-- particularly the wonderful portion where Akash pledges his heart to Shalini (it will make your heart melt--so be sure to have some Kleenex nearby!).

There are three(mostly), two of them have a fight ,never talked for years, meet each other after a long time and after an adventurous outing, become friends again. This is what happens in a film film, always, be it Kai Po Che or ZNMGD or any other. But Dil Chahta Hai has one thing which other didn't have, Aamir Khan. Indians rate it 10/10 before watching and that's how it's one of the most voted Indian film on Imdb.Usually, every Indian films contains one love story, this one has three. And all of them have a problem. So first they unite ,then each of them completes his love story. And we have to watch this boring film just because it has Aamir Khan.Dil Chahta Hai is an extremely unpopular film. A common moviegoer might have never heard about it. I too, came to know about this one only after joining IMDb. But the IMDb world is different from the real world. And I am happy that this movie is not very popular, off course, in real world.",

They found the club dance scene hilarious and were taken with the friendship and camaraderie that the three main characters shared.

            "content": "This was a huge hit in India, seen as an important step towards hipper, less clich\u00e9 Bollywood film-making, that combined the strength of western films (more low key and subtle story and acting, better technical values) with the Indian use of musical numbers, big themes and epic running times. The story is about 3 young men graduating from university, their friendship, and how each deals with love and women. There's plenty to criticize. That 3 hour running time for one thing (a cultural difference \u2013 that's a common length in India). Casting actors who are clearly in their mid-30s to play kids just graduating from college. A score that sounds like a Giorgio Moroder cast off from the 1980s, and 'happy' montages that look like something Richard Lester would have done in the early 1960s. So why did I like it so much? Maybe it just caught me at the right moment... it's just pretty damn infectious; the few musical numbers feel slyly integrated (fantasies, performing in a night club) and cleverly staged, instead of just stuck on. The songs are good, with catchy melodies and clever wordplay. While the actors are too old they're charming and natural in their roles. A lot of clever, funny lines manage to translate across cultures, and while the dramatic side could be attacked as hackneyed, and a more than a little paternalistic, I still found myself caught up. In short, I found myself enjoying this way more than I 'should' have, and maybe on re-seeing it I'll downgrade it. But the bottom line was, I had a fun, involved 3 hours I was glad to spend with this film. I smiled a lot. I cared about what happened and how things turned out, and I was charmed, not turned off by the seeming anachronisms.",

As a huge fan of Aamir Khan, I can't help but be biased in saying that this certainly was one of Aamir Khan's finest performances ... and to me personally, I think this was his best performance after Lagaan!

The older woman-young man romance is shown but, come on, who are we kidding. She gets conveniently bumped off in the end.The comedy sometimes is too deliberate and artificial and that gets on your nerves.Apart from that,it has the same boring happy ending. 3 friends bond-comedy happens, seperate, fall in love, reunite.

This is upscale affluent yuppie India where the characters live in spacious luxury, chatting on their cell phones and doing the Indian equivelant of drinking coffee at Starbucks. The romantic comedy was a throwback to the Rock Hudson/Doris Day era.  All the men were handsome, all the girls were drop dead gorgeous, everyone wore stylish clothes, everyone was rich and lived in a lovely home.I was somewhat daunted by the length of the film, especially as I was watching it at night.  Either Indian directors don't have a cutting machine or they never saw a take they could not use.  Whichever, the film could have done with some cutting, especially of the musical numbers which seemed out of place and slowed the action even more. For me the only musical scenes which worked were the scene at the opera and the Busby Berkley style number featuring a tap dancing Sameer.The only other fault I found was that the male characters seemed somewhat older than one would expect for bride hunting, especially as they lived at home with their parents.  It may be different in India, and I don't know the age at which young men marry, but maybe that was the point, that they had left it a bit late and were afraid of missing out.",

In my opinion love is a minor point in this movie, the main thing it deals with is friendship... In a way which is completely comprehensible... not like other movies , e.g. \"Dosti\" , where its totally exaggerated which makes the audience not try to identify with the main characters cause it seems to be so unrealistic. In DIL CHAHTA HAI this is not the case, you're gonna have fun watching Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna when they try to get their beloveds ... and you're gonna laugh!

Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut - Dil Chahta Hai - was not just fresh in its approach but also gave the urban youth a movie to celebrate forever. It also ushered in a new sound through some awesome compositions by trio Shankar Ehsaan Loy. 'Jaane Kyun' is still popular in Australia as 'Johny Q'!!Aamir, Saif and Akshaye played the besties and each one of them has a distinct character of their own. More importantly, no one is a sidekick here as all three get equal importance in the screenplay. Right till the first half. Aamir is a richie rich brat who doesn't take life or love seriously. Saif is a hopeless emotional fool ever ready to fall for a girl while Akshaye is the brooding youngster too mature for his age which makes him fall for the much older Dimple Kapadia.The best moments of the film come in its first hour with all the mazaak masti. Saif's \"Christine\" episode is a laugh riot. Akshaye's sensitive conversation with Dimple is another memorable scene. The second half is dedicated to Aamir discovering love in Australia with his college acquaintance Preity Zinta. To be honest, that part could've been edited a bit. In a later interview, Farhan admitted that he had two scripts - one involving the buddies and other was Aamirs love angle - which he merged together as one Dil Chahta Hai.Coming straight after playing Bhuvan the villager in Lagaan (2001), Aamir's transformation in to the uber cool youngster indicated his terrific range as an actor. Saif benefited tremendously from the film playing his career best act ( I prefer this to his much celebrated Omkara (2006) also). You can say this film made his career. Akshaye was good as always. Of the heroines, Dimple overshadowed the other two ladies with her charming and dignified presence.I saw Dil Chahta Hai on first Saturday with my group of friends at then newly opened Cinemax at Kandivali. As we exited the theatre, we started planning a Goa trip. Pronto!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

I was also attracted by 27-year old Farhan Akhtar who is making his directorial debut with this film and his father Javed Akhtar(currently the best lyricist in Bollywood after the demise of the all-time greatest lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri) who has again come up with great lyrics in this film so soon after his recent triumph in Lagaan( I was already playing the songs from the movie in my car on the way to Diamond Bar).Well, I found the movie very refreshing and original. I felt engaged throughout, though the level of involvement was not as intense as in Lagaan.But why am I comparing this movie with Lagaan?Just because Aamir Khan and Javed Akhtar are a part of it, some comparison is inevitable. Lagaan is a many-splendored,multi-layered classic while Dil Chahta Hai is an enjoyable, hugely entertaining movie.Both are very very different from each other.And Akash of Dil Chahta Hai is very different from Bhuvan of Lagaan.Nobody can believe that both characters are played by one and the same Aamir. And therein lies the beauty of the film. The film, of course, works on many other levels but this is undoubtedly its most compelling element. With his new look and with this performance Aamir has added many years to his career at the top. In fact with this hit film he has joined the legendary Dilip Kumar and the great Amitabh Bachchan who also had two back to back hits in the same year. Dilip Kumar with Mughal-E-Azam and Kohinoor(for which he got the Best Actor award) in 1960 and Amitabh Bachchan with Deewar(He got the Best Actor award) and Sholay in 1975.And now Aamir with Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai in this extraordinary year 2001.It's a great high for someone who loves movies, music, poetry and the arts. My only regret is that Farhan did not give the title of the movie in the credit titles also in Urdu ,the language that makes these great movies possible in the first place.",

The actors, cinematographer, editor and all the other film people, believing in the young man's enthusiasm, themselves pour their best into the film. And then some kind of magic happens. The film turns out to be revolutionary; it defines a generation, both of filmmakers as well as avid film watchers. Such movies virtually spawn a new era of films....an age begins, and another one ends.DCH is just such a film; with this, Farhan Akhtar soared into unchartered territory and then somehow never made anything even remotely close. Anyway, that aside, this film came to my mind because I just saw Kontroll a few days back, as some of you know. Kontroll is another such revolutionary film, also by an immensely talented first-time director, the Hungarian-born Nimrod Antal.This film's technical standards stunned me when I had first seen it long ago. For a Bollywood film, it set the bar so high that even subsequent films never came close. Take Ravi K. Chandran's cinematography : in a word, unbelievable. The shots inside the discotheque are unlike anything I've ever seen, even in the most eye-boggling of American/European music videos.The same goes for the performances, the script, the music, the editing, the mise-en-scene....I could go on and on. Having lately revisited this, I still cannot believe that an Indian filmmaker managed to do this. This film is like a good dream, the kind where you know that its a dream, and you don't want to wake up.",

I was 22 then and was most impressed by the music, the intelligent dialogues and Aamir Khan's portrayal of the central character Aakash.Over the years as my reading of cinema has changed, the dialogues and Aakash are too over the top. The music is still great and subtle performances by Saif Ali Khan (Sameer) and Akshaye Khanna (Sid) seem much better.This was Farhan Akhtar's first film and great things were expected of him but he has turned out to be a one dimensional figure. He knows his high society and nothing else.If in 2001 I had been on Letterboxd I would have given it a 5 star rating but now it is a 3.5 star film which is a more realistic ranking for this film.",

But, the title in this case is cunningly disguised, as what will be I'm sure the most talked about film of this generation for this decade. I feel it's the first movie set a milestone in Indian Cinema since 'Sholay' (1975), and can classed as a funky Generation X movie to boot.Dil Chahta Hai explores the life of 3 friends Akaash (Aamir Khan), Sid (Akshaye Khanna), Sameer (Saif Ali Khan), and each of their ideas about love, and as a result how they affect each other throughout the movie. Nothing more needs to be known or explained about this film, except, that it contains some of the most well-timed comedy I have ever seen, best & original acting performances to date from all three actors and love interests Preity Zinta & Dimple, creative cinematography, vibrant and fresh imagery, a water-tight script, and all this from debut director, Farhan Akhtar, demonstrating he was firmly in control of his work at all times.I knew this film was going to be good when I saw the trailer, what I didn't know, it was going be Outstanding!

But my favorite was the scene were Sid is painting Tara. The acting is over the top for my taste, and I feel off in stating that the notions of stereotypical romance depicted in the film are outdated and sexist, but hey the whole industry in the world is just like it in terms of romantic comedies, right? It had a few good moments, I liked the relationship between Sid and Tara, they could definitely make a statement out of that plot but they chose to go safe on that.",

The cast, story lines, song's (which I kept humming over and over) made me say 'Oh Yeah' there's someone else just as good as Hollywood. I have since watch other films to see if DCH was a fluke but for me there still was that Bollywood magic. I am also glad to see that some of the film companies are starting to expand into other more controversial subjects about the morays and tabu's because I find not only is the films entertaining but I have learned a lot more about the culture and it's people. The actors and actresses are diverse not cloned, that may be why I do not have a favorite each contributes to the Bollywood mystique. And I must not forget the song writers and singers whomever they are because to me they share as much credit as the cast. My movie library now has more Bollywood films than any other I am quite sure that I am just one of millions world wide that say 'thank you' to the Bollywood industry.",

            "content": "CAN THINGS BE EVERLASTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT BEING GREAT! That is the answer which I am searching here through a movie, \"DIL CHAHATA HAI\". I have heard people saying the movie, \"DIL CHAHATA HAI\" is just another teen summer movie which just comes & goes by without leaving any substantial impact. I would say that is a disgrace. It certainly did on me; it left on me an ever-lasting impact that I can reminiscence forever. I still remember that evening when I first borrowed \"DIL CHAHATA HAI\" CD secretly on the way back from mathematics coaching & very excited to watch it because my sister watched it two days ago & highly praised. Though she did not reveal that until that day's morning or it accidentally slipped through her lips. Actually I was going through a very critical stage of my academic career. My exams were literally knocking at the door, only 10-12 days left. So my folks made me a promise to abandon watching it till the exams got over. But I can not hold that long if there is anything related with movies. If I could, I would not be writing about it now, would I?! Somehow I managed the whole thing out {don't ask me how} & I did watch it.So, without diverting any further with my past numerous hidden movie experiences, when I first watched it, I was simply dazzled by the beauty of the movie. It took me in such a state of ecstasy where I felt like I was doped. I was terribly sad when the movie actually ended. I was really hoping that it would go on forever, I really did. The movie had me in such an engrossing manner that after completing, I dreamed all the night about it, about the characters. On the next morning, I plugged \"DIL CHAHATA HAI\" again & then again. It seemed like going on forever. But after a while, I desperately felt an urge to get out from it & eventually it took quite a few days to get back to my normal system.By telling you all this nonsense childish stories, I'm trying convey here if one movie can create such a profound impact on a kid like me back then {I wasn't even the only one, after doing some personal survey back class, my friend-circle & the courtesy of some movie magazines}, It can not be just a movie; it has to be more than that.As time has passed, I have seen many more good movies. I have learned the true meaning of movie, enriching with such great films from where I have found the purpose of my life. I'm really grateful to those movies. If I had to say anything which changed my way of looking at life forever, I would definitely name those movies. No, I would not name \"DIL CHAHATA HAI\" but I just can't seem to forget those joyful moments it gave me. Yeah, it was my \"SUMMER OF '69\" & always will be.Cheerio.",

I can't think of one moment in the film in which I was dissatisfied with the framing and the pixelation.  Also, I must call special attention to the song \"Tanhayee.\"  It is wonderfully filmed. Kudos to Chandran's craft. Dil Chahata Hai also has an incredible storyline of interweaving 3 different storylines into one big picture of life in progression. This films gets you away from Bollywood because it is not focussing on some stupid love story.  This film is not quite Hollywood because it has some principles of independent films going on within itself.  Although, love is not the strongest thought expressed in the film, it is definitely the motivation of the story's progression, or else the film would have ended at the intermission.  Also, the story of Sid is kept on the sidelines, while in the true essence of the film, that is the story which is the most honest and strongest one. The film's sound design is incredible.  It is probably the only film in Indian Cinema with SyncSound in it.  Also, Ehsaan, Loy, and Shankar's music is always a strong underscoring factor that triggers a heightening of emotions at the exact appropriate times.  The soundtrack is definitely worth buying thanks to this somewhat renaissance music in Indian Cinema by the trio. Aamir Khan's work is exceptional.  Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna have reinvented themselves in this film which is totally worth watching. Although, a little old to play their parts, I let out a suspension of disbelief because the film is just so much fun!",

I have always been a biggest fan of AAMIR KHAN and this is one of the finest performance by him.From his hunky funky flirto type to intense mature person in the end, you love him all the way. Both SAIF and AKSHAYE were perfect.Saif was so likable and played it to perfection. Akshaye did a real just with his character which i think was very difficult as well A lesser actor would have easily failed to bring the expression and mood to the character but he performed as this character was made for him. In fact the trio worked so well...the on screen chemistry between them was so great that the made it look so real. Preity showed why she is one of the best in Bollywood. Music is the high-lite and all the songs are hummable,well choreographed and picturized. \"DIL chahta hae\" still reminds me of inner me. \"Janay kiyon\" will mesmerise you and \"koi kahe\" is foot tapping number that ll sure bring you on the floor. The last one \"TANHAI\" was picturised superbly and expressions by AAMIR were tremendous. You cannot say that this is the debut movie for FARHAN AKHTAR. An excellent effort by him. Wish he ll be back with some more flicks like this.",

            "content": "Dil Chahta Hai is one of the most popular Bollywood films out there and with good reason. The movie follows the lives of 3 friends: Sid(Akshaye Khanna), Akash(Aamir Khan), and Sameer(Saif Ali Khan),who have recently graduated from college. They are from three different strata of society yet inseparable in friendship. But problems arise when Sid starts falling for a woman 10-15 years older to himself and subsequently falls out with Akash which leads to a series of events which changes their lives forever. While it is well taken and the characters relatable, this movie does have some flaws. For one, they spend the entire first half elaborating on the relationship between the friends, something which, in Hollywood, is normally done in half the time. This not only serves to annoy the less patient viewers but is also problematic as far as the plot goes. They spend so long introducing everyone that the fallout occurs shortly before the intermission at the end of the first half. Then when the movie comes back, the focus shifts to Akash and Sameer and their respective whirlwind romances which are played out in typical Bollywood style(complete with boring, arrogant, and overbearing rivals that the girls would gladly dump) which leaves little time for Sid. All he gets is a hasty fallout followed by him leaving Mumbai. This also is problematic as it provides no explanation as to how he got back to Mumbai, met Tara again and so on. If it was just a minor plot point, it would've been insignificant but this plot point should've rightfully been the focus of the story as it was the reason for the friction between the friends. Finally, the ending: The friends make their peace with each other, Sid moves on but it would've been better if they left it open ended and not shown that he had gotten together with Deepa. Overall, the movie was pretty good. Acting besides Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna was passable but I still don't regret taking 4 hours off my life to watch this. My score-7.5/10",

            "content": "Alas we have some Indian director who knows how to make a good film. Offcourse I exaggerate but lets face it bollywood releases a record breaking number of films week by week. Of those 8 or 9 movies perhaps you get one that is even worth a look, if you're lucky. So why is that? It's because films are aimed at lower/middle class traditionalist uneducated people who cling onto whats familiar. Offcourse we are all like that in a way. Slowly but surely Bollywood directors are realising that there is an even bigger market outside India. I must admit that at times Ive been frustrated by Bollywood film making antics. There is so much unique and beautiful material on which many great films can be made. Indeed there have been attempts with films such as Dil Se, however I have not been impressed with the execution of a potentially good film idea. Theres is too much of a temptation for these directors to turn the film into a media circus, cheesy songs are one medium for this. Why am I reviewing the state of Bollywood industry instead of the film, one might ask? Well after watching this movie and loving it, my intial thought was : was this film great because it was different and a break from the cheesy nonsense that bollywood has thrown my way before. Or was this film great because it was actually a great film. After scanning the film memory fresh in mind I decided it was the latter. Never have I seen such articulate cinematography. So much attention being paid to not only the materialistic side of the film but also the character depth. The three characters in the movie are great. As with all good films, the plot is simple. What makes a really good film i've always believed is the strength of the characters on film, How well they come across the screen and how believable they are. This film achieves all these factors and more. The film is about the changing lives of three college freinds, their relationships and how these relationships develope as they get older. The film doesn't actually deal with that many issues, two in the main, Love and adventure. How original is that you might say, well I'd say it is very original since the approach taken to handle these issues is very unique. Aamir Khan as always has done really well, and taken to the new style of character with ease, the two supporting actors Akshay Khanna and Saif Ali Khan are brilliant. The casting director has done well to cast these two in their particular roles, as it suits them perfectly; Akshay as a serious thoughtful character and Saif as bubbly and funny airhead (reminded me of Matt Le Blanc's Joey character in the US comedy sitcom Freinds) This film I have to say has very few flaws, and I'd like to think I can spot them, infact I canot remember even one at this particular moment in time. Even if there are the film overall is an absolute beauty. I strongly recommend you pay a visit to the nearest cinema that is showing it, sit back and enjoy you'll love it.",

This happened to be my very first exposure to Bollywood filmmaking-in fact, I just happened to stumble upon the beginning of the film as I was channel surfing-but I was very impressed with the entire production. The writing is marvelous, as is the direction, the acting, and the cinematography. I also must say that I thoroughly enjoyed every musical number.Dil Chahta Hai is a triumph for writer-director Farhan Akhtar. If you are looking for deep socio-political meaning in a film you won't find it here. This is just a movie about three young men, their friendship with each other, and their relationships with women. But unless you are hopelessly cynical, you will find this a very engaging and entertaining movie. This is a film that draws the viewer into the world of the characters on the screen, and when the movie ends, you don't want to leave. I think that Dil Chahta Hai is the kind of film that melts away cynicism and reminds us that sometimes the world is a wonderful place.",

The chemistry between the three leading actors is wonderful and Aamir Khan gives a very good performance. Saif Ali Khan does a great comic role. This film has wonderful comic moments (consider the scene with the Time Table Guy) and powerful serious moments (like the pre-interval confrontation). Overall it puts a great accent on friendship and its importance. Enjoy!!!",

There can be awkward silences between friends in a scene, and the director does not feel compelled to break them with over-dramatized tension. They can sit around and share a joke, and we're allowed to sit among them and enjoy the company. This may seem like elementary stuff for Hollywood audiences; but it was a big accomplishment for Hindi cinema. It's an act that has yet to be followed.\"Dil Chahta Hai\" was Farhan Akhtar's debut film.

The soundtrack to the movie is pretty impressive as well, and fit in with the plot of the movie at appropriate times - not like a lot of the movies i see nowadays where some songs are put in the movie simply either for the sake of having a song, or to take up time. the songs were good, relevant, suited the mood, and contributed to the modern style of the movie. Comedy, Drama, Great Songs, love stories that work - and everything is very realistic, so hopefully this film is a wake up call to the rest of Bollywood, who seem to be obsessed with unoriginality. - If you haven't seen this movie, you are seriously missing out!",

They identified with the cast, the clothes, the haircuts, the songs, the emotions, the dances and the humour. It wasn't obvious, it wasn't repetitive, it didn't insult their intelligence. It spoke their language.In fact, DCH was one film where even the actors got a new lease of life. With hip haircuts and cool gear, the cast looked fab.Farhan Akhtar the director (whose father Javed Akhtar created the angry young Amitabh Bachchan), had made his point.

This is beyond the understanding of many people. *And yeah even though u may be the best of friends there is always a limit which shud never never be crossed. Then it starts hurting........... *Improving ur imperfections after you realize it, always take some time. *You always don't need to show or prove your gf how much u love or care about her, which can sound very boring and finally u r dumped. *Believe in Love, true love will never let you down *Never be ashamed to go back to your old friends, friends are there to understand your mistakes. *Do not be afraid of others, always think that othersr afraid of you. (Australian Beggar ) *Whenever you need your friend, remember that he is just a phone call away... distances can't separate friends *What a woman wants in life is some one who can make her smile. Be true in all your relationships, be friend, wife, or a stranger. *In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. *It's the friends you can call up at 4 A.

No matter how difficult it may seem in that moment to get out of that situation, with time you eventually put it behind you and move on, like Siddharth did there.It may take you some time, how long depends completely on you. However, you'll be ready when it's time. How do you know when it's time? You'll just know. So just hang in there!\nA perfect example of friendship & mutual understanding between the three friends, who are individually realized that even in tough times, your friends will be there for you.",

Aamir Khan is amazing as a very funny character at first who later becomes a more emotional character. Saif Ali Khan gives one of the best performances of his life, no doubt it is a very funny role. Akshay khanna gives the most emotionally deep performance of the film proving his range as a character actor. The script is very funny but at the same time can be emotional and challenging. THe punchlines are excellent and prove that a movie can do all. NO one can touch this film as far as Hindi films go it is just superb.",

EVERYONE has acted superbly, with many CLASSIC scenes. Preity Zinta looks FANTASTIC, the songs are ALL very very listenable, and you dont get bored with them as you do with other movie songs. Young, hip-hop movie - everything we expect from movies. I am not a big indian movie fan I admit, but WE WANT DIL CHAHTA HAI 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The way characters were played by the actors was really brilliant though the story of Dimple as the love interest of young painter was a bit of a drag. Saif really was at his best as was aamir khan and preity zinta.It actually portrays what the youth is like in India today with a comic grasp. Music is well done, the songs are shot in an incredibly original manner and lyrics is good. If you are looking for something fresh ..this is it. Fantastic direction and great comedy! A MUST!! :)",
