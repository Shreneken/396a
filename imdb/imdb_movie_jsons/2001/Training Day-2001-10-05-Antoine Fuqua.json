            "content": "Jake(Hawke, innocent yet with some edge) has been on the force for over a year and a half now. He wants to make detective, and that means joining Narcotics. For his titular training day he must impress Alonzo(Washington, simultaneously threatening and charming). He will soon find that this is a cop who crosses the line frequently. Exactly how far is he willing to go?The acting by both leads is amazing. Honestly, for everyone in this. Denzel steals the show, but Ethan still really makes a mark. This is immensely gritty, with many honest looks at what happens in the bad neighborhoods of LA, as told by a screenwriter and director who actually lived there. The authenticity is a huge part of why this is so compelling. With a few exceptions, you really feel like this could happen(there are things that are not very credible. Others have already detailed them, I don't really have anything to add), and it really provokes a discussion of police brutality. Despite an episodic nature, every scene has a distinct purpose in the overall narrative, although for a number of them, you won't realise what it is until later.This contains a lot of strong language, some brutal violence, and a little nudity. I recommend it to everyone who can stomach the contents. 8/10",

            "content": "Ethan Hawke, bright eyed and innocent, reports to his training officer for his first day on the job in narcotics in the LAPD. He never could have fathomed just how much he would learn on that very first Training Day.His training officer is Denzel Washington, a thirteen year veteran on the police who's put in a few years in plainclothes in Narcotics. He certainly has the experience, but just what kind of experience and what he imparts to Hawke is the subject of Training Day.A film like Training Day will rise and fall with the performances of these two characters since one or the other and mostly both is on screen from the beginning. Fortunately both Washington and Hawke complement each other's performances like jigsaw puzzle fit.It is no accident that Denzel Washington won his second Oscar, his first as Best Actor. This performance is working on so many levels it's astonishing. Washington is at all times, charming, capable, corrupt, violent, street smart, and arrogant. What I liked most about it is how the various facets of this character are revealed bit by bit to the audience and to Hawke though not at the same time.As for Ethan Hawke it takes him to realize just exactly what he's dealing with in a training officer. Hawke was nominated himself as Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Jim Broadbent for Iris. Still it remains his career role so far.Corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department isn't exactly a new story. In fact one of the supporting players, Scott Glenn who plays a drug peddler and well, did another film about LAPD corruption in Extreme Justice. LA Confidential also dealt with this issue recently, another fine film.Denzel Washington is a great example in this film of the arrogance of power. He's a guy who dispenses more street justice than going through the traditional system. So with what happens to him here, he gets one of the best comeuppances ever seen on the big screen.And I won't say what it is, but you've got to see Training Day to find out.",

There's no logic or plot worthy of following. That's not the point of this movie. The audience is Ethan Hawke as he tries at first to submit to the Denzel hurricane. Then we're trying gather our feet in the storm. Finally we have to make a decision about his character. This is a tour-de-force performance from Denzel and nothing less.",

It's a riveting 122 minutes, I'm just not in love with how the premise is played out.Washington's character, Alonzo, never really changes throughout, despite a supposed problem of his. I kept waiting for a reason to change the opinion that the first act puts to you regarding him but it never came, there's never a point I cared for him and I assume I was supposed to... at least to some degree? Also, his issue is thrown at you in one scene and isn't really mentioned again until the end. I get the character, just not his arc.Ethan Hawke is very good, too, in this, even if I kept hearing Tom Cruise when he spoke... You also have a load of now familiar faces involved, including Eva Mendes, Raymond Cruz, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Terry Crews. Quite an interesting cast list, that.Loved all of this, except the (still good) plot execution. Maybe that's just me though. From what I've seen, Washington's best performance so far. He's the main takeaway from this whatever way you look at it.",

            "review_title": "Fantastic, Denzel Washington's finest hour",
            "content": "Before seeing this movie, my impression of Denzil Washington as an actor wasn't especially high. Not to say that he isn't talented, just that ever since Crimson Tide he appeared to be slotted neatly into every stern hero in every serious political thriller to be trotted off the studio assembly line for years. But then came Training Day and his role as Alonzo Harris and all that changed. Shrugging off the overly serious good guy image once and for all, Washington here is a revelation; a barking, ranting maelstrom of police brutality who believes that maintaining order on the crime ridden streets of LA means being even more ruthless than the drug dealers he faces on a day to day basis. His performance elevates the film from standard thriller fare into an exemplary story that has quite rightly become one of my favourite films of all time.Set over the course of twenty four hours, the film whisks Ethan Hawke's naive young police officer onto an introductory day of Narcotics work under Alonzo's tutelage. As the hours go by, Hawke is subjected to more and more violence as the heat and paranoia of suburban Los Angeles combined with his loose cannon superior officer play a heavy toll on his nerves. Consequently, the film is very much a two man story with Hawke and Washington playing off against each other expertly as polar opposites. One young, inexperienced and a firm believer in the rule book, the other older, more cynical and twisted by all his years on the streets into a bull-headed monster.The story itself is fraught with tension. Alonzo forcing his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to smoke PCP at gunpoint is just the start and from there on the pulse pounding never stops. The execution scene where Hawke realises just how far gone his partner is for example is one of nail-biting pressure and shortly after, his encounter with a trio of Mexican gang members is jaw dropping, working as the exact moment you realise how much hot water he has found himself in.The end result is nothing less than a brilliant thriller. Hawke and Washington make for a phenomenal double act and the pace only occasionally lets up to allow the characters time to breathe and establish the depth that makes you care for them more. Highly, highly recommended so long as you're prepared to be absolutely terrified of Denzel Washington for years to come.",

            "review_title": "Training Day is a prime example of how just one scene can elevate a film to greatness.",
            "content": "You all know the scene I'm talking about. Alonzo's monologue against the street that he thought would cooperate with him. That scene. Urgh, genius. A rookie narcotics officer is paired with a more experienced, albeit corrupt, detective for a day of training in the urban streets of Los Angeles. What looks like a semi-professional day on the job turns out to be a nightmare for the rookie. There are a ridiculous amount of positives, but unfortunately there are various negatives that prevents the police drama from being classed as a classic. At its core, this is a character study. A twisted, demented and self-assured detective who may have started out with the right intentions, but gradually becomes corrupted by the streets. The screenplay consistently reaffirms the idea that it is the environment that changes a person. Being adaptable under given scenarios. The depiction of the streets of Los Angeles and the black and white segregation is rather prominent throughout the film's runtime. Yet it feels extremely real. It is the gritty and dark undertone embedded within the narrative that intrigues you and makes you invested in the characters. Speaking of our protagonist(s), Ethan Hawke was sublime as the naive rookie who just wants to help the world, one crime at a time. However, Denzel Washington just owns every scene in what I can only describe as his best performance. His acting was ferocious. Conveying confidence and fear simultaneously. David Ayer's best script (although that's not saying much...) and Antoine Fuqua's best directorial effort. It's just a shame the ending was unsatisfying with too many plot conveniences throughout. What were the chances that the girl they saved at the beginning was the cousin of a Sure\u00f1o who was going to kill Jake!? Absurdly convenient. Then later we get the craziest overkill of the decade. Bullets galore. Alas, I do find this to be a gripping police drama and Washington's best performance. That's enough for me to highly recommend this.",

            "review_title": "Authentic, Intelligent & Utterly Engrossing",
            "content": "This movie's a top quality police drama that's not only violent, tense and exciting but also authentic, intelligent and utterly engrossing. It's set in the most dangerous neighbourhoods of L.A. where undercover cops regularly have contact with drug dealers and gangsters and also face high-risk situations on an almost daily basis. The men who undertake this work have to assume many of the characteristics of the criminals they pursue in order to be accepted and in so doing are expected to avoid being sucked into behaving in the same way as the people they're seeking to bring to justice. Needless to say, not every officer manages to do this.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)is an ambitious young rookie who wants to advance his career by becoming a member of an elite squad of undercover officers who work under the leadership of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). When Alonzo agrees to take Jake on a one-day ride-along, Jake's thrilled, eager to learn and hopeful that he can show that he has the qualities needed to be a successful member of Alonzo's team.Jake is naive, idealistic and totally unprepared for the events that he'll experience during his training day. He's initially disconcerted by Alonzo's repartee and sense of humour and is later unsettled by some of his mentor's practices, which seem incredibly unorthodox. Alonzo has many years of experience in undercover work and so Jake is reluctant to challenge his methods too strongly.After observing the sale of some drugs in a park, Alonzo chooses not to make any arrests but simply acts in a very threatening manner towards the buyers and then confiscates their drugs. When Jake sees a young girl in an alley being sexually assaulted by two men, he overpowers them on his own and is then surprised when Alonzo decides not to report the incident after viciously beating up the two attackers. Alonzo knows that the girl's related to a gang member who will ensure that the two men are suitably punished but Jake is appalled by the use of this kind of street justice.Later, Jake accompanies Alonzo when he uses a fake search warrant to enter a drug dealer's house so that he can steal the dealer's money and on another occasion when Alonzo and the rest of his squad kill a drug dealer who used to be a cop so that they can steal his money. Jake refuses to take a share of the proceeds but then is forced to change his mind after Alonzo threatens to frame him for the murder.During his day with Alonzo, Jake is forced at gunpoint to smoke marijuana (laced with P.C.P.) and later pressured into drinking whisky and beer. He also learns that Alonzo owes a large amount of money to some Russian gangsters from Las Vegas and that the money stolen from the drug dealers is to be used to pay them off.Jake's recognition of how corrupt Alonzo had become had grown as the day progressed but things then become even more threatening when he realises during a visit to a Latino gangster's home that Alonzo has abandoned him and the gang are determined to kill him.\"Training Day\" contains plenty of action and violence but it's all relevant to the story and is very effective in portraying the level of danger that Jake finds himself in. The way in which the story unfolds draws the audience into identifying with the hapless trainee and in so doing makes the whole drama extremely gripping. The initial meeting of Alonzo and Jake is fascinating and the way that their relationship develops turns out to be both interesting and unpredictable. The inclusion of sequences filmed on location in the neighbourhoods where the action is set, enhances the realistic feel of the whole project and the authentic sounding dialogue strengthens this further.Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance captures perfectly Alonzo's unique combination of charm and menace and Ethan Hawke is extremely impressive as a young guy who experiences the most eventful and memorable day of his life.",

I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, \"Black Hawk Down\"...no clich\u00e9s, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. \"Training Day\" was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, \"not Oscar material\" and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?",

            "review_title": "Training Day A Solid Action Crime Thriller",
            "content": "Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch.",

            "content": "The most intense ride along ever. Antoine Fuqua directed a wild cop drama like you have never seen before. Dealing with systematic corruption in the police force, crime investigation, drug dealing, bribery, and ethics. Training Day is a visceral sprint into law enforcement. Training Day forces you right into the position of a rookie cop asking yourself what would you honestly do in the same situation. It is brilliant due to David Ayer's clever and complex script alongside Fuqua's innovative and gritty direction. Training Day is timeless thanks to its commentary on police corruption and our contemporary police brutality problem. I think everyone needs to see Training Day. Denzel Washington is the real star as he comes across as the most real and selfish cop ever put on screen. His violence, anger, and ingenuity are met with his display of likability, experience, and results. Washington portrays a man of deeply held convictions that poses as a good cop to fool all those around him. Washington earned that Oscar for real. You will absolutely despise his character by the end. Notably, Ethan Hawke is the everyman rookie cop that we are meant to empathize with from the very first scene. We are along for the ride right by Hawke's side and he plays it wonderfully. From the naive well wisher that does not understand the streets to the honest cop that does the right thing, Hawke pulls off a very relatable performance in Training Day. He plays off of Washington's outgoing psychopath very convincingly down to the last. I like Hawke in Training Day quite a bit. I must mention there are so many neat cameo and supporting roles scattered throughout Training Day. From Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Eva Mendes, and Terry Crews. Training Day's cast is wild. Everyone is realistic and feels a part of this horrid world of crime and corruption. In all, Antoine Fuqua did a phenomenal job directing Training Day. It has aged well with the same intensity as when it first released in theaters. Training Day is still shocking and visceral down to the last moment. This is a brutal ride along for the books, but well worth the watch.",

            "content": "I know I'm late as hell and I hate to break the overall 'vibe' about this movie but this movie was great when I saw it in the theater and gets better every time I watch it over again. And this is mainly because of the performances by Denzel and Ethan. I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.Next time you guys bash a movie, make sure to try to be objective and rate what you see and not what you're used to seeing!!",

Hawke meets then detective Alonzo Haris (Denzel Washington) who was assigned as trainer and evaluator for this rookie. Hoyt wants fiercely to get this assignment, but finds very orthodoxes and quaint ways to \"protet and to serve\" of Alonzo.

With the allure of a new job, a transfer to the division that he has been working hard to reach. He is at the top of his game. The Call, from the department head, Alonzo Harris, congratulating him on his promotion, sort of. Denzel Washington, takes on a character, like none other that he has had so far. Sounds like a big business wall street type scenario aye? Not even close, down of skid-row street maybe. This is a story set in Los Angeles, that even when it's daylight, this is the darkest 'beat' in the whole department's city.From the moment that the meet was set at the coffee shop, something is just, slightly skewed. There seems an absence of real concern for Jake's situation and a lot more mechanical rogue cop, trainer 'Doggin' going on here. Alonso wants to catch him up on what's going on, of course, see what he is made of, but Alonzo is dangerous, because he doesn't care, anymore. His soul has departed, and it's simply a matter of time before, he is too. As they departed from the coffee shop, by way of a black Monte Carlo. The director, Antoine Fuqua wanted to show a more real and brutal side of the crime busting business. The place where lines are so blurred...if they even exist anymore. Denzel Washington, should be applauded for the part that he became ' wholly ' involved in. Scary in some ways, it appeared as if there was no acting, just this over the edge ' Narc ' who you just gotta watch like a hawk! Ethan, was the ' newbie ' but a very likable, \"Just wanting to do the right thing\" type of guy. Some what confused at times about the way in which Harris attended to his profession. Curious about why he would do what he would do. Alonzo, always explaining away the point to a nervous rookie, who in the back of his mind just knew, that there is something here, that won't let him rest until he does the right thing. It almost costs him his life, in the end, Hoyt is a master in his career field...a true Wolf, amongst the dogs. It seemed as though, Hoyt had an awakening. He had to go down into that alley-way because his 'gut' wouldn't let it alone. And in the end, this is what saved his very existence, now that is reasoning with razor sharpness. Plus he needed to get home to that hot wife of his....Recommended, but not for those with weaker film story constitutions. (*****)",

            "content": "This unflinchingly realistic police drama takes viewers into the dangerous world of drug dealing that runs rampant in the streets of South Central Los Angeles and where is a subject on nearly every street of the area. Along the side, this film also gives viewers an inside look at the corruption of law enforcement and police brutality that remains a major issue in the United States today. The film places Ethan Hawk in the role of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who ventures on a 24- hour 'ride along' with veteran narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington). Cruising through the dirty, crime-ridden streets of Los Angeles, Harris pulls Hoyt in the grueling of crime and drug-busting. However, when Alonzo's lines between right and wrong become blurred and his bold decisions put Hoyt's life at risk, Hoyt soon find himself in a dangerous game of survival. This film is directed by Antoine Faqua and written by David Ayer who would later go on write and direct many other cop dramas. Not many films portray the harrowing reality of the law enforcement as realistically as this one does, and this film does not shy away from the dark side of police corruption as we watch the characters venture through the sordid streets of the South Los Angeles suburbs and experience the violence and gang activity that consumes these neighborhood. Thanks to Denzel Washington who breaks his usual good- guy typecasting to portray a narcotics cop who suffers significant ethical dilemmas and brings his first-time partner in jeopardy. The intensity of his character drives the plot in a long run, to the crescendo in the last half hour of the film At one point during the training, his character busts two teenagers for possession in marijuana with phencycldine, upon taking it he smokes it and then offers it to Ethan Hawke's character who in response smokes it. This scene immediately leaves you questioning on who his character is and leaves you with thoughts that this character could be up to no good. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance as Detective Alonzo Harris. Throughout the film, Washington is just drowned out in his role with such powerful effort. It is quite astonishing to see him play in a villainous role so well after watching him play in good-guy roles in his other works. Ethan Hawke does a magnificent job here too. He is shown to be very committed in what is arguably the best role of his career, and his talent shines bright here.Training Day is a highly entertaining movie and a textbook addition to the police drama genre. Complete with mesmerizing performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, powerful directing by Antoina Faqua, and a spectacular screenplay by David Ayer; Training Day definitely hits home.",

The whole thing has a slightly de-ja-vu look about it, as other equally good movies resonate in one's memory. But just as it begins shuffling towards Boredom Street, the plot quickens and undergoes a dramatic and unexpected shift. A likable bad guy, played by reliable Scott Glenn is ruthlessly slain by the mentor (who has clearly crossed the line) in punctuation for stealing his $4million stash. The whole thing is rigged to look like a shake-down that went wrong. It certainly gets your attention. Needless to say; the rookie wants no part of it and declines his share in the pay-off. You know from that point on that a collision course is inevitable. Later this rookie is left in the hands of a bunch of homicidal Hispanics who have evidently been paid by his mentor to whack him. He survives this experience by a coincidence that borders upon the supernatural and is rather hard to take seriously. Still; he does, and now goes after his 'villain' mentor. After that we are back to formulaic again. The ending is as weak as the beginning. Our rookie survives, the mentor gets wasted (by Russian mafia types) there's a brief off-camera newscast voice-over explaining that he's a 'hero' cop who died in the line of duty, blah,blah, blah.A group of shady senior law officers referred to as the Three Wise Men and who are also evidently rotten as hell - of which Tom Berenger is wasted in a cameo role - are never seen or heard from again. It's a very incomplete and unsatisfactory denouement. I'm left thinking that the money or the celluloid just ran out before the story could be wound up.You can see hints of 'Serpico' - which is more believable, 'The Rookie' - which is more fun, 'Deep Cover' which is more gripping, and one or two others. This work is adequate. The script is decent; acting is mostly good; location, lighting and sound do the business. Editing seems a bit choppy at times. It lights up predictably, shines brightly for a while, but fades without much flair. Worth a watch if you get the chance, but not recommended for any particular quality.",

Moreover, Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.So, this movie has two great performances to see, as the rogue cop, Alonzo Harris (Washington) takes on the new wannabe narc rookie, Jake (Hawke) on his very first day on the job. And, what a day it is...There are three threads to this complex plot: first, Alonzo has the Russian Mafia after him and must deal with the problem or die \u0096 there's a contract out on him, and those Russian types just don't mess around; Alonzo also has a group of dirty cops who are getting ready to take down another long-time dirty cop who's been supplying drugs for years \u0096 and Alonzo and his gang intend to cash in; and, finally, Alonzo has a do-gooder rookie who thinks he's on the job to actually do good for others, instead of just doing good for himself \u0096 money-wise that is.So, where're the real bad guys, you ask? Well, they're either wearing suits and pulling Alonzo's chain in the big end of town or, they're sitting on the sidelines of the really bad areas, waiting for Alonzo and his buddies to mess things up for themselves \u0096 so that they can then cash in...A big part of the plot is somewhat artificial because Jake's eventual success, shall I say, on his first day comes only as a result of a very fortuitous co-incidence when he saves a young schoolgirl from an attempted rape. It's a crucial event, and I suppose the screenwriter figured that only one unlikely co-incidence was okay. I guess so...Apart from that, it is a fast paced, beautifully edited and photographed, non-stop, rip-roaring, pulsating, wisecracking, boom and bust, kick-butt action movie that left me dazed after first viewing. A second viewing helped to clear up some of the more confusing details. You might want to watch it twice also, but if you like Denzel, then you'll watch this one at least once.",

Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do \"anything you want me to do\", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won Denzel the Oscar that year for Best Actor!!

His superficially schizoid behavior here is all under his complete control. All thought out and manipulative and lethal, nothing accidental. His only problem is his delusional perception of his own omnipotence, and misperception of how people he perceives as his obedient followers really feel about him. His denial of the \"Big Picture\" is his Achilles heel.Stronger by far then either version of Bad Lieutenant or Gang Related , or too many other Bad cop movies to list, This is just a great movie.",

It's like it was a handout for playing something more true to his \"race\". I thought the film was gritty enough and showed that cops can be turned from seeing what they see all the time. The film was good at presenting that side instead of the justice for side. Ethan Hawke kinda took a backseat to Denzel's power in this film. It was necessary however so Hawke could determine for himself if he wanted that life badly enough. It made me wonder how many cops are like that and if there really is any justice left when within the police lie people like Alonzo. Not too bad a film, but you have to have a penchant for films about bad cops, and I don't. Even with Denzel in it.",

He deserved that Oscar and I will forever be mad that he did not get it.The real credit is given to the man himself, Denzel Washington, who I reviewed as The Equalizer in the 2014 film based on the television series of the same name.Denzel Washington plays the villain Alonzo Harris really amazing and his performance was just top-notch and very amazing and not only he played that part amazingly, he did a great job with the dialogue written for him at the end when all of the gang members turn against him after letting Ethan Hawke's character got home and the scene where he was shot by Russian gang members just had me wanting to cry the first time I saw this film.He won the Oscar for Best Actor and he was spectacular in the role and it is a departure from his usual roles that he played and he would play Frank Lucas in the 2007 film American Gangster and he did a really amazing job.The rest of the cast, nothing more to say about them, but they all do great, especially Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in the screen time that they have.The music by Mark Mancina is just amazing and I listen to the musical score and soundtrack for this film on my phone and it sounds really good in the film and I could have not been more happier.Overall, I love Training Day.

Ethan Hawkes is Jake Hoyt, newly \"recruited\" to it and even eager to join.Hoyt immediately sees that Harris is not your run of the mill detective, he appears to have a unique style of \"detecting\" - Which involves all kinds of bullying and fear tactics- And he does not limit this to suspects, he uses them on Hoyt as well.In reality Harris has a specific agenda. Hoyt goes along with it but each activity of their day raises the red flag level higher and higher.Harris actually rules over a small section of hell, a gang-ridden neighborhood called \"The Jungles\" where his son and girlfriend Sara (Eva Mendes) live. Harris expressly instructs Hoyt never to enter \"The Jungles\" by himself. Harris appears to be the \"benevolent protector\" of this neighborhood and we get that impression as well. Remember, this is all appearances- This whole film depends on our \"First Impressions\" and how they are wrong.We get to meet many of Harris' \"friends\" and acquaintances, who are either \"retired\" drug pushers who have served their time (Scott Glenn as \"Roger\") or Judges and DA's (Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger and Doug Rosselli and Stan Gursky respectively). In fact, the two categories of people are interconnected in some way through Harris. And Harris plays them like finely tuned instruments.And now Harris has chosen Jake Hoyt. The only question we can ask as the body count rises is \"Why\"?Alonzo likes Hoyt because he has a good eye for what is happening around him, this is proved when Hoyt sees a rape happening in the corner of his eye, jumps out of the car and takes on the two gang-bangers who are piling on a hapless girl. In the process she loses her wallet and Jake picks it up: File for future use.This film puts a new slant on the words \"Patsy\" and \"Double/Triple/Quadruple Cross\".Washington plays this as if he's the guy, just like he does any other role, Hawkes follows suit with the \"Innocent Look\" that hides the fact that he's seen more than he lets on. Look for the likes of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, and veteran character actors Nick Chinlund and Raymond Cruz- Several real gang-bangers from the LA neighborhood called \"The Jungles\" were used as well.Antoine Fuqua mimics Tony Scott's style of directing with a great score by Mark Mancina peppered with some decent Rap tracks and other interesting music.",

In fact, both actors attracted Oscar nominations with Washington deservedly winning for Best Actor for his bravura turn.

But none of their plans go as they intended thus the reason for this movie's erratic thrill.Training day is a well conceived, incredibly performed, eloquently written, beautifully directed, captivating and mind bending art.

Poor and naive Jake unaware of the scheme his future to be boss plotted against him gets baited into delving deeper and deeper into the slimy and foul acts of Alonzo and when things seem ineludible, his benign act saves him from certain death.Training day is awesome as a second watch cause you'll see the foreshadowing of it all ( Jake paying his death money hit right in the guts for me ) and appreciate the smarts that went into building the intricate plot and characters.Denzel's charismatic and menacing performance, Ethan's confusion and eventual degradation into disappointment, depravity and rage and Eva's helpless look impressed me as all totally morphed into these incredibly complex and authentic characters. Denzel especially was unlike anything I've ever seen. He became Alonzo and pushed his character to a point that's irredeemably evil and hella scary.Every scene was well directed and pretty to the eyes and the colorful lines ( esp Alonzo's ) are to never stale and be forgotten.

What starts off with a decent premise disintegrates about midway through the movie where the \"rogue\" cop can somehow get away with virtually everything. Denzel is a baddie that is not only untouchable, but seems to have been unnoticed by everyone, including the press and those who are not involved in the corrupt underground. The plot holes are gaping, especially where he leaves his partner to an uncertain fate for reasons unexplained and with an escape that gives a whole new meaning to the words \"deus ex machina.\" The ending, where a white man can simply walk through a tough black neighborhood and then get their backing, was about as awkward as John Goodman on a tightrope. Worse is how Washington's partner is able to pull of physical feats that rival those of coming back from being pummeled more than Rockey and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound *and* showing strength and \"stickum\" like Superman and Spiderman. You'll wonder who thought up this tripe. Denzel Washington is a fine actor but the script was so awful that Denzel was left with the memorable tag line \"you shot me in the a**!!!!\" I fail to see how any actor could win an Oscar with such a poor script. The \"all black win\" at the Oscars was unquestionably pre-scripted for this warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment to America. Denzel may deserve an Oscar for another film, but combine this tripe with Halle Berry (and there were plenty of other films and performances that were far better than hers) and you can understand what kind of contrived garbage you have here. If you want to see another fine black actor who hasn't won an Oscar and should have that appears in an awful film that should, unfortunately, prevent him from receiving an Oscar, go see Morgan Freeman in \"Along Came a Spider\" -- another contrived piece of garbage.",

It's got really good action scenes, the plot is engaging and you're on the edge of your seat and the showcasing of corruption in the police is a really good portrayal.There is a few things I would have liked to have changed. For example, I felt as though the side characters were a bit pointless in the grand scheme of things. Eva Mendes character and the \"3 Wise Men\" spring to mind in a sense that they could have been utilised so much more and they were just left to burn really. I thought as well they really bigged up this whole Alonzo being in trouble with the Russians, but it didn't really amount to much.However, I felt the plot was still incredibly engaging and the complexity of the characters is what really carries this movie and I have to say I was glued from start to finish. From the get go you're thrown into the mix and there's no bland moments. It really keeps you interested and curious to know what's going to happen next and that for me is what makes a good movie.If you haven't seen I would highly recommend and this is a very strong 8/10 from me today!!",

I loved it so much I could never get enough. Denzel and Ethan are a perfect match for this movie; I can't imagine anyone else playing their rolls. Can you? You will either love this movie or find it just a way to 'pass a night'. If you connect with it then you'll never forget it. I know I haven't and I haven't watched it since 2002 because I can remember every part in detail! Training Day is one of those movies which breaks new ground in terms of how a movie can come across to people. It was filmed in such locations such as Imperial Courts neighborhood which, until now, hasn't been filmed. The talk is the talk... you get a real sense of what it's like for these guys as narcotic officers and for what it's like for these guys as the 'bad guys' themselves. At the end of they day they're \"Just people and they always were\" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview).The movie isn't the fastest paced one around - there are some slow moments but they are played out meaningfully due to some great acting talent which gels the scenes together well. The more you watch it, the more subtle lines and actions you will pick up which make this movie authentic.Overall, to each his own. I have found this to be one of my favorite movies due to great acting, great directing, great casting (Hawk, Washington, Scott Glen etc) and an interesting storyline.",

            "content": "Police and thieves are such a staple of TV that you have to be looking at making something special to make one stand out as a feature film.Here the producers try and make things bigger, bolder and more extreme but, sadly, this only makes the production more hysterical and far-fetched. No cop in the history of the force is quite as down-and-dirty as the one played here by Denzil Washington. Indeed he is probably as out-there as any cop in the history of cinema cops!Excess and success have often been mistaken for one another in the Oscar world and here Denzil took the main prize with this good, but hardly great, performance. The guy can grin and talk in double time (this guy knows about speech rhythm and stress - which is rare for an American actor), but this must have been a poor year. Nathan Hawke is actually just as good as the rookie that may - or may not - be corrupted.Here we are in \"blacktown after-dark\" (for those that have seen Kentucky Fried Movie!) and you can be sure that the minute they step out of the car there will be gunshots, a chase and a death. Yes it is quite lively and the street hoods do look the real deal, but so what, they probably are the real deal!I feel for Hawke, the cop he is playing is a moron so he can only react not act. Hope he gets his own star gig soon - he looks ready.There are plenty of other movies that leave a horrible aftertaste - Boyz in the Hood, Menace 2 Society, Taxi Driver, to name but three - but there films have some social comment to make. This doesn't. This says: It is all rotten, it is all without hope. Bad places have bad cops so they are part of the problem not part of the solution. There is no redeeming qualities here. It is just a pointless theme ride through the LA gutter. Sadly it won't be the last.",

            "content": "I was anxious to see \"Training Day\" because Denzel Washington won the Oscar for his performance. It indeed was an Oscar-caliber performance, but that alone doesn't make it a great film. In fact, to me it is seriously flawed.As Denzel said in an interview this week, when he found out his character met such a finality, he took license to make him a really bad guy. With perhaps noble intentions, this cop deals out his own form of justice to the drug traffickers, in one scene shooting Scott Glenn's character with a shotgun in his apartment, then telling the other officers present how they should relate the incident to authorities. Denzel was also a cheating husband, with a primary family of wife and 4 sons, and a young son on the side with a Hispanic woman in the \"hood.\"Ethan Hawke plays an honest, by-the-book type of guy who is also street smart and capable of handling himself, a good cop. He eventually gets the upper hand on Denzel, after being abandoned for dead among Latino gambler thugs, and prevents him from getting the stolen money to the payoff point.The following comments contain information which may be considered SPOILERS for those who have not yet seen Training Day.The story covers one day, from early morning to midnight, it is Ethan Hawke's first day \"training\" with corrupt cop Denzel to become a narcotics officer. It ends when Denzel, unable to get the $Millions to the Russians by midnight, is gunned down at a stoplight by a half-dozen or so Russians. But I get ahead of myself.Although difficult to watch at many points, most of the first 3/4 of the film has a realistic, ingenuous feel to it. Then the last parts become disingenuous. After a brutal fight, Hawke drops from the roof onto the hood of Denzel's car? Denzel, instead of getting out and disposing of him does a multiple car-ram routine in the parking lot? Denzel flaunts disobedience of all the rules, even pointing a gun at another driver in mid-day, but at midnight, on a deserted street stops and waits for a light to change to green?? That was obviously done only to stage the finality where the Russians box him in and then start shooting. A rather promising story, once again, ruined by a poor and unimaginative end game. Staged fights, near-executions, saved-by-a-phone-call scene, car crashes, slow-motion execution do not a good movie make.I saw it on DVD. While the picture and sound are fine, and there are a couple of interesting extras, overall the presentation by modern standards is average at best. Overall a disappointment, with much foul language and crude sexual references, and I will not recommend \"Training Day\" to friends.",

He deserved that Oscar and I will forever be mad that he did not get it.The real credit is given to the man himself, Denzel Washington, who I reviewed as The Equalizer in the 2014 film based on the television series of the same name.Denzel Washington plays the villain Alonzo Harris really amazing and his performance was just top-notch and very amazing and not only he played that part amazingly, he did a great job with the dialogue written for him at the end when all of the gang members turn against him after letting Ethan Hawke's character got home and the scene where he was shot by Russian gang members just had me wanting to cry the first time I saw this film.He won the Oscar for Best Actor and he was spectacular in the role and it is a departure from his usual roles that he played and he would play Frank Lucas in the 2007 film American Gangster and he did a really amazing job.The rest of the cast, nothing more to say about them, but they all do great, especially Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in the screen time that they have.The music by Mark Mancina is just amazing and I listen to the musical score and soundtrack for this film on my phone and it sounds really good in the film and I could have not been more happier.Overall, I love Training Day.

Movies don't get much grittier than this one. Director Antoine Fuqua pulls no punches when telling the story of a rookie cop's first day as detective. Ordinarily we would be raving about the brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt but such is the personality and expertise of Denzel Washington , Hawke is overshadowed. The scene in the kitchen when he is left alone with the card playing gang members is a memorable one.This movie is 10 years old now and rarely has there been a film since to compare.

Looking them over now however, makes them seem clich\u00e9 ridden, offered in an attempt to manipulate the viewer. That 'smiles and cries' explanation offered by Ethan Hawkes character was an eyebrow raiser, and how about it 'taking a wolf to catch a wolf'. The topper though was Denzel Washington's tattoo - \"Death is Certain, Life is Not\". That one prefaced the ending, since Washington's Alonzo wasn't a bad cop in a 'Die Hard' yipee-ki-yay sort of way, he was just a bad rogue cop.Let's face it, if \"Training Day\" represents a rookie's first day in narcotics, then the bad guys have won. Alternating hits of PCP, beer, and who knows what else, it's pretty amazing Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) even made it through that day. That's not including guns to the head, rifle blasts through the 'office' car, introduction to a Latino bathtub and falls from high rise apartment buildings after being beaten to a pulp. Even with steely resolve and a strong constitution, there's got to be a better way to make a living.Story semantics and odds defying coincidences aside, Washington and Hawke turn in strong performances as cops on opposite sides of the moral fence. It's not enough though to tone down the way over the top situations and confrontations the pair find themselves in and out of, all without a moment's rest.

            "review_title": "So What Was His Second Day on the Job Like?",
            "content": "Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day' portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols. We've seen plenty of 'bad apple' cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place. Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants. For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the lowlifes at their own game - employing their tools, using their methods - the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner. Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner. Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flauting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves. Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such 'unconventional' actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations. Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking? The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.'Training Day' is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting. The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from. Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre. However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness. This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable. Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world. The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us. However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake. Washington, generally relegated to 'good guy' roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character. In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer. Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life. As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows \u2013 or thinks he knows \u2013 is right. These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move. Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), 'Training Day' provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie \u2013 and much, much finer acting.",

Featured in the film are Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Eva Mendes, and Snoop Dogg.Hawke is a young family man, Jake, who is teamed up with a decorated narcotics detective, Alonzo, to see if Jake has what it takes to work the street and go undercover. Alonzo is a very unsettling guy - joking one minute, mean the next - and Jake doesn't know quite how to take him. He just knows the job means a lot to him.Gradually it dawns on him that a) Alonzo is more corrupt than any of the perpetrators he says he's after; and b) he's setting Jake up so that he's part of some dirty work and therefore won't be able to talk.Really top-notch, edgy performance from Denzel Washington, who is always full of surprises, here playing an unpredictable character. This was his Oscar winning role, and it was deserved, though there's no question that he deserved it in the past too. The film is full of action, violence, and really raw characters - one certainly gets a sense of the mean streets from watching this film. Ethan Hawke acts just as a man who doesn't know what's going on would - unsure, embarrassed, nervous, scared, but very determined and quick-thinking, as he realizes what he's gotten himself into.Shocking, violent, bloody, and fast - that about sums it up.

            "content": "Revisiting Training Day the other day after about fifteen years actually raised my score of it from an 8 to a 9. At the time, back in 2001, when it was released it was following behind a golden streak of movie years dating back to the mid-90s, so maybe it wasn't as appreciated as it should have been since the standards were so high; it was still very good, but something left a little to be desired. This sentiment held true on the rewatch, but only as to the very end of the movie, which in my opinion was still disappointing.Having Alonzo go out like Scarface was a let down and still is. It feels like an easy way out and a lazy way to end the story; it may have been chosen to add to the realism of the movie, but the film was dark enough throughout and didn't need a pitch black depressing ending. They should have at least had Alonzo fire back in a shootout to take out some of the bad guys after him, but the writers didn't allow him to even get one shot off- kind of anticlimactic if you ask me.However, this is really my only complaint with Training Day. In a surprisingly completely original story, Denzel Washington takes Ethan Hawke's rookie NARC agent through the streets of L.A., teaching him that what he learned in the Academy means zilch in reality once he is in the street game.Washington's Alonzo rarely evokes sympathy and even when you think he may, you have to question if ALonzo is just playing the game since he is so deceitful and can fake his emotions so well. However, there is one scene where it looks like Alonzo does let his guard down, and it is in that brief moment that you see that the real Alonzo is a broken man who has been hardened and corrupted by the true realities of the job through the years, which has taken its toll on him, giving him no choice but to play the game.But make no mistake, Alonzo is a bad guy. When the plot unfolds and his reasoning and tactics are revealed, you see that he is a scheming criminal, who is ruthless and will do anything to save himself, even if it means gaming and playing a rookie partner as a pawn in his game of survival.There is lots of truth and revelations as to the nature of cop corruption in this movie that I had never seen this realistic before. The way Alonzo can get dirt on everyone, but only use it if he needs to is very shocking and eye opening. He uses it to keep everyone on the street (and in his department sect) in line, but if they step out of line and get him in trouble, then he will just go write them up for a past violation and charge them. Knowing this, he purposefully tempts those around him to commit crimes (sometimes deceptively) so that he immediately has dirt on them (exampled in telling Hawke to take the dirty money and smoke the marijuana, which Hawke later learns from Alonzo himself is actually a much harder drug in dust- this btw was one of the most disturbing scenes watching Hawke's character get corrupted so early on by this lie).Alonzo has his \"dogs\" or \"boys\" all over the slums of L.A., which are for the most part his informants who he has been protecting from throughout his time working the streets. But you watch as he will play them as an Ace card in the hole if he needs to in order to escape justice himself, and simultaneously he explains why these high rollers can never face the court since they have too much dirt on everyone else as well and it would be hard to get a conviction after years of them serving as informants.In summary, the movie depicts an inevitable corruption that evolves in some police departments, as Alonzo has become corrupted and disillusioned by the realities of the game, which can only be learned through experience. The dangers and temptations, as well as him facing himself in the mirror have taken their toll on his soul, leaving him with no choice but to check his heart at the door in order to survive both the street itself and his own criminality. Alonzo is ruthless and willingly wears two faces throughout the job, always playing chess, but for all of his street smarts, you can't help but despise his bad behaviors and corrupt acts.This is a great movie that is riveting, creates constant tension, and teaches what can go wrong in police departments, especially those that have to deal with the dregs of society and the drug game. Hopefully Hawke's character went on to just write parking tickets like he implied after getting a taste of the realities of the job that no good soul would ever want to be a part of.9/10",

I can think of other characters he's played that were much better than his Training Day character...Alonzo.I was wondering why the whole elaborate set-up for Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to take the fall. Why didn't Alonzo simply shoot Scott Glenn, take his money, and leave the body until someone discovered it and conclude Glenn  killed by robbers?Also, after when they were in Glenn's house, they dug a big hole in his kitchen to get the money that had been buried in a chest. They cut through the floor with an ax and dug it out. After Alonzo shoots his partner, they radio the dispatch to tell them an officer has been shot.This would've gotten an immediate response from all cops in the area. How did they fill in the hole in the kitchen so quickly and replace the floor boards they chopped up witht he ax? If they didn't do that and the hole was still uncovered..it seems like a homicide detective would have been somewhat curious about it and would have asked questions.Plus, they tell the officers that Hoyt was shot Glenn and the cops don't take him in for questioning and let him continue on his shift. It's seems like he would've at the very least been taken off his shift until internal affairs investigated the shooting.Next, Alonzo leaves Hoyt with some gangsters, assuming they were going to kill hoyt. How did Alonzo plan to explain that to his supervisors? He abandons his partner on the first day, his partner disappears and no one would think twice about it?Police Chief\"Detective Alonzo, your partner is missing, he never clocked out of his shift and his wife and family want to know what happened to him.

When I was ready to leave, Hoyt was playing cards with the gangsters and drinking with them. He was having such a good time that I decided to let him stay.

            "content": "Apparently, the viewing public and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, loves bad cop movies. Now, I know what your thinking. Was that five bad cop movies, or six? Well to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kinda lost track myself. You know, the nice thing about the internet is that the ordinary, run-of-the-mill-movie-viewer can express his/her thoughts about the entertainment they've paid for, and not have to think that what the critics think is what everyone thinks. So here's what I think:I can't believe the fuss made over this new bad cop movie.\nWithout a doubt, you will be captivated and even frightened by Denzel Washington's portrayal of Detective Alonzo Harris, an over-the-edge narcotics detective. And you will be equally riveted by Ethan Hawke's portrayal of rookie detective Jake Hoyt, who has the all time worst first day on the job. The movie mixes the fantastically corrupt cops with Godfather (Mafia type) violence with the backdrop one of this nations largest cities, \u0091the Hood'. This is a case to way to much talent wasted on the tiring bad-cop-good-cop theme. Training day ranks up there with \u0091The French Connection', \u0091Dirty Harry' and \u0091L.A. Confidential'. So, yea it's a thriller, and you can ride with it, but, at least in my opinion, it's far less than memorable.FM",

So yeah, the story connects really well together even the parts that just look like subplots. And when you throw in Denzel Washington putting on his most explosive, menacing, charismatic and powerful performance. You got yourself one heck of a awesome street/hood/crime movie that pushes towards what street justices is like. Ethan Hawke is even believable playing a naive rookie officer with a good heart. This is a entertaining and yet enthralling experience to sit through, especially because of Washington's performance in this. Overall, this is a movie I can highly recommend.10/10",

Ethan Hawke is a serious cop (and he plays the role well). Even so, his trainer, Denzel Washinton, manages to get him to, or I should say the \"script\" manages to get him to, on their first day together as partners, smoke PCP, take responsibility for a murder, release two rapists, shake down a drug dealer in a wheelchair, drink beer and hard liquor on the job, conduct an illegal search, and more. It defies believability. The core of the movie seems to be a vehicle for DW to be the big angry, over the top bossy, black guy, and call his new rookie \"nigger\" for the first fifteen minutes of the movie. There was no suspense, no tension, just an angry black man yelling at his new white rookie for two hours. Nothing here for me.

I did not see any complexity in his character at all, and no redeeming qualities - the witch in Wizard of Oz was more likeable.As for the \"good cop\", he was just a greedy wimp.  (SPOILERS)  Sure, he turns down the buttload of money he's offered after the bad guy kills the drug dealer...  but does that matter?  Through most of the movie he puts up with or participates in illegal activities \"against his will\" - why? - because he wants to work his way up the ladder to a better job - why? - for the MONEY.  \"You should see the houses THEY live in\" he says to his wife in the first scene.  He acts so righteously offended by the bad cop right from the beginning, but goes along and goes along because he wants to attain his career goals.  Some moral high-ground, huh?The bad cop was bad right from the start - the rookie had no reason to respect him, take his advice, or want to follow in his footsteps.  I much prefer corruption movies where the bad guy's evilness slowly leaks out into the story, and where the rookie at first has reason to trust and respect him.  The moral dilemma and internal conflict of having to change your view of someone is just much more interesting than knowing from the start that he's a jerk.So the two main characters just left me feeling nothing except annoyed.Then, there's the plot.  I found too many things hard to swallow - that Washington's character was so very very bad and had apparently never been caught at it (yeah, there are corrupt cops, but this was too much), that he would involve the rookie in THAT MUCH corruption on his first day as a \"test\" of his character, that Washington's character thought even for a second that the rookie would just buy into his bulls*** and cover for him... I thought it was contrived and basically made no sense.The only thing that I *did* like plot-wise was the most contrived thing of all - the young woman the rookie saved turning out to be the cousin of the man who later would have killed him.  Now THAT'S a contrivance I would have liked if the rest of the movie hadn't annoyed me so much.  Sure, it's totally unrealistic, but at least it had some sort of point to make.All in all, it kept me awake and provided minimal entertainment.  It was interesting seeing Washington being a bad man.

Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no- nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do \"anything you want me to do\", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set- ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives. This is a must watch! The one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washington. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%.

Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?\"Training Day\" had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of \"Training Day\" is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in \"Runaway Train\" or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in \"Apocalypse Now.\"As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, \"I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir.\" How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.BOTTOM LINE: \"Training Day\" is an excellent urban thriller with a captivating performance by Washington. It's fittingly ugly, raw and brutal, so stay away if you don't think you can stomach it.The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in L.A.

I really enjoyed the dynamic between Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington, and I'm glad they both got nominations for their work here. After seeing Hawke in the 'Before' trilogy I know he can do dramatic roles and it goes without saying that Washington can act. The only thing I was worried about was that this movie may have that over the top action like some movies similar to this do. I was not disappointed.Praise- Its a high octane thrill ride from the beginning till end. I cant say I didn't predict Washington setting Hawke up, but its still for the most part un-expecting and very interesting. It was one of the first times Washington played a complete bad-ass on screen, and he played it well. I totally bought into Hawke's character being frightened by Washington and him daring to do all the crazy stuff that he is \"supposedly required to do\". There were also some great cameos by great actors playing small roles. Tom Berenger and Eva Mendes are barely present, but their presence is felt. This movie also has a high re-watch-ability factor. Particularly for the banter that goes on between the lead characters.Complaints- To be honest I felt that some things were unrealistic. Such as the bullets in Alonzo's car. You mean to tell me that nobody at the crime scene happened to notice the bullets in the rear view windshield? I also find it hard to believe that for over 10 years this man got away with going outside the law to put away criminals. But it is a movie, so anyway....Good movie overall with a memorable dynamic between the leads. Very pleased with the outcome.8.3/10",

Because the role is always the same : \"A man ho has to run from his family to protect his wife and child and also has to deal with the mafia. or like in this movie he deals with Drug-mafia's and for once he's the Bad Guy!.\"This one wasn't special although i must admit i have a \"Soft-Spot\" for the \"Beautiful, Foxy and Sexy Femme Fatale\" Eva Mendes.This movie just didn't do it for me.Denzel Washington is an actor but is he a great actor?He has won an Oscar, but let me ask you this : Is everyone ho wins an Oscar \"Worthy\" of winning the Prize?Is John Ruiz truly a Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world?Is Lennox Lewis one of the all-time great Heavyweight Boxing champions?The answer on the Denzel Washington question will always be a split decision, in my eyes.The best movie i saw of him was : \"The Hurricane\".That was truly a brilliant performance, but \"Training Day\" is not.And i think that movie will always make the grade in my book.The \"annoying\" thing about this movie is that the \"predictability\" is pretty \"obvious and boring\".When i mean \"Predictability\" i mean : Guns, Drugs, Mafia, shootout and This and that.And even if Denzel played the \"Bad Guy\".There wasn't anything \"Special\" about that role.Russell Crowe's \"Beautiful Mind\" but especially Will Smith's Ali are much better \"Performance's\".Some people on \"this Board\" seem to think this movie is \"real day to day life.\" or think that this Denzel's best performance.Well i don't think so!Hurricane was his best, Malcolm X i wasn't impressed with and Out Of Time was Good to watch but Sanaa Lathan and again Eva Mendes made it even more Tasty!And all that talk about this movie being real \"day to day\" life?How \"Out of touch\" can you be?At the end of the day everyone is in titled to his opinion.So my conclusion : This movie isn't one of \"Denzel's\" better performance's. Eva Mendes will always be \"Beautiful\" on the screen, she is a \"Very Underrated\" Talent.Ethan Hawke seemingly is very popular for his \"role\", witch was pretty good.And there are a lot of \"unnecessary\" \"Rappers\" invited like Dr. Dre and Snoop \"Doggy\" Dogg.And that doesn't much help the credibility of the \"real life case\" of this movie, that is put forward by some people on this board.And although the movie is rated \"High\" by many in my eyes the movie was nothing special than a \"Mediocre, Nothing Special Predictable\" Performance.For the people ho enjoy these kind of \"Action, Drug Mafia and Denzel type movies\" I'd recommend it.But for people ho are looking for \"more\" depth and a better or a more \"Real Life\" performance, i say : This is not the movie for You!My Score : 4.2\"Groeten\" from Gerrit",

            "content": "\"To protect the sheep, you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.\" This questionable sentiment is how rogue LAPD detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) justifies a heavy laundry list of dirty deeds, scary volatility, sociopathic backstabbing and a complete disregard for the badge that he wears on a chain like dog tags. And indeed, inner city Los Angeles can seem like a war zone, but its like he's in fact more part of the problem than the dark angel of justice he sees in himself. Antoine Fuqua's combustible crime drama Training Day rightly won Washington an Oscar for his unsettling runaway train of a performance, and he owns it down to the last maniacal mannerism and manipulative tactic. The film takes place over one smoggy L.A. day (hence the title) that feels like an eternity for its two leads, as well as all the colorful and often terrifying people they meet along the yellow brick road that's paved with used needles and shell casings. Harris is tasked with showing rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the ropes in his neighborhood, in the hopes that he'll pass the test and achieve Narc status. Jake is prepared for a run of the mill crash course, but as soon as he's treated to a verbal beatdown from Harris in the diner they meet at, he has a feeling it ain't gonna be anywhere close to a normal day. This is just another day for Harris though, as he drags Hoyt by the scruff through drug busts, gang warfare, the worst neighborhood in town and pulls him deeper into his very dangerous world. Fuqua has a knack for getting the atmosphere of his settings just pitch perfect, and the feverish nightmare of the inner city comes alive, seemingly possessing the characters themselves until the atrocities just seem like a way of life. The trouble really starts when they run across Harris's old drug lord buddy Roger (a wicked Scott Glenn in a role originally intended for Mickey Rourke), who proves a valuable asset later, though not in the way you might think. Harris introduces Jake to his equally crooked and scary team, including Peter Greene, Nick Chinlund and Dr. Dre who struggles in the acting department, especially in a room full of such heavy hitters. Jake is aghast at the horrors he sees and cannot believe the streets are like this. Harris devilishly assures him that this is the job, mutilating the symbol of his badge even more by justifying such behaviour as necessary. Tension reaches unbearable heights during a visit to a Latino gang household run by Cliff Curtis, Raymond Cruz and the eternally scary Noel Gugliemi. This is the heart of darkness fpr the film, a story beat from which there is seemingly no escape, until it becomes clear that Jake has somehow evolved a step up the food chain as far as LA goes, and is now ready to put down the dog who taught him, a dog who has long been rabid. People complain that the final act degenerates into a routine action sequence. Couldn't disagree more. With a setup so primed with explosive conflict, it can't end up anywhere else but an all out man to man scrap, which when followed by no flat out action sequences earlier in the film, hits hard. Their inevitable confrontation is a powerhouse, especially from Washington, who finally loses his composure and yowls like a trapped coyote, his actions caught up to him. In a role originally intended for Tom Sizemore (who would have rocked it in his own way) I'm glad Denzel got a crack at it, for he's absolute dynamite. Watch for Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry and Tom Berenger as the three senior LAPD dick heads, Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as a screeching banshee of a ghetto whore and Snoop Dogg as your friendly neighborhood wheelchair bound crack dealer. Fuqua keeps attention rooted on the dynamic between Washington and Hawke, who is excellent in as role that could have easily been swallowed up by Washington's monster of of a performance. Hawke holds his own, and the film is really about how two very different guys view a difficult area of town, how it changes them both, and ultimately how their moral compasses end up on a collision course. One of the best crime framas out there, and quickly becoming timeless.",

Ethan Hawke is quite good as the na\u00efve protagonist and the cast is also filled with many other well done roles. Peter Greene is always entertaining, and Eva Mendes is always a treat, clothes on or off. The highlight of the movie is Denzel Washington. His performance is a combination of spectacular acting and writing. Half the time you're not sure if he's just an abuser of power or a true demon, and every second of his screen time is just marvelous. Also starring in small roles are many rap legends from the genre's 90s hey-day, namely Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.The action is pretty intense and the camera follows it gracefully. My favorite scene had to be when Denzel visits his friend Roger, played by Scott Glenn . Delightfully brutal, and also a very plot-driven film I urge all to see.",

I love when he shoots Roger and Jake freaks out, he makes a very good point when Jake asks why he shot a friend. \"Why was he my friend, because he knew my first name? Roger sold crack to kids and the world is a better place with him dead!\" Every point he makes about modern day \"street\" justice rings very true to modern day crime and justice. It sets the tone very well for an awesome films and all though he is ultimately the bad guy, Alonzo Harris is one of the best characters to every grace the big screen and you can't help but like the guy. There are some great cameos from Dr. Dre and Snoop DoggA true modern day classic. Highly recommended",

At first, Jake tries to ask about the job, procedures, etc,, but Harris quickly fills Jake in on how he conducts his Narcotics team. They don't operate out of a police precinct.

Denzel Washinton's performance was uninspired to say the least, and seemed to be nothing more than a medley of other successful actor's adaptations of similar roles.

            "content": "What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of: gangster, crime, cop/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another: you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle: guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts \u0096 Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of: instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American \u0096 Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling \u0096 again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states: 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle. Although this manipulates our opinions on Jake as a bit of a wimp and further makes us think Alonzo is sort of invincible, the payoff for thinking these things is great \u0096 the filmmakers make us think of one thing so much that all the odds seemed stacked against us later on.What was also clever is the way in which the film can change so dramatically \u0096 although not entirely realistic all the time, one situation or setting can very quickly change in an instant. This could include when Jake is in big trouble with some Mexican gangsters but gets out of jail thanks to a previous deed that he did. Although this was a bit of a fluke, it would still be possible in the tightly knitted world of crime that particular city possesses. Although these changes are unpredictable and entertaining, lines must be drawn somewhere especially in which the finale is played out: where several characters seem to switch sides to team up with a guy who they've known of for about twelve hours, which was a little unbelievable.In the long run, Training Day is a very entertaining film that doesn't cover too much ground in terms of innovation or anything deeper than that but it is a clever example of how to suck an audience in and play with them later on.",

Along the way Denzel spouts philosophical mumbo jumbo about street justice and about how he's the real cops and not the guys helping old ladies with their groceries, that sounds real good on previews -hey they got my seven dollars fair and square, right?  Unfortunately on the way to possibly becoming something appealing intellectually, it back pedals and turns into an over-the-top action-suspense yarn.In the end I was not satisfied, though I may have been had my expectations not been contrary to the true intentions of the movie.  looking back, the best parts of the movie were probably the ones I enjoyed the least- the silly ones.

I was thrilled for the first, say, 105 minutes of Training Day.  Then, rather than giving us a shocking ending, which would have been ok, or an ambiguous ending, which would have been better, we are given a cheesy formulaic ending.  Not only that, the last 15 minutes are an assault on the viewer's intelligence. We are required to believe that Hawke's character would give up his weapon, we are hit with a ridiculous coincidence with the wallet, and it is suggested that our hero would know how to use LA's bus system to travel (quickly, another joke) from Boyle Heights to South Central (for those of you not from here, that would not happen).  Then Washington's character leaves Hawke's alive, and...oh forget it, the list just keeps going.But up until that point, I was so impressed.  Hawke's internal struggle was great to watch, and pretty plausible.  Washington, awful as his character was, was a joy to watch.  It was fairly reflective of local issues, coming on the heels of the Rampart police scandal, in which cops in one part of the city (where most of the movie was set) took over the streets, making a huge impact in crime while doing some terrible things.  The action scenes (until the latter moments) were fairly realistic looking and fun to watch.  The character actors in smaller roles (Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and especially Cliff Curtis and his friends) were outstanding.

The film makes a weak gesture at introducing an interesting moral dilemma: is it possible to fight the evil of drug-dealing while holding onto one's own sense of morality?  But ultimately, it has nothing complex or thoughtful to say about that dilemma.  The best performance in the film is actually Ethan Hawke's, a character torn by conflicting impulses. Hawke does a fine job of conveying that inner turmoil. Washington's performance is mostly just showing off, but then his character is largely a cartoon character.  The Oscar is a make-up for other better performances that have gone unrewarded.And isn't it enlightening that all of the film's people of color are despicable drug dealer or corrupt cops while the film's conscience is the white cop?I was generous; I rated the movie a 3.",

The obvious question after the first five few minutes is: why does LAPD bother to have a narco detail if the main drug busters double up as main drug runners and seize such large sums for themselves?Of course there are corrupt officers in any police force in any country, but,\ngiven the tools, checks and balances available to police in the USA, it is really difficult accept that premise, not to mention that Denzel's bent cop character is repellent throughout.Hawke balances things somewhat with his basic decency but you can see he will not last in such corrupt and vicious surroundings. Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, and Harris Yulin have meaningless small parts that only needlessly extend an overlong flick.Strong script up until the final fight between the leads, at which point it truly derails into dementia.Film's main saving grace: Eva Mendes in the nude, bush and all.

Together, they stop criminals, but it may turn out that the biggest criminal of the day may be with them the whole time.The acting in this movie is great. Denzel won Best Actor for his performance-and it's well earned! If someone else won in his place-that would have been a crime against humanity! Well, maybe not, but it would still be cruel!Ethan Hawke was great too, and I have not seen much of his work. I will be keeping an eye on his work now! In fact, everyone was great in this movie!If you read my reviews, you know I am against movies with a ton of language(see my review of The Wolf of Wall Street for an example.)While the IMDB trivia page says that the F word is said 211 times, and that can't be too far off, I found the movie to be more concentrated on it's awesome story than dropping in the next curse word in, unlike the other movie I mentioned! Still, if coarse language overused bothers you, wait for this to air on TV.I have read reviews saying that the end was kind of predictable, and it personally shocked me at first, then it didn't so much. If you don't overthink the entire movie, the ending is still impressive. Personally, I found the ending to have the best twist ending ever in a movie-and yes, I've seen The Sixth Sense!Some also argue that this movie couldn't have ended in one day. I would have to disagree. If this day starts somewhere from 7 am- 9 am, I could totally buy that this event ends before midnight! Plus, it's a movie for heaven's sake!As I watched this movie, I kept thinking of Quentin Tarantino, not just because of how brutal the violence can get at times, and not just because of the coarse language, but simply how the movie is structured.For example, the opening scene in the diner could have been an alternative opening to Pulp Fiction. This scene also has some Tarantino-like humor. I actually had to check the case to make sure QT had no involvement in this movie! This is the Tarantino movie that he didn't make!If this is not enough to make you want to see this movie, I don't know what else could! If more movies were as well-constructed as this, I would have a lot more absolute favorite movies!Training Day is the bomb, and there are few movies that I could recommend more! I feel like this movie should get a couple more stars, it's that brilliant!i can't say enough great things about it, so I'm stopping here-but definitely give Training Day a watch!",

I won't go into depth about the story, 'cause I want you to see it as I did, but let me just say that there were a number of times in the film were I was \"on the edge of my seat\".The only complaint I have about the movie is that Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray were in the film.

            "content": "It's easy to look at Training Day as just another action/crime movie with the bad cop corrupting the rookie and dragging him into his world. With Denzel Washington turning in his best performance as the villain and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic, likable and heroic good guy, this is anything but a routine movie. Both actors are excellent in their roles, and Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job bringing a gritty no holds barred crime movie to the screen.LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is an idealistic, honest, good hearted rookie who has one day to prove himself that he has what it takes in the Narcotics Division. Jake Hoyt is very eager to make a good impression and earn his place as well as seeing this role as a stepping stone to making Detective. Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington in his Academy Award winning role as Best Actor) is a 13 year highly decorated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and has a feared and respected reputation amongst all police officers, friends, criminals, and enemies alike. Alonzo is assigned to showing Jake the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles as well as taking Jake under his wing as a mentor. However, Alonzo Harris is a corrupt police officer to the point where the line is blurred between cop and criminal, right and wrong, good and bad, and what is legal and illegal. Alonzo Harris is not above physically intimidating and assaulting suspects, as well as stealing, robbing, assaulting, planting evidence, and setting up a murder to look like a justified shooting. Though Alonzo Harris justifies this as all in the good of taking bad guys off the street or in his words which he lives by on the streets of Los Angeles, \"To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.\" Alonzo Harris is also extremely arrogant and selfish who will do anything for money as well as caring very little for anyone else but himself.Once Jake Hoyt witnesses Alonzo Harris' unconventional methods of enforcing the law through his own brand of street justice in which he makes up his own rules, Jake finds that it may be too late to save himself and his career. Alonzo threatens Jake by making him smoke drugs at gunpoint otherwise face being thrown out of Narcotics Division. Jake also witness many immoral acts committed by Alonzo to the point where he questions his own conscience and whether Alonzo is a police officer wanting to enforce street justice or just a criminal wanting to commit acts beneficial to himself.Denzel Washington is well known for portraying a variety of good guys on the screen in movies such as Glory, Philadelphia and The Hurricane. Cast against type in Training Day, he does an excellent job portraying the villainous, down and dirty Alonzo Harris. There was a lot of controversy when Denzel Washington won the 2001 Best Actor Academy Award for his role when Russell Crowe was strongly tipped for his role in A Beautiful Mind. Regardless, Denzel Washington thoroughly deserved to win for his role. This is definitely Denzel Washington's best role in his entire career.Ethan Hawke was previously known for his roles in Dead Poets Society, Alive, Reality Bites, and The Newton Boys. Ethan Hawke, who also deserved to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, comes of age in his role as the idealistic and honest rookie Jake Hoyt who is very eager to make a good impression but finds himself in over his head in an unfamiliar world. Although Jake Hoyt makes several mistakes which end up almost costing him his career as well as his life, he proves himself to be a capable police officer when he saves a teenage girl from being sexually assaulted by two homeless men, which later saves his life. To date, this is Ethan Hawke's best role.Other actors which appear in Training Day include Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs) as a local drug dealer Roger, Tom Berenger (Platoon) as District Attorney Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin (Scarface) as Detective Doug Roselli, rapper Snoop Dogg as wheelchair bound drug dealer named Blue, New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis (Three Kings) as a thug named Smiley, pop star Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Eva Mendes in an early role as Alonzo's mistress Sara, and as part of Alonzo's corrupt crew of police officers rapper Dr. Dre as Paul (who comes across as a thug than a police officer), and Nick Chinlund (Con Air) as Tim.Training Day certainly left a long lasting impression of me when I first saw this movie back in 2002 which will never be forgotten. In what could have been a routine action movie, becomes an intense, gritty and compelling cop drama. Excellent job all round, Denzel Washington earns his well deserved critical acclaim as the bad guy Alonzo Harris, and Jake Hoyt also deserves acclaim for his role as Jake Hoyt. It's also great to see Antoine Fuqua go on to direct greater movies such as Tears of the Sun, Shooter and The Equalizer. Screenwriter David Ayer has also carved out his own career following this movie and has also made his mark as a director with Street Kings, End of Watch, and Fury.Training Day is an excellent movie which is definitely highly recommended.9/10.",

            "content": "Before watching the movie I had read some good and some bad credits about this movie. Some said it was overrated, that it wasn't realistic at all... Others said that it was the best movie they had ever seen. I saw the movie for the first time three years after it appeared in the theaters. Perhaps that is why I wasn't as influenced by the hype which was created around the movie as some other people may have been. Overall I liked the movie, though I wasn't very impressed with the first 20 to 30 minutes.What is the story about? The young police officer, Jake Hoyt, who has a perfect family, wants to get a better job within the LAPD. He doesn't want to write parking tickets for the rest of his life, but wants to become a detective in the Narcotica Brigade. To get this job, he will get some help and advice from a detective which is already chasing the bad guys for many years, but who isn't afraid to cross the line from time to time. Hoyt will have to make some big decisions, will he stay the good cop or will he cross the line as well?This movie may be a little predictable from time to time, but overall there are enough twists and unexpected plots to keep you focused and interested. The action is well portrayed, without exaggerating and Denzel Washington is really fabulous. I guess many people were a little bit disappointed because he played another part than what they expected from him. I liked him and I would advice everyone to watch the movie. To me this is worth at least 7/10, perhaps even a little bit more.",

Also memorable are the use of actual street gangs in the film, some on their first acting movie debut playing their roles quite well! Somewhat made in the same direction as the British film, \"The Long Good Friday\" starring Bob Hoskins and Helen Miren where the surprise revelation is at or near the end of the movie!

On the second, I didn't find the whole thing that appealing.I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening.

            "content": "I have never walked out of a movie before.  I don't intend to start doing so.  But, man alive, did this flick try my patience.Training Day is about Jake Hoyt (Hawke)'s first day in training to be a narc.  His \u0091mentor' is Alonzo Harris (Washington), a veteran of the LAPD narcotics beat.  Now, Hoyt isn't a true rookie \u0096 he's been a cop for over a year, but he wants to be a detective.  One good way to become one is by training in narcotics.  Alonzo has been on this beat for years, and is considered one of the best.  What better training ground could there be? During his day of training, Hoyt learns to disregard the 4th Amendment, lie, use drugs, and all sorts of other things a good cop shouldn't do.Now, there is some validity to having an undercover cop or narc be familiar with the quality of drugs, but they must also remain above the culture. Donnie Brasco and Rush both showed this very well.  Training Day does not.I have a host of complaints about this movie.  I'm going to address them in no particular order.1) The story made no sense at all.  It starts off fine \u0096 Alonzo is a typical hard-nosed narc with little to no patience with a rookie who wants to be a do-gooder.  The street has no patience for those types.  Ok \u0096 I'll buy that. But then, all of a sudden, we're in the middle of a mystery, and we have no idea where it started or what the details are.  We know that Russians are involved, and some other guy, and then all of a sudden we make a bust that makes even less sense, and then, the movie doesn't end.  It keeps going, adding new subplots, and don't even think that any of these are going to be resolved at the end.  And then the movie is over.2) Alonzo is not likable.  Yes, he's a tough cop.  Yes, he uses methods that aren't exactly legal.  But Washington gives the audience nothing about his character to like.  We grew to like Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  We liked Darth Vader.  We saw the humanity in those characters.  Washington is a very good actor, and has the awards to prove it.  I don't know if it was the way the character was written or what, but we are given nothing about Alonzo to like.  We aren't allowed to see his humanity.3) The pacing is terrible.  This movie went on and on and on, and just kept going after it had stopped making sense.  Now, this, I don't understand. Fuqua started off directing music videos (This is not a bad thing \u0096 David Fincher, who directed Se7en and Fight Club started out the same way.  As did Spike Jonze, who made Being John Malkovich.).  He should understand pacing. He directed The Replacement Killers, which starred Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino \u0096 he can obviously work with actors.  So, I'm not sure what happened.  Perhaps the editor should be canned.  Or the writer.  Someone, anyway.I'm done making my list.  There are just too many things to go into with this movie.  I'm not about to write a spoiler for those of you who still insist on seeing this movie, but I will advise you to reconsider.  There are plenty of other movies opening this week.I'd go into more detail, but, this movie was so frustrating that it made my brain hurt.",

            "content": "A rather unremarkable cop-crime thriller in most respects, \"Training Day\" does benefit from a plot set within one day and from Denzel Washington playing against type. I might've been surprised, however, that he won an Oscar for it except that the field was relatively weak that year, and maybe Spike Lee and others have a point of it being a makeup award for his losing nominations for more usual Oscar-bait productions, whether for \"The Hurricane\" or, further back, \"Malcolm X\" (1992), the latter where Washington watched Al Pacino receive a more-obviously-makeup award, and, later, for \"Fences\" (2016). The Academy has been handing out competitive Oscars like they're Lifetime Achievement Awards since at least 1930 when they gave one to Mary Pickford for her embarrassing performance in \"Coquette\" (1929). Washington's \"Training Day\" performance does also fit the Academy criteria for over-the-top, capital-A Acting, and he's charismatic and dressed stylishly. To paraphrase, King Kong ain't got **** on him. Regardless, he's the main attraction here.Ethan Hawke riding those coattails to a Supporting Actor nod for his less interesting role and performance for the first day on the job as Washington's partner--and despite being the protagonist and being on screen 13 more minutes than him--is more unaccountable. It's a fantasized, if not melodramatic, simplification of corruption by the police and justice system and the supposed depiction of a block of a hood, Terry Crews included, otherwise. The rest of director Antoine Fuqua and writer David Ayer's resumes are stuffed with such mediocrity and worse. Recording artists the likes of Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray make cameos, and Eva Mendes is merely there. The plot is brisk, although the narrative coincidences are a drag in the final act. Exaggerated though the performance may be, Washington carries this one.",

Written by David Ayer (one of the screenplay producers of the Oscar winning movie \"U-571\") \"Training Day\" unfolds the story of Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) - an LAPD narcotics officer, and his colleague - the rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Alonzo and Jake have to deal with the tough street gangsters and the drugs that they are spreading all over LA.\"The street\", as shown here, can change everyone for less than 24 hours. Once becoming a member of one of the street gangs you can never go back again. There are no law rules on the street - the guns are the law.",

I just had expected a typical bad cop film or something of that nature,but my friends, it wasn't. Denzel Washington has proven, once again, that he is one of the finest actors of his generation. His character,Alonzo,a highly decorated officer of the l.a.p.d.,is charming,street wise,cunning,and dangerous. Now, some actors would have made this guy just a bad ass cop.Heartless.However Denzel gave him a just the right amount of humanity(there's a scene with his son,that briefly gives you a glimpse of that aspect.)where there might be a heart deep within the beast. Ethan.My god. He is wonderful in this film.Playing this first day on the job,fish out of water,and some times confused cop,you see why he,along with Washington, was nominated for the oscar this year. I watched this on DVD and after seeing the deleted and alternate ending of the film, I have to give kudos to the director,Antoine Fuqua. It was very wise to leave out some of those scenes...but at the same time, you got the feeling it was true what the character,Alonzo frequently tells the young det.Hoyt(Hawke),\"you remind me of me\". Training day is a must see film that may shock and surprize you. It really made me wonder,how widespread is the corruption in the police. Must they,as in the film shows,be criminals to catch crimals??God help us all. See the film. You will not regret it.",

Not to say Ethan Hawke or any of the other cast aren't great, but the life Denzel gives to Alonzo is on another planet. The charisma and aura he builds around his character makes him take control of every scene that he's in. Then you have Ethan Hawke who does really well as his straight partner. Someone who Alonzo can manipulate in the beginning because of being the newby, but not incompetent where he doesn't quickly catch on to what's really happening. David Ayer is really good at creating your average day characters and creating a solid, realistic script with them. He did the same in \"End of Watch\" and in \"Fury.\" I would say that Alonzo it the outlier, but I believe that Denzel is what made that character who he is. Then you have Antoine Fuqua (Director) creating these very tense scenes between characters, like the kitchen scene with Jake and Smiley (Cliff Curtis). Scenes like this really bring the film above and beyond.If you're looking for a crime drama that has fantastic acting and some very tense moments, this is the one. 9.1/10.",

Clearly inspired by recent events within the LAPD, TRAINING DAY is told from Hawke's point of view, allowing the audience to share in his escalating sense of outrage, until he's finally tipped over the edge by a monstrous betrayal of trust. But, like any number of exploitation movies before it (even those as polished and presentable as this one), TRAINING DAY is conservative in thought and deed: Washington is sexy, dynamic and evil to the bone, and the movie wallows in his decadence before concluding with an audience-pleasing showdown between Good and Evil.

For me there are just 2 movies \"pulp fiction\" and \"training day\" that have made me feel an exciting fast ride sensation since the first minute until the end.The plot is about the first day of work of a rookie policeman called Jake (Ethan Hawke)who have to learn about the job from a tough street wise cop named Alonzo. During the day Jake is surprised how Alonzo handles different police's situations in a not by the book way, but Alonzo tells him this is how things are done in the field because you have to be a wolf in order to protect the sheep. Will Jake agree with Alonzo's methods to do the job?..... I think a 7.5 is the correct grade for \"training day\" for its worth as a movie, but i give it a 10 because of the emotion that made me feel despite its common Hollywood's final. I think if this movie would have had a more realistic final part, \"training day\" would be considered one of the great movies of the decade and not just as a good action movie.

No one ever denied that Mr. Washington could act, but by casting against type (as is often the case) people finally noticed the depth and breadth of his acting skills.Of course, in order to truly shine, an actor needs other elements to be in place as well. And Mr. Washington has them all here. His co-star, Ethan Hawke, does an excellent job of providing the innocent counterbalance so that Mr. Washington looks even tougher by comparison. The action sequences are well shot and grittily realistic. The plot twists, while not truly shocking, are unique enough to keep the movie's tension at a high level throughout.To see my other reviews, please visit: https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",

He ends up selling out, and his movie has a stereotypical Hollywood ending in which a character played by Bruce Willis pulls a daring last second rescue of the formerly doomed heroine, played by Julia Roberts, complete with snappy exchange between the characters.In \"Training Day\" there is a unrealistic coincidence that allows Ethan Hawke's character to survive a situation where he should have died; I immediately thought about \"The Player\". I can hear the producers insisting that the hero (Hawke) survive, and that the villain (Washington) get a comeuppance. They may have shot an ending in which Hawke dies, and Denzel Washington's character goes on leading his corrupt life, but like in \"The Player\", it \"didn't test well\" with audiences in an advanced screening.I also was never convinced that Denzel could be so rotten, the fact that he always played heroes weighed on my ability to suspend disbelief, but that is my own subjective opinion. Denzel certainly played the character well, but I am not alone in my opinion that the Academy gave him the Oscar as a \"makeup\" for his being passed over before.What ruined the movie for me was the pat ending, and the coincidence that allowed it.",

            "content": "It looks like this is another one of those films that I missed during a period of time when I didn't go and see films anywhere near as much as I did in the past, or I do so now (which is probably between 2000 and 2006). So, during that time I really wasn't paying all that much attention to what was coming out, or even going and seeing films that did come out at the time. However, this is also one of those films that seem to keep on popping up every so often, and a part of me felt that maybe it is worth actually going back and watching, particularly since Washington did win an oscar for his role in the film.I have to admit that it is pretty gripping, and things seem to get deeper and deeper as the film progresses, though we should note that the entire film occurs over the span of a single day. Basically the film opens up with a beat cop Jake being offered a position as a narcotics detective, as long as he successfully completes a single day on the job, which is basically an evaluation. Obviously Jake is pretty egar to impress.The thing is that there are a lot of things going on behind the scene which is slowly being revealed to us, but not necessarily to Jake, namely because Jake is not quite in earshot, or simply assumes that everything is above board. Sure, he sort of has some suspicions that things are not quite right, but sure enough, he is an innocent beat cop who is eager to please, so he isn't really all that keen on asking too many questions.That is the other thing about the film, and that it is basically told entirely from his perspective. Unfortunately, unlike literature, we aren't really able to get into his mind, and understand what he is thinking, but then again the film doesn't actually provide us with a narrative. Should it? I'm not entirely sure, because it still sort of works out, at least most of the way through the film.Well, sort of, because once we get to the end, the coincidences do start to pile up, such as the girl whom he saved turning out to be the cousin of the guy that has been paid to kill him, which means that he spares his life and lets him go. Yet, if we work on the principle of Chekov's gun, that incident earlier in the film really does need to have a reason for occurring, particularly since he picks up her wallet after she leaves - even though Hollywood movies don't necessarily follow that rule, having such a thing occur without having a reason for it later on in the film would effectively be sloppy film making, and it certainly isn't one of those films that throws red herrings at you.It is an interesting look at corruption in the world of the detectives. Look, corrupt cops are nothing new, there have been countless numbers of films and TV shows made about them, and of course they never seem to actually get away with being corrupt. Though this story is much more interesting, particularly since our detective lives in the heart of gang territory, and doesn't seem to have a problem with living in the heart of gang territory. Sure, he is corrupt, but I think the film goes a little further than that.For instance, Jake, at the beginning of the film, refuses to smoke any marijuana because, well, cops don't do drugs - remember, he is pretty innocent - yet is suddenly told that one needs to be a little flexible if one is going to be effective. By sticking to a moral code means that you are going to be outing yourself pretty quickly. Yet by bending your moral code raises the question as to how far you are going to bend, and the further you bend the more corrupt you eventually become.I guess Alonzo, our detective, in a way is a very tragic character. He is a highly decorated officer, yet in becoming effective has resulted in him becoming corrupt, and the more effective he becomes, the more corrupt he becomes. Yet it isn't just him that has fallen down, because it seems that the rot has spread far and wide throughout the system - it is just that Alonzo, as we soon find out, has stepped just that little bit too far over the line to discover that he has found himself in what is effectively a no win situation, that eventually tips him over the edge.In this case, sometimes innocence, and the desire to maintain one's honour, can save one from falling too far, yet it also results in an awful lot of sacrifice, since it is clear that Jake probably will not being going down the path of the narcotics detective, though this is never really made clear at the end of the film.",

To that end, he tries to join an elite squad led by Alonzo Harris (Washington), an undercover officer legendary for his effectiveness. The hitch is that Jake has only one day to prove his worthiness to Alonzo.

Alonzo lives there, convinced he is respected by his brutal neighbors due to his ability to work the system. In fact, they loathe the man and put up with him solely because of his badge and gun.Taking place over the course of a single day, Training Day builds momentum and never backs off.

            "content": "After making his application to join a special unit within the LAPD, Officer Jake Hoyt is assigned to his new boss, Alonzo Harris for a training day on the job. Harris immediately shows Hoyt a way of work that is foreign to him \u0096 making him smoke drugs and drink at the very start of his shift. From this point onwards, Hoyt is taken on an eye opening training day that forces him to depart from his professional ethics and try to understand how things are done on the street. But is Harris really working for justice his own way or is he working for himself \u0096 and how far will Hoyt sink before he cannot justify it anymore?When this film came out I wanted to see it as a thriller; after the Oscar for Washington I wanted to see it for another reason and eventually got round to seeing it on video. The plot starts on familiar territory and pretty much continues along the same road for the whole film \u0096 it is never really more than an average cop thriller but it still manages to be quite enjoyable. The film sticks to the 'ends justify the means' plot device for the first half but then pull back to reveal a wider plot that is more of a standard thriller. In the first half this is all stuff we have seen before and it sort of works but not as well as things like The Shield etc \u0096 Alonzo is too out there to manage to make me be for him and against him; unlike the Shield where you are constantly being challenged by Mackey. The second half is more dramatic and, although a bit forced, is necessary to bring the film round to a dramatic conclusion.The Oscar for Denzel was not deserved in my opinion. Having now seen his performance I will acknowledge that he is a big part of this film working but he is not Oscar worthy here. Actually his performance is just par for the course for this type of film \u0096 yes he is a bit of a powerhouse and his tough delivery really makes the film move but it is hardly worthy of being called the best performance of the year even if it is really effective within the context of the film. Hawke is pretty good but obviously plays second fiddle to Washington's scene stealing performance; he is wide eyed as required and he serves well as our entry into Alonzo's world. The support cast features quite a few well known faces but mostly they are underused and play slightly worn ethnic clich\u00e9s full of tattoos and 'mo-fo' dialogue \u0096 Macy Gray, Dre and Snoop represent the rap community while Mendes shows ass and Glenn, Yulin, Barry and Greene add recognisable faces if nothing else.Overall this is an enjoyable but standard cop thriller that has gotten better reviews than it perhaps deserves. Although he doesn't not deserve his Oscar for this, Washington's performance still drives the film and is fun nonetheless and certainly livens up what is, for all it's stars and it's publicity, is still a standard cop thriller with bells on.",

Denzel Washington is an over the top, rogue cop that doesn't do anything rewarding of an award. He kills, steals and murders yadda yadda yadda. Seen it a million times in a hundred other movies. And the performance isn't that great. I give Ethan Hawke some credit, for at least his character is believable and he does a decent job of moving the plot along. What little plot there is. Basically, it doesn't make that much sense. Bad cop versus good cop. From there, its up to the viewer to fill in the gaping holes. Overall, there are a bunch of other movies that do it better, one being L.A. Confidential. Go rent that rather than this tired, rough movie totally undeserving of any such awards.",

            "content": "\"Training Day\" is the story of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), an LAPD rookie who is looking to join a top-notch narcotics squad led by Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's awesome, and Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; \"The Fast And The Furious\" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the \"Crime doesn't pay\" and \"Power corrupts\". So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice. All in all, I found \"Training Day\" to be a steadily enjoyable film with great performances across the board, a wonderful story and script, and a solid direction. Remarkable.",

            "content": "I can start off by saying that i consider the Academy Award to be a very dubious award. It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of \"The Shield\" (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke. I'm not an expert on the American police authorities but somehow i doubt that someone would like to put Ethan Hawke in plainclothes in an all-black/Hispanic neighborhood. Even that issue put aside Ethan Hawke still looks like he's fifteen years old and completely lacks any credibility as a policeman. And for this he gets one Academy Award nomination? And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of \"The Shield\". The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors.\"Training Day\" is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste.",

            "content": "At the end of the Oscar-winning movie \"Training Day\", one must ask, \"where's the fine-line between doing what's right and the tactics one must go through in accomplishing it?\" The hero in the story faces this enigmatic question from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep at night. Getting tired of the usual routine of parking tickets and arresting drunk drivers, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is young cop who has bigger aspirations into the police force. His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. The script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like \"American Gangster\" (another film Washington was in) proves my point. Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do: take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. For an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent \"Lethal Weapon\". The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. Sure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind? With stunning action scenes and a believable premise, this has got to be the best heart-warming thriller that will leave you stunned for a long time.",

There is really only one, or two movies which I have ever seen which have disturbed me in this way, and this is one of them. (The other was \"Death Wish\", which I saw when I was 19 yrs. old, so it's understandable why it was so disturbing). Why this movie was so disturbing can be summed up in three reasons: 1) a cop never surrenders his gun. Why? why? why is the gun surrendered? The fact that the viewer can understand, that the young officer is trying to trust the corrupt Denzel, is probably what is so disturbing. We KNOW he is blowing it, he should NEVER hand over his gun. And somewhere in his gut, he knows it too.2) The images of the Mexican dude's house, the home, where the rape/murder was going to take place. There was a wife in the home, there were babies in the home, there were crucifixes on the wall. Yet, a disgusting, unacceptable crime was going to occur in the bathroom. Yuck.3) The fact that I, as a viewer, thought that maybe Denzel really was a good guy, and that maybe his \"way\" was the way, to get the job done, the job of a good guy. So, in simple terms, the fact that I too, along with the new recruit, could have been tricked.I know lots of folks liked this movie. I guess if it turned as many people on as much as it turned my stomach, it must have something!",

            "review_title": "An abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture with a great Denzel performance",
            "content": "Denzel Washington delivers a dynamic performance easily worth an Oscar as a rogue cop in director Antoine Fuqua's gritty urban crime thriller \"Training Day,\" co-starring Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Snoop Doggie Dog, Macy Gray, and Tom Berenger. This unsavory but exciting R-rated law & order melodrama paints a considerably less than flattering portrait of police corruption in Los Angeles. Essentially, scenarist David (\"U-571\") Ayers has exploited the recent Ramparts police scandal in the L.A.P.D. as the basis for his controversial but contrived screenplay. While he infuses the film with his charismatic personality, Washington goes against-the-grain for a change as a dyed-in-the-wool villain who won't hesitate to double-cross friends. Not only does bad-ass Denzel tote a chrome-plated automatic pistol under each armpit, but also he cruises his asphalt domain in a customized obsidian-black 1978 Monte Carlo. Gear heads will drool over Denzel's ride which doubles as his office. As an extension of Alonzo's amoral character, the Monte Carlo compliments his roguish personality. Sadly, as psychological actioneers rate, \"Training Day\" lacks the tenacity that Washington imparts to his warlord-like antagonist. Fuqua and Ayer employ sentimental stratagems to align our sympathies with Ethan Hawke's half-hearted hero who turns wimp in the end. Surprisingly, unpardonable logistics sabotage Fuqua's mise-en-scene, especially in a rooftop foot chase! Further, the filmmakers bank on sheer coincidence to bail out the hero. A \"Scarface\" inspired scene as Latino gangsters prepare to ice our hero in a bathtub illustrates the worst of the coincidences. Ultimately, if \"Training Day\" constitutes the best Hollywood can offer as a cautionary tale about police corruption, we're all in trouble. Basically, the Darwinian message of \"Training Day\" is big-fish eat little-fish, or survival of the fittest, so what does it matter if how criminals buy it in the end if justice is served? As cynical as \"Training Day\" tries to portray itself, it winds up as a formulaic but flawed thriller about legal courtroom justice versus street justice.Basically, this abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture does nothing countless other thrillers like Sidney Lumet's \"Serpico\" (1973) haven't done better. Specifically, \"Training Day\" resembles a white-washed version of director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1994 dirty cop saga \"Bad Lieutenant,\" starring Harvey Keitel as a heroin-shooting, trigger-happy, N.Y.P.D. detective in deep trouble with loan sharks. Like the Keitel character, Washington's renegade cop shoulders his share of problems. He has teed-off the Russians (presumably their mafia) during a wild and woolly weekend in Las Vegas, and they want payback. Even Alonzo's police superiors refuse to believe he is anything more than a walking dead man. Alonzo aims to prove them wrong and his narcissism makes him perversely appealing. Some of the problems with \"Training Day\" is what we learn about Alonzo's off-screen activities seems more interesting than what we see him do. Take the encounter with the Russians in Vegas. Apparently, Alonzo snapped, killed a guy, and the Russians have dispatched hit men to get him the same way the Colombians nailed Al Pacino in Brian De Palma's \"Scarface.\" Nevertheless, Alonzo never loses his cool in \"Training Day,\" because he believes he is in control, particularly with regard to a rookie auditioning for the sixth man slot on his elite team.\"Training Day\" chronicles a 24-hour span in the life of young, idealistic, rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke of \"Dead Poets Society\" & \"Hamlet\") who wants only to 'protect and serve' the public. Since joining the Los Angeles Police Department 19 months ago, Hoyt has been angling for a big break. Thirteen-year veteran L.A.P.D. Det. Sgt. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington of \"Remember the Titans\"), who heads up an elite narcotics squad, provides that break. Harris gives Hoyt the chance of a life-time to prove he can perform undercover without getting himself smoked by a paranoid drug dealer. If Hoyt can make a favorable impression on Alonzo, he assures his young beautiful wife breast feeding their 10-month age, infant daughter they will be bound for a better life.As a typical, formulaic American movie, \"Training Day\" relies on rewards and punishment to shape its morality. Hoyt interprets this assignment as his ticket to the big time. Not only is Hoyt in for a rude awakening, but also so is the audience. By the time those fateful 24 hours elapse; Hoyt will emerge as an entirely different person. His saintly ideals will be tarnished as well as his own sense of innocence. Anyway, Ethan Hawke gives an evocative performance, but the actions of his character ultimately undercut the brilliance of his acting. He plays a stereotypical hero who balks at doing what a hero's got to do. Hoyt's last confrontation with Alonzo underlines the weakness inherent in Hawke's character. As the young, hungry cop, Hoyt represents hope, so his refusal to rub out Alonzo smacks more of political correctness than dramatic closure. Similarly, \"Training Day\" compares these two characters and reminds us in no uncertain terms who epitomizes good and evil.Director Antoine Fuqua, whose credits include \"The Replacement Killers\" and the slick Jamie Fox caper \"Bait,\" gives \"Training Day\" a sleek, sharp, and snazzy look. Unfortunately, while the movie amounts to a visual feast for the eyes, David Ayer's script degenerates during the second half of the action. The hero stands for law and order, but he refuses to get himself dirty do his job. Clearly, \"Training Day\" contends that what you sow, so shall you reap. Anton Fuqua and David Ayer have made a passable film that provides reassurances if the cops cannot take care of corruption, then criminals will.",

            "content": "In re-visiting TRAINING DAY (2001) recently, I have absolutely no doubt that Denzel Washington deserved his Best Actor Oscar. He makes the absolute most of this role and is magnetic as corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo Harris. The main thing that I like about this performance is that Washington played it as a totally corrupt and unscrupulous man who once, a long time ago had wide-eyed principles of doing good and cleaning up the streets. But he lost his way to the point there is no redemption.In walks newly promoted young Detective Jake Hoyt (played superbly by Best Supporting nominee Ethan Hawke, who in reality has more screen time than Washington), Alonzo's new 'trainee'. Jake is who Alonzo used to be with a MAJOR difference...Jake is incorruptible! He refuses to give in to the seduction of the quick buck and giving up on humanity. And in the process, Jake is the one who proves to be the strongest of the pair. Even with his Oscar nom, I feel like Hawke's work goes unnoticed as he essentially is the true heart and anchor of the film. Jake could have easily come across as a fake, stereotypical, do-gooder character, but in the end, he makes the viewer believe in Jake's unflinching valor. We care BECAUSE OF Jake! Initially, a had a problem with the film taking place all in one day. While I still think that it's a bit unbelievable at times, I really appreciate how gritty and realistic many of the characters and situations translate to the screen. While there are hints of preachiness and convolution, the film still draws you into it's dangerous world in a very provocative way; it manages to stay a step ahead of the typical tale-of-the-streets, mainly due to many intense scenes and strong acting. I really didn't appreciate all of this when I first saw it, being totally awed by Washington's transfixing performance and ignoring how good a movie I was actually watching.Director Anton Fuqua did an amazing job not just with Washington and Hawke, but with the entire cast as well, with standouts being Scott Glenn (as the biggest street dealer in LA) and Cliff Curtis as a young Hispanic ganglord who actually shows signs of nobility. Addititonally, there are effective cameos by famous rapper-musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray.

But the rest of the film was more than excellent.\"Training Day\" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few. Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb. The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender. (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.) The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary. I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares. There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.Unlike some cop dramas and shoot 'em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him. The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then \"led\" on the \"trip\" by someone wanting to exploit them. Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day. For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil\u2014and you just found out. And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of \"guidance\" you can't refuse. And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

None of what it presents is justified by the highly predictable ending.Did the people who made this want it to be like \"Serpico\" and \"The Departed\"? They failed to understand that it's really creepy to make a hero out of the Denzel Washington character. Fans will say that Washington's character is not a hero, that the dialog and script clearly depict him as a bad cop. Despite that, he is the most powerful character in the film by miles, which makes him the hero. His demise is ultimately effected by an anonymous band of machine-gun toting thugs we have not previously seen, leaving the impression that this guy was so powerful that none of the other characters could stop him -- not a very satisfying conclusion.The first two-thirds are slow, consisting of little more than Washington acting uncompromisingly tough and Hawke acting compromised by his ambition to advance. Only in the last third of the movie does something resembling a plot materialize, almost as an afterthought.The action was unrealistic. The dialog -- of which there was so much that a viewer could follow and understand the movie with eyes closed -- was artificial. It takes more than violence and tough talk to make a good film, unless the viewer is only after cheap thrills.",

I hope everyone will prefer the former.  (I hope, also, that everyone will realise that in real life, the choice is otherwise, and that the most corrupt police forces are also the most inefficient and useless.)Unfortunately, Ethan Hawke's woefully under-described and thin character (the actor does what he can) doesn't have the guts to be pure.  TWICE his superior, who might as well have horns growing out of his forehead, offers him the chance to walk back to his old, honourable, by no means unpleasant job, at no cost or risk, without losing face before any third party - and the fool refuses, for no reason at all that we can see.  We can only presume he doesn't want to appear na\u00efve.  It would only be possible to warm to a man this spineless if we knew something about him.But the key choice he's offered is a bit less obvious.  Only a bit.  Anyone ought to be able to see that everything the narcotics squad does counts for nothing - for less than nothing.  For every drug dealer, large or small, that they put away, another will leap up to take his place.  But the market forces that make this the case do not apply in the case of, say, rape: and when Jake saw a rape about to take place, he had the chance to actually do some good, by dropping whatever shadowy nothingwork Alonzo wanted him to be getting on with and intervene.  He chose to intervene.  (Successfully  - but for some reason he doesn't actually arrest the rapists.  Why not?  Did he require the co-operation of his superior?  Was he merely caving in, once again, to moral pressure?  Are we meant to be able to work this out?)  And it's fitting that his one good deed turns out to be what saved his life - in fact, to have been almost the only thing that COULD have saved his life, given that he didn't have the sense to walk away from the narcotics squad altogether.I liked this touch.  A pity everything that happens after the key scene with the bathtub is just standard revenge rampage wrap-up (so muddled that perhaps I'm being generous in using a word like \"revenge\", which implies a goal).  And a pity that everything leading up to the trap in which Jake is caught is just so flat.  Fluid, bold photography, a good sense of rhythm and strong performances can't breathe life into the opening third or the conclusion.  Nor can guns.  But there's real promise and fire in the middle bit.",

            "content": "Since it's 2001 release, \"Training Day\" has come to be known as one of the most intense films ever made. Director Antoine Fuqua and writer David Ayer craft a tale that pulls absolutely no punches in its portrayal of life on LA's \"mean streets\". There are few lead actors that would be up to the task of matching such intensity, but fortunately this film employs one of them.For a very basic overview, \"Training Day\" sees young cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) looking to start a career path in the narcotics division. On his first day, he is paired with veteran detective Alonzo (Denzel Washington), who gives him a physical--and psychological--tour of LA's drug trade and the queasy or downright dirty methods often undertaken--even as wearers of the badge--to get the job done.In terms of overall plot, the whole \"gritty cop ethics\" theme is one that will vary from person to person. If such moralizing is \"your thing\", \"Training Day\" will probably be one of your all-time favorites. It truly is fearless in its portrayal of the seedier side of police work, often to the point of outright discomfort.But even if hard-boiled \"cop stuff\" isn't your cup of tea, Washington's performance gives the film such a high floor. This seems like a role that Denzel was born to play, allowing him to glower, crack wise, and monologue (usually emphatically!) in equal parts. There is not a moment he's on screen when your eyes won't be drawn to his presence. You'll get no complaints from me on his Oscar take-home.Perhaps overlooked in the wake of Denzel's masterpiece is Hawke's own solid acting job here. Denzel's schtick only works if another character can be made an audience proxy, and Hawke does that admirably. Viewers may marvel at Alonzo's swagger, but they'll identify with Jake's sense of conscience and morality.Overall, I consider \"Training Day\" to be a solid film featuring an extraordinary acting performance. The hard cop stuff isn't my personal favorite genre, but even then I'd never go lower than 7/10 simply for the atmosphere of tension that Fuqua, Washington, and Hawke create from beginning to end.",

Is it for low incomes? Is it for the desire of power? \"Training Day\" perfectly explains Alonso's behavior through many violent scenes that not necessarily deal with phyiscal violence, but also with drug abuse, corruption, sexual matters, and also display situations that start with home.The movie is very intelligent because through Ethan Hawke's character we learn that not every single cop member is the same; in fact, the good cops follow a long hard road before becoming corrupt and more. Through his character, we learn that not only good intentions are needed to fight against crime...So \"Training Day\" is in my opinion one of the best cop movies ever made because it doesn't follow the typical \"cop features\" and goes further and insert sub-plots that satisfy the new millennium tendencies.Please watch Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance.

            "content": "Boy, was Denzel Washington good at being bad ! You almost have the feeling that he had fun portraying Detective Alonzo Harris, the corrupt cop and mentor, during the titular \"Training Day\" of Jake Hoyt, the rookie played no less convincingly by Ethan Hawke. Both actors would be nominated for the Oscar, but only Washington took it home. This is how persuasively villainous he was. The recognition also came from the American Film Institute that put him #50 of the Top American villains, the last spot but to his defense, he was the most recent entry. Anyway, \u00ab Training Day \u00bb has been remembered ever since as the \u00ab Bad Guy Denzel Movie \u00bb.Washington had fun and it sure shows, he gives a figure that is not that unfamiliar for cop-movies buffs a larger-than-life vibe, he's on the screen for less than twenty seconds that you know you're onto a great creation, a narc cop dressed like a Black Panther or Black Muslim militant, a gangsta goatee and a black beanie, a smile that would make any small-time thug freeze from fear. How come an actor with such a friendly face can get so intimidating, sure part of the merit comes from Washington's performance, but it also owes to Ethan Hawke who, as Jake Hoyt, is the perfect counterpart to Washington's alpha male confidence. And their first exchanges in the restaurant shows with a few words that these men are separated by experience, equaling in such a dirty racket, to an eternity.Hoyt lives in a modest apartment with his wife and a 9-month daughter, his dream is to climb the social ladder, which in the Police, means he must pass the 'danger' square. The training day is Hoyt's opportunity to make his bones, his career depends on it. That perfectly sets up his character, he's a man determined to succeed and be a good police officer. Part of his learning will consist on discovering that both goals can cancel out one another, yet the film would've been too cynical had it been the culmination of the 'coming-of-age' learning. It's not a movie about the disciple outranking the mentor, but the disciple learning a few ropes from the mentor and still be able to stick to his values. And that's what, in my humble opinion, emerges from the first exchanges, Harris is a static character, Hoyt evolves, and part of the interest relies on Jake's evolution. And that works most of the time.The problem with \u00ab Training Day \u00bb is that it gets so wrapped up on that premise of Washington being the villain that it is almost used like a gimmick, and Hoyt's evolution is only limited by the scope of that training day, we never get to know what changed exactly in his view and how that will affect his future. The film takes a conventional turn to a personal face-off between the good and the bad guy, which in the final act, is a bit of a let down compared to the whole 'close to reality' card it played right at the beginning. \"Training Day\" tries to be many things at the same time, for its own good. Let's get it straight, it never ceases to be entertaining, and this is a good movie, but it could have been so much grander had it chosen not to focus much on Alonzo Harris. In my opinion, he should've been the supporting role, which, technically, he was, as he literally 'supported' the most interesting character's arc.God, that whole first hour of \u00ab Training Day \u00bb is a terrific slice of post-September-11 era, these times I couldn't imagine I'd be nostalgic of. Even the casting of Snoop Dogg as one of the informers gives the film a little edge by encapsulating the post-Millennium day where urban violence, rap and money contributed heavily to Pop Culture imagery, where the sight of death wasn't a taboo anymore. In a way, Alonzo Harris is an efficient villain because he's emblematic of his time, being a Cop with a 'C' like in cynical, corrupt and charismatic. Yet, it's with Hoyt that I related, as a Millennium kid who wanted to believe there's a part of goodness to take from society, wishing he wouldn't fall in that trap Harris kept luring him into. I also identified with the relationship between the rookie and his new boss, something I've had enough experience to appreciate the realistic way it was conveyed in the film.You know these first days at work, where you're being taken by your coach or top manager everywhere and you feel so useless between all these people who know each other. Indeed, that's why the first day is always the worst : each impression you give is the first, and in Hoyt's business, a bad impression is something he can't afford. You're also the most recent newcomer, the one who knows the least people, this is how marginal you are. The wisest thing is to shut up, to listen, to learn. Hoyt has no other choices than listening to Harris, and Harris is no stupid, he takes advantage from it and cunningly toys with Hoyt's eagerness to prove his value, and isn't that the biggest trap you can fall in. And as the day progresses, you can feel the distance widening between Hoyt and Harris, and I hoped the movie could focus on Hoyt because Harris didn't need more screen time to make an impact, it worked from the start.\"Training Day\" tried so many things it got convoluted in complicated plot devices and other contrivances, some of them unfortunately, were too blatant to be even taken seriously. While it started as one hell of a character study mixed with police procedural \u00e0 la \"French Connection\", it ended like \"Scarface\". I don't mind a good over-the-top performance but the film could've been remembered for more than being that movie with a bad guy Denzel.",

I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clich\u00e9s, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.Overall, if you like cop/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion.",

I've read through the other reviews here, with people nitpicking the movie and finding minuscule \"plot-holes\" that are too stupid to be repeated here, and let me just say: WHO CARES?!?! Training Day is a great movie, and here's why: Denzel Washington. This film is the Greatest Actor in the World's shining achievement, and that alone makes it great. The character of Alonzo is one of the most menacing villains to hit the screen, and it's all because of Denzel. He BECAME Alonzo - almost everything that Denzel says in this movie is purely his creation (and I know - I've read the script.) For those of you who said Denzel was not Oscar-worthy in this film - you are extremely wrong. Just sit down and watch all the clever things he says (that he made up), all the subtle nuances. The scene in the car after they kill Roger is one of my favorite scenes of all time, because he goes from ghetto and evil to sweet and almost fatherly. The shift is brilliant, and Denzel pulls it off completely.Like I said above, picking out irrelevant \"plot-holes\" is pointless...every single plot-hole that was brought up in other reviews has a logical explanation, but people are so against this movie that they feel they need to find some need to tear it apart, and since they can't tear apart Denzel's amazing performance, they focus on minuscule plot elements. This movie is GREAT. It's a gripping tour into a side of the streets we aren't exposed to, and Alonzo is our guide. And try and tell me it isn't classic cinema when Alonzo, broken and beaten at the end, puts a cigarette into his mouth and says \"I'm still winnin'...I can't lose...\" Denzel's greatest performance, and if you know anything about his acting skills, that is SAYING something.

Hawke is also pretty good, but here's the thing. No, I don't really smile at knowing he got a nomination for the Oscar because he was in no way a supporting actor. I'm sure everyone in the Academy knew this, but because Washington is so good and in fear of vote splitting, they carelessly voted for Hawke in supporting actor, robbing a true supporting actor that year a slot. I'm sure they knew it, but once again it shows just how political the Academy can be. This film is ultimately only worth a look for the two leads, but even then I can't recommend it much.",

            "content": "Some people say that the country became more violent after Kennedy got assassinated; following that argument, one might say that we got even more violent still after September 11. Certainly, Kennedy's assassination destroyed the image of a squeaky-clean, wholesome America, and September 11 changed the way that we felt that we could do everything.Whether or not we became more violent after 9/11, \"Training Day\" offers some insight into that. Released right after September 11 (it's release even got delayed because of the latter), the movie stars Denzel Washington as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris, teaming up with rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). As this is a movie about the gritty world of crime, I shouldn't have to identify that it's pretty violent. By the time that the movie had gotten released, movies had been showing violence for over thirty years. But if in fact we did become more violent, then the movie might have been a look at the future. Movies about corrupt cops are nothing new, but they did an OK job with this one.As for other aspects, Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, making him the first African-American to win Best Actor (Sidney Poitier is actually Bahamian). Some may ask whether or not it he would have won had 9/11 not happened, but not me. I say that he deserved the Oscar.",

Jake also wants to be a detective one day. Alonzo is not your normal detective. At first his intentions are not very clear but when Jake has to do very strange things you know Alonzo is not a good guy.Basically Alonzo and Jake are driving around in a car, sometimes meeting people. That is why the performances are so important. Fortunately they are great. Hawk as the rookie does a very nice job and Washington, not the likable character he often is, creates a great evil character. The movie itself is not that great and the plot has some very predictable points, but because of these two actors the movie is elevated to a higher level.",

Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) Jake has 24 hours to show Alonzo he has what it takes to do whats necessary to get the job done. But Alonzo's methods are questionable and sometimes illegal. This film was amazing. The acting was fantastic, to watch this straight arrow cop have to do things every bone in his body is telling him not to, was completely enthralling. At times Ethan's performance reminded me Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad just the way he carried and handled himself in certain situations was superb. High praise indeed from me. Denzel Washington gives an Oscar worthy performance. To see somebody switch from borderline criminal to genuinely caring mentor and leader, was simply incredible. The story has twists right to the very end and what makes this film so special and separates the good films from the great. Is that you understand what Ethan's going through, how he sees Denzel's character, how he's conflicted between knowing whats right and what he wants. This is due to the marvellous work of Director Antoine Fuqua, the acting of the two lead roles and the script! The script was sensational it really was, it was dark and gritty throughout keeping a harsh realistic aspect to it. The cinematography was great, some of the shots of the gang driven streets of LA were beautifully done. Overall I loved this film and thought it was done incredibly well with outstanding acting, script that was directed really well. A 9/10 from me.",

But the movie turned out to be way better than expected and it's arguably one of the best movie of 2001.The movie has an amazing pace that covers one of the days in the life of rookie narcotic officer Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and rouge LAPD veteran Harris (Denzel Washington) on their first (and only?) day together on the job. The movie gets nowhere boring or slow and has tons of surprising plot twist that make the story very interesting and even tense multiple times throughout the movie.The power of the movie is in Denzel Washington's Oscar worthy performance and the chemistry between the two main characters. Denzel Washington is perfect as \"bad guy\" and delivers his lines in a most amazing way. His lines sometimes seem to come straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Also notable is Scott Glenn in his role as a rotten old drugs lord.The atmosphere and style of the movie feels very realistic mainly thanks to the cinematography, nice fast editing, script and the performance's by the cast.Way better than you would expect it to be, give it a chance!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I think the main reason I wanted to see this film was because of a great star winning the Oscar, and then I heard that the villain he plays is a cop. Basically Jake Hoyt (Oscar nominated Ethan Hawke) wants to become a professional LAPD narcotics cop, i.e. stop drug trafficking, and he is teamed up with veteran, swaggering and streetwise narcotics cop Alonzo Harris (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) for 24 hours to learn and prove his mettle. But as they are searching and investigating the big drug case, along the way they clear the streets of other (possibly drug related) crimes, and Jake is finding it very difficult to cope with Alonzo's questionable and very rough techniques, particularly when the guilty should go to prison. As the film continues, you see what a genuine scum Alonzo really is, and why he does not deserve to be a cop, and he and Jake do eventually turn on each other in the concluding scenes. Alonzo does meet an unexpected death, being killed by thugs (most likely the ones he insulted). It is a dark, pretty engaging and very stylised look at American law enforcement. Also starring Scott Glenn as Roger, Tom Berenger as Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin as Doug Rosselli, Raymond J. Barry as Lou Jacobs, Cliff Curtis as Smiley, and hip hop stars Dr. Dre as Paul, Snoop Dogg as Blue and Macy Gray as Sandman's Wife. Denzel Washington was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Alonzo Harris was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!",

In the hands of someone less daring, Alonzo Harris could've been just a cardboard bad guy. But Washington handily makes the role his. He owns this movie. And up until the pivotal scene with Scott Glenn, this movie is a kickass crime thriller. It's here (sadly) that things start falling apart. Til now, Ethan Hawke's internal struggle gives the movie its dramatic weight when Denzel's not on screen. But at this point, the movie's about a thug with a badge buying search warrants with stolen money, and the rookie being asked to shoot someone dead with no provocation. There's nothing left to the character of Alonzo Harris, seeing as he's just a criminal trying to buy his way out of a screwup with the Russian mob. All the b.s. he'd been spewing to Hawke is nothing. And everything from then on (Hawke's miraculous salvation from execution, ridiculous fistfight on rooftops, etc.) is just absurd. The brilliant first half crime movie gives way to the typical contrivances of a David Ayer script. It's all still worth the watch just for Denzel Washington's riveting performance. It's just a shame the rest of the package doesn't live up to that incredible talent.5/10",

Here is how my `Training Day' went:3:30 p.m.- Since it was `Veterans Day' I knew I had some free time to see a matinee. Usually I see romantic-comedies during matinees, so I had not been trained in the action genre that is `Training Day' during this mid-time of the day.4: 13 p.m.- I decided on `Training Day' because of the buzz on Denzel Washington's virtuosos performance as a crooked L.A. cop. So I got up my gear (my movie watcher discount card, my popcorn money, and my glasses) and was ready to be trained. 4: 45 p.m.- My training began a little rough when I saw the long line outside the movie theatre waiting to get their tickets. I knew now I was not in this alone. 5: 13 p.m.- I now started my neck-stretching warm-up exercise regime as I notice that the only vacant seats left in the cinema room were the ones in the front row. 5:45 p.m.- My official training started in the `advertising department' when I saw the trailers of some upcoming yet-to-be-released films.6: 00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m.- During this time, my training moved into the `public relations department' when I was able to notice that the film was very intense and very well-crafted. It had substance that the viewing public, especially those that live in the inner city, could relate to.7:01 p.m.- 8: 15 p.m.- My training ended in the ` motion picture elite department'. Because after watching this immensely entertaining intelligent film, I knew that it belonged in the elite films of 2001. Academy voters should be put on probation if they do not nominate Denzel for a Best Actor Oscar. Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie cop who gets manipulated by Denzel's character, was surprisingly good in this type of film for him. However, it was Antonio Fuqua's manipulative direction that was one of the most unpredictable aspects of the film.  8:30 p.m.- My `training day' had ended!

Fortunately, Training Day avoids both extremes, being a fascinating police story with outstanding performances that won Ethan Hawke an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and Denzel Washington the Oscar for Best Actor.The story is gritty and real-world, with an \"edge\" that avoids campy entirely. Although it's quite violent, they avoid serious gore. And although the premise of the story is not new (what premise is?), how it's played out, especially at the ending, is original and satisfying. The film has both more drama and more action than the recent spate of Robert DeNiro drama / thrillers, including \"Heat\", which is similar.Who should see this film:-- Action film buffs, even if you hate dramas, even if youare only happy when stuff is blowing up constantly-- Drama / arty types, unless you are turned off by what isperhaps one notch too much violence (less than \"The Professional\" aka \"Leon\" (1994)).-- non-action film types who might see one action film everyso often, and have maybe heard about \"training day\",with the same caveat about violence.I'll give \"Training Day\" an excellent 9 out of 10.",

I think a Slovene critic said it best; The role of Alonzo Harris is Denzel's \"Scarface\", it's a role, a character, a movie that breaths in the beat of his heart and it's a role that represents a peak in his career.\nA movie that never ceases to amaze took me for an unforgettable ride making sure that I will never look at Mr. Washington the same again. When his name is going to be mentioned this is the role I will think of first. Kudos to Ethan Hawke as well who represented another major surprise of the movie proving that he is a good actor and that he could easily follow the tempo of his \"partner in crime\". With the amazing performances by the two actors, a story that kept me begging for more and a bunch of memorable supporting roles (Scott Glen, the surprisingly great Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray)and a great sound track this is without a doubt the best 2001 had to offer.Denzel winning his well deserved Oscar (although Russel Crowe's performance was almost equally good) proved to be merely icing on a cake that was already amazing.

            "content": "I saw this movie when it first came out. I liked it a lot, the setting, the acting, the storyline was fantastic. But I never really got hooked on it like some people who still to this day, worship it like some kind of cult movie. Back then I didn't fully understood the ending, but I just didn't like it.Today I rented it to watch it again because even to this day, people still bring it up for comparison like with Street Kings, so it seems like it's set a standard for this particular genre. Well, now I remember why I didn't like the ending back then. It was unrealistic. Training Day is all about realism, all about the streets. So how the hell did Denzel get beaten by the rookie, who somehow survived getting killed by the 3 Latino's because one of them decided to grab his wallet before popping him, checks the wallet, sees the photo of the schoolgirl who somehow Jake had saved earlier that day. Unbelievable... and why didn't they just kill him? Why beat him up, why not choke him to death then take him to the bathtub. Won't leave much of a mess either.So Training Day is a very good movie with an Oscar-winning performance from Denzel, but the ending was typical Hollywood \"good cop wins\" ending. I guess I'm spoiled by the more modern films which are much more gritty and cruel. Jake (Ethan) wasn't just a good cop, he was NAIVE. I wish there was some kind of twist were Jake screws Denzel over at his own game, without having to resort to pure luck and inconceivable behavior from Denzel where he spares him on the rooftop rather than finishing him off. Unfortunately, unless Jake smartens up and \"becomes the next Alonzo\", he will get killed within two months if he goes on to pursue a Narc career. I just hope that for his sake, he gets a desk job or goes back to patrol.The ratings are fair, Training Day is good but nowhere near Top 250 good. The people who go all ga-ga over it and the ending are all teenagers, or equally naive people who still think good people have good things happen to them. Wrong... it's the SMART people that live. Jake was a liability to the force, even if he lives by the end of the movie, if he continues his do-goody ways, he will most likely get popped by some other bad cop. It's unfortunate but nowadays it requires a hell of a lot more than integrity to become, and survive as a good cop. You need to learn politics.",

Hoyt is a newbie plains clothes undercover cop while Harris has been in the job for years and both men are chalk and cheese where personality is concerned . We`ve seen this sort of scenario umpteen times in other buddy movies , only thing is this usually only happens in comedy dramas and if you`re tuning into TRAINING DAY for some light hearted laughs you`re going to be very disappointed\n!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! TRAINING DAY is a grim gritty hard hitting drama , the sort of movie Hollywood rarely makes these days with the first half being a very compelling intelligent movie that really holds your attention . Unfortunately about half way through there`s a slightly ridiculous plot twist that threatens to sink the whole movie and had me begging the question \" Why on earth would Harris and his corrupt buddies invite Hoyt along to do a job with them \" ? I mean Harris has only known his partner for a few hours at the most while the other cops don`t know him at all so why would they trust Hoyt to keep his mouth shut ? I guess that`s to show how evil Harris is and how morally upstanding Hoyt is at the climax , another bit I found faintly ridiculous . I mean if you`re a home boy would you side with a corrupt black cop who`d let you walk away from a crime if the price was right or would you side with an untouchable white cop who will see justice done at any price ? Yeah that`s what I thought too . I don`t want anyone picking me up wrong thinking I hate this film because I don`t , it`s very well acted by all the cast and even after the plot twist halfway through it still held my attention , especially when Hoyt is in the latinos` house . It`s just that it seemed the studio decided to treat the audience as fools at the last moment which is a common fault with Hollywood movies for the last few years . I was going to give TRAINING DAY 9 out of ten up untill the halfway point , so overall the movie gets 7 out of 10\nSeeing as everyone else has brought up the subject of who deserved the oscar I will say some days I think Washington deserved it while some days I think Crowe deserved it , but 2001 wasn`t a vintage year for performances and if the Oscar voters had put Jim Broadbent in the best actor category he would have deserved to have won it for IRIS",

True, Fuqua and Fincher stemmed from the music video world, but that's where the similarities end.  Fuqua's method is more Michael Bay and John Singleton.  Fincher has promise because he knows where to channel that energy.  Oh, well, at least Spike Lee is showing change...Hawke does his 'Dead Poets' bit all over again playing a rookie--how ironic. What's really shocking here is the emphasis on Denzel.  He and Tom Hanks have so much in common that I'm not surprised that they were in 'Philadelphia' together.  Both rely on taking self-assured \"mr. right\" roles.  Both have lately tried to be \"mr. deep\", making some noble failures. 'Glory' marked a time when Denzel really tried.Unfortunately, this takes too many cues from the last 20 years of cop shows and two Cameron movies ('Strange Days', 'Point Break') to be anything interesting.  Rather than throwing us another \"bad cop\" cliche, Fuqua should have made false leads and layered backstories to make us think more often.Then again, what do we expect from the director of 'Replacement Killers' when he's working with the writer of 'Fast and Furious'?Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",

When watching this movie it was interesting to see Denzel be the corrupted cop attempting to corrupt the other cop and partner.

It was interesting to see Snoop Dogg and Eva Mendez in this movie as well for a moment. I did not like the fact that the bad cop was the black guy, but realistically speaking I guess even the black cops are corrupted. It was interesting to see Jay the whole time be the good cop actually fighting for justice and you see how all corrupted people give you no choice but to be corrupted as well. Also, Denzel's character was very good in using lies and reverse psychology to control Jay's integrity. I loved seeing Jay gain not only his integrity back but he also kept his courage with him.

Washington is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This may not be his best performance (\"Glory\" and \"Philadelphia\" come to mind) but it's unforgettable because it shows his versatility. Washington generally plays \"good guy\" roles; here he's the corrupt LAPD narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who recruits Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to his squad only to set him up in a scheme he has to pay back Russian mobsters to whom he owes money.Washington's Harris comes across as believably ruthless (\"the devil incarnate\" my wife called him at one point.) Harris and Hawke made a great team. They seemed to have a chemistry and I hope they work together again. The movie is chock full of action and you definitely will not be bored. It contains a lot of language, but surprisingly little nudity or sexual content, focusing instead on the story itself.Watch this. You will definitely enjoy it. 8/10.",

It was an ugly, obscenity-laced piece of garbage that presented black cops in a negative stereotypical light.

This character doesn't work as well portrayed any other way by any other actor. He is continuously oscillating between charming, vindictive, calming, cunning, wise, and extremely morally questionable. He does all of this with poise and ease. The audience, riding along with a blank-slate Jake (Ethan Hawke), doesn't know what to believe. Alonzo is a a master manipulator. A complicated man who holds authority and has been influenced by his experiences. Why shouldn't we trust him? Even as things escalate, we're hoping for redemption. For it all to make sense and be justified in the end.While sometimes slow and at other time uncomfortable, \"Training Day\" does what a lot of movies don't do anymore; immerse you and make you think.

Of all the cops to have a day with, Hawke gets to ride with the fiery and out-of-control Denzel Washington (in an electric Oscar-winning turn). Washington is a rogue cop who runs everything everywhere he goes. However, Washington has a hidden secret that could cost him his life by the end of the day. The film could best be described as \"The Los Angeles Connection\" (ala \"The French Connection\" 30 years ago) and Denzel Washington makes Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman in \"The French Connection\") look like an eagle scout. Washington dominates the action and is the much-needed \"fire\" in \"Training Day\". On the opposite side of the coin is the equally riveting Ethan Hawke who acts as the \"ice\" to counter-act Washington's heat. Hawke is trapped in a situation where he sees all, but what can he really do about what is happening around him? Overall the film is a near-miss and really should have been a pure mess. Denzel Washington finally got a role where he could do what he wanted and more than anything \"Training Day\" is just an exhibition for Washington's out-of-this-world talents. With that said this is not Washington's greatest performance (I am partial to \"The Hurricane\" myself). Washington has made himself great by playing somewhat quiet and sympathetic characters and this role is the exact polar opposite of that. Ethan Hawke is super and this film truly put him into a higher class of actors. The research of this film is pretty impressive as the film-makers shot in real rough neighborhoods in Los Angeles and many real-life gang-bangers and thugs are prevalent throughout the film. Cameos by musical superstars Macy Gray, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really some of the strongest scenes as all three do fine jobs in limited screen-time. Too many coincidences, a somewhat ridiculous confrontation between Washington and Hawke near the end and Washington's side-story are the main things I found a bit out-there. But in the end the film served its purpose: getting Washington the Best Actor Oscar. 4 stars out of 5.",

The plot was simple yet involved. The entire movie took place within a small area and within one day. With those parameters, you have to be quite good to make the movie interesting.",

The ending was somewhat weak like has been commented here before, but I'm not sure I could have taken another moment of intensity... I was 'in' the picture and lost to the world like nothing in a very long time. You could have grabbed a sample of my blood and come up with nothing but pure adrenaline.Part of the reason might be a past history with a bit of street background in it (yes, I've met lowlifes although nothing as bad as portrayed here)... this brought up the atmosphere of some remembered horrors, and by the end of the film my heart was palpitating and I was physically choking.  I went into this film with no 'prior knowledge' whatsoever (as a rookie), and it might have been a near heart attack for this over-35 guy... next time I'll read up on the plot a bit first.For the average moviegoer, the realism may not jump out too much... if you've ever been on the streets sometime in recent memory (even briefly, and not necessarily in LA), this film is like spreading drugs out in front of a former junkie -- not pleasant, but try tearing your eyes away.  And Denzel... was truly a surprise.  I've never been too impressed by his somewhat wooden acting, but his 'moment' toward the end is up there with the best rant-fests I've seen from Al Pacino.  The 'best actor' Oscar was deserved, imho.9/10 (one point off for a weak ending).",

To assist in his training he is accompanied by the man in charge of the division, \"Detective Alonzo Harris\" (Denzel Washington) who shows him the ropes for the first 24 hours. During this time he quickly learns that the rules he has been taught at the police academy do not apply and that his life is in jeopardy if he fails to adapt. He also learns that there is another sort of justice other than that rendered by the courts-street justice. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was movie offers a no-holds-barred glimpse at the \"war on drugs\" and gang activity from the perspective of those living in the eye of the storm--and it isn't very pretty.

This is one of those films that is at times so over the top brilliant, and at others so patheticaly stupid, that you wonder if it wasnt a splicing of efforts by 2 different directors.

Ethan Hawke prepares for his first day of training on the narcotics team with a meeting with Denzel Washington who plays by his own rules. He begins by forcing Hawke to smoke pot then Washington proceeds to dish out his own brand of justice on the guilty. Hawke can sense trouble as corrupt law caves in leading to an extremely violent climax. Director Antoine Faqua previously made Bait, which contained similar themes. It observes corrupt justice and plays out many scenes with uncertainty. Flawless performance by Washington who is of the law at first appearance before true nature emerges. This is a very different performance from him and that is what render this film viewable above the violence. What is interesting is his downfall right after he yells, \"I am the police. King Kong ain't got nothing on me!\" Hawke is superb as a cop wanting to do right but forced to comply with wrong. He will be placed in a difficult position in the third act. Unfortunately Scott Glenn and Tom Berenger appear in flat roles leaving only the two leads to carry the film. Average in terms of production, it plays like a cop drama but states a strong case regarding bad company corrupting good character. Score: 6 / 10",

I'm always a fan of the 'Good v. Evil' scenario and this one employs it perfectly. The polar opposites that the film creates in Alonzo and Hoyt (the former being completely corrupt, the latter being completely pure) are very interesting and the balance between them kept me engaged the entire film. As we watch Hoyt try to understand this new world that he's been thrown into, while still trying to keep his morality and good nature intact, we realize (just like he does) that there is no right or wrong. You have to create a balance, because the line 'It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.' couldn't be more true, so sometimes that's why you have to bend the rules in order to bring the bad guys down. The ending is one of my all time favorites, as Hoyt leaves Alonzo to be murdered by the numerous men out to get him because he can't arrest him and he can't kill him himself. Brilliant. Both of the lead performances are excellent, and Denzel's win was fully deserved. His charisma and the fact that his character was so against his normal 'good guy' type made for such an interesting and ethereal portrayal of one of my favorite characters. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the huge coincidence that the girl Hoyt randomly saved from being raped just happened to be the cousin of the man who was about to kill him. I found that insanely dumb, but it didn't affect my opinion on the film at all.",

            "review_title": "Amazing performances, great action, good film, but it should have been better.",
            "content": "There are a few actors in Hollywood that create a huge stir of interest and gossip anytime they come out with a new film. Tom Hanks is probably the biggest of these actors, but this group also includes tremendously talented actors like Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, and of course, Denzel Washington. All of this almost automatic hype is not, however, entirely accurate at all times, and Training Day is a prime example of this. Now before you click on my name above so you can send me some hate mail, I should just point out that I am not pretending that Training Day is a bad movie, I am just saying that there are a lot of things in it that should have been done differently or not at all. Denzel Washington plays the part of the scary Detective Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke plays Officer Jake Hoyt, a new white officer on the force who is to learn the ways of being a tough cop from Harris. The most powerful part of the film is, of course, Denzel's performance as the hardened narcotics officer in Los Angeles, and the interaction that he has with the inexperienced Hoyt, who really only wants to get a nice promotion so he can provide a better life for his wife and kid. Harris has a way of doing his job that really makes it interesting, he's not just a guy running around arresting guys who sell drugs or are doing drugs, he plays his job almost like a chess game.One of the more surprising examples of this is the way that he forces Hoyt to smoke PCP laced marijuana as one of his first lessons, explaining to the incredulous Hoyt that if he were to turn down a similar gift out on the streets, he's be dead. No further explanation is given, and none is needed. Harris knows that he has to be intimidating on the streets or he'll get killed, and he knows that he has to be as familiar as humanly possible with the very thing that he's trying to stop. These people are his people, but he's on the other side of the law.There is an interesting way that the movie explores the possibility that many of that civil laws that police officers must follow only hinder the true delivery of justice and their efforts to stop crime, because Harris is an officer that pursues the bad guys in any way necessary, whether legally or not, and he looks much deeper into the situations than just getting the guys in cuffs in the back of his car. The scene where they see the two guys trying to rape a woman on the streets comes to mind. Hoyt is ready to throw these guys in the car, take them downtown, and throw them in jail, case closed. They witnessed the crime, it was that easy. Instead, Harris beats them both stupid and lets them go right in front of the astonished eyes of Hoyt, inspiring the famous line, `Let the animals weed themselves out.' God willing.The real problem that I have with this movie is that, for one thing, it is entirely too violent in places where it doesn't need to be. One of the things that I hate to hear the most in a review of an action movie is that it's too violent, just because it sounds so much like something my grandmother would say, but take, for example, the scene where Harris and Hoyt are fighting each other hand to hand. This scene is excruciatingly violent, but the only problem that I have with it is that it should have been maybe a third of the length that it was. MAYBE. I am a serious fan of good bloody, violent movies, I even enjoy Steven Seagal films and Van Damme films, but even in the most hardcore action films and for the most die hard action fan, there comes a point where you think, `Okay, I GET it.' Training Day either does not believe that this point exists, or doesn't know where it is. Besides that, I know that this is an aberrant role for Denzel Washington, who does not very often play villains, but even as the character that he played in Training Day, there are certain things that you simply can't do to an actor like him, and gunning him down Godfather-style by a whole row of machine guns is one of them. No matter how bad the guy is that he's portraying, you just can't do things like that to him, the man's LOVED! I am not usually one to complaing about issues of violence like this, but there is a place in the movies for excessive violence, and it is in Van Damme films and Seagal films, not in movies like this. Training Day had entirely too many real world connections to be dumbed down be excesses like that, and if these things had been reduced to a more realistic level at least slightly, the quality of the film would have increased enormously. Just a little change could have done a lot of good.",

He begins the film as a good guy, showing Jake the ropes. He quickly becomes questionable with his techniques that just don't feel right. As the film goes on it is clear that Alonzo is very, very crooked and needs to be put in his place. There is a very memorable line from Alonzo during his drastic downfall, which is, \"King Kong ain't got s**t on me!\" The way that Washington delivers that line during Alonzo's monologue is magnificent. Beyond the fantastic villain character, \"Training Day\" has a great script. Yes, it is unlikely that all of this would take place in just one day if this was real life, but I firmly believe that that notion of reality can be stretched at times in cinema. There is little to be said on the plot, but it is just very well written and executed. Jake's good natured personality is a good opposition towards Alonzo, but his character is left in the darkness next to the brilliance that is Alonzo.I highly recommend this film.

Considering the other nominees and Washington's performance, I wouldn't say he deserved it \u2013 he wasn't bad, but didn't make an impression either. He based his character on Rafael Perez, a former police officer involved in the LAPD Rampart scandal who covered up robberies and murders.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has always wanted to be a police officer so he could rid the society of drugs and dealers. On his first day on the job, however, a much more experienced policeman, detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), takes him around town in his car and shows him that being a police officer is nothing like he imagined.I didn't like this movie, even though it's very good. I found the story to be original, even though it follows the classic good cop vs. bad cop scheme and you can see it from the start: detective Alonzo is irritating, violent, full of himself but he's also experienced; Jake Hoyt, on the other hand, is a family man, an idealist and, maybe one could even say, a fool \u2013 but we like him, feel for him and wish his vision of society was the true one. Hawke and Washington both deliver good performances, which makes this movie good since it mostly focuses on their interactions and overall relationship that develops in one day.Training Day is very violent, therefore it would be difficult for me to watch it multiple times. Another problem with the movie is that it becomes boring from time to time \u2013 there are some parts you simply must sit through to get to the good parts. On the other hand, some of the twists were truly intelligent and unexpected. The cinematography and the soundtrack are good too. But the ending seems abrupt, and certain characters should have been more developed, or at least given more screen time \u2013 especially those Alonzo calls \"the three wise men\". All in all, Training Day is a good movie, and you're guaranteed to like it if you fancy violence and action.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

It's the ever-changing relationship between these two equally interesting characters that drives the piece forward with a constant momentum that often amounts to edge-of-your-seat suspense. It's really thanks to the amazingly grounded and realistic script that the film is so effective, as every single line of dialogue feels incredibly natural and each word that is said adds to the overall narrative in some way. The effortlessly entertaining picture becomes incredibly engaging by its pulse-pounding third act, to the point that its few issues can be easily ignored.

From the first time I saw him in Dead poets, I've been following his career and in Training day I thought Hawke gave the performance of his life. This is a fantastic gritty suspenseful story that is so refreshing in the face of all the bubble gum thrillers out there that just want numbers at the box office. This movie proves that you can have both realism and popularity in the same reel.

Both movies were ho-hum, but held the character of a lifetime and is highly recommended just on their command performance.This is not to underplay Hawke's almost (90%) equally acting \u2013 he was very good, himself, but Washington was so good, that when I first saw this back in 2001, long before the Oscar Nominations were announced, I said: \"He better both be nominated and win.\" On a side note, unfortunately for Washington Fans \u2013 he has tried to recapture this high since and that's made me very sad to say I once was a devote Washington follower. Meaning: almost every role since 2001's Training Day, he has screamed \"OSCAR!\" without acting much.But, I digress, this is about Training Day, a good (again, not great) film, but one you should see concerning the troubling day both Rookie Hoyt (Hawke) and Harris (Washington) are having.Eager to please and diligent to keep his job for his growing family, Hoyt is joining the narcotics hard-core L.A. team, but he needs to deal with drama-filled Harris, who may (or may not) be on the take with the crooks he's paid to take down. (Watch FX's excellent series The Shield for further adventures on the same plane.) You see, Harris might be in over his head with a deal/incident gone wrong in Las Vegas, pissing off the wrong people, despite his demeanor. And he must trust the Clark Kent'ish Hoyt if he's to get away with it.That's pretty much it.

            "review_title": "The films of Ayer",
            "content": "This is a review of \"Street Kings\", \"Training Day\" and \"End of Watch\", three films by David Ayer.Ayer's best film since \"Harsh Times\", \"Street Kings\" stars Keanu Reeves as Detective Tom Ludlow, a burnt out cop who spends his days dodging bullets, taking down bad guys and dealing with a corrupt law enforcement system rife with scumbags in uniform. Sounds clich\u00e9d? Ayer's film moves like magic. He captures the tone and tempo of sleazy pulp fiction, revels in the genre's trashiness, writes in a baroque, pulp-prose style and volleys dialogue back and forth like Howard Hawks on cocaine.Ayer, who started out as a screenwriter, also has an ear for snappy noir dialogue. His characters don't talk, so much as they play ping-pong with words, prose hurtling along with staccato intensity; like drumbeats. It's trashy, but it knows it's trashy; 1950s B movie sleaze filtered through a modern prism.The film's all hand held cameras and snappy cuts, pausing now and then only to capture noir infused, sun drenched shots of California. We get convenience store shootouts, foot-chases through LA's Latino quarter, ominous nighttime skylines and the bloody haze of downtown ghettos. In Ayer's films, California's a war zone.The message here is also less problematic than that of Ayer's other work. Here Keanu plays your typical loose cannon of a cop. He's a modern Dirty Harry, a fascist with a badge, a ruthless authoritarian who breaks the law and shoots up punks, all in the guise of doing the \"greater good\". To eliminate evil, Keanu believes, you have to employ risqu\u00e9 tactics, perhaps even the mendaciously immoral and outright illegal. The ends justify the means. Deal with it.Only they don't. Keanu eventually realises he's a messed up dirt-bag who's been used as a violent blunt object by both the good guys and the bad. Ticked off, this little pawn visits his king, a chubby Police Chief who's house, in a nice bit of symbolism, literally has money, drugs and blackmail tapes leaking out of its walls; the up-scale veneer can barely hold back the corruption.Ayer also wrote the screenplay for \"Training Day\". Another cop thriller, it stars Denzel Washington as a vicious LAPD narcotics officer who takes an ambitious rookie (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Washington's a criminal and crooked cop. Ethan, in contrast, is our great white hope, representative of Good, white American values, family and strong morals. Faced with the multi-ethnic criminality of both LA and Washington, Ethan opts firstly to simply walk away. Let the animals kill themselves. But Washington won't allow it. He attempts to corrupt Ethan \u2013 first with marijuana and later with harder vices - before provoking him into righteous violence. Even then Ethan refuses to deliver the kill blow; its up to the people of the slums \u2013 Latinos, Russians and blacks \u2013 to finish off their own kind. Ethan's hands remain clean. Whilst the film's first hour is thrilling, it becomes increasingly racist and stereotypical as it progresses.Racism and stereotypes are precisely what gush forth from Ayer's \"End of Watch\". The film finds actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena playing a pair of LAPD cops. They're young, macho cowboys, high on testosterone and hungry for action. Much of the film juxtaposes the goodness of our virtuous heroes, their family lives and desire for peace, family and domesticity, with the wild savagery of LA's underclass, who actively hunt our heroes and violently intrude upon their private lives. It's your typically racist Cowboys vs Indians story. Our cops are a fraternity of hazing, backslapping, well-meaning frat-boys (they shoot and kill only in legitimate self-defence; yeah right), who hold the line against the savage chaos that is the Other. It's a jungle out there, which Ayer fetishizes and salivates over, his cops finding black kids tied up in cupboards and butchered limbs hidden in basements. You can find similar scenes in early films which demonized those pesky Native American Indians; monster's gonna getcha.As this is a millennial police drama, two generations removed from Rodney King and a bevy of other scandals, Ayer's cops are more thankless grunts than boys in blue. They're soldiers. The film, with its pseudo documentarian shaky cam aesthetic (which, bizarrely, makes the film feel manufactured and fake rather than \"authentic), as a whole mirrors \"Saving Private Ryan\", the poster boy of modern cinematic fascism, which likewise masked bigotry, blood-lust and hatred behind patriotism and seemingly wholesome values. \"Black Hawk Down\" for cops, the film's a love-letter to the thin blue line, a blood-and-guts glorification of \"those who keep the savages at bay\", which is to say, it's total propaganda and trades in bogus mythology.Crime films routinely demonstrate no social understanding, and routinely ignore the systemic causes of the appalling, violent conditions underprivileged minorities find themselves in. Others focus on \"corrupt policemen\" and \"rotten apples\", which itself misses the larger point that all law enforcement is systemically corrupt. The police/polis has a repressive function, its goal is to make politics disappear, for as long as there is no politics, a hierarchal distribution of power remains intact. The police, including disciplinary institutions and their various ideological components, are there to uphold the status quo and make sure that equality doesn't interfere with the hierarchal distribution of power; these social institutions are inherently inegalitarian. Today people have no problem accepting that the thin red line, the armed forces, does not act in the interest of You or Other, but it's the same with the thin blue line. Indeed, the dollar value of crime stopped by police infinitely out-weights that caused by the same. Borne of the desire of the wealthy to restructure society, to manage the urban poor and potential workforces, the law doesn't exist to prevent injustice acting upwards (the old notion that police protect the happy middle classes from the crazy, lazy lower classes), but largely to promote injustices acting downwards.7.9/10",

For the Denzel Washington character, rules of ethical conduct are utterly meaningless and are to be ridiculed and ignored. The problem with this movie is that it glorifies the corrupt cop who is portrayed as being tough and all-knowing when in fact his thinking and perceptions are completely distorted. Accordingly, his behavior becomes maladaptive and can lead only to disaster. As a result, he is ruined, both as a police officer and a man. Sad.",

Denzel shows why and how he is at the top of the acting game in America - no one is better. And Ethan Hawke was brilliant in a role demanding a 12-hour change from na\u00efvet\u00e9, confusion, nuance, defiance, vulnerability, acceptance, defiance again and finally strength and resolve.

            "content": "'King Kong ain't got sh*t on me!' That's sure, right! 'Training Day' was an amazing movie! Directed by Antoine Fuqua, and written by David Ayer, this neo-noir crime thriller, tells the story of a young naive LAPD officer, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) undergoing a nightmarish single day evaluation by corrupt, yet renowned and respected narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) who has big sinister plans for him. Without spoiling this movie, too much; while this good/bad cop film has amazing performances from both main & supporting actors like Ethan Hawke, Cliff Curtiss, Scott Glenn & others, much of the success of this movie has to go with how surprising good, Washington was as the villain. It's sad to think, that Denzel had to depart from his usual squeaky clean image, to win, an Oscar for best actor, but the performer really does shines in this type of roles. You can truly tell that, with his use of body language and tone. The way, Washington show, primeval street grit, with long, hard stern looks, loud boisterous charisma yelling, and disregard for the public safety, such as bumping into people as he walks, show how much of an utterly detestable character, Alonzo can be. No wonder, why most of the audience were so eagerly for his comeuppance, even if Denzel, personal, is so beloved. Yet, there was another part of the character, Washington was able to display, without the writer spending too much time on his character backstory, visually; which was showing empathy for Hoyt. You see this, whenever Jake does anything, valor and honest & Denzel having to react from that. Its shows the struggle of guilt, within Alonzo. It tells the tragic story of a mild-mannered, family man, slowly morphing into a ruthless criminal in a matter of a few words & stares. It's nearly perfect. Yet, there was a few flaws, with the character as a whole. Much of that, comes from the misuse of the source material, which 'Training Day' is loosely based on. While, Alonzo is somewhat based on real-life, corrupt Los Angeles, police officers, David Mack, Rafael P\u00e9rez & Kevin Gaines. Some of the actions, the character commits as a Narc Cop with Hoyt, throughout the film, just doesn't seem very plausible or realistic. They come across as too flashy, gimmicky and cartoonish, rather than smart street cops. One such example is the smoking, a confiscate drug scene. First off, it's a little hard to believe, that an officer like Hoyt that use to do patrols, would be that gullible and foolish, what it takes to become a narc. In most cases, police officers received an average of 41 hours up to 540 hours of instruction training before going into that field. There would be, no way, Hoyt would be that adequate. Secondary, it really doesn't make much sense that he would take the drug, knowing full well, that he was going to drug test in a few days & he wasn't dealing with any perps at that time. Third, it's highly bizarre, that Alonzo would plan out, for a whole week of stuff, on a specific one day plan that relies so much on the highly off-chance that Hoyt would take the drug, in order to blackmail him. Much of this movie could had be resolve in the first couple of minutes, with Hoyt, saying 'no'. Fourth, how in the hell was Alonzo's many crimes, overlook for so long!? I get that, he get stuff done in the department, but even if most of the department share the same corruption as the officer on the field; cops still have to write reports, submit a financial disclosure statement, undergo random drug testing, and pass recurring background investigations, yearly. There is no way, they can hide everything from the public & other government agencies. The corrupt cops would eventually get caught. Probably quicker than later, like what happen in real-life, with the Rampart scandal; which this movie is loosely based on. Also, none of the criminal sequences, throughout the day, felt anywhere near realistic. The idea that they easily find illegal drugs, as soon, as they pull a corner is far from truth. In real-life, Narc spend hours on end, on one, suspicious activity, with little to no pay-off, that a crime is being committed. Also, much of the crimes, portray in the film, felt more like step-up sequences, rather than isolate scenarios, which occurs more, likely. Regardless of that, I do have to fight against the claims from critics that this movie is nothing, but the continuous negative stereotype of minorities in film, by saying the movie does show that corruption happens in every level, regardless of class and race, such as the case in the restaurant scene & with Roger (Scott Glenn). As for the critics that says, Hoyt was nothing, but a ''white savior' cinematic trope whom job is it to rescue people of color from their downward plight. I also have to disagree with them, as the film shown in the end, Black & Hispanic communities, are willing to stand up against crime. Hoyt didn't make them, change. They did it on their own. Nevertheless, the film approach to women, could had been a little better. Most of the women in the film does nothing, but look and act like sleazy floozies. Sadly, actress, Eva Mendes is just there, for eye-candy and pointless nude scene. Still, that's a lot better than the jarring use of black musicians artists, like Macy Gray, Snoop Dog, and Dr. Dre, as criminals. That was awkward. Still, great use of their music in the soundtrack. Nevertheless, this strong Rated R movie, was an intense & compelling watch. While, this crime drama is not for everybody, due to rough language, graphic violence, drug use, and sexual references. It's still worth checking out, unlike the 2017's TV Series of the same name. Forget that show. Watch the movie, instead.",

Ok, he's not a rookie cop, exactly; he's been on the force for something like 14 months. But he wants to do bigger and better things, so he's signed up for Alonzo's elite narc squad.\nAlonzo puts Hoyt through the paces - visiting snitches, shaking down people, doing the drugs they confiscate (or at least making Hoyt do them). Through it all, Alonzo seems mean and cynical, but also worldly and supremely intelligent. He's not just some megalomaniacal renegade cop who's king of his own world, or even some Johnny Law with a 'tude. The viewer wonders what's up Alonzo's sleeve: Does he have plans for young Mr. Hoyt? Is he just playing with him? Or is he just completely nuts? You just plain never can tell with Washington's portrayal, and that's why he deserved the Oscar. Always keeping the audience guessing, Washington makes sure you don't pigeonhole his character as purely evil. The events that take place during the day (as the title suggests, all of the action is confined to one day's work) imply that they're all leading up to something - the audience just doesn't know what. If Alonzo is bad and is looking out for himself, what kind of denouement can be expected? If he isn't completely bad, is he going to say the day's just been one long lesson for his newcomer? The crisp script by David Ayer never lets up, relentlessly pounding the viewer with these and other questions. Moral ambiguity is a delicious plot device, but only if the script is well written. There's hardly any lag in Training Day, so that if there were any plotholes the viewer would gloss over them quickly enough. The movie's hard hitting, full of life and excitement, complete with plenty of twists. You can never get completely used to anything in the movie, because few things are as they seem.The one exception to this is Hoyt himself. Maybe he's supposed to be an Everyman; more likely he's just a wide-eyed innocent being corrupted by the Big Bad Veteran. Hawke has the wide-eyed look down pretty good, which is a bit of a comedown from a guy who played a supercool dude in 1994's Reality Bites. It's the meatiest role Hawke's had, and he seriously flubs it. But since he's playing opposite Washington, and since this is Washington's movie, Hawke's inadequacies are easily overlooked, as well they should be. Having said that, there's no way Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar, as he was. What were people thinking? That Washington was as good as he was because he had Hawke to play off? Hardly. It's an ineffectual performance; Edward Norton would have been a far better choice - and he could have walked home with that Oscar, too.",

This one and Three Kings.  Had I known the actor before I watched Whale Rider it mighta been interesting.  And I think he's best acting job is in Whale Rider.

            "content": "At times, \"Training Day\" seems like a photographed play.  Most of the scenes during the first and second acts take place within the confines of a patrol car, with Denzel and Hawke having their foul-mouthed interactions.  To be honest, I felt some of those scenes could've been trimmed or cut and didn't seem necessary.  The overuse of dialogue scenes dragged down the pace a little.  So you can say, the film could've used more time in the editing room.  The performances are stellar.  Denzel is one of my favorite actors, and it was nice to watch him play a character much different from the upperclassmen he usually plays.  This time around, he's an uninhibited, foul-mouthed, sadistic, no-nonsense narcotics cop.  Like always, I was impressed by Denzel, but I was even more impressed by his co-star Ethan Hawke. Technically, the film focuses on him, but since Denzel is a much bigger star--he has to get first billing.  Sorry, Ethan.  Hawke, though a fine actor, usually gets the role of the pretty-boy love interest.  This is a much, much different role for him.  He plays a quiet, well-intentioned married man who gets called in for training (as a narc) by Denzel.  The two guys couldn't be any more different, like all buddy cop movies.  But unlike most buddy cop movies, this is much darker.  There's humor here and there, but dark humor.  None of that Riggs-Murtaugh chemistry we got used to in the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies.  I have to admire Antoine Fuqua for not making the usual casting choices.  Another example of his original casting is Scott Glenn's role as a burned-out dealer, who Denzel befriends.  Of course, since Fuqua has a history directing music videos, we have supporting roles with such artists as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray.  Not the greatest actors, but they didn't have enough screen time to ruin the film. \nThe climax is adverse to the film's harsh, realistic tone.  We're basically given the Hollywood treatment.  We have the usual dueling between the antagonist and protagonist, in which they beat each other to a bloody pulp. One of them gets away, the other returns--as a bloody mess--and they fight again.  I don't want to give away the ending, though there's no big surprises, but if an alleged tough guy is in the middle of a ghetto, gangbangers and dealers surrounding and outnumbering him, and starts telling them off--it don't matter if you're a policeman or not; those guys would blow you away in the drop of a hat.  That's when Denzel makes his \"King Kong ain't got s**t on me!\" speech, in which you're sitting in the theater trying to stop yourself from laughing.  And you know damn well those gangbangers and dealers would've laughed at him too--before he's brutally killed.  It's noticeable that the writer of this film tried to be realistic by injecting tons of street slang into the script, but some of the slang sounded more laughable (unintentionally) and preposterous than realistic.  Believe me, I live in an environment where I hear more street slang than I need to hear. I know the difference between real and fake slang.  \"Training Day\" is an overlong film that gets boring at times, but I found it mostly engaging.  The performances alone are worth watching.  By the way, that hot mamacita Eva Mendes plays Denzel's wife in the film.  And she has a brief nude scene.  Oh, man!  Is she hottt!My score:  7 (out of 10)",

            "review_title": "With great performances, films portraits the police corruption and the complex situation experienced by those who are thrown into the violence",
            "content": "Starting from a promising premise, director Antoine Fuqua manages to create an instigating narrative and, aided by editing by Conrad Buff, intersperses between traveling shots, many close-ups, slow motion and agitated motion to maintain a dynamic pace that gives us the constant sensation of that something important will happen at any moment, keeping the tension going without allowing the viewer to relax. In addition, the director is skilled in creating a realistic environment that is coherent with the universe in which the narrative takes place, something reinforced, for example, by the soundtrack by Mark Mancina, which oscillates between rap, Latin music and heavier chords., throwing the viewer into that reality in a competent way. Likewise, Michele Michel's costumes indicate from the beginning the duality of Alonzo, who appears wearing the typical black of villains even though he was initially sold as the experienced and admired tutor who would guide Jake.Still on the technical side, Mauro Fiore's photography follows the natural evolution of the day with the sun rising over the horizon at the beginning, filling a good part of the second act and disappearing at the end, which gradually makes the film more suffocating and prepares us for the act Final. It is also worth mentioning how the play of light and shadow partially covers Alonzo's face when he asks Jake to execute a drug dealer, visually demonstrating his criminal facet, which at that point was already evident. Tense, this scene is crucial to understanding the workings of that underworld and the dialogue that follows is equally important to understanding Alonzo's questionable moral code.Addressing various social problems in the United States, \"Training Day\" fails due to the caricatured way it portrays the communities and Latinos that cross Jake's path, for example, when he is abandoned by Alonzo to be murdered, in a scene, incidentally, that it is conducted in a very realistic way by Fuqua, but in which unfortunately the solution to the conflict sounds quite artificial due to the simplistic way in which the girl is convinced by her uncle to tell the truth about the attempted rape. Likewise, when the enraged Jake goes in search of Alonzo in the \"Jungle\", the community that had been portrayed as one of the most dangerous places in the city previously, impresses negatively as even with the two fighting, breaking various objects and shooting everywhere, locals take forever to get out of their houses. To make matters worse, their behavior in the face of confrontation does not sound convincing, confirming how the third act is by far the weakest segment of the film.Fortunately, the realism of several other scenes make up for these slips, such as when Alonzo uses a false warrant to search a house and is forced to flee from there under gunfire from local residents or when Jake rushes out to save the girl from being raped. And fights alone against his aggressors. It is also worth mentioning the various dialogues between the two police officers that oppose very different views of the world and that provoke good reflections.However, it is even in performances that \"Training Day\" guarantees its success. Demonstrating Jake's discomfort from the beginning at his home and in the first conversation with Alonzo in a cafe, Ethan Hawke manages the difficult task of facing Denzel Washington's exceptional performance head on without ever sounding inferior for being living a rookie and, what is even better, amplify her impact by deftly exposing the reflections of the veteran's attitudes on her character. With his minimalist expressions, Hawke humanizes the character, conveying his fears and doubts accurately and, on top of that, doing very well in moments that require more expressiveness, such as when he appears high after consuming drugs stolen by his partner. Incidentally, the way Hawke convinces us that Jake will be able to withstand the trials he is subjected to is crucial to the success of the narrative.Menacing, cool and already very comfortable in that universe, Washington's Alonzo is the typical corrupt policeman who already knows all the paths he can take and, more than that, imagines that he even knows how to deal with young idealists like Jake, betting in the harshness of his behavior and in the shock as a way of convincing the young man to accept his controversial methods, since, in his view, this is the only way to defeat organized crime - and his impressive numbers reinforce his view, since, however questionable whatever, these methods have led him to arrest many powerful criminals over the years. On the other hand, he doesn't seem to care about everyday events that can't boost his career, which leads him to patiently light a cigarette and smoke while Jake grapples with two criminals on a street defending a young woman who was about to be raped. What is most impressive, however, is how Alonzo actually believes in what he says and in the way he acts, as is clear in the conversation in which he explains the concept of wolves and sheep to Jake or when, ironically, he asks the young man to collect illegally collected evidence of drug dealer Blue, played by the iconic Snoop Dogg. For him, the ends justified the means and that was the only way to survive in that environment. Washington's energy in the role is contagious, conquering the viewer even in the face of various reproachful attitudes - and his smile when Jake uses one of his catchphrases against him is touching, showing how much he believed in his own methods.Insinuating police corruption right off the bat when Jake tells his wife she should see the houses they have, referring to Police Division Chiefs, \"Training Day\" doesn't hesitate to question the risks intrinsic to the power granted to these officers. Professionals in the United States, something made clear in the aforementioned scene of the murder of a drug dealer, meticulously planned by Alonzo. \"Just because we have badges is different?\", asks Jake after the crime. The conversation that follows inside the car exposes the opposing views of the characters, with Jake upset by what he saw while Alonzo demonstrates understanding for his reaction and strategically praises his partner, in an attempt to raise the boy's self-esteem to gain his empathy and attract him to that world.Unfortunately, David Ayer's screenplay compromises the film by grossly failing in the third and final act of the story, when it seems to give up on giving realism to its protagonists and decides to turn them into uninspired caricatures of 'hero' and 'bad guy'. From this moment on, Training Day abandons the ambition of its subject and strives to be just another crime thriller. On the other hand, Antoine Fuqua's direction never loses dynamism, plunging the viewer into an incredible state of tension (as in the sequence in which Hoyt plays poker with three thugs). In addition, the filmmaker does not avoid the graphic aspect of violence and shocks the audience by not diverting his camera in the strongest moments (there is a confrontation that takes place in a bathtub that reminded me of Scarface, by Brian De Palma).Anyway, the questions raised in \"Training Day\" are very valid and still current, being applicable not only in the United States, but in other countries like Brazil. How should a police officer act to survive in an environment where he is under constant threat and where criminals will not hesitate for a second before taking his life? On the other hand, how far can this same policeman go? It is certainly not acceptable to steal suspects and use these stolen objects in negotiations with informants, to act as a judge and not just to condemn suspects but to murder them for one's own interests or consume the same drugs that one seeks to remove from the streets - and it is relevant to reflect on this in a society who often confuses the search for security with a thirst for revenge. At the same time that it is necessary to offer protection to citizens and to the police themselves, it is also necessary to reflect on the risks involved.This is the best discussion that Fuqua's film can foster and that's why the third act disappoints by turning Alonzo into a one-dimensional monster and taking him away from the viewer. In a violent society like ours, it is more and more natural that we have the impulse to support attitudes like those of Detective Alonzo, since we want to recover a little of our former tranquility at any cost (and, thus, many may argue: \"he is corrupt, but at least he's doing something about crime\"). Sadly, the only way Training Day can show the error of this stance is to turn Washington's character into a monster.Even with these slips, \"Training Day\" works well as a portrait of police corruption and the complex situation experienced by those who are thrown into the war on drug trafficking, whether police officers or ordinary citizens. Built in two brilliant performances, it works as good entertainment without failing to provoke reflection, although a better worked third act could increase its thematic and narrative complexity.",

Hawke is fine for most of the film, although occasionally, he seems to be playing the \"rookie\" part a little too literally. One still has to believe that the character DID make it through the Police Academy and 19 months on the sometimes very tough streets of the San Fernando Valley (believe me, they ain't all dotted with Starbucks!). Around the 2/3 mark however, I think the film makes a wrong turn and becomes the kind of pro-forma cop/action flick that pervades the \"action\" shelf at your local video store. Too bad, it could have said something more profound about the state of police work in modern day big cities (and no matter how \"farfetched\" you might think some of the events are, just keep in mind that the LAPD has had just these kinds of scandals).

Is as simple as this: the film begins and is sort of having the experienced big detective who certainly knows how is that world opening the eyes of the rookie who just wants to track down big drug dealers, who just wants to do a good for the society. The transition we have is that Jake stops seeing Alonzo as the type of dude he has to learn a whole lot from to can deal with the new type of world he is entering and be successful and starts seeing Alonzo as nothing but a criminal that well tried to kill him, if at one point Jake smoked some weed because Alonzo said to him, in other things, that a good narcotics agent must know and love narcotics at one point Jake will go for his revenge.

It's a watchable film that once is over, well let's see, recently I bought the double feature DVD with both Training Day and Fallen (also with Denzel Washington and directed by Gregory Hoblit) just because I wanted to see again Antoine Fuqua's film again after many years (I remember seeing it when it was brand new as a rental). In that DVD Training Day is pretty much the main attraction and Fallen the bonus, minor feature (I never heard a thing before about Fallen), the Side A with \"Day\" has much more extras and stuff. Now that I saw Fuqua's film pretty much Fallen has all the chances to become the only reason for me to say something like \"well, buying that DVD was a great choice\" since basically by the end of Training Day I was like \"that's all?\", certainly for me now Fallen has not a really good contender for being the best out of the two films on the DVD but I will see.",

His justification for his conduct is that criminals work outside of the law and to get to them the police should too. But Alonzo is no different than any of the villains rookie officer Jake meets over the day, and as the film suggests he's possibly worse.The brutality and genuineness Denzel Washington brings to the role is exceptional and the quality of his performance raises the entire film a couple notches. As Hitchcock said \"The better the villain, the better the picture\" and Alonzo Harris is a great villain. Who packs so much authenticity you could almost think he's a real thug off of the street if you didn't know better.The veracity of this picture extends beyond Washington's performance which is what separates it from so many films. The Los Angeles crime world of this film stands above and away from almost any other peer. In it's own right it even surpasses the more stylish depiction of Michael Mann's films and portrays something far more raw and vicious. The movie puts you on some of the worst streets in the city in a way that transcends watching and is more of an experience nearly on par with way Apocalypse Now did for Vietnam.",

If you overlook the implausibility of this movie, it is still quite entertaining. The acting is great. Washington definitely captures a really insane character. Although his portrayal is fictitious, there is a grain of truth. It must be very difficult being a narc in 21st Century L.A. However, even as over-the-top as Washington's portrayal, you realize that a cop could be more dangerous than a criminal, if \"under the radar\". Ethan Hawke is also great as a very good cop, but a little naive. Hawke's character is manipulated and charmed into submission by the Washington's \"evil cop\". The ending of the movie was the best part. Despite having a certain fear of the evil cop's authority, in the end you find out that he was really despised. Hawke's good cop is actually saved in one scene by an earlier act of decency on his part. The evil cop eventually is destroyed and revealed as a power-hungry, sick individual that he truly is. In conclusion, don't expect believability. However, if you want to be entertained, this is a movie to see.",

Before I elaborate further, first of all let me highlight the fact that this movie features stellar performances by Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. These two actors take the viewers on a journey that entertains and thrills, shocks and mesmerizes, and it will feel very real.As I said earlier, \"Training Day\" is an action thriller, but it is an excellent one. The reasons that it feels very real is because we all know that a certain level of corruption exists in cop work, that seems unavoidable at times, due to certain reasons. I said reasons, therefore, I would like to mention that it also feels realistic because of Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington ' s genuinely outstanding, mind-blowing performances.Hawke plays a rookie cop who is being \"trained\" by a senior cop that Washington enacts. As the movie progresses, viewers will realize that this is definitely no ordinary training day in the life of a rookie cop ; there is definitely a mystery behind the action and procedures that Washington is instructing Hawke to do. The movie is full of surprises and excitement, suspense and mystery, and \"garnished\" with good action sequences. David Ayer has written an excellent cop-thriller story, and director Antoine Fuqua has presented it on-screen brilliantly, and almost flawlessly. \"Training Day\" will always be remembered as one of the best cop-action / crime thrillers ever made in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "Warning! SPOILERS galore!I was genuinely interested in this film to begin with... and I absolutely loved the acting of both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.BUT - about three quarters of the way through this thing I could no longer suspend disbelief.There are just too many things that accumulate for this film to be taken as seriously as it could have been...Yes, there are rogue cops out there. That is not my problem with this film. It probably comes extremely close to the truth when showing how corrupt the cops can be - and also probably very close to what the streets and their scum are like.The problem is with what happens to Ethan Hawke during the day in the life ... First problem. He smokes some pot laced with crack. He is totally out of his head... but probably not long enough to be realistic. He should probably have been almost totally knocked out for several hours... but it seems like only an hour or so after being high he is charging down a street and capturing totally by himself two would-be rapists... Not bloody likely. (And while I'm at it, I can't imagine real cops walking away from the perps leaving them with their handcuffs on... they would have at least taken back their equipment!Please remember that one of the rapists kicks Ethan in the side at least two or three times during their scuffle. Second: Ethan gets beaten up a second time by the hoods in the house where he is left by Washington. Sorry, but anyone who has been beaten up once by rapists and then beaten up a second time by these hoods would have been barely able to walk or do anything for the rest of the night. But not Ethan... he goes after Washington, and not only gets into a tumbledown fight that should ALSO have left him totally unable to move - but he actually jumps off a roof onto the windshield of a moving car and is STILL able to walk and operate on a pretty high level. Sorry, but if anyone reading this has ever taken even a quarter of the punishment Ethan does in this film, they would know that he would have been inoperative for most of the day... and certainly not in any shape to get through the last quarter hour of this film; Like, who is this guy, anyway? Superman?Third: How many 4 year old kids do you know that would trust a guy he's never met more than his own father? How many women who greet their man the way Washington's girlfriend (wife?) does when they stop off for lunch - would abandon him so quickly near the end? She grabs up her kid but does nothing to help protect Washington... and there is no explanation of why.I could go on - but why bother? There are so many holes in this film that although I liked much of it - and could believe the angle of the rogue cops etc... there is just no way that someone like Ethan would have been able to physically make it through this day.Oh, and by the way - in a town of how many millions, what would the odds be that the ONE 14 year-old girl who Ethan saves from being raped would turn out to be related to one of the hoods who is supposed to have killed him for Washington? Oh, come on! That is the weakest part of the entire plot. Could anyone who took two seconds to THINK really accept such a corny device? One would have better odds trying to win the lottery!All of this means that the film is really pretty stupid - or taking its audience for dunces... The only reason I gave this film a 6 instead of a 4 is because it is well-shot and well- acted.",

Similar to real life friend or family member loss. The only 3 bad things, hence the rating, I did not like is lack of real action, lack of positivity, and lack of solution.

            "content": "Ethan Hawke has made a career out of perfecting the nervous smile and candid shake of the head. Even as he gets older he has retained that youthful naivety about him. In Lord of War I noted he was woefully miscast as the FBI hotshot - Hawke is not the arrogant, in control type. In Training Day he is a different brand of law enforcement, where his character plays to his strengths. In the beginning Jake Hoyt feigns confidence and ambition, but soon after is immediately wringing his hands and vibrating with a nervous energy because of the things he is being asked to do (he put this aura to great use as the fresh faced teenager in Before Sunrise). Hawke is like a modern Jack Lemmon, but dropped into a urban, unforgiving environment and a tireless role. His body is withered and lean, with a scratchy, unkempt beard as a symptom of long nights. He represents a rat, a narcotics cops scurrying over to the dark side. Alonzo Harris is his opposite, who shares the same traits as Hoyt that might sooner mistake him for a dealer instead of a cop. Washington is relentless to the point of being overblown; with his skullcap, black 'matrix style' trenchcoat, silver crucifix necklace and penchant for double wielding pistols (with one aligned in the 'kill-shot' position), he treads the dangerous line between authenticity and the Hollywood vision of the edgy, corrupt cop. His dialogue is fast and furious, showcasing his 'street' knowledge and his wielding of racial capital to play both sides of the thin blue line closely, and often recklessly. In another world it would be easy to imagine him as a drug kingpin. It is this approach that leads to Hoyt's first challenge. Harris underlines the offer with a bit of wisdom that makes so much sense that almost makes up for his methods: to be a narc you must know and love the drug. The second part of his nefarious plan is to lace the joint with PCP and create a trial of evidence that will later come into play. The 'drug vision', shot from the perspective of the dazed Hoyt, is where the film shows some of its false colours. It's ridiculous, highlighted with a nightmarish green tint, canted dutch angle and erratic shaky-cam straight out of some Don't Do Drugs PSA for a high school crowd. The nauseous combo with extreme close-ups barrelling in on the young rookie's reactions are part of Fuqua's treatment of 'realism', albeit a shiny, sanitised version of working narcotics. Occasionally, he even is allowed to splurge, and the result of this is a dramatic rooftop meeting of similarly corrupt cops about to raid an informant, or as they call it, 'cashing in an account'. We understand that each of the four have gone through the same trial by fire that Hoyt is being pushed through. But what's wrong with a Starbucks?The ideal behind Hawke's Hoyt is a good one, if not simplistic. An early scene tacks a wife and child onto him like some sort of moral compass point, but not as part of a three dimensional character. He's an amalgamation of the characteristics that we and Hollywood like to see often in movies - white, middle class, young father, morally upright. Fuqua aligns the audience alongside him, and we nod and agree with his moral choices, before all that is upended and we discover that the streets operate on an entirely different level than the cinematic black and whites we are so used to. But the film also falls victim at the same crux. It posits that sometimes the bad guys win and that simple morality might not always be such an easy out, but then lets the angelic protagonist navigate the messy and heartless territory it has worked so hard to establish with relative ease and a few convenient narrative strokes. Training Day recalls other tangled crime dramas about figures trying to navigate the corrupt waters of the system, in particular the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and its more well known western counterpart, The Departed. While the former wears its pulp on its sleeve by using a flashy action aesthetic and showy, soap-opera-esque flashbacks to push the narrative along, the latter was well and truly americanised. As with many of Scorsese's films it verges on the point of being overdone, stretched an extra fifty minutes and made gritty, grey and quietly devastating. A distinct difference lies in the treatment of the undercover gang member who infiltrates the police system: the original had a way of swinging allegiances and evoking Buddhist sentiments of a perpetual guilt, whilst Scorsese all but batters Matt Damon into the ground, leaving no room for dispute. Interestingly, Training Day was released but a month after the 9/11 attacks, with the American public distraught, and fear and paranoia running rampant. In that climate a cop could do no wrong. Nowadays I look around and see a very different environment, one where the lessons of Training Day might not be so shocking. While the two former films are more or less straight thrillers, Training Day attempts to say a little more, but it's not entirely successful either.",

            "review_title": "Washington Makes It Worthwhile",
            "content": "A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, `Training Day,' directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return. The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in `Bullitt,' when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, `That's where half of it is--'  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.\tJake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, `If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--'  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his `Training Day,' is going to be a day that will change his life forever.\tFuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of `street-wise' reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  And one of the biggest flaws, especially in light of the fact that this story is presented in `realistic' terms, is that a key element of the plot hinges on a coincidence that Vegas odds-makers would love to put some big money on.  Fuqua visits much of the same territory as Dennis Hopper's 1988 film, `Colors,' though the final message is quite different, inasmuch as the focus of this film is on the `bad cop' angle.  As stated previously, there is some significance to this one, but it takes some work and imagination on the part of the viewer to discern.\tAs Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in `Lethal Weapon,' or Eastwood's Harry in `Dirty Harry,' the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.\tHawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.\tThe supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, `Training Day' is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.  6/10.",

Warts and all, there's still something about unsung, neo-noir cop thrillers like 8MM, RUSH, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. and FORT APACHE: THE BRONX that stays with you.  This may not necessarily be a good thing, but unlike something as insipid as AMERICAN PIE 2, for example, at least they make an indelible impression.Add TRAINING DAY to that list. What makes the movie different from others of its stripe, is no brain-twisting mystery whatsoever. What could've been your usual, by-the-numbers, good cop/bad cop thriller, not worth a hot minute in theaters and even less than that on the video store shelf, is elevated by a ferociously good performance at its center. And that performance, of course, belongs to Denzel Washington, taking his career of noble, high-minded \"saintly\" roles and giving it a welcome, vigorous shake.To say that undercover narc Det. Alonzo Harris is a bad man, is like saying that Bluebeard could've used a little marriage counseling. There's no way to simplify it in such pat terms. Somewhere underneath the layers of street cred that have hardened over the years into a thick, nearly impenetrable shell, a blue knight who has given over to the seductive darkness of thug life is buried alive. The young idealist who once wanted to \"protect and serve\" is still in there. You can catch glimpses of him, but less in the eyes of Harris, than in the face of his anxious but ready-to-please \"street virgin\" partner, Jake Hoyt, well-played by Ethan Hawke.Jake thinks he can do whatever it takes to gain entry into the narc squad, and use it as a stepladder to reach his ultimate goal, which is to someday make Chief, and actually have his own precinct. But young Jake has got to survive his initial trial-by-fire first, and nothing he's learned in the academy has prepared him for what it's like to roll down the streets of South Central, with a truly original Bad Man.The Oscar controversy has left a taint on this picture that is prejudicial and unfair, and the truth is that if Russell Crowe had won, the clamoring din of critics who would've screamed about how it would've been a consolation prize YET AGAIN for his astounding work in THE INSIDER, wouldn't have been quite as loud as the naysayers are now regarding Denzel.Both actors are remarkable craftsmen, and both have never \"phoned-in\" a performance in any of the movies I've seen them in, regardless of what the genre is.  If Denzel didn't deserve the award for this movie, as many have whined, then I say that he should have it for the simple fact that he has been doing great work LONGER than Russell Crowe. Bottom line.Am I biased? I would say yes. Did the Best Actor award smack of a popularity contest? I would say definitely to some degree, but when HASN'T the \"you-like-me-you-REALLY-like-me\" factor not affected the Oscars?  Regarding nomination of the best performance given, let me just say this. Russell, just in terms of acting ability, hits one out of the park as John Nash in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. High profile project, A-list director, a storyline that is virtual catnip to any Hollyweird producer. Personal ethics and public behavior aside, looking at Russell's past body of work, THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE. This was a sure thing, a SAFE thing.Considering Denzel's past achievements, the very last thing you would count on, is to see him give a Class-A performance in what could've easily been a grade-Z movie. If TRAINING DAY had come out at the same time as BOYZ 'N' THE HOOD, MENACE II SOCIETY, SUGAR HILL or NEW JACK CITY, with a star like Laurence Fishburne or Ving Rhames, there wouldn't have even been a debate. Don't get me wrong; these are both two fine actors, but Alonzo Harris is the kind of part we've seen them both play before. Nothing new there. But Denzel has NEVER played a villain before, let alone one as complex as this. And he did it BEAUTIFULLY. For that, he now has gold for his mantle. Case closed.Ethan Hawke holds his own with Denzel's riveting presence, taking what could've been the cliched, fresh-faced rookie role and putting just enough spin on it, so that when Jake Hoyt is a little more wary, battle-tested and world-weary by the end, we can completely buy it. Very few of today's crop of \"youngsters\" could have believably pulled it off.Antoine Fuqua (REPLACEMENT KILLERS, BAIT) has been down this road before, and the gritty, jittery, paranoia-laced uncertainty of the streets deposits a ball of tension in your gut from the opening frames and winds it ever tighter throughout the movie. South Central has never looked meaner, and it reminds us that for all the glamour we see on TV and in magazines and, yes, in the movies, L.A. has the same kind of scaly underbelly that all major cities have, and because of cops like Alonzo and Jake, good or bad, you might be lucky enough to never have to experience it first hand.So if there is anything faulty about TRAINING DAY, it lies not in the performances of its award-nominated leads, Fuqua's sure-handed direction, or the almost three-dimensional photographic style of the excellent DP Mauro Fiore. TRAINING DAY'S main downfall lies in the factor that bears at least 75% importance in determining whether or not a movie will get made, even before the budgeting: the casting.For that \"extra touch\" of street cred, not to mention guaranteeing the attraction of a certain demographic, no less than Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray and Dr. Dre stroll through in cameos, as a disabled crack dealer, a \"ghetto-fabulous\" hoochie, and one of Harris' men, respectively. All these performers have either lived or seen \"the life\" in one way or another, and none of them have to go 'Method' or 'find their motivation,' so you expect them to be good, and they are. The problem? Their presence, no matter how fleeting, is a jolting reminder that you are watching a movie, and that is what keeps DAY from being more than just a good film cemented by two great leads.Even more distracting, though, are the other supporting players, all of whom are at the top of their game here, but their appearances toss the hard-won realism right out the window.  Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry, Harris Yulin, Cliff Curtis and Raymond Cruz are among the well-meaning culprits, a who's-who of the type that we used to see a lot of, back when Clint was still busting heads as Harry Callahan. However, to the credit of the casting director(s) and the producers, I think we, the public, are savvy enough by now to know that without these vets, replaced instead by a bunch of no-names, no matter how talented they were, TRAINING DAY might still be a script sitting in the bottom of screenwriter David Ayer's desk drawer.That said, this is no feel-good romp, no buddy-buddy cop thriller where an Eddie Murphy or a Chris Rock will cut the tension with a well-placed, profanity-laced quip or two. Even with its obvious drawbacks, TRAINING DAY is still better than most films of its type, and more than worth your dime and your time.",

The more he does the harder it is to turn back and he becomes embroiled in Alonzo's schemes. A very good movie with fine performances from both the leads.

PLOT: (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) It's the first day on the job for Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). And what he wants more than anything is put put crooks and cops behind bars....not become one. But that is going to be tougher than anything he's ever faced before, because his parter for the day is narcotics veteran Alonzo Harris, a cop who turns out to be dirtier than the thugs he puts away. All of the actors in this movie were good. The supporting cast includes: Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr.Dre, Peter Greene, Cliff Curtis and much more. If you like movies with Denzel Washington because he is such a nice person and such a good actor, then stay away! You will hate him in this movie. But you will be able to relate to Ethan Hawke in many ways. If you like strong brutal violence and lots of language throughout movies, then this one is for you. You will find it interesting as Alonzo and Jake cruise the streets looking for trouble...and find it where ever they go. This is a knockout action film. A great suspense one, and a factual drama. So, I really don't know how to catigorize it. As an Drama Action Thriller? I don't know. All I know is that this is one heck of a movie and that I like it a lot. See it if you are a fan of strong violence. There's plenty of that to go around. TRAINING DAY: 5/5.",

On the face of it this is the story of a rookie narcotic cop's first day on the job riding shotgun for an old hand who doesn't play by the rules. However as the day progresses we learn the old hand is in big trouble and is desperately trying to frame the rookie to take the fall instead of himself. It's well written for the most part and certainly well performed however the plot hinges on a random event towards the beginning of the day which the corrupt old cop has no control over but that changes events dramatically later on. I'm not a fan of plots relying on coincidence but it only detracts a little and otherwise the plot is solid. So if it's been a while then give Training Day another watch and if you've never seen it before it's one of the best movies on Netflix at the moment.",

            "content": "This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation. However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both `Hurricane' and `Malcom X'.  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman' instead of going to him for his performance in `Malcolm X'.  In `Training Day', Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real. And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10.",

As Jake's 'Training Day' progresses he learns that his Police Academy rules don't apply in Alonzo's world, and with increasing concern, not to mention personal jeopardy, finds that Alonzo, some of his fellow detectives and even higher officials in the LAPD, have distinct rules of their own.Not an original premise, but here the delivery is bang on. Washington plays on his past comfortable screen personas, initially coming across as the experienced, tough, no-nonsense, but well meaning, detective. We of course, like Hawke's character Jake, a rookie eager to please, are initially taken in by this, but it is not long before doubts about Alonzo's true nature and agenda start to kick in.There are many disturbing things about this film, not least of which is the fact that no-one has come forward to say that it ain't really like that on the streets of LA \u0096 in fact they endorsed its accuracy by giving Washington an Oscar for his portrayal.However, Washington's performance is electric and worthy of its Academy Award. Alonzo is charismatic, persuasive, powerful, dangerous and downright scary. Ethan Hawke compliments this with a portrayal that runs the gamut from initial naivety and respect, through wary tolerance, to disbelief, terror and finally rage, in a performance necessarily powerful enough to counter Washington. The two are equally compelling to watch and provide edge of the seat entertainment in a gripping, raw and violent tale of lies, betrayal, corruption and abuse of power (sorry to use the old maxims there, but here they actually apply).Highly recommended.",

Every feeling you have towards the main characters is your own, and the movie never attempts to dictate your emotive response. This is a rarity in the sentimentally-driven industry Hollywood frequently is. The performances are utterly excellent, and Ethan Hawke does equally as well as Washington in my opinion - the only difference being that Washington's character has more scope and more of the opportunity to be dynamic.\nThe movie is objective, never takes sides, and gives the viewers the chance to deduce their own feelings.

I'm glad I did; Training Day is an outstanding film, even if it's a bit of a no-brainer.What elevates this one from others is the acting. Denzel Washington, in his Oscar-winning performance, does a superb job playing Det. Alonzo Harris, a corrupt LAPD officer who is given the task of breaking in rookie NARC Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke, who was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar). As Hoyt slowly finds out that his cohort is the shadiest cop in the universe, involved in corrupt dealings with gangs, drug lords, and stealing of dirty money in conjuction with other renegade cops. Hoyt needs to bring him down to save his own bacon. Still, despite the obvious ending to the story, the ride is well worth it because the acting is uniformly excellent. Denzel plays against type, instead of the amiable types of people or rogues, here he plays a cruel, evil, cocky, SOB; but he doesn't overplay it. Hawke plays the good cop beautifully, but fortunately he's not a goody-two-shoes type, as he goes on his rounds with Washington in the inner-city of L.A. (some of the movie was actually filmed in Compton).A supporting cast with Scott Glenn and hip-hop stars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, and Macy Gray will be of big interest to some. The direction by Antoine Fuqua and writing of David Ayer is first-rate. The DVD includes deleted scenes, an alternate ending, two music videos, the usual documentary, and other goodies.

Washington is relaxed and entertaining as a corrupt undercover cop who shows his new partner (Ethan Hawke, way out of his league) the ropes in south central L.A. but he plays into the conceits set up by screenwriter David Ayer (he wrote the slick `The Fast And The Furious') and in the end Washington's in cahoots with the film's stodgy finger-wagging, becoming little more than a stick figure. The director is the talented Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') but this time he's reined in his talent for flashy color-driven visuals for the usual cloudy, bleached-out images we've come to expect when the subject is down-and-dirty L.A. Special note should be made of the cameo of singer/songwriter Macy Gray: she makes the most of her brief appearance, using unsteady hand movements and a fair amount of sass to create a vivid portrayal of a woman who knows she's being used by the police and who has no compunction about letting her feelings show--she has the best moment in the film and you end up wanting more.",

            "content": "Training Day is a fast paced maniacal, dirty, crude whirlwind that will leave you reflecting on how you would deal with the ambushes and immorality that Hoyt faced. Are you a wolf or are you a shepherd? Only a wolf can catch wolves. Alonzo's philosophy justified many of the actions he made, but clearly understood the type of person that he was and what he had become. We never knew if Alonzo actually was a good cop at the beginning of his career, but his personality is so crass, vulgar, and duplicitous one can only conclude that he was the crooked cop all along.Ethan as Hoyt gives a good performance as the rookie cop that is hopeful and morally driven. We get some slight instances of character development at the beginning of the movie that solidified his character, but he was largely able to carry himself the persona of authenticity and naivety that was needed for that role. He was continually manipulated by Alonzo and walked the fine line between being submissive and not being weak, excellently. The gestures offered by the movie were brilliant. Hoyt fought and restrained two homeless people that were attempting to rape a teenager, stark contrast to Alonzo just watching and then releasing them after giving them a severe and savage \"street\" lesson. We were reminded repeatedly the temperament and value structure of both Alonzo and Hoyt.The street smart is a recurrent theme in the movie. It was clear at the onset that Hoyt had to forget everything he heard in the academy and adapt to Alonzo's philosophy to be able to survive. I would say that the ability to connect with people on the streets gave Alonzo some needed advantage to be able to infiltrate the circles that he needed to police, but the clear issue was to not transform into those criminals, but, as he mentioned, he needed to become a wolf like them to be able to catch them. The fascinating part about this movie is the complexity and ruthlessness that the streets conditions are displayed for people that want to make a meaningful change. A clear quandary is presented to the viewer where we are invited to reflect on complex and innovative ways to understand the sadist, vicious, uncertain dynamics of the streets.Ultimately, the message sent by the movie is that corrupt cops will eventually get punished for their decisions. Alonzo was playing too many people and ended having no people he could trust or depend on. Hoyt was saved by the sole just action that he did the entire day, providential or maybe unlikely, but the movie teaches us that if anyone aims to construct any change, it cannot be done by a single person, and no one will trust to take that path with you if you continue being duplicitous.",

That said, he was still Denzel the charmer as Alonzo in Training Day. We even began to believe that he was redeemable after he shot the Scott Glenn character as he explaining that that sort of thing was a necessary evil. I was annoyed that Eva Mendes was nominated for an award for an appearance that lasted seconds over all. Also cameos from Snoop, Macy and Dr Dre were totally redundant and distracted this viewer. They really do not have the chops for parts like that. Ethan Hawke was terrific in this film too and was the perfect foil for Mr Washington. It has been a long time since I saw TD originally and it impressed me greatly then. The impact has not lessened over the years.",

The very first scene in which Denzel Washington's Alonzo appears, grabbed my attention and made me stand back and say \"Okay, I think I'm going to like this performance\". However, not only was I absolutely blown away by Mr. Washington's potrayl of a cooked cop, but I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable. Ethan Hawke was a perfect contrast to Washington, and the director and writer did a great job of capturing the feel of such a neighborhood.It's still hard for me to say that Russell Crowe did not deserve to win, however after seeing this movie and knowing what a great actor Mr. Washington is, I can honestly say that I have no complaint with his victory. It was a tough decision to make between the two, but in the end I am glad Mr. Washington got his Oscar.",

The weakness is that it seems a bit over the top for all those things to happen in less than 24 hours.Since Denzel Washington is in the film the acting is of course brilliant.

It's thought-provoking and disturbing.Denzel Washington won the best actor Oscar for this, and I can see why--he's utterly mesmerizing as Alonzo, the senior street narc. He's Satan in gangsta clothes: charming, sexy, seductive, manipulative, and larger than life. Ethan Hawke deserves credit for holding his own with Washington; a lot of other actors would have been blown off the screen, but we keep identifying with Hawke's ingenue Jake right up to the end of the film. Great use of authentic locations and lighting, and terrific supporting performances too.This was the best film of 2001 in my opinion.

Hawke is excellent in his role as the rookie caught up in a terrible world of police corruption and he is deserving of his Oscar nomination, perhaps deserved of the win. Denzel is superb though. His character is meaty, with this guy almost being a personification of evil while also having other personalities to him, a character who is almost trying to delude himself into thinking that he is an upholder of the law. Washington is amazing, this is one of the greatest bad guy performances ever. Denzel is like a firecracker, one minute he is exploding and showing off an alarming attitude towards policing and the next he is talking Hawkes character round, convincing him that what they do is right. He is so good he almost talks the audience round at the same time. Of course the film may seem very exaggerated in regards to the police corruption in LA (ten cops from each precinct can be charged with abusing their privileges and the law apparently!).

I've seen others of Fuqua's filmography and the likes of Southpaw were extremely entertaining and it seems he's had a long career of hits. Back to Training Day this is a masterpiece, straight from the get go you can relate to/empathise with Hawke's Jake Hoyt and he feels like a well defined and crystal clear character from the very first second, not a doubt in anyone's minds he's the hero of the film. A story of corruption is naturally interesting and I must say the performance by Washington deserves all the praise it gets as he falls into the group of villains which you truly despise, testament to his performance and the quality of the writing/directing. Baring some parallels finally to Se7en the grim depiction of the criminal underworld is full of life and looks realistic and dingy. As the titular 'Training Day' ensues and develops with Hoyt dragged into the shady dealings of Alonzo the tension ramps up and the stand off occurs, feeling organic and natural the division of our protagonists is understandable and feels genuine leading to the neighbourhood shootout and chase between the two leads, at times a little far fetched it's still gritty and heart pounding, concluding with Washington's iconic monologue and his exile from the neighbourhood. Boasting a cast of notable faces such as Cliff Curtis and Eva Mendez as well as a couple of celebrity cameos from Dr.Dre and Snoop Dogg who aren't actually bad actors this is a masterclass in conflict, tension and character, a true great of cinema",

Confidential' set in the early 50's and now 'Training Day' set half a century later in the early 21st century, we can see that people haven't changed one bit in all that time and have always been the same.  While the majority of police officers are honest and law abiding, 'Training Day' shows how one cop can do so much damage and that the crooked cop is worse than any criminal.  'Training Day' is designed to keep your stomach in knots from start to finish and features an Oscar calibre performance from Denzel Washington.  Ethan Hawke is the subject of Washington's training.  A veteran of the force, Washington takes Hawke in, trains him in the narcotics division of the LAPD and tries to justify criminal activity on the part of the police as a necessary part of nailing the bad guys and the film illustrates how corruption goes all the way to the top of the city's law enforcement officials.  'Training Day' has an exceptional look at street life with outstanding cinematography and editing and director Antoine Fuqua has crafted a film with exactly the right touch of violence and street smarts to match its intelligence and realistic look.

            "content": "What can I say Denzel is the MAN.  He just steals the show.Training Day focuses on Ethan Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt), a young LAPD cop.  He is on his first day to start off in a new position to work in the narcotics division.  Jake is eager, he tells his wife how excited and nervous he is for this assignment comparing it to first day of high school football tryouts.  Jake plays by the book, is intelligent and strong, but his world is about to be turned upside down by a hardcore veteran named Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington.Alonzo takes Jake on a ride of insanity through the drug plagued worlds of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in gritty Los Angeles.  Alonzo is hard, he is succesful and good at what he does, but he does things differently. Alonzo is essentialy a cop who makes his own rules, and this of course creates a conflict for Jake.  After a few minor routine assignments it's easy to see that Alonzo is dirty.  In short Alonzo's attitude to fighting crime is simple, to beat the street you have to be harder than the thugs and pushers who inhabit it.  But Alonzo has been doing this far too long and is in a lot of trouble.This movie COULD have been a bad exercise in good cop bad cop shlock.  But what evolves is a very well acted character study of 2 men with different views on how crime should be fought (in fact 2 polar extremes).  Denzel is masterful as Alonzo playing one of the most feared dirty cops I have ever seen on film, and Hawke as Jake does what he does well in most films, playing tormented characters caught in a bad situation and looking very shocked and perplexed.  There are great scenes of dialogue between the 2 such as when Alonzo asks why Jake wanted to join the squad.  Jake replies that he wants to get drugs off the streets and give something back to the community, and Alonzo only replies what is the real reason you joined narcotics?  Jake then says, \"Cause I want to make detective\".  It is this line that is the basis of Training Day.With that, director Antoine Fuqua's work of pictured gang plagued LA is masterful.  Black distraught neighborhoods, Hispanic tatooed thugs sitting around a card table,  Fuqua creates hell and shows it brilliantly.  There is some good cinematography and a good score (but used too infrequently) creating a nightmarish uneasyness.  It's also wonderful to see Denzel play a bad guy for a change and play it sooooo well.  When Alonzo is interogating suspects you can't help but squirm in your seat while you watch him on screen.The film tries to tie in a plot, so that it can create a conclusion in the end.  It isn't that distracting or even neccesary but it only shows the inevitable of Alonzo's work.  The film ends unresolved and this is good, because the film isn't about the good guy winning and the bad guy getting his just desserts, it's about how 2 men of different moral belief try to survive and do what is right.  There are no heroes in this film, just great characters.While the use of placing 2 well known rap starts in cameo rolls, 1 Snoop Doggy as a wheelchair pushing crack dealer [good acting], 2 Dr Dre. as a cop henchman for Alonzo [bad acting], was really unnecesary.  While Snoop holds his own in the spotlight Dre's acting is just so canned.  Minor points, but I'd EASILY recommend this for Denzel's performance alone.Rating 8 out of 10.",

Also Ethan Hawke's characters is not subdued, in fact, Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt) while being sensitive and moral, is at the same intense level as Denzel Washington's.You can't write a review, without describing the plot.The story is very real and vivid. It concerns a rookie cop (Hawke) who is assigned to a veteran narcotics cop named Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).During hia first few days on the job. Hoyr observes how Harris does his job of busting crooks and drug dealers. Alonzo is like a Dirty Harry movie, everyone in the city knows who he is and is scared to death of the gritty cop.However, underneath, that great cop lies a crooked, corrupt policeman who is playing both sides of the law....This is Denzel Washington best role ever, and I hope he wins the Oscar over that little wimp Russell Crowe.Ethan Hawke is also great as Jake Hoyt. In fact both actors have been nominated for their roles in the movie.I just checked out the DVD, and it's absolutely fantastic!!!Movie of the year, hands down.",

            "content": "Actors seem to enjoy playing \"bad\" people and Denzel is so bad here, he becomes a caricature: a slick mix of all those power hungry LA cops you hear about too much in the news. His performance is riveting, he's a scumbag yes, but who would want to watch this more than once?  Ethan Hawke's role was the tougher of the 2 leads, I felt, because he had to play a person who is all too rare in Hollywood these days: someone with a strong moral center. We feel all his pain and disgust and finally his anger, and we root for him, even with the cliched script. Hawke deserved his supporting nomination since he truly went thru an emotional gamut from beginning to end. Denzel pretty much stayed the same: remaining a scurvy villain in every scene, even if, one is apt to say, his job created his behavior as much as his own greed did. Feeling powerless to change society, he in turn becomes just as warped and destroyed as the people he's trying to put away. Too bad the screenplay takes the issue of powerlessness and turns it into an action picture. This could have been real compelling with a more careful writer. Instead we get Denzel as evil cartoon and an Oscar to show much Hollywood loves evil cartoons. Harvey Kietel excelled with more complexity in the Bad Lieutenant some years before in the 90's, with complicated religious overtones thrown into the mix to make a riveting but overlooked  film experience that was hardly given a chance at the box office. See that for a more realistic look at corruption and authority and view Training Day one time to debate why Denzel has the gold statue and Kietel does not.",

He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are. Definitely not a film for anyone under seventeen, and not only is there some substance abuse, nudity, language, adult subject matter, and violence, but there is also some scenes that are very heavy to handle.Good performance though, and again...I loved it because I hated it.",

He exudes danger and that's why he won the Oscar. He flipped everyone with this choice of roles. This movie could have easily been straight to video but how does a straight to video movie get a cast like this? I don't know but we can start by handing off kudos to David Ayer, screenwriter. Antoine Fuqua, director. You more than made up for that piece of splatch, Replacement Killers. Ethan Hawke, supporting role. You held your own and you definitely got the magic eye.

The movie compensates its poor scenario by a wave of violence and insults. If the US are really like that then it is difficult to understand why anybody would like to immigrate over there. What comes out of the movie is not so much the fact that the nice cop wins but more how poor and miserable the US are. Indeed, not only is the movie showing drugs, violence, alcohol, etc. but it also reveals that 99.9% of Americans are only interested in money.

It was a very easy movie to watch; the dialog went smooth and fast, the clips of gangsta rap and mood of the music was spot-on, and the acting was as bombastic as the characters were written. Also the directing by Antoine Fuqua (Replacement Killers, Tears of the sun...after Training Day) couldn't have been more brilliant and full of visual changes for the audience.Basically, Ethan Hawke plays a new NARC on the beat. He doesn't know what to expect out of Denzel Washington's character except that he is his trainer and an experienced detective. Denzel meticulously plans his real-life curriculum for Hawke to learn, and since Denzel's character is known in the surrounding neighborhoods as a detective who cuts deals with potential rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, he pushes buttons all throughout the neighborhood, brandishing Hawke as his proteg\u00e9. When Hawke continues to see shady deal after shady deal, he begins to suspect that Washington is up to something but cannot place what it is. It comes down to the end when Hawke must choose what he was taught in the ethics training of the other policemen or what Denzel's character allows him to get away with on the street.There is not enough praise to give the actors and actresses, including Eva Mendes as Washington's girlfriend stuck in the ghetto with her son. I'm not particularly fond of Ethan Hawke in the action roles (to me, he looks kind of fake and unbelievable), but in this movie, there seems to be plenty going on to forget this small mirage. And Denzel was spectacular; he had this character down pact. He loves playing the same types of roles, but this one was almost written for him because of the delivery and positioning that he displays every time the camera is on him.The Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre appearances didn't need to be there, but there's no doubt about the power of being the director's friends. Snoop was better than Dre, I think, mainly because he was given more of a character to portray (while placed in a wheelchair of all things for the most notable cool-cat in rapping business). But other than their puzzling cameos, the movie does great to entertain and keep you guessing every bit of the way.I gave it a 7/10 because it doesn't have the look about a classic film and to constantly watch it, it would get tedious, but the feel and look of the whole thing keeps you entertained for a few watches. It's worth the buy, but rent it first to get a deeper story to see if it's your type of action/cop drama movie.",

In Training Day he plays Alonzo Harris the cop you'd just have to hate, unless you were as corrupt and violent as this mean b*****d is. But then he has locked away a good many criminals.He takes into his charge young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who hopes to make it into Alonzo's elite drug squad and in one rather hectic day shows Jake the ropes. `To protect the sheep you gotta kill the wolf and it takes a wolf to kill the wolf,' is Alonzo's mantra and he belts Jake about both morally and physically, in the name of justice, L.A. cop styleI hated Training Day for nearly all of its length but certainly not because it's a poorly made movie. It's just that it painted such an unrelenting picture of nastiness, selfishness and thuggery, and presented this message strongly as being the only right, proper and effective way of dealing with Alonzo's environment.  The softer side of me just screamed for civility, niceness and the rule of law.But not Alonzo's street law. If the world is or might become really like this, especially in my town, well, we'd be in big trouble.Bad, vigilante cop movies aren't rare. Training Day is a beauty though, graced with a very good cast, a strong if erratic script from David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, U-571) and exciting direction from Antoine Fuqua (Bait, The Replacement Killer).The performances are remarkable especially from Denzel Washington who discards that kind, lovable, demeanour of his to show just how terrific is his acting ability. Ethan Hawke complements Washington and that's a complement.Cameo's from Snoop Dogg and in particular Macy Gray as an embittered housewife are very strong as is Scott Glenn's as former cop Roger.Training Day often stretches credibility, particularly in it's final stages, but its intensity overcomes those sorts of reservations.  It's not the sort of film I'd recommend for entertainment. If you enjoy tension and fine performances and you can take violence not too far to heart then Training Day could fuel your passions.3 Well Trained Flys Out of Five",

Training Day is an account of life both for a cop working the rough streets of LA and also if you do your research you learn that it also involves real crips,bloods and various other gangs with their input which means that you get an authentic taste of what life is like for those living and growing up in one of these rough hoods. What makes Alonso Harris scar your mind is that he is not your average Dirty Harry wannabe but he is more like a resourceful , intelligent street wise cop with his Jekell/Hyde tendency's which makes him a joy to watch and no one could of carried this of in style like Denzel.

For the first half of the film, he keeps us wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy, in spite of his unorthodox methods. He's actually seems like both. Sometimes he's charming; other times, he's outright despicable. It take a skillful actor to pull off a role like this.Ethan Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, Harris' white rookie partner on his first day as a narcotics cop, is convincing as he wrestles with his concepts of right and wrong--enforcing the law or stooping to the level of the criminals he's dealing with. Alonzo puts him through his paces, big time.The second half of the film goes into dissipation. As Alonzo's actions become increasingly over the top and corrupt, Hoyt, finds himself descending into is own kind of vigilantism. In the ending of the film, his decision to \"do the right thing\" is not only misguided, but it causes Alonzo's demise. Ironic.All through the film, I kept wondering how these two cowboys got away with all this stuff without any other cops or their superior officers knowing about it. Pretty hard to swallow. There's one brief scene with Alonzo having lunch with some high ranking police officials who are clearly indifferent to the law, but it's not enough to answer the question of why the two cops are completely unsupervised.The film is fast moving and captivating and will keep you watching, but the final scenes descend into a typical violent Hollywood shootout that rivals Bonnie and Clyde. This movie could have had a better ending. It just \"drops dead,\" if you'll pardon the expression. And it doesn't answer the moral question that it raised in the first place. If the middle had been cut shorter, there could have been a better resolution at the end. What became of Hoyt? What about the investigation of the shootout? We get nothing but death and final credits.Still, it's worth a watch for two good performances, excellent camera work, and the questions it raises about police ethics (or lack of them).",

Surely not! Oh yes.

He is very naive though, Olonzo shows him what it's really like to be on the streets etc. and things get a little bit dodgy to say the least.Good plot structure and two very confident performance's - especially Washington, he is ELECTRIC on screen - make this a great thriller to watch. Hawke puts in a great performance (not a big fan of him, but this film might just make me see his other films!).

Given free rein (both to act and to police), Alonzo (Washington) is a swearing, day-drinking narcotics officer playing close to the edge of lawfulness, often opting to bend the rules in order to impose just punishments. His new protege, the stereotypically naive and one-dimensional Jake (Ethan Hawke) is necessary for the plot, but arguably offers little in acting.Taking place over Jake's first day under Alonzo's watch, Training Day tackles a cop's conflict with doing what is right. Alonzo spends most of his time brandishing weapons or using suspect techniques to gain information, whereas Jake is the puritan rookie, playing exclusively by the book. The deeper Jake follows Alonzo, the more he understands how Alonzo has lost his focus, his morals, and his entitlement to wear the badge.Training Day is fun, there is no question. Watching this gun-toting narco detective sleaze around LA is amusing, whilst also hitting hard when Denzel delivers his lines to a tee. Hawke does his best, but is forgettable really; a conduit for the story, his character is often grating and irritating, but does what is required.Training Day is not a new idea - we've seen rogue cops and LA gangs before - but it does nail the core principle: something that is fun to watch, without entering incredulity. A leading man like Denzel (giving one of his best performances) does this film only good, and is definitely one to watch if you aren't looking for a serious cinematic commitment. - HLO",

            "content": "I'll start by saying I really enjoyed \"Training Day\". It was certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in this first month-and-a-bit of the cinema year. I'm going to recommend it, with a little bit of caution, and here's why:Firstly big respect to Denzel Washington. Usually he's playing the underdog and we're rooting for him. He's constantly getting the nice guy role and so it's extremely refreshing to see him play the corrupt cop here. His character - Alonzo Harris - isn't necessarily evil, he's just deciding to do a delicate balance of crime and punishment. He takes freely from the scum he prosecutes and has no qualms about doing so. In playing this character Washington is allowed to show far more versatility than his works normally allow. He works well with his attitude to new rookie cop Jake Hoyt (played admirably by Ethan Hawke). Hawke wants to do well on his first day, his \"training day\" but can't stomach Harris' morale scruples. There is a great line of tension between the two that develops more as the movie progresses.It is the plot, if anything, that lets the movie sag a little. For the most part it's predictable and Ayer, at one very tense moment, uses a poorly scripted coincide to back himself out of a sudden ending. The actual end to the movie is also foreseen and, for that, is somewhat disappointing. It might have been nicer to go a different route but I guess some elements of formula must be adhered to. Having said that there's some great lines of dialogue as Harris convinces Hoyt that the way the world *really* works is not as simple as Hoyt would like to believe and that there is a certain \"survival of the fittest\" element you must follow. The cop's corruption - in particular the first middle-of-movie-3rd-act climax - is quite harrowing and sharply executed.Antoine Fuqua does a nice job of realizing the script he's working from. The fight scenes, for example, pack - pun intended - a lot of punch. You can feel the pain of the blows. The camera-work generally succeeds without having to be overly intrusive. The lighting is generally subdued even during high noon - adding to the movie's generally bleak outlook and feel and the score never over-plays any sentimental or aggressive moments.Overall I really quite enjoyed \"Training Day\" and found it a cut above the average buddy-cop flick. With some good performances, a (generally) sharp script and some fine directing I'd give it a 7.5/10 which is well above average for me.",

It's not a bad premise, really, since we all want that kind of security for our loved ones.His first day in the \"narc\" division is, shall we say, an eye opener.

I really can't believe that all of the \"bad cops\" were willing to let Hawke walk out of there.  Washington was the ring leader, but I don't think any man has that kind of control over everyone like that.  True, I'm not from the streets, but this ain't the nineties, anymore.  You can't control how I feel!  Denzel being the boss, or not, if someone with Hawke's character were in the position to put me away for a very long time, I would make very sure that he was on my side.

That's the beauty of it, we are so deep with this characterand we can see his madness and his end with some understanding and acceptance.Indeed this is one of Denzel Washington's excellent-steadyperformance. His stare, his goove, his move, indeed casting himin this movie is the best thing the producer have done. And for Ethan Hawke, okay, he's there the way he's suppose to be,the usual boyish purity and idealism.

I won't say too much more about the plot but I must say that both actors play their roles very well; Hawke is very subdued while Washington is completely over the top. The movie moves at a satisfyingly quick pace and keeps you hooked right until the very end.

Well, it's been in theaters for over a month now and I just got around to seeing it yesterday.  What the hell took me so long?  Anyway,  I'm sure that most everyone bothering to read this knows the basic plot of this brilliant action movie (a rare breed) but I'm gonna do a quick rundown without spoiling anything.  Rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is starting his first day on the job with leather-clad, veteran, city-reknowned all around badass Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).  Things start off uneasy and the director does one hell of a job at making you feel the rookie's nervousness.  In fact, you're sitting there wondering why in the hell this baby-faced nice guy wants to be a narc so bad.  It's really simple;  he wants to protect and serve and be one of the good guys.  That's all.  Needless to say, throughout the course of the day, Mr. Hoyt may very well decide that being a narc just isn't his cup of tea.  But things aren't going to be that simple.You see, Hoyt is about to get way more than he bargained for.  Alonzo Harris is one badass, crooked, filthy and downright mean guy, but yet he has an irresistable charm that makes you want to like him. Through him, we learn along with Hoyt, that everything he previously learned about being a cop is wrong and \"to catch the wolf, you must become the wolf\".  This is one of those parts that I SWEAR had to have been written with just one actor in mind.  I say this because I can't think of anyone else who could've pulled the part off, except maybe for Samuel L. Jackson.  This is, in my mind, the best and most challenging role that Ethan Hawke has ever played.  He does a damn fine job at showing all the right emotions and the transformation from vulnerable do-gooder, to hardened-vet over the course of 24 hours (!) is made wholly believable.  Denzel Washington plays TOTALLY against type and gives one hell of a knockout performance as the ruthless badass who may have once been a good cop.  (I know I keep using that word a lot to describe him, just see the movie.)  I really loved the wolf-metaphor that he kept using it was perfect. I give Training Day A perfect 10 here and I will be getting the DVD.  Let's see Mr. Washington in more roles like this.  One more thing. I was really glad to see Scott Glenn.  He's highly underrated.",

The character is not unlike Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle; at first he walks a *very* narrow line between sanity and madness, and to his credit he does a fairly good job (up to a point) in barely keeping himself on the right side. We may not like him, or approve of his actions, but we accept him as he is, as well as the fact that he has reasons for what he does that seem perfectly logical and sensible to him.Some critics have been hard on Ethan Hawke, probably because Washington outshines him. That's missing the point. The Hawke character's purpose in the film is to provide a foil, a contrast to his partner's insanity. They are complete opposites, and it's interesting to notice that while Hawke is more idealistic and \"upright,\" he's also a bit naive, and tends to see things in black and white. Washington, on the other hand, perceives the world in shades of gray. While that's probably the more accurate and balanced outlook, he simply goes too far, and pays the price.Is the ending a bit overdone? Yes, it is, but no one will deny it's effective. It was inevitable that his actions would backfire on him. As the film proceeds, he descends further and further into his self-created morass. There is a point in the film where it is immediately apparent that he has finally reached critical mass, and there's no turning back. I was reminded of the Biblical proverb, \"He who lives by the sword dies by the sword.\" The wisdom of that statement is all too apparent when applied to the character.*** (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.",

It's not perfect and there are some plot holes ( which most of the complaints don't even touch), but even though it's entertaining. And definitely not the worst movie like some say. Of course there were movies about \"bad cop - good cop\" , but not in this scheme. I think it had even some originality in it. And if you don't like Violence in movies - don't see it. But don't say you hate this movie because of the violence. Training Day's genre is violence. Finally to the character of Alonzo. I honestly think that Russel Crow should have the Oscar. He had a much deeper character to portray (in Beautiful mind), and did an excellent job with it. Nevertheless, the character of Alonzo was about one of the worst kind of people that there are on earth ( and if you see some documentary investigation, you understand that such people exist). Don't complain that you didn't like the character, I hated him either, that's why I think Denzel Washington made a great effort. Some credit to Ethan Hawke also.Some holes in the plot: 1) I think the most visible one, and the most annoying is the one-to-million coincidence of Lisa being the cousin of Smiley. What chances that Lisa's wallet would save Hoyt? 2) Hoyt isn't used to narcotics and we see it on the effect the drugs have on him. But so strong of an effect should have take longer in time to recover from it. 3) After Smiley releases Jake he immediately goes to Alonzo's house. How did he remember where Alonzo lives? He couldn't remember it from one ride being on narcotics. 4) At the end of the movie Hoyt got serious beating from Alonzo. He was face smashed through the window, got hit with a chair, kicked and punched and after all that he managed to stand back and ready to fight again in a couple of minutes.As I said. This movie is flawed, but still entertaining.",

            "content": "Denzel Washington took home a well-deserved Oscar for this performance. He seemed to absolutely relish the part of the brutal, corrupt cop. Tremendous job. The movie, however, left some things to be desired. My first thought, early in the movie, when Denzel puts a gun to Ethan Hawke's head to force him to smoke a bowl of PCP-laced grass, would have been to get out of the car, hitch a ride back to my precinct, turn him in, and go back to my previous patrol job. I would not have found that particular experience very acceptable. Just not very believable for me. Well, okay, I was willing to put that aside. Ethan Hawke's character is very ambitious, and he wants to be part of this narcotics unit, so he probably accepts this act as something that may help him in the mean streets ahead. Later, Denzel leaves Hawke vulnerable with a bunch of thugs who decide to kill him. Just as they have him in a bathtub, and a shotgun in his face, ready to pull the trigger, they go through his pockets, and find a pink wallet, which Hawke had picked up earlier in the movie saving a girl about to be raped in an alley. Of course, the wallet belonged to the girl and, wouldn't you know, the girl just happened to be the niece of one of the guys about to kill him. Pretty convenient, huh? Again, not very believable.A movie about a brutal, corrupt cop training a young rookie just going about the every day work of narcotics officers may have been enough to make this an outstanding movie, but there were far too many odd twists, convenient coincidences, and weird peripheral characters (Russian Mobsters, no less) that made this a rather disappointing movie overall. Nothing can take away from the performance of Washington, though. He nailed his character right down the line. He was frightening, charming, inspiring, repulsive, brutal and charismatic, sometimes all at once. An exceptional acting performance.",

I've been impressed with his work for many years. Arguably, with some exceptions, his presence in a bad movie, can raise the rating of a movie a few notches. I don't believe \"Training Day\" was a great crime drama. There were some glaring plot contrivances and a number of underwritten supporting characters made me wonder if David Ayer's screenplay wasn't thought out in its entirety. Despite those flaws, there was a lot to admire in the movie: Denzel's outstanding, charismatic performance as the rogue L.A. detective, Ethan Hawke's fine supporting role as the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 caught in a very dangerous corruption web and Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction of the most important characters: the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Did Denzel Washington deserve the Oscar for this performance? I still say no. I preferred his performances in \"Malcolm X\" and \"The Hurricane\". (Of course, Al Pacino deserved it for \"The Godfather Part II\" and/or \"Serpico\" and not \"Scent of a Woman\" and Russell Crowe deserved it for \"The Insider\" and/or \"A Beautiful Mind\" and not \"Gladiator\" and, personally, I thought Tom Wilkinson gave the best performance this past year for \"In The Bedroom\". But the decisions have been made, they won't be changed in the record books and there will always be disputes on who should win an award for which film. Digression is over. Goodbye!)",

            "content": "This movie is about a na\u00efve cop Jake, played by Ethan Hawke, on his first day as a narcotic officer, being trained by the dirty corrupt guy who runs it, Alonzo, played by Denzel Washington.  His character is so evil, sinister, and every other bad characteristic that you could think of, he has it, including openly flaunting his infidelity.  It is to the point where if you want anything bad to happen to anyone on the film, it would be him instead of the guys committing the crimes.  But at the same time, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, believing that he is some sort of demagogue.  Denzel is very good in portraying all that in this character, that is, everything except for any redeeming characteristics. Some other parts are a little more unbelievable, like Alonzo letting Jake in on his secret dirty dealing, not even knowing if Jake will be openly receptive to the assassination and looting of drug money that he and his gang regularly enrich themself with, then putting Jake on the quandary of coming on board or snitch and be blamed for the whole thing.  I would assume if they want to introduce someone into their inner circle, they should either be receptive or do not object to such dealings.  The other cops on Alonzo's team seem to be characters straight out of some illicit gang, with more criminal than law enforcement attitude and personality.  Others issues includes the cardboard cutout characters of the dirty politician and DA. They are like a pack of crooks who has nothing in common except for their corrupt dealings.  Looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, it was good of them to delete the last scene where they collectively go to Jake's residence for the loot that he took from Alonzo.  The ending is also over the top, with the faceoff between the two cops in the street, with Alonzo's street homies not coming to his aid, instead letting them two take it out mano-a-mano, including sliding a gun to him when he didn't have one. I guess at the end, Alonzo knew it its over for him, having messed around with some people even above this demagogue's head.  So instead of running, he is accepting fate. Despite the movie's flaws, it is still a gritty hard look at the dirty side of undercover police world.",

            "content": "Films about police corruption are commonplace, but it's interesting to watch a film where the police become corrupted as a result of fighting an unwinnable war on the streets (a war that is unwinnable as seen in 'Traffic'), resorting to crooked methods/heavy handed tactics in their war against drugs. I enjoyed the interplay between Alonzo (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), their obvious clash of ideals/brutal cynicism and the early scenes are probably the strongest in the film. Hoyt's druggy trip almost reflects the murky, blurred world that he now finds himself inhabiting. The film has two main plotlines (police corruption, & the Russian mafia seeking vengeance) which eventually come together but I feel this is where the film  loses its hold on reality and descends into farce and implausibilty. If only the film perhaps had concentrated on the theme of police corruption, the possible consequences etc. The scenes & dialogue where Alonzo & Hoyt argue their feelings (wolves & sheep) are excellent. On the one hand, we can sympathise somewhat with Alonzo - the ugly war against drugs is stacked in favour of the criminals - yet most of us would probably identify with Hoyt's opinion. It's a morally grey area which should have been examined more.Because the film sadly descends into a simplistic confrontation between good & evil. It is very easy to criticise but I'd preferred a story that made Alonzo examine himself & question what he has become. Instead he becomes a pantomine villain - boo, hiss, he's behind you!The performances were good esp in the beginning where the actors were given the opportunity 'to act' rather than wrestle with each other. Washington is charismatic - I loved his opening gambit where,impatient with Hoyt's talking as he reads his paper, he orders him to 'entertain' him. Some critics have accused Washington of 'hamming' in this role, but I thought he was good as the police officer corrupted by his sense of power. His role, away from his usual type cast, is reminiscent of Richard Gere's impressive turn as a corrupt policeman in 'Internal Affairs' - a film which is much more psychological and the better for it.An interesting premise, but the final twenty minutes disappoint and let's the whole film down.",

            "content": "The most salient component in \u0091Training Day' is the intensity that stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke bring to the screen. Director Antoine Fuqua presents his third and best film yet that weaves a simple yet effective tale of human tragedy and morality. Fuqua's first cinematic foray was the ill-received \u0091The Replacement Killers'. In the film he proved he was a student of the art in which he displayed his flair for John Woo style visuals in this Honk Kong-type action flick starring Chow Yun Fat.  From then on he went on to make \u0091Bait' a so-called action comedy that failed on almost every level. In this; his most mature film as of yet, he tones down his visuals and uses Washington's acting capabilities to the fullest capacity to create a rich, character driven film that is taut and tense. \u0091Training Day' is exactly what the title describes it as. The film unravels within the span of one full day and brings us into the heart of police corruptibility. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a former rookie uniform officer on his first day in the narcotics department. Heading this department is Washington who portrays Alonzo Harris; a deviant and ruthless corrupt cop who has crossed the line of morality. Within a span of one day, Hoyt is literally \u0091thrown into the fire' as he is exposed to the dark underbelly of the Los Angeles Police Department Narcotics Unit while being \u0091trained' by Harris.      Without spoiling the simple yet efficient script, these two men deliver great performances that catapult this otherwise regular film into a good film. Within the span of one day, Hoyt is exposed to massive gunplay, violent attacks, crooked drug dealers (such as Snoop Dogg), a loud-mouthed drug haven (Macy Gray) and plenty of foul language as Hoyt must come to terms with the disparaging image that being a cop is not all it was supposed to be. In terms of performances, this film packs it in mainly due to Washington's villainous turn as a cop who has crossed the line and who is attempting to  recruit  others with him. A welcome note is Hawke's turn as a young cop who holds his own against Washington in some tight and well acted scenes that add a certain level of intensity that completely captivate the audience. In addition to all this, a refreshing angle in this film is that unlike other films, we see the relationship between our \u0091hero' and \u0091villain' (notice the quotation marks) build up, blossom, and deteriorate before our very eyes. This leaves the relationship unmasked and we as the viewers get to experience  first hand the detrimental characteristics of this unconventional relationship.      As for the direction of this film, I mentioned it earlier. It is a substantial step in terms of Fuqua's respectability factor. Finally he won't have to be ashamed of one of the movies he has done. It is imperative to note that this is not an action film, nor a thriller. It is a pure dramatic piece that pits both antagonist and protagonist against one another that is highlighted by well-written scenes and great acting.      Screenwriter David Ayer creates a fairly decent script that allows the audience to view a first hand glimpse at the audacity and cunningness of Washington's character. Furthermore, those of us who have seen the film know that there is a subplot that pits Washington against a deadline that forces our villain to commit these protruding acts all within the span of one day. This allows the audience to also view what means he takes to achieve an end. Without saying too much, Hoyt is exposed to the easy way to making Detective and the normal, arduous task that is of the legal and rewarding manner. In terms of its' worthiness as a film, it surprises on many levels. Perhaps due to low expectations this was a surprise but make no mistake \u0096 this is a well-made film that tells  a tale with a surprising amount of intensity, tension and with an interesting graphic resolution.\nGiancarlo's rating: **1/2",

            "content": "Audiences looking for a big, mindless, action-driven cop flick in Training Day will be surprised by two things: director Antoine Fuqua, who made the dismally mediocre Jaime Foxx vehicle, \"Bait\", has molded an adult, tense, mature, and engrossing action-drama, and two, Denzel Washington has eschewed his good guy persona, playing a charismatic but unlikable rogue cop.While the story of corrupt cops lurking in the police department may be done to death, a certain timeliness is present with such stories as the recent LAPD Rampart scandal.  Ethan Hawke plays a rookie-cop who hopes to work his way up the rungs of the LAPD to detective by working with seasoned undercover narcotics cop Washington.  Washington proves, however, to have questionable methods of investigation and procedure.  Hawke unwittingly is drawn into the sickly logical and charasmatic musings of Washington until he ends up unwittingly becoming a participant in a coverup.Again, the story has been done before, but rarely has it been tackled with such a tense, uneasy, and guttural realism.  Director Antoine Fuqua injects the film with a searing authenticity: LA hasn't been such an uninviting. dangerous, ugly urban jungle in a while, with bleak, rainy shots of the city swimming in dirt, litter, and graffiti. The use of realistic looking and acting gang members, and also the cameo appearances of rap stars helps keep tensions high as well, and also adds striking resonance.\nAnchoring the whole movie is Denzel Washington, in a refreshing change from his usual upstanding, righteous roles.  As the corrupt cop, he gleefully goes for broke in a manic, antihero, larger-than-life performance so unlike his previous work that it will surely garner him an Oscar nomination.\nWhile the last 15 minutes almost undo the fantastic work by the cast and crew, Training Day is an accomplished renewal in the cop movie genre, a promising feature in Fuqua's career, and another great performance under Denzel Washington's belt.8 out of 10",

After a couple of viewings, you can really see the evil plan that is churning in Washington's head, and what seemed good for upping `street IQ' was just part of the ongoing  scheme to bring down Hawke.  In short, a must see film.  By the way, why was there such a big deal about Washington being  a `bad guy'?

            "content": "All of the buzz is true! Denzel Washington's performance in this movie is amazing. This marks his first time as a `bad guy' and he plays it so well. The film is about a lowly suburban traffic cop named Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), who gets his `break' by getting a chance to prove himself as a narc for a day under the supervision of Alonzo Harris (Washington), a shady vet cop whose undercover tactics are less than conventional. They drive around the rough parts of LA in Alonzo's low-rider Monte Carlo going from one questionable `bust' to another. Alonzo sets up Jake by making him smoke some confiscated  PCP-laced marijuana that taints his blood, leaving Alonzo open to changing his story and having Jake as his pawn. Jake quickly sees that this is not the kind of law enforcement that he bargained for, but is stuck with him in every scary moment, at least for the `training day'. While Alonzo runs in a ring of rouge cops, he is not flawless in his procedures. He has some high-ranking city officials behind him, who quickly lose faith in him when he screws up a job in Las Vegas (which is never really explained too well). Jake must then try to get himself out of a bad situation, which only grows worse as the day goes on. Director Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') does a great job of keeping the steady pace of the film and keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat. Showing his music video director cred, artists like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray find parts in the film as well, but not as silly cameos. The writing is top notch and the good cop/bad cop angles are grittier than ever. While Washington has Oscar buzz all around him, it seems unlikely that a movie like this would get nominated, even with his superb performance. It is not a perfect movie and it's not your `traditional' red carpet Oscar contender. But as usual, Denzel never disappoints. For the viewer, this is definitely worth the money to catch it in the theater. Although the violence may be sensitive for some viewers right now, most people should be able to take it for what it is: a good action flick with great acting.",

            "content": "SPOILERS ALERT I am glad the Denzel won his first best actor Oscar. I could think of other roles he has played more deserving of accolades. Fair enough, he does a fine job here.The problem with this movies is not the acting, though Ethan Hawke is no giant. The problem with this movie is the writing.I will give this movies top marks for disturbing imagery, and its hyper-adrenaline feel. But some things just do not make sense in the plot.Denzel's character plays a street-wise narcotics cop, tough as coffin nail, always one step ahead of everyone. Ethan Hawke is a boy scout of uniform cop, that is on his first training day with Denzel.We the audience are then taking for a ride. Denzel puts the rookie through hell, and we squirm watching.He talks/tricks the newbie into smoking pcp, drinking beer, and pocketing confiscated money. If that doesn't push your sense of disbelief, Denzel, then shows him his personal whore, and bastard son. To cap off a typical LAPD first day, training day, Denzel then introduces Hawke's character to three high ranking government officials, all who reveal their high level corruption in casual conversation. From these three they get permission to murder a major drug dealer, and split four million dollars in drug money.When Hawke's character refuses to go along after the murder, Denzel then tricks him into going to a rat's nest of gangsters, abandoning him to be murdered by the gang.At this point we have to figure Hawke's character as a very stupid man.Yet after he is released by the gangsters( for saving the leader's cousin that morning)he stalks Denzel at his whore's apartment, and get's the drop on him.After the completely predictable long fight scene between Denzel, and Hawke, Denzel is confronted by all the gang members that he previously owned, and Hawke is allowed to escape. Instead of killing Denzel they just stare at him as though they very disappointed in him, and go home.In the end, Denzel is killed by some Russians, whom we have never seen before in the movie.Just a few holes in the plot?",

            "content": "SPOILERS\"Training Day\" opens strong. Here you had Jake, a guy who finds himself in this terrible situation. He wants to make detective and work narcotics, so he must spend a day in the field getting some \u0091real world' training with a hardened LAPD legend. You see this big brother/little brother dynamic develop between the two. Jake wants to impress this guy more than anything, but soon realizes he's in for more than he ever imagined.Who was it that said, the audience doesn't want to see the second worst day of a guy's life? Well, what a day this ends up being for Jake Hoyt. Ethan Hawke gives this great multi-leveled performance. There's two main things he needs to accomplish: be scared of Alonzo and hide that fear from Alonzo. \u0091It's just one day,' he must be thinking to himself, \u0091I can get through this.'The film does not build on this promise, but ends up being an unintentional sermon. I never like to feel like I'm being preached to while watching a film. \"Training Day\" claims to know the answers to the questions it poses. Films shouldn't do that. Make the audience think but let them make up their own minds.The cause of this problem is the character of Alonzo Harris. I was disappointed that this guy ended up really being bad. This is a case of a plot twist gone wrong.  While it's admirable that Denzel didn't demand that the writers change the story so his character seems more heroic, the way many stars have, I almost wished they'd gone that route, if only just a little.We're never given a reason to feel sympathetic toward Alonzo. First we think he's a jerk. Then we find out he's really an evil person. The plot features this double fake-out that starts with him going psycho on a couple of would-be rapists. At this point you're thinking, they're messing with our heads. Soon we're going to see that Alonzo isn't such a bad guy. But the story just keeps pouring it on: Evil, evil, evil. This translated into boring, boring, boring.By the time the film got to the business with the three wise men and Alonzo's 'posse,' followed by the revelation that Jake's been set up the entire time, I was no longer involved. I was no longer relating to Jake's character but was just along for the ride, merely curious about what happened next.The card game scene is great and could have saved this film's behind. It's ruined by a coincidence that asks more from the audience's suspension of disbelief than it should. I mean, his cousin? Out of how many millions of people in Los Angeles? Is that supposed to be ironic? It's not even the coincidence that bugs me the most; it's that the scene it's meant to be the payoff of, the scene that had been the most interesting and intense in the film, ends with a big thud.\"Training Day\" is another one of those films I wish had taken a different course. At the beginning you're thinking it's going to be about this wide-eyed rookie learning the hard lessons of the 'real' world. But not long into the story it becomes apparent that the film isn't based on any reality at all. It becomes this typical cop thriller with corrupt cops and evil Russian mafia guys. Isn't there enough moral tests in the real struggles of an undercover narcotics officer that they could have built a story around? It's as if no one involved in the film knew anything about narcotics investigation, so they had to resort to this theoretical crap that's straight out of \"Tango and Cash.\"Grade: C",

            "content": "I had read lots of great reviews on this title but unfortunately I have to admit that I was disappointed after watched it. Denzel Washington gave a strong performance as usual but I think for the very first time in his career played a negative African - American role. Ethan Hawke was surprisingly great at his role although his role did not have much of affection to show just many physical action. you may think if the performances were good then how come you did not like it ! Answer to that question is simple , it takes more than just big names or good performances to make a movie that everybody can connect to. the most important element is the story. unfortunately the story of the Training day was kind of childish, very unreal and raw! the writers had to cook the story more and answer basic questions on the minds of the audience about the sequences of the movie. for example we never realized who were those Latino guys ? who was Eva Mendez , a girl Washington sleeps with , a whore or his wife ? why didn't anybody help Washington in the neighborhood? The biggest turn off for me was the scene where Hawke shot Washington! it was so unreal! first of all , in real life LAPD guys are trained to shoot and they don't flirt with the suspect just like Hawke did with Washington , they count to 3 or maximum of 5 and then boom they shoot! they don't wait for your bullshit ! second of all , in real life and in an African - American neighborhood no White has the balls to stand with a gun in his hand shooting another African American while he does not have ANYTHING to show that he is a cop! Another questionable scene was at the same moment , when Hawke was going away with the money , Washington who was shot in the butt was jumping up and down ! who on earth can even stand with a bullet in his butt ???? Or how strong a very average and kind of slim man like Hawke can be to survive all that punches he got from Washington , jumping down from a building and still being the tough guy and standing on his feet and giving the bad guy to justice ! I know it's just a movie but , what I'm trying to say is : entertain us , don't ridicule us!",

            "content": "Young police officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) tries to prove himself to a senior cop, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), to be admitted into his narcotic unit in LAPD in his first day. The whole story takes place in just one day but what a day that is! From the beginning to the end, they witness all kinds of criminal events as they cruise down the back streets of Los Angeles. Jake is a straight arrow and completely honest, yet equally na\u00efve. Throughout the day, he desperately tries to handle the situations he encounters in his own na\u00efve way whereas Alonzo, who is much more experienced in the field, has completely different methods of resolving issues. As a result, they often disagree over how each situation should be handled and Jake realizes that his views are mostly in conflict with those of his senior officer. However, since his objective is to get into narcotics department and since the only way is to impress Alonzo, Jake obeys Alonzo's orders. After all, Alonzo is the expert in the field so he should know better.\nThe best thing about the movie is that it keeps the audience guessing right till the end about the actual morality of Alonzo. Is he really a corrupt police officer as inexperienced Jake suspects him to be or are his ways really how things are handled in the narcotics department of LAPD? Neither the audience nor Jake really knows the answer to that question for it is Jake's (and also our) first day in that field. Who are we or who is Jake to judge Alonzo's morality who spent many years in this field? Can we really say for sure that his methods are not practised in reality? After every argument, when Jake tries to rest his case, Alonzo comes back with a stronger argument and convinces him that his methods are the best. Of course, you don't know the answers to these questions until the end unless you haven't read the complete plotline. I honestly think whoever is responsible with the publicity of this movie doesn't know anything about the art of movie making. The same goes for the person who is responsible with the plotline which gives away everything about the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DO NOT READ ANY reviews (especially the plotline in the \"Main Details\" page) which give away the whole story. Possible Oscar Nominations: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both deserve Oscar nominations (Best Leading/Supporting Actor) for their excellent performances. Antoine Fuqua has done a very nice job as a director by capturing the ambience on the streets and with his depiction of criminals' lives, especially of those in the black neighbourhood. Each scene is nicely done and the suspense is so authentic. I was especially impressed by the tension in the scene where Jake sits down at the poker table with the guys waiting for Alonzo to come back. You can find a similar tension maybe in a horror movie.What I didn't like (***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***): I didn't like the publicity of this movie where Denzel Washington was openly declared to portray a corrupted cop which probably is the biggest movie spoiler that I have ever encountered in my life. The best part of the movie is the puzzle it creates over Alonzo's real character because it is not possible for the audience to decide whether or not issues are handled in Alonzo's ways in special narcotic division. Given his real character away is to kill the joy of the entire movie. Even at the end of their day, during their conversation in the car, Alonzo's explanation is very convincing and makes perfect sense. Only thing I didn't like about the movie itself is the scene where Jake jumps from the terrace of the building to the Alonzo's car after beaten up pretty badly. This scene was not realistic.",

Just about egos and mainly noting that a criminal is still a criminal with or without a badge. Ethan's character's turmoil seems to be more that he keeps hoping that Denzel's character will eventually show him something through his unorthodox teaching 'methods'.

And Kuhn used to say that conversion is an essential part of every scientific revolution.  Would the world go round without it?  I love Training Day precisely because it's such a visceral foray into the art of seduction;  for example, when Jake, the trainee, is faced with a serious moral dilemma, Alonzo tells him that the game they're playing is chess, not checkers, and adds, with avuncular affection, that when he's able to match what's going on in his head with the `real world,' he'll feel better.  Only after he knows how to play the game, Alonzo adds, after he has become `wise' to real world, can he change things for the better.  But he must become part of the system, however corrupt, before he can change it. He must have some dirt on him before others can trust him.  From a pragmatist perspective, this is reasonable.  From a `strategic' perspective of a chess match, it's morally superior.  `They build jails because of me,' Alonzo boasts.  And so, when the rookie makes his choice to challenge Alonzo's `official' construction of reality with that of his own, he's really challenging the entire system.  In the eyes of his peers, he's an egoist, a `choir boy' who's better suited for a different line of work.  He's a threat, not because he's ethically superior to his colleagues, but because he just doesn't understand the fundamental realities of the situation.  `It's not what you know:  it's what you can prove,' Alonzo says several times over to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.  Alonzo has the social and political capital to `prove' anything he likes.  The more times I see the video, the more I buy into Alonzo's perspective. And the more I wonder if he wasn't right after all.  The game is chess, not checkers.  Watch it again and see if you don't notice a subtle change in your attitude.",

This movie just adds to the huge resume of Denzel that shows his versatility to play so many different characters.  It is unbelievable that he is the same guy who played in The Hurricane and Remember the Titans.  This guy can act, and this movie is no exception.Ethan Hawke did an excellent job as well, but Denzel is who made this movie so good.  Together though, they were superb!My only gripe about this movie is that everything happens in one day. Jake (Hawke) meets with Alonzo (Washington) one morning on a \"training day\" to see if Jake is cut out to handle his new job as an undercover narcotics officer.  Jake has a laid back, shy and almost sheltered personality while Alonzo is completely over the top and in your face.  The things that happen in this one day are things that probably wouldn't happen in an entire career for most people.  However it is Hollywood, so what do ya expect?\nNonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie.  There were many scenes which made you laugh, others which made you say wow, and then there were the ones which made you say \"yea right\".  However, even my girlfriend (who was expecting it to totally bomb) said she enjoyed it.For a cop movie, it is very original and realistic in that it takes place right in L.A., no fabricated neighborhoods were used here.  However, it does start to stray from the realistic aspect as the movie draws on, which is why I only gave it a 9 out of 10.  But if you can get by that, then you'll really like this movie.",

A truly great piece of filmed cinema.It stars Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, alongside Scott Glenn. Scott Glenn is such a good Actor, and he pulls off the role with skill and ease, well done.The supporting cast does a good and effective job also and includes an impressive list of Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Dr. Dre, Raymond Barry, Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray, Eva Mendes & Raymond Cruz, to name some of them; and we'll done by them.Antoine Fuqua captures all of the Performances well and allows the friction and underlying intensity to unfold on screen by its 2 stars, filming it wonderfully.Then there's the 2 stars, Denzel and Ethan Hawke. It's a treat seeing these 2 amazing Performers together in a Film that insists on amazing Performances to lift the Movie from good to great, and its exactly what they do. The 'shower scene' with Ethan Hawke is brilliant and few Actor's in history could have taken the scene to the level it was taken to in this Film, an absolutely amazing scene. Denzel and Hawke create completely believable and crazily intense moments that create an aura of uncomfortability for me as the viewer. A level of discomfort that is created by these 2 amazing Performers. Not many Performers could've taken it to the level they do. It's a treat and a class in how to Perform, period.Once in a generation, if we're lucky, a talent like Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke come along, emotionally dynamic Performers that captivate.I think Denzel and Ethan Hawke are among the 10 best Actor's in history. It's an impossible list as there are 50 I want to have in my Top 10; but I would say these are the 10 best Actors in history (listed in order from oldest to newest):Charlie Chaplin, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Joaquin Phoenix, Leonardo DiCaprio, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Shia LaBeouf.Most Film Historians would say that Denzel Washington has starred in 15-20 Masterpieces thus far during his career, even more than Ethan Hawke. I believe if I talked to the 100 most respected Film Historians around the World, naturally they would all have slightly different lists, but I believe if they came to a consensus, this would be Historians Top 10 Denzel list:1. Glory (1989) 2. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) 3. Malcolm X (1992) 4. The Tragedy Of Macbeth (2021) 5. Inside Man (2006) 6. American Gangster (2007) 7. The Hurricane (1999) 8. Fences (2016) 9. Philadelphia (1993) 10. Crimson Tide (1995)And they would say Ethan Hawke has starred in 10-15 Masterpieces; I think this would be their Top 10 Masterpiece consensus on Ethan Hawke:1. Before Sunset (2004) 2. Boyhood (2014) 3. Before Midnight (2013) 4. Before Sunrise (1995) 5. Dead Poets Society (1989) 6. First Reformed (2017) 7. Maudie (2016) 8. Before The Devil Knows You're Dead (2007) 9. Gattaca (1997) 10. A Midnight Clear (1992)I would change both of those lists slightly. With Denzel, my list would include this Film. My Denzel Top 10:1. Fences (2016) 2. American Gangster (2007) 3. Inside Man (2006) 4. Glory (1989) 5. Malcolm X (1992) 6. The Hurricane (1999) 7. Philadelphia (1993) 8. Crimson Tide (1995) 9. A Soldier's Story (1984) 10. Training Day (2001)I agree with most Film Historians in the opinion that Training Day is a Masterpiece; a truly great piece of filmed cinema; a must see.",

He's proven it time and time again but he has always played morally true characters or the typical Hollywood `good guy' so when the `Training Day' trailers first came out I was really looking forward to seeing Washington portray a completely opposing character. Training Day literally takes place over the span of one day. A young patrol cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) gets his big chance to further his career goal of becoming Detective by working with the legendary Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). This man's reputation precedes him and has been responsible for over 15,000 man years of incarceration based on his investigations and Hoyt is now getting his chance to work in Harris's squad. Hoyt finds out that Harris is as tougher than his reputation and quickly begins learning the ropes of street justice but to the contrary of everything he's learned and devoted his life to. `To Serve and Protect' now takes on an entirely new meaning.You know I really hope that Denzel Washington does more of these types of roles. I'm always amazed at his acting skills but he always plays the same type of character. Whether that was a career choice or not, it was very refreshing to see him finally play a more `evil' character per say. In this case, the role was even more amazing in that Harris isn't so much evil but that he has his own outlook on how justice should be handled. In some instances you actually begin to agree with his outlook and root for him. I have never seen Washington give a poor performance. He acts with an intensity that very few other actors have and dives into his character with reckless abandon.What surprised me even more was Ethan Hawke. I've never been a huge fan of his and I sometimes find his characters hard to believe because of his boyish looks. But in this movie they seem to work. He comes across as a young ethical patrol cop trying to make his way to Detective. Throughout the movie he has his morals and ethics challenged by Washington's character and frequently he caves into Washington's dominance. This worked very well and made the movie interesting but more importantly Hawke make his character believable. I was impressed by his performance in this movie.There was a nice little scene with Cliff Curtis (Smiley). I saw this actor in `Blow' and really like his performance there. Hopefully he doesn't get typecast but he was very good in the character he played here. I guess if there's on thing to get picky about was the storyline. It seems a little extreme to have only one day to make or break making a new squad but in the context of the story, this works. Especially when you know the motives behind Washington's character. Overall, this was a dark entertaining movie. If for nothing else, see this movie to see Denzel Washington play a bad character. You'll be surprised and impressed.",

The story starts as a rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) first day with a corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Jake is stunned by the methods that Det. Alonzo uses in his daily routine. Because Jake wants to become narcotics office he follows Alonzo instructions. As the story unfolds it is found out that Alonzo is in debt with the Russian mob and they have a deadline on when he must pay them back or he will be killed. This causes Jake to be thrust into Alonzo world of using drugs, stealing, and even killing. This film is centered on the theme good versus evil. Jake is the naive rookie narcotics officer trying to bring down the overbearing corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris. The cinematography was great in showing this. The camera angles and lighting were great for the fact that it showed the desperate measure that Alonzo was willing to through in order to pay back the money and save his life. A few scenes stood out as very powerful scenes in the movie. In the beginning of the movie Alonzo with a gun forced Jake to smoke PCP. Little did Jake know that this was part of a big plan Alonzo created to get out of debt. The use of slow motion was awesome as Jake smoked the PCP. There was also the use of different colors in the lighting. It showed how zoned out Jake was. Another scene in Training Day was where Alonzo was cornered by the Russian mob there was misty fog. The lighting was very dim and then the gun shots rang out. Hundreds of bullets were let off. This was a very powerful scene in the movie.This is a great must see movie. Highly recommended.",

It reminded me of Brian DePalma's SCARFACE, about drug dealer Tony Montana. Realistic? No, but tremendous movie making. Denzel Washington outdoes himself here. He goes over the top so far, but still within the limits of the movie. Director Antoine Fuqua (THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS and BAIT) is not exactly known for his subtley, and TRAINING DAY is anything but subtle. It's like a freight train of a movie. The violence is strong, persistant and off putting, but then again it's supposed to be. (WARNING SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD). The final scenes with Denzel in the street screaming at all the people he thought loved him so much, are great.

Denzel's performance is riveting, not because of the performance itself (it's pretty one-sided as far as I was concerned), but because Denzel has always played the nice guy. Here he plays the bad guy.  It's simply interesting to watch this metamorphosis.  But that's also the test of a great actor:  being convincing in any role you play.  And he certainly is convincing in this role and in everything he plays.  So---bravo, Denzel.But for the movie: well, some of it just doesn't work, but you have to overlook some of the implausibilities and go with the action, which is constant and intense.  And using famous rap stars in speaking roles is certainly a mistake.  They come across as wooden.  And some of the plot twists just become a bit too far-fetched: e.g. why does the young girl saved from a rape so willingly provide the information to her UNCLE!?  She starts off her telephone conversation hiding everything, but then almost unconvincingly spills the beans.  Why does the neighborhood in which much of the action take place change it's opinion of Denzel's character so quickly? Oh, yeah, he's a bad cop and he used them and they hate him and he's a pig, etc.  But it just comes as such a pat finish.  Was it dramatic license that forces the rookie into the \"fold\" so quickly on the very first day on the job?  We are cheated out of getting to see the wool being pulled over the rookie's eyes, really.  It all happens so quickly, forceably in the first hour or two on the job.  Pretty neat trick, but are we then supposed to believe that the rookie was that gullible in the beginning?  Yeah, he is pretty stupid, I guess, and green in the beginning.  But wow, very little leg work had to be done to get him involved.  But this of course is what adds to the intensity of the film.

So therefore the that is why I hate Hollywood, i admit Denzel is a good actor a very good one. But he was the supporting role...

Ethan would've told the D.A. what should've been said and then end-of-story.Second movie - we get to see that Denzel is not only ruthless, but savage and murderous. He's even willing to give up his partner/trainee to murder. This movie, which at first was compelling and intense, now shifted gears so ferociously, so violently, so unexpectedly that it was impossible to want to watch anymore. This second part was like watching a train wreck,  and no matter how much you scream, the trains crash into each other.  I wish I hadn't watched the second part. It shouldn't have been there.

However...Denzel Washington is great, very much deserving of the Academy Award he won. And Ethan Hawke is quite good as well. Not to mention Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Cliff Curtis and so on and so on. For the first 70 minutes, I was loving it. However...About 70 minutes into the movie the movie takes a wrong turn from which it never quite recovers.But those first 70 minutes! Wow! What a movie! Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a young LA policeman who has just transferred into the narcotics division. His first day on the job, a training day, he is introduced to and will serve with Alonzo Harris (Washington). Hoyt knows he must make a good impression on Harris or he will be washed out of the department.Hoyt quickly discovers, however, that Harris is a very unconventional policeman. Hoyt does things \"by the book.\" Harris does not. Hoyt knows there are certain lines a policeman must not cross. Harris doesn't care what lines he has to cross as long as he gets the job done. So who is right and who is wrong? Is a little bit, maybe even a lot, of rule breaking okay for the police as long as they are succeeding at their job? In the narcotics division, do the ends justify the means?If the movie had stayed at this level, \"Training Day\" could have been one of the best cop movies ever made. However...70 minutes into the movie it takes that wrong turn. And for the last half hour it devolves into just another Hollywood Good Guy vs. Bad Guy movie. A very stylish and well done Good Guy vs. Bad Guy movie to be sure. However...See it for Washington's performance. See it because, whatever its faults, it is a very well made movie. However...it could have been so much more.",

All through his training day, he finds himself having to choose between his ethic and what Alonzo tells him what he should do, because the real world is a \"jungle\", and one has to be a \"wolf\" to survive in it. So, according to Alonzo, an officer could co-operate with drug dealers, steal money and even murder as long as he succeeds in his primary mission. Hoyt never seems to agree with this and when he finds out that the training is in fact a setup, he has to come after Alonzo. In the end Alonzo dies as a wolf because in this kind of game there is always a greater wolf.This was a really interesting movie. It shows a completely different aspect than the ideal world of police in the US as it appears in many other movies or TV shows. There is also an excellent performance by Denzel Washington.

Harris will show him the streets, and will actually make him feel part of it. Harris' performance repulses Hoyt, but there's something that at the same time makes him admire him. Probably this will happened to the spectator as well. Partly because of the script, and mostly because Mr Washington knows how to be convincing to everyone listening. Hoyt will have to make a quick decision about if being a cop is really what he was expecting, therefore what he wants to be. Harris makes it sound like the only way possible to work in the narcotics division. But it's up to Hoyt to make a decision.The most remarkable, though there is nothing wrong with the directing, the script, etc, are the performances. Washington is really convincing and will make you doubt, you won't know when you have just crossed the thin (white) line  between cop duty and illegality and corruption. And Ethan Hawk should have really won the Academy Award as Hoyt. these performances kill, in more than one way.This kind of great police dramas make me want to know and watch more about the genre.Btw, who the hell said it was a comedy?! it is funny watching as Hoyt smokes the dope that Alonzo gives him to 'be on the streets', but what else?",

Also, some of the events or shots or scripting does seem a little 'theatrical' and 'staged', rather than flowing in such a way that we can 'buy' the story. That being said, it does deliver the goods. Training day is one of these films that is not really escapism, it is just a fictional story. The real world of law enforcement can be and is (within reason) a dirty and corrupt empire. It's easier to have a Black or Hispanic scapegoat, or somebody to pull over just for kicks or for another notch in the Detective post.It's an enjoyable watch. I'm not sure how I would feel about it if the two leads were not who they were. Washington rules the roost, and the camera. Hawke plays the honest, determined and somewhat under confident rookie very effectively.

Training Day tells the story of their shocking interactions from the unreliable point of view of the addicted young officer Jake.Barely into their first mentoring session, Jake smokes up the evidence of an important drug bust. High as a kite, Jake embarks on a crazy PCP trip including a delusional journey to meet music legends Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre before ultimately physically and emotionally abusing each in turn. In a clear sign of the depths of the chemically-induced abyss, Hoyt actually thinks some random old man remembers Jake's \"career\" as the third-string strong safety for conference-doormat North Hollywood High.When he learns of an exclusive Hillside house party from some 14-year old girl he met in an alley, Jake crashes the soiree with a boxed blender in hand. After a miscommunication with the party hosts, Jake almost loses his life for stealing the 14-year old's pink wallet. Fortunately Jake talks his way out of a self-made mess and for some reason angrily rides the city bus away while fondling his loaded service weapon.Then stomping into Alonzo's peaceful neighborhood, armed and psychotic, Hoyt terrorizes Alonzo and his young family with a loaded gun and has the audacity, the temerity, the unmitigated gall to think that Alonzo's son trusts a gun-wielding home invader more than the boy's own father. Chasing innocent Alonzo across a set of rooftops, Hoyt's quixotic quest is only deterred when the local neighborhood watch finally escorts the disturbed newbie from the neighborhood.In a final ironic twist, Hoyt's Russian drug connections catch up to Alonzo in a case of mistaken identity when the assassins shoot up the car where Jake was last seen.9/10",

You instantly warm to Denzel's character. Even as his acts get gradually more and more questionable throughout the movie you want to believe it's not quite what it seems. Perhaps this is all a test, but no he is actually the bad guy. A loose cannon drunk on the power being a cop affords him leading him to a path of corruption.Denzel's performance is excellent. I particularly liked the emotion behind him explaining to Hoyt why they can't do everything above board after murdering a drug dealer. Retrospectively looking at this scene you can tell he is a desperate man, like he doesn't really believe his own lies anymore but he has no choice. His fall from power at the end is also spectacular.Credit to Hawke who played the naive and eager-to-please rookie. He was perfectly cast and was truly believable in the role.One criticism I have of the story is that Hoyt's rescue of the girl being attacked which subsequently saved his life was a bit too convenient for me. LA is a huge place and what are the chances, in the same day!Despite that a thoroughly enjoyable movie largely because of the excellent performances throughout, plus you have to love a Snoop cameo.",

That number does no justice to the film.  No, no, no!  Get some more people to go to imdb.com and bring this number up.  I thought the movie was great.  Yes, Denzel was at his usual best but Ethan Hawke stole the show in my book.  Considering his previous movies where he played characters who would have been better portrayed sleeping than speaking (Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, movies I didn't want to see in the first place), Ethan Hawke did a wonderful job as the moral guy.  I have a greater respect for him now.  And let's not forget Denzel.  I'm surprised he doesn't have half a dozen Oscars.  But what does the Academy know anyway? If they know anything (which they don't) Training Day will be nominated for Best Picture, ActorS (plural, for both Denzel and Ethan, who should at least get a supporting actor nom), screenplay, and director.  That's right. Antione Faqua really showed what he's made of with this film, as opposed to Bait which wasn't so good.  I really liked it.10/10",

It\u00b4s different from most of his other work, but he\u00b4s very confident and believable when he is teaching the viewers the \"law of the street\" with that lovely accent. Ethan Hawke makes an nice comeback, after a few tough years with not many films worth seeing. Oldies\u00b4 like Tom Berenger, Scott Glenn and Harris Yulin have small but important roles, and it\u00b4s fun to see artists like Macy Gray and Snoop Doggy Dog in cameos. The director portrays the ghetto with an interesting touch, and the story is strong and shocking at times.The ending feels unnecessary violent and something that\u00b4s there to please the action fans, who might have trouble to cope with the rather slow pace at times.

            "content": "Training Day is a 2001 cop drama/thriller starring Denzel Washington as veteran Narcotics cop Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt, an LAPD newbie auditioning himself to Alonzo for a job on the Narc Squad.The film's most immediately obvious strength lies in the personal, documentary-esque way we follow the two officers throughout their day. We start with a mundane breakfast scene in a roadside cafe to introduce us to the characters and their eccentricities, transition to Alonzo's car and from there we ride along with the characters on the whole seedy and sordid affair.Hoyt acts almost as an audience surrogate, reacting to Alonzo's antics with confusion, admiration and alarm. Ethan Hawke does a great job of conveying a rookie cop's naivety yet combines this with strong morals and sense of honour and duty that makes his character likable.Washington steals the show, however, with his portrayal of Harris. Alonzo is a character who mutates constantly throughout the movie. Washington flicks effortlessly between being charming, cold, amusing, intimidating, sinister and friendly. Harris is just as at home smiling warmly at you as he is blowing you away with a shotgun - and when he decides to pull that trigger, he's already worked out exactly how it's all going to play out in court afterwards.I'd say keeping Alonzo's nature ambiguous until the very end of the movie is another strength of the tight script. Just like Hoyt, we are never 100% sure whether Alonzo is merely a maverick or a flat out corrupt scumbag right until he crosses a very specific moral line (the murder of Roger for money). Even then, Washington's acting is so good Alonzo almost makes the killing seem reasonable!The movie has a brain to it, and features several things that really stand out on repeat viewing. In particular, the scene in which Harris is smiling and laughing on his phone and says \"Make sure you clean the tub out after...\". He then shares a seemingly heartfelt conversation with Jake, making that line particularly chilling once you have seen the movie once and understand what the phone call was referring to...!Weaknesses of the film precluding it from a 9 or 10 star rating from me include a somewhat limp ending and some extraordinary coincidences.At one point Jake's life is saved because it turns out that a girl he prevented a sexual assault on earlier in the day is the niece of a gangster about to kill him. This seems like a big long shot. Since the guy is the head of a large gang, it would have perhaps made more sense to make the girl the sister of one of his gang members or something. Those odds would at least seem a little less ridiculous.As for the ending; after a brilliant performance, Washington's character is gunned down with almost no fanfare by a bunch of oft-mentioned-but-never-seen Russian gangsters. It's not a terrible idea and is fairly satisfying, but I think it would have been better to simply have Harris murdered outside his girlfriend's house by the gangs during the standoff with Hoyt. It would have really highlighted how he was no different (even worse in fact) than the criminals he was manipulating. It would have also added an interesting angle regarding whether Jake would have kept quiet on the murder or not, showing that maybe in a way he \"learned\" to bend the rules from Alonzo.Anyway, despite these minor flaws the film as a whole is well acted, well written and enjoyable to watch or re-watch. 8/10.",

The movie has a few errors, but at a movie with such a story does not matter a few issues, practically the story and the mode the movie is made \"repairs\" the issues keeping you close to screen that you can't see them. Denzel Washington plays awesome, I haven't seen somebody playing so good in this kind if role since Al Pacino in Scarface, I'm sure that if a person that doesn't know Denzel Washington as an actor, watches how he plays, that person will probably tel you that is a men taken from the streets, not an actor. Ethan Hawke plays great to, he was probably deserving an Oscar at the time but perhaps it was just bad luck.It's an excellent movie with a great story that is waiting for entering Top 250, if you wanna see an exceptional movie you should watch this, I can't find my words to describe it so I probably have to end my comment here.",

            "content": "`Good cop/bad cop.' The police interrogation technique of partners ganging up on a suspect has long been a cinematic staple, but in `Training Day,' the new film from Warner Bros., the competition between good cop/bad cop goes on inside one cop. Narcotics detective Alonzo Harris, played by Denzel Washington in a spectacular performance, is the schizophrenic combination of a streetwise law enforcement crusader and a vicious leader of a police wolf pack that preys on bad guys and good guys alike.  He is funny and likeable, ruthless and despicable, hero and outcast. `There are some profoundly evil people walking these streets,' Alonzo says as the film begins. Will good prevail over evil?  That is the simple dramatic question director Antoine Fuqua poses here, but the route to the answer weaves erratically through crime-infested neighborhoods and sizzling plot twists, jumping from one spellbinding scene to the next. Harris spends a single `training day' working with narcotics  division recruit Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke).  Hoyt is a veteran ofuniformed traffic duty in the suburbs, but Harris sees enough in him to offer a chance to make detective on the mean streets of Los Angeles. The two spend most of the day riding around in Harris' `office,' a vintage low-rider Monte Carlo, as the grizzled but suave Alonzo explains the nuances of working undercover and making the big arrest.  Harris convinces his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to smoke PCP-laden weed, saying refusal on the streets would cost him his life -- `If I was a dealer, you'd be dead by now.'  He tells Hoyt not to wear his wedding ring to work, saying suspects would seize on it as a sign of weakness, a vulnerability to exploit.  They drink malt liquor like so much bottled water, and even stop off for a few belts of `the $300-a-bottle good stuff' with Harris' shadowy friend (played perfectly by Scott Glenn). Harris boasts of the `15,000 man-hours of incarceration time' that his investigations have led to, but he allows several small-time criminals go free after Hoyt is ready to make busts.  `We're not racking up arrests today,' Harris says. Hoyt asks, `Just let the animals wipe themselves out?' And Alonzo replies, `God willing.' Fuqua, who made a mark directing music videos for Arrested  Development, Henry D & The Boyz and Coolio, distinguishes  himself with his third feature, after `The Replacement Killers'  (1998) and `Bait' (2000).  The pace of the film never slows, even when the two main characters are simply riding around in a car or sitting in a restaurant.  The action sequences are interlaced with driving rap music and feverish editing, and Fuqua keeps the viewer guessing about what will become of Harris and Hoyt to very last. Even with a scraggly mustache and goatee, Hawke still has a hard time shaking off his boyish innocence, but he comes of age as an actor in `Training Day.' With solid performances as a teen-ager in `The Dead Poets Society' (1989) and `A Midnight Clear' (1991), Hawke started landing some starring roles, including the overlooked lead in `Snow Falling on Cedars' (1999).  A Best Supporting Actor nomination would not be a surprise, given his stellar work as the tormented Hoyt.As for Washington, he has never been better on screen, and we're talking about an actor who has mustered four Academy  Award nominations in his career.  He earned his first nod for a supporting role as South Africa's Steve Biko in `Cry Freedom' (1987), and then won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1989's `Glory.' He followed that with Best Actor nominations for `Malcolm X' (1992) and `The Hurricane' (1999). (He should have  won both statues, losing to Al Pacino in `Scent of a Woman' and Kevin Spacey in `American Beauty.') Some wonder whether Washington took a risk by playing a rogue cop in `Training Day,' but other than the upbeat football coach in `Remember the Titans' (2000), his past characters have not exactly been choirboys.  For example, Reuben `Hurricane' Carter was a ruthless boxer and enough a product of the streets to be convicted of manslaughter, and Malcolm X made enemies of both whites and blacks before being assassinated. No, playing Alonzo Harris was not career suicide for Washington. In fact, it's very likely he'll finally win the Best Actor Oscar that his body of work so richly deserves.",

Almost all the movies have one star ratings and also ten star ratings. I don't get why some people, only vote to give a bad rating to movie which is good. If you don't like a certain genre of movies you shouldn't watch them. Some time ago I only liked comedies and I didn't bother watching other type of movies, but since I grow up I understood that every movie genre has at least a one good movie. There are good dramas, horrors, comedies, action movies, science fiction movies and so on. So when I rate a movie, I don't let the genre of the movie affect my judgement.

When Harris begins to cross the line, Jake finds himself willing to look the other way.Amazingly set over the course of 24 hours, the movie is a look at the seductive nature of corruption, how deeply it can bloom and how its ruinous consequences permanently stain anyone who comes in contact with it.Washington radiates a wicked, malicious magnetism he's never displayed, by way of contrast with the heroic roles he usually takes on. This is the first villainous turn of his career. Being bad brings out the best in Washington, and his performance elevates \"Training Day\" past its familiar street-cops scenario into something far richer. Denzel is surely the star of this film and was quite deserving of his \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\" academy award, even though I am sure many people claim Russell Crowe deserved it more for \"A Beautiful Mind\". In my opinion, the winner should have actually been Sean Penn for his work in \"I Am Sam\". However, I also think Ethan Hawke deserves some praise, this is a guy that has grown on me over the past few years, especially with this film and \"Before Sunset\".Obviously Training Day is an example of a movie that showcases the talent of everyone involved, especially the talent of director Antoine Fuqua who, in my opinion, is not getting enough work but I am absolutely sure we will see more from him soon enough. 9/10",

Not even close.The idea of this movie was interesting but terribly done. One dimensional boring or unlikeable characters and violence, cussing, and a few \"gangster\" scenes. There are much better movies of this genre thats thought provoking and doesn't come off cheesy and unrealistic. I highly recommend HARSH TIMES. Its not a good coop bad cop movie but its a very well done film about two friends who are the opposite when they grow into men and have different goals and problems. Christian Bale is outstanding in it too and unlike training day, harsh times has real gut emotions and believable scenes. Also even the unlikeable character has some depth and humanity and we get to see different sides to them unlike Training day where alonzo was awful from start to finish just a bad guy no real relatable traits. I give Training Day a 4/10. Denzel and ethan are amazing actors but i thought the script was bad and made no sense. The story is moronic and the characters are caricatures. Stinker. Rent HARSH TIMES!",

            "content": "\"Training Day\" is a film which features great acting by the two leads, and a story that's very good, until it slips a bit at the end. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, veteran narcotics cop who's training Ethan Hawke, a young cop hoping for a spot on the unit. Both of the leads, especially Washington, are great. Washington's portrayal of Alonzo Harris will, I think, end up being one of the best, if not THE best, performance of the year. Definitely Oscar-quality material. And Ethan Hawke more than holds his own. Washington has been getting more praise, probably deservedly so, but Hawke does a great job playing Jake Hoyt, totally the opposite of Alonzo, thus making Denzel's performance stand out even more. Aside from those two, there really aren't any big parts, just lots of little ones. Most of those are good as well. Surprisingly, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg do nice jobs in their brief appearances.Antoine Fuqua does a good job directing, which is a bit of a surprise, considering that his previous work isn't really worth mentioning. I didn't know he had it in him. His directing isn't quite as good as the acting, but he does keep things moving nicely and does a good job of building up tension as the film goes on.The script, written by David Ayer, is the only complaint I have. \"Training Day\" starts off with a great deal of promise, but then loses it a bit at the end. At the beginning, Alonzo doesn't come across as a horrible person. He makes some interesting statements that could make you think, and he has decent reasons for what he does. He doesn't always follow the laws, but he can make you understand why he breaks them. But by the end, he's a completely corrupt, totally evil villain. And then the film is no longer about these choices that he makes, but about Hawke trying to stop a madman. Don't get me wrong, the ending is still exciting and fun to watch, but I was a bit disappointed to see the film abandon the moral complexities that it hinted at earlier. But, with the acting, it's still a very thrilling film, even at the end. Washington and Hawke could have been fishing, and I still would have been on the edge of my seat. So despite my minor issues with the story, the quality of the performances is more than enough for me to recommend \"Training Day.\"Rating: 8/10",

            "content": "LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to make a difference on the streets, so he attempts to join the tough, harsh world of the plain-clothes Narcotics Department.  To succeed in this, he has to endure a training day on the job and convince the Narc's chief street officer, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), that he has what it takes.  A difficult enough job for anyone, but Detective Harris has one or two skeletons in his closet, and today they've all decided they're claustrophobic! Firstly.  The acting of the two leads is top-notch.  Washington might have won the Oscar for the showier part but Hawke matches him all the way in what is actually a more demanding journey.  90% of the movie concentrates on these two almost completely in isolation and they deliver through-out; a couple of moving, confrontational scenes at the heart of the film being exceptionally executed.Secondly.  The film does not have the courage of it's convictions. Initially it is almost plotless - and all the better for it.  Harris takes his rookie on a roller-coaster of 'street justice' and, despite the latter's consternation, the pivotal moments are so well handled and the dialogue of argument in the mouth of Harris so persuasive that his apparent immorality is never as clear-cut as it should be.  Had the entire film followed this path, we could well have been left with an intriguing debate on 21st Century urban justice and a refreshing reflection on the idea of 'right' and 'wrong'.  The film, of course, does nothing of the sort.  It's made in Hollywood after all!  No, almost exactly half-way through, we are introduced to a no-brainer plot involving the Russian mafia (oh dear!) and Harris stops breaking the rules because he firmly believes this is the only way to maintain street law, and starts breaking them because he is suddenly a very bad man!  Unbelievable plot twists follow hard by and we are taken into a different, disappointing, cliched nonsense of a film in which (among several lame developments) the residents of a lethal neighbourhood ghetto suddenly develop a collective, moral consciousness.  The very ending is awful beyond words and if it's a nod to Penn's Bonnie and Clyde it's an offensively crude one!It is to the two leads' credit than that, as crassly predictable as the film becomes, it remains very watchable because of their inspired playing.  And for that - it is worth a few hours of anybody's time.",

The whole line where he told the rookie, I was just like you and you later find out he's been plotting to use this rookie from the beginning. This was him doing exactly what was done to him, becoming a trapped rat in a game where he was no better off than the man he pushed into a corner. The do unto others as you would have done unto you was clearly what was illustrated. The act of bravery saved one of the man's lives and the spiral that the other was in was what consumed him in the end. But for me the first few minutes of their interaction was just enough for me to think this is a guy you don't want to spend another minute with and why did he even bother listening to him for even one more minute. And you're suppose to believe this pushover eventually gets the balls to take this same guy on later in the film. The plot relies too heavily on certain things to go right that are so far fetched and go so wrong that it's just not believable. Serpico is a movie I enjoyed far more than this and it's the same theme and based on a true story which holds the storyline together so much better. This movie does have a very good plot twist and it is the high point of the movie, But overall the glue for this one just is held together far too thinly for my liking.",

Ethan Hawke was also nominated, and is actually much more impressive and truthful as the rookie cop (whose first day on the job with Denzel lends the film its title.) Denzel is always competent, but his turn as the bad guy in TRAINING DAY never amounts to anything but a gimmicky career move. I suppose his Oscar win just goes to show how much the Academy loves an actor showing off, whether its Nicole Kidman or Charlize Theron uglying up for their Best Actress wins, or Al Pacino, Tom Hanks, or Dustin Hoffman playing handicapped for theirs. In this case, Denzel was the Biggest Showoff of 2001.",

            "review_title": "The Reality Paradox",
            "content": "\"Training Day\" is an intelligently produced police/corruption movie, which presents us with some very realistic, and very scary situations, showing us that in the big bad world, there are no laws, no rules - only the dictates of angry mobs, and guys with guns. And the environment of menace, and grimness is created expertly. And yet, having appreciated this movie for what it is, I could never bring myself to watch it again. That's because, as good as the acting may be, it's very difficult to enjoy this film overall, not because of its' content, but because of its' approach to the subject matter. To be brutally honest, it compromises its' own integrity, in a way that superior \"realistic\"dramas, like \"Taxi Driver\", and \"Get Carter\", would never dream of doing. All of which raises the main problem about the movie: something which I like to refer to as \"the reality paradox.\"Basically, it goes something like this: If a film presented a totally realistic account of street life, or police corruption, then it would not be an entertaining two hours of your life. Real life is devoid of dramatic incidents, of heroes and villains, and of moral boundaries, as well as of generally insightful dialogue. Therefore, to be \"realistic\", in that sense, means to be dramatically lacking. Realism is often attempted, but more often than not, the writers realise the need to spice things up with those old Hollywood clich\u00e9s: in \"Training Day\"'s case, there's car chases, a rooftop fight of ridiculous proportions, in which both Alonzo and Hoyt would definitely never walk away from, and a last half hour which totally dissolves the powerfully mature atmosphere which had been built up. That's why I cannot consider \"Training Day\" to be a realistic film, although it is peppered with insightful moments.What it is, is a tour of a really nasty city, presented in an extremely threatening and scummy fashion. I cannot fault Denzel Washington's acting, and even Ethan Hawke (whom I rather dislike as an actor) gives a good account of himself. What I can fault, is the narrative of the movie itself. The world of \"Training Day\", IS believable. It is nasty, and unsanitised. But the story which the movie tells, is flawed considerably, because of its' self conscious theatricality, and rather perverse logic twists. Hawke would not have lasted nearly as long as he did in this neck of the woods. When he's about to get shot in the bath, I sincerely doubt that one lucky coincidence would stop three sinister nutcases from killing him, and it is at this point, that the movie starts to collapse. Hawke has been easily manipulated by Washington's cop all the way through, so his sudden desire to hunt him down seems ludicrous. To be fair, when Roger is killed, I'd find it equally hard to believe that the rest of the cops would not kill Hawke, in best \"Serpico\" fashion, even if Denzel wants to keep him alive as his master fall guy - which seems a touch Machievellian to be taken seriously. Hawke may be reluctant to kill in cold blood and smoke weed, but he doesn't seem principled enough to risk his neck to take down Alonzo, just to satisfy his own sense of justice. The ending is far too clich\u00e9d, and out of touch with the more visceral realism of the rest of the movie. And, I'm sorry, but why would the neighbourhood scum not just gun Hawke down in the final confrontation? Stretching reality too much, for a downbeat ending which makes you wonder whether or not the whole two hours was worth your while, and Alonzo's death seems to be a big, clich\u00e9d full stop to a film which, if it had the courage of its' first ninety minutes, would not have had a proper ending, and would definitely have seen Hawke dead by the time the end credits roll. So,is \"Training Day\" a great movie? It's well made, by a director with a brain, and a sense of the macabre nature of everyday street life. But, it's far too afraid to go all out, and be really realistic. Just enough to make you scared, but not enough to really make you think. As a piece of entertainment, as a story, as an imaginative vision, \"Training Day\" is definitely lacking, and it's bolted on thriller elements clash with its' grisly realistic moments. Did I enjoy it? Honestly? No. I didn't. But I respected it. An \"A\" for effort, but a \"C\" for content.",

            "content": "A total downer from beginning to end, `Training Day' reeks with immoral, unredeemable characters while filling the screen with unavoidable bloodshed. Yet what keeps it from being just another standard tale of urban terror is its sharp, imaginative direction (Antoine Fuqua), an ultra-tense and engaging script, a jaunty pace, and knockout performances by Denzel Washington as an L.A. narc with dirty hands, and Ethan Hawke as his straight rookie partner learning the ropes.Interesting shakeups begin right off the bat as Washington plays a  corrupt black cop and Hawke an honest white one.  Jake Hoyt (Hawke) dreams of elevating his young family's lifestyle.  He's given a plum opportunity when he's placed in the hands of hotshot veteran Alonzo Harris (Washington) for a trial run as a narcotics cop.  Hesitant because of the escalated risk but buoyed by the inevitable raise in pay and respect, Hoyt seizes the moment. If he can pass the muster, he's in. If not, he'll probably end up doling out speeding tickets or pushing papers the rest of his career.  But Hoyt is an action man and  seems up to the daunting task.  He learns quickly on his first day of training that Harris isn't your everyday, by-the-book officer. He's a fearless, arrogant braggart who plays hard ball.  Harris has developed his own survivalist style in bringing in the bad guys.  His methods are underhanded and he only plays for high stakes.  Intimidating, remorseless and just as terrifying as the street gangs he infiltrates, Harris exposes Hoyt to the money laundering and sexual favors, the crooked deals, the set-ups, the frame-ups.  Punk-ass thugs and rapists who turn informants are thrown back into the water as bait for bigger game.  And Harris is lord of it all, preening about his L.A. ghetto like a peacock, proud of the infamous reputation he's made for himself on the streets.  He's an avalanche of cocky confidence and streetwise cleverness out to win every drug game he plays, at any cost, at anybody's expense.Oscar-winner Washington is nothing short of brilliant in a role that completely shoots down the upstanding \u0091good guy' screen image he's thus far cultivated.  What remains, however, is that undeniable Washington charm, charisma and quicksilver intelligence.  Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated) gives one of the best performances of his young career as a man caught between a badge and a hard place -- trying to fit in without compromising his code of ethics.  How far can he go?  How much can he endure?  His boyishly tough yet vulnerable cop gives the audience something to root for.  The character byplay between the two leads is strong, real, and fascinates as Harris draws Hoyt further into his dark world, playing some dangerous mind games along the way.Ravaged, seamy locations and scary, menacing support characters capture the requisite feeling of urban paranoia and moral decay, and surrounds the film with an almost apocalyptical sense of hopelessness and doom.  Peripheral characters offered by Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg and, particularly, Scott Glenn as an equally distrustful retired cop, add intensity and atmosphere.In no sense of the term is \"Training Day\" an urban action flick.  On the contray, it is a taut, stark, ugly, complex character study that shows off some powerhouse talent.  Those who prefer mindless escapism will probably be turned off by its unrelenting grimness; those who prefer cerebral, realistic character studies will see it as a plus.  Repelling and unforgiving, I only wish the conclusion had been a bit more plausible and less grandiose.  It much too much for the realistic story presented.       \nDirector Antoine (`Bait,' `The Replacement Killers') Fuqua, who began directing rap music videos for such artists as Coolio and Arrested Development has a promising future, at least in this genre.  It is an assured move into stronger film territory.",

I thoroughly believed that Denzel was Alonzo.  This feat, not to be confused with great storyline, developement of characters, and other movie characteristics, is not acheived by all actors.  Robert Dinero, Al Pacino, and a few of the other great actors have at least displayed this skill once or twice in their careers.   If you can understand the difference between overly-hyped Tom Cruise and the actors that I have listed, then we see eye to eye. The intensity with which Denzel delivered his lines in this movie makes it a must see for any inspiring actor that wants to one day be a leading man.

Cliff Curtis is great in this as well as a gang leader with a heart. IF you want to see another great Cliff Curtis performance, check out BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. The supporting cast is great in this as well. Eva Mendez from 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is Denzel's wife (hottie), Dr. Dre and the guy that played Redfoot in THE USUAL SUSPECTS are members of Alonzo's unit. Denzel Washington's performance is top-notch. And I don't even think this was his greatest performance. Denzel was superb in REMEMBER THE TITANS and in the Oscar-snubbed THE HURRICANE.

Training Day often goes beyond the limits of Hollywood with its careful dissection of the moral and ethical dilemma cops face when dealing with \"the streets\" while still remaining a Hollywood flick.What works so well is the combination of faced paced drama that we and our Rookie cop, Ethan Hawke, are thrown into and the intellectual debate that rages today over \"the streets\" and \"what to do about it.\"  Hawke's ethics relate closely to that of MLK while Washington takes more of Malcom X's position (fittingly so). Denzel's character may be corrupt now, but the film hints at a change from earlier views, almost as if \"the streets\" showed him that there was no other way of functioning as an effective Narc.  Understanding the value of being \"real,\" he believes to be most important in getting things done.  A \"naive, wanna save the world\" rookie cop, in his mind, ain't gonna cut it out there. And he tries to get Hawke's character to understand his views.  But while this is happening we are then shown how by being so closely related to \"the streets,\" and even living there, what it has done to him. \nWho is more right in dealing with \"the streets,\" Hawke or Washington? \nThere we have the foundation for the story.We are pretty much thrown into Ethan Hawke's position of constant wonderment of Washington's character.  And for the most part it works.  Is this how things get done?  Can one be a \"good\" cop and be effective?  Is there no hope for the victims of the situation?        And the dilemma plays on to a fast beat.  Very good stuff.The only surprise was where was all of the hip-hop music from the soundtrack?  the moody score was effective, but they could have added more than one or two tracks from the soundtrack.",

            "content": "I knew that Antoine Fuqua had a good movie in him.  Let's breakdown his career: He directs music videos (most notably, Gangsta's Paradise) then he gets tapped to do an American version of the Hong Kong action film.  The Replacement Killers was alright, I suppose, but it certainly didn't live up to its predecessors.  Then he gets stuck directing a movie with Jamie Foxx in the lead.  That had disaster written all over it (Jamie Foxx is absolutely great in supporting roles).  But with Bait, you really could tell that Fuqua had talent, even if the material wasn't good.  But now, with Training Day, he's given a prime opportunity to show us what he's made of. And it's clear that he's got a good career ahead of him.This movie is a real treat in this time of what seems to be one bad movie after another.  It's very funny at parts, but not to the point where it's a comedy that gets all serious at the end.  Denzel is, of course, great.  I really don't understand why people keep making a big deal out of his performance though.  Sure, it's the first time he's played a bad guy, but I honestly can't think of one time when he's given a bad performance.  He's always great, so this shouldn't be a surprise.  What is a surprise is Ethan Hawke.  For once he's not playing the brooding, misunderstood guy.  He plays this one like it should be and that was the big acting surprise (not seeing Dr. Dre as a cop).Normally, when a movie has a revelation towards the end, it changes your whole viewpoint on what happened earlier.  But, without giving away anything, with this movie, it just makes you uneasy about the events that are to come.  I've also read a few people talking about how the very end is a little hard to swallow.  It makes perfect sense if you really paid attention to the rest of the movie.  And I'm not talking about \"if you blink, you miss the key point of information.\"  This film is about setting a certain mood and state of mind.  Both from the director and from the characters.  If you let yourself get into it, the whole movie is a really great experience.Like I said before, this movie is very funny.  But the action in it is some of the best in a while too.  It's not all about special effects and messing with your visual perspective.  Most of the action is shot in a way that allows you to follow it from start to finish.I loved the cameos too: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Macy Gray, Tom Berenger, and that guy who played Redbud in The Usual Suspects.  They were fun, but not distracting.  Overall, I guess the movie does have it's flaws; it does seem to drag a little in parts.  But it is still a great movie worth watching. While this is Antoine Fuqua's first really good movie, I hope he now has the ability to get better and better projects.  I've never ended a review with a pun before so I won't call his first two movies training days.  That would just be wrong.",

But I have One COMPLAINT : Didn't the Oscar juries notice Denzel Washington for his roles in movies such as Cry Freedom(1987), Malcolm X(1992), Philadelphia(1993), Crimson Tide(1995) and ofcourse ...The Hurricane(1999)? That's where my complaint lies: DENZEL WASHINGTON SHOULD HAVE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR LEADING ROLE LONG TIME AGO.\n   Even though he was not nominated for his roles in Philadelphia(1993) and Crimson Tide(1995), his roles in those movies were significant ones. Both the movies were GEM of movies. Actually, my PERSONAL opinion is that BOTH Philadelphia and Crimson Tide should have been nominated in the categories of Best Picture,Best Director(Jonathan Demme/Tony Scott respectively),Best Actor(though Tom Hanks won for Philadelphia),Best Supporting Actor(Washington/Gene Hackman respectively. Gene Hackman has done a great job.)\n   Denzel Washington had actually proved from the very beginning that he was here to ACT and not only to ACT, but ACT in very MEANINGFUL roles. And it was clear from the very start of his career when the movie Soldier's Story,A(1984) was nominated for the Best Picture in which he had acted and was only his second movie AND he himself was nominated for the Best Actor for his role in Cry Freedom(1987) which was only his fourth movie for the big screen. Actually by winning it, Denzel has proved that Substance rules over hype-hoopla and favour.This was the reward he was toiling for, for the last fifteen years.Actually, Denzel Washington is an ideal example of a  GREAT FIGHTER/STRUGGLER.\n   The IRONY is that after playing the GOOD GUY for all these years, he has won it for the BAD GUY role. Anyway, a role is either an excellent  role or a poor role and not any other thing. Anyway now that he has won the Award, my only wish is that he doesn't rest and works only MORE HARDER in more MEANINGFUL roles. His roles are what attract me towards his performances.    Anyway,Best of Luck ,DENZEL for your future ...",

Ethan Hawke too is simply brilliant in expressing the character of a cop on his first day of duty who is initially excited about and ready to follow the rules by the law-book but then gets shocked and subdued by the law bending and even law breaking tactics of Alonzo Harris. As far as the movie movie is concerned it a decent flick expressing corruption in the police force but has been made an affair to remember by Denzel Washington.

You never knew exactly what was Alonzo Harris' true motivation in his actions towards Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke)until the final act, and it takes superb acting to pull that off with the sincerity and believability that Denzel did. Ethan Hawke does a good turn here also as the rookie cop Hoyt who struggles throughout the movie with the apparent \"realities\" of narcotics investigation offered up to him by Alonzo. Just how much \"dirt\" is Hoyt willing to take on without becoming untrue to his ideals?I never judge a movie by how \"original\" the story is. \"Being John Malkovich\" was hailed as an \"original\" story, yet I found it only mildly interesting. If Training Day has been \"done\" before, I can't recall seeing it. I judge movies by how well they tell the story that they are telling. This one is told quite well. The characters were interesting, the plot moves along quite smoothly, the visuals really portray the gritty, harsh reality of the LA ghetto.All in all, I found this to be a very worthwhile experience and would recommend it to anyone.I gave it an 8/10.P.S.:I wonder if the writers of FX's The Shield watched Training Day before writing the character of Det.

            "content": "A friend of mine and I have been waiting a very long time to see Denzel Washington in a role where his talent really shines. The best movie I've seen him in to date is Fallen, although I haven't seen Malcolm X, so can't comment on that. For me, the difference between Fallen and most of Denzel's other roles is an edge, a sharpness, a *reality* that just doesn't appear in movies like The Hurricane or Remember the Titans. To put it as my friend does, we wanted to see Denzel play a character that would 'kick puppies and step on kittens' for a change. This movie takes what he brought to Fallen and puts it on steroids.\nWashington is Alonzo Harris, a corrupt cop. A man who believes he's part of the big time but, in reality, he's just a small-time criminal hiding behind his LAPD badge. As a member of a covert narcotics squad, he gets to cruise the streets of LA looking for his next big bust. He may have originally been a fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak and a notion that justice involved returning the streets to the community, but his thirteen-year tour of duty in the narc unit have left him jaded, disillusioned, and willing to do whatever it takes. Throw young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) into the mix. Hoyt is that self-same fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak, a young wife, and a nine-month-old daughter. He's looking to make detective, and wants nothing more than to be able to provide for his family and take down the questionable elements of society that run rampant in downtown LA. Alonzo, however, has totally different ideas about Jake's future.\nAlonzo seems to have surrounded himself with a plethora of fools, and it's implied during the film that he's done it so that he can keep control. Because as long as Alonzo has control of the men in his unit, has control of the streets--which he rules with an iron fist--he has control of his life. As he gets to know Jake, however, he can see that there's something different about him...that he's not going to be just another follower. Jake has one single day to prove to Alonzo that he can cut it as a narc. Failure means he goes back to 'cutting traffic tickets' and maybe never gets his coveted job as detective. MINI-SPOILER However, an incident in Las Vegas with some nebulously defined and never-seen Russians suddenly has Alonzo in over his head. He has to provide a million dollars by midnight or his life is forfeit. His upper-echelon contacts (the semi-satirical 'Wise Men') are worried that he's not going to be able to find the money, and then they'll lose their man on the street, the guy who can be relied upon to get things done when the system can't. But Alonzo has a plan, and that plan centres around Jake. END MINI-SPOILERWashington turns in an incredibly driven and fiercely charismatic performance as Alonzo. Hawke, as his counterpoint, plays his role in a perfectly understated fashion, which only adds to Washington's impact in the film. Washington's character *needs* to be compared to a bland background, just so you can appreciate exactly what it is that's going on.\nBut when the film comes to its resolution, we're still left with the question unanswered. Which view is the right one? Does Jake's initial idealism have a place in the warzone--the drug-fuelled hotbed of intolerance and violence that is 'the office' for these covert narcs? Or is Alonzo's brutal and almost fanatical version of justice the only way to catch--and kill--the wolves prowling around the edges of the flock?\nIt's also refreshing to see a movie on this subject-matter that doesn't have a 'message'. Training Day simply explores the issues and puts them on the table, and whilst some people may believe it falls down on one side more than the other, I prefer to see it as giving the audience the option to make their own decision. The real stinger though, is that despite his unorthodox methods, his disregard for due process, and his uncompromising, severe attitude, Alonzo shares the same ideals as Jake. Both of them want to eliminate the scum of the streets. However, whereas Jake wants to create his perfect Aryan-esque world where it's safe for a fourteen-year-old to walk through the worst parts of town in the dead of night, Alonzo is much more interested in landing the biggest of fish--whatever the cost. Pros: Superb acting from Washington and a fine counterpoint by Hawke. A fast-paced character- and event-driven drama that assaults the senses and leaves you reeling from its mental impact. Cons: The last ten/fifteen minutes or so may leave some unsatisfied.\nLikely Oscar nominations: Well, I'm going to forego my usual comical comment here. Seriously, Denzel should get _something_ for his performance in this movie. It's just a pity this is the sort of movie the Academy usually overlooks. Verdict: A tour-de-force led by Washington that proves that violence and intelligence don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive in a modern movie. Go see if if you liked Fallen, or want to see what Denzel can really do when he turns on the afterburner. Plus the ins and outs of this movie can easily lead to lengthy discussions over coffee afterwards.\n9 out of 10.",

Sheesh.Washington wins Oscar for this role? Malcolm X, maybe. I could listen to an argument for his \"Hurricane\" Carter. But for this caricature of a \"bad man\"?

This movie would have been much more effective (and realistic) if it'd gone for a more low-key approach. The problem with today's Hollywood is that the first rule of movie-making is always MORE, MORE, MORE. But the subtle, low-key approach has its advantages. It would have given this movie the street credibility that it so desperately tries to achieve. Yes, there are rogue, out-of-control cops in America in real-life. It'd be nice if we could get a half-way realistic film about this problem. But instead, we get this loud, over-the-top, ham-fisted movie that won't have any more real-world impact than the latest superhero/comic book movie. A more subtle, low-key movie could maybe have shed a little light on the rogue cop phenomenon (and perhaps even let us relate to the rogue cops on some level and understand what drives them to act the way they do). In fact, it appears that this movie makes at least a half- hearted effort to achieve just that. But it fails. Maybe some people in the audience related to why the Denzel character acted the way he did. But I thought he was just a one- dimensional jerk who was abusing the badge.A lot of his dialogue was presented as being a lot more profound than it really was. Actually, a lot of it (along with his actions) didn't make a lot of sense (spoiler alert) starting with the premise of bringing a new guy along on a day of outrageous antics that would have shocked the most jaded, crooked veteran rogue cop.This movie not only fails as a work of art, it is an insult to real- life police officers.",

That it is, except it reaches the level of being so over-the-top that it becomes ludicrous. This particularly rings true for the ending, easily one of the worst of recent memory. I will not give it away, but it really had me scratching my head. The alternative ending on the DVD does not fare better.Denzel Washington is a show-stopper for the entire film, giving his most over-the-top performance to date (it may even beat out \"John Q\"). He is obviously having fun, which is what I liked. Hawke is excellent in a difficult role. He has the perfect tone for the most uncomfortable scenes, but can still show authority.Hothead Antoine Fuqua (\"The Replacement Killers\") directs with confidence here, and he had excellent production values to work with.In the end, Washington was worthy of the Oscar (although I still feel Tom Wilkenson from \"In The Bedroom\" should have taken home the statue), Hawke was questionable as Best Supporting Actor, and a string of unlikely and unbelievable events ran this movie into the ground at about the 90 minute mark.RATING: B-",

Denzel Washington is beyond a great actor. In my opinion, after watching this film, he is among the top two or three of his generation. If Glory introduced him to the masses, Training Day should cement his place in film history. Very few actors have the ability to be effective as both the hero and the villain. Kevin Spacey, Robert DeNiro, and Robert Duval come to mind also. Denzel was the perfect villian for this film. The atmosphere of this film is very gritty and realistic. Still, it does not move slowly, and every little vignette in the story seems pertinent at the end. The only flaw with this film might be that it was supposedly supposed to mirror the life of a rogue LAPD narcotics officer. Maybe it was a little too dramatic in the end, but again it was well worth my time and energy to see this film. 8.8/10",

But in the Infinite, we find meaning and enjoyment in life. We are simply satisfied when we eat and drink. That's the gift of God. (3:13) Harris was wise in a sense, but he is foolish in God's eyes. Harris didn't seem to enjoy his work, and he looked sad all the time, even when he did smile. Solomon said, \"There is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work\" (3:22). Who is like the wise man? I think Hoyt was the wise man. His wisdom \"brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance\" (8:1). His wise work saved himself.

It is rated R for brutal violence, persuasive language, drug content, and brief nudity. The basic story is as follows: Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a husband and father who has been a cop for 18 months.  He is training to be a narcotics officer.  On his training day he is assigned to Alonzo Harris who will show him the ropes.  Alonzo at some times is bitter but at other times is fun.  But Jake is surprised when he finds out how Alonzo is corrupt and conniving.  And soon Jake is intertwined in Alonzo's plan to deliver a large sum of money after a mistake made with the Russian Mafia. First of all this movie is performance based... the script doesn't give it any oomph and neither is the direction anything special.  It is simply wonderful performances by Washington and Hawke (though Hawke will most likely be overlooked by Washington).  The movie is paced very well at the beginning with Hawke waking up and meeting Denzel... then we get the intensity point as they go from bust to bust.  There are surprisingly impressive cameos by Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray that also push the movie along.  Scott Glenn also gives a worthwhile performance as Roger, Alozo's \"supposed\" friend.  1 hr. 40 mins. in I was thinking, whoa that was one of the best endings I have ever seen!  And then the movie continued.\nThis is the movies fatal flaw... it should have quit when it was ahead... hell, I might have given it an extra half of a star if it had ended then but it all boiled up to a rooftop jumping and then loud ending. Academy Potential: I am deeming this much too violent for the Academy to choose Denzel for a Best Actor nomination.  It's just to much of an action flick to be considered... it would be like nominating Stallone for \"Cliffhanger\". While the film has a horrible flaw... it's still enjoyable to watch the stars in brilliant performances.  So the movie isn't completely wasted, just less than expected.",

Certainly the LA Kitchen genre has been played to death!My biggest problem with this film is that the underlying premise makes no sense. Alanzo doesn't need the rookie cop to take the fall for anything, and even if he did he risks both the Rookie's life and the possibility of him not being lured into Alanzo's world way too much during \"The Training Day\". It is unrealistic too to think that even though Alanzo has just gotten in trouble in Vegas he could set up a transfer of a trainee to fill the role of..., the role of,...well I'm not sure what role he is supposed to fill. Renegade newbie who shouldn't have shot Scott Glen and then was killed mysteriously in east LA, allowing Alanzo to skate? If you think back, or try to outline some resolution other than Hawk escaping,  I am sure you will get my point.Something is definitely cooking in this film, but despite all the spice, it is really lacking a fundamental principle. Make sure it makes sense. I give it a Seven (7)",

Alonzo used the humanity rules he understood to pyramid the justification of attacking poison with poison, and used the means of walking on the edge of the law to express the greed of humanity so \"reasonable and reasonable\". It should be said that this is mainly due to the male director Denzel Washington's three-pointed, incisive acting, absolute film-level performance.",

He is spending his training day (no complexity in the title) following the leader about on his \"average\" daily duties. Ethan Hawk plays the new guy who is all dreams and ideals, Denzel Washington plays the hardened street cop who is all realism and street vibes. If he were retiring in a week the clich\u00e9 would be complete.We learn very early on that the only way to police the street is to become the street. Essentially by being less of a cop, and more like a teacher to the hoods and gangsters. While you may take them out for selling drugs to kids, stealing from the rich to feed you family is ok. Why break up a rape in progress when all you are going to get is a lot of paper work at the end of the day? Slowly Washington removes hawks' ideals, breaking him down to be one of the team. This starts with hawk being tricked into smoking a PCP laced joint, which inevitably leads him on a downwards spiral as things get more and more surreal throughout the day.The story is nothing particularly new. There is the buddy element, the cop turned crook element and the will he/won't he element of doing the right thing. The script has already dictated who should come out on top by navigating your sympathies in the direction of Hawk's plight. Hawk himself carries himself very well in what is essentially a stock role picked from the Hollywood book of stock roles. And if you turned to the next page you would see Denzel Washington's character. Washington was very good in the role, but it was certainly no Oscar performance. This is an average film with above average performances.Wait until the video comes out in Blockbusters.",

            "content": "\"Training Day\" tells the story of young cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) assigned to Narcotics, partnering veteran cop Alonzo Harris (Washington) on his first day. As he tries to improve Hoyt's \"street IQ\", Alonzo appears to push the boundaries of what is acceptable policing to their absolute limits, forcing Hoyt to question both his own motives and those of his superior. The film is all about asking yourself one question: how far would you go in order to do the right thing? And without trying to sound righteous, this is a question that all of us must ask ourselves from time to time. Do I do the right thing and refuse or capitulate and go with the flow? It is this theme of morality that lifts \"Training Day\" beyond the mire of most cop movies. The other huge bonus is the performance of the two leads - both Washington and Hawke are brilliant, utterly compelling and believable in their respective roles. However, I think that the Oscar went to Washington for two reasons. One: he is playing totally against type. Washington isn't known for playing characters with a prominent dark side, let's be honest. Two: Russell Crowe didn't deserve a second Oscar after \"Gladiator\". Hawke, I feel, was probably a little peeved at not getting as much recognition as this is easily the best film I've seen him in. But Washington is at his scene-stealing best, especially towards the end. Most other actors only appear for short periods of time (Dr Dre, Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, etc) and don't really contribute that much.Unlike most other cop movies, \"Training Day\" feels a much more realistic picture than others in its stable. LA isn't the playground of the rich and famous that we expect in the movies - it's a scorching hot-bed of drugs, gang violence and simmering racial tension. And it looks great. This is a wonderfully shot film, drawing you into it's shady suburbs. For the first time in years, Los Angeles looks and feels like a real city and not just a main street full of skyscrapers. For all it's accuracy, I confess that some of the \"hood\" dialogue lost me (I'm a pasty white boy, can't help it!) and this marred the ending slightly, which did feel slightly contrived and hurried to fit the time frame. What it did do was leave me wanting more and I haven't seen a film in a while that left me like that.",

            "content": "***Spoilers!!!***I started watching this movie not knowing what to expect. At the end I wasn't disappointed. It was a well-structured, well-balanced cop-movie.Training Day is about LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt, excellently portrayed by Ethan Hawke, and Narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris, brilliantly portrayed by Denzel Washington. Jake Hoyt is going to be a Narcotics Detective too, just like Alonzo Harris. He has a great sense of justice and honesty. But before he really starts to work he joins Alonzo Harris on a training day, meant to introduce new detectives to their work and their neighbourhoods. The only problem is Alonzo Harris is probably the baddest character ever portrayed by Denzel Washington. He's just bad to the bone, he steals, he cheats and he beats. He's in this line of work just to get rich. Because Jake Hoyt is nervous and new to this line of work he accepts some of the suspicious behaviours of Alonzo Harris but slowsly he starts to realize what he is doing and most importantly... He starts to realize that he is being sucked into it against his own will.The story line makes up for a good movie, but if properly executed it could be great movie (as with all story lines probably...). Let me tell you this, this movie is executed properly! Alonzo Harris has some cool lines but when Denzel says they sound great! Put some mediocre actor in this movie instead of Denzel and this movie would have been good, but not nearly as good as it is now. He performance lifts this movie to a higher level.Now we are completely forgetting Ethan Hawke. Ethan portrayes his character excellent too. He acts very convincing as the cop who only wants to do good and help people (isn't that their job? :)).Scott Glenn's character Roger is nice too. He plays a bigtime drugdealer who is being betrayed by Alonzo Harris.Musicians Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg also have nice parts. Especially Snoop Dogg's part is cool. A crackdealer in a wheelchair!Although she didn't play a big part I want mention Eva Mendes who plays the role of Sara Harris. She is just drop dead gorgeous!!!All in all this is a great movie. I recommended to anyone who likes crime/thriller-movies. I don't think people will be disappointed by it.My Score: 9/10 (It would have had a lower score if it wasn't for Denzel!)",

This film is one of the best cop movies since 'Heat'.  Gripping, exciting, and violent.  Quite superb in parts.Hawke plays a 'rookie' cop, (and I use that term lightly) who is being trained by Washington to work the drug filled streets of LA.  What Hawke is exposed to is the highly corrupt world that is LA's (and even America's) police force.  The story concentrates on how Hawke deals with it - a coming-of-age, writes-of-passage drama in one sense, in which Hawke's innocence is lost.  There is only a thin red line between the police and the bad guy - a simple police badge.  Hawke's character remains a glimmer of hope for the system.  All the performances are superb.  Washington at times is chilling, Hawke is brilliant as a terrified cop who grows stronger throughout the film.  See this film, it is not difficult to see why Washington got the oscar, but I think that Will Smith should have got it for 'Ali' instead.",

The question is would he have preferred this to be the role for which he was acknowledged with the greatest of all acting awards? Malcolm X, Glory or Philadelphia are probably the films that the actor himself would have an asterix by as defining roles in his filmography. Yes his performance is great, but the character is one that could have been played equally as well by Laurence Fishburne or Samuel L. Jackson, either of whom have enough suitable menace to be a winner as a narcotics cop gone bad. Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington) is playing out of type as the beanie wearing bad narcotics cop who takes Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his training day. Unlike the majority of characters Washington plays, Harris has no redeeming roles. It is a day that is supposed to define whether Hoyt will make it as a rookie narc. Instead it defines the young police officer's desire to do the right thing, seeking firm but fair justice for the good of the community. From meeting his new take no prisoners tutor to toking marijuana laced with PCP, drinking on duty, destroying evidence and ignoring petty crime it is a day that tests the faith of the young cop. The ending is a little loose, leaving you to wonder if Hoyt remains true to character as the police officer his high ideals would wish him to be. A strong performance from both major actors keeps this film moving at breakneck pace, maintaining your attention as the sordid tale winds to its breathtaking, gunshot filled conclusion. Also features guest appearances from hip hoppers Dr Dre and Coolio, along with songstress Macy Gray. Weekly recommended rental: LA Confidential (1997). The best tough guy cop film of recent times.

The story is about a young police officer (Hawke) trying to make detective the fastest way, by being a narcotics officer for 18 months. He has one day to prove himself to his boss, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington). This becomes his Training Day. Through out the film he finds out that being a narc is more then he bargained for. The film is about wrong and right and making the right decisions under extreme pressure. Denzal Washington gives a fantastic performance as Detective Harris. He is a man that has no morals and is using the badge to perform crimes against the criminals he is putting away, or trying to put away, either by death or prison. Denzal's powerful performance earned him an Oscar for best actor in 2002. Ethan Hawke gives a emotional performance as Officer Jake Hoyt, the new guy in training. He was also nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. Another great cop/detective film that came out recently is Narc (2002). I highly recommend both of these films.

Together, Washington and Hawke create a new genre in the film industry, and proffer dual performances that are above reproach. Bravo!!!",

The movie has parts that one could call \"Hollywood\" however those only add points to the film. I want to point out that you must have massive head trauma or be in born in another country to know that Denzel Washington not only played a realistic corrupt cop but it seemed like it was second nature for him. Looking back at this film I can see nothing flawed about maybe I mean not to be redundant but there are very few films that really make you feel gratitude at the end.

Did DW really get decorated for this? Some of the support roles are more convincingly played, lending a greater sense of motive for their actions, and perhaps more focus on their stories might have raised the interest level. Ultimately, it's a watchable but pretty anodyne and forgettable film that, despite the 'drama' billing, sheds little light on the human condition.",

Nevertheless, the reason I think highly of the movie is because it really explores the conflict that undercover officers face- to be very effective, one must almost become a criminal. Morality is not always crystal clear. I think the message of the movie is this- Denzel's character crosses the line and it thoroughly corrupts him which leads to his demise. In the course of the \"Training Day\", Ethan Hawke's character sees what one must do to reach the pinnacle of effectiveness as a narc cop, but in the end, he rejects that philosophy because he sees the paradox. One cannot claim to be an officer of the law, however effective at fighting crime, if one engages in criminal activity to achieve the effectiveness. This is an incredibly profound and compelling concept for all cops. Do you \"create\" justification to pull over a vehicle you suspect may be involved in criminal activity? Does the end justify the means? Is society better off with cops whose methods may be immoral but whose results are extremely productive? Great food for thought and debate.",

            "content": "Training Day sees Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke at full supremacy, both so brilliantly in command of there roles that they compensate for this action thriller's decorous screenplay and lack of ideas. If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene: it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict.",

The best part about training day is that it grips you from the very first scene. It doesn't give time for you to sink in and get absorbed in the semi dark appeal of it (which at least i felt). It engages from the first scene and confuses you at various moments leaving you mystified as to what exactly will the next scene be (something i assume that every movie buff loves - unpredictability). Denzel Washington like always delivers an incredible performance. But its Ethan Hawke who stands up and delivers a performance equally good as his co-star. The story is well written and aptly portrayed. My favorite moment in the movie is the conversation of the two leads after having interrogated a woman in her house",

First off, in my opinion, there were few of these flaws in the movie. I admit there were a few but no movie is perfect. I have watched the movie three times, not because it was the best movie I have ever seen, but to look for these giant holes in the plot and to watch the over the top action scenes. Nothing I saw and noted was that big of a deal to throw the whole movie into the crap pile which is what many people have done. I guess a lot of people don't realize that when these blockbuster movies are created it's not for the people who will look into every nook and cranny of the story and dialogue to find some piece of imperfection. They write it for the average movie go'er. This average movie go'er isn't there to look for the flaws they are there to, in a sense, be put into this movie.If Ethan Hawke hadn't been beating so badly that he couldn't get up and fight back then the next scene of him being hauled off to the hospital would really make the movie less interesting. On the other side if he hadn't received those brutal beatings then his fighting back wouldn't be as enjoyable. Thats what people want to see a glorious fight back, or a tragic fall. In providing the audience with this the writer has to make some adjustments to reality.  Maybe the streets of LA are not correctly portrayed and maybe the way the they went about their police business isn't all realistic, but without these tweaks it wouldn't be a good in your face cop movie. I mean reality can't always be as entertaining as Training Day was.Reading over this I kind of rant, its late and I should be asleep. I hope some who read this can see my point.",

The movie was a pretty long two hours but it kept you in it so it did not feel like it was dragging. Many people say they are unhappy with the climax or the big turning point but i was content with the ending if that helps at all. Everything was realistic, the actors were awesome and the movie really makes you have a connection for whats going on. It is sort of a movie where you actually have to pay attention and it is not predictable unless you ruin it for yourself.

No, really, \"Glory\" was an excellent film, but between the time span of \"Glory\" (1989) and \"Training Day,\" (2001) twelve years if my mathematics are not failing me, Washington has done other top-notch films, namely \"Devil In A Blue Dress,\" (1994) \"He Got Game,\" (1998) \"The Siege,\" (also 1998) and \"The Hurricane\" (1999). This film just happens to have Washington as a completely wicked cop. To me, this film contained one of Denzel Washington's top-notch performances as villain F.E.S. Detective-Sergeant Alonzo Harris. Washington is completely wicked as he double-crosses everybody he knows to get the job done and then some. He holds nothing back. This film has heart, emotion, and adrenaline. It has something, a majestic quality, that Tony Scott's mean, tough \"Man on Fire\" (2004) tried to capture, but not quite as successfully. An incredible Oscar-nominated performance also for Ethan Hawke, who unfortunately lost to Jim Broadbent in \"Iris\" (2001). Probably most people Antoine Fuqua's best film to date, edging out \"Tears of the Sun\" (2003) and \"King Arthur\" (2004). The storytelling never felt stiff in the joints and just moved freely pretty much the whole way through. By the way, was that Eva Mendez as Washington's wife in the film? JUST KIDDING! I knew that!

Another reason for being refreshing is that Denzel is the bad guy - he plays the players to his own ends, and not just to put the criminals away.The action flows nicely from a steady beginning to the fateful climax and, even though the film paints quite a bleak picture of what is required to survive and thrive on the streets, there are not a few moments of humour.Definitely recommended.",

Judging by some of the comments already posted on this page, there are a lot of people who disagree with me on this one. But I thought the whole movie was nicely restrained, right up until the climax (is this review beginning to read like a write up for a high class porn flick?).Yes, yes, so Denzel Washington spends MOST of THE film TALKING like THIS (!!!!), his eyes continually twinkling with a mixture of mischievousness and raw insanity. But if there's one actor who you don't mind over acting, then it's Denzel. Imagine Al Pacino in the same role - although Al would definitely have looked even more ridiculous than Washington going round calling everyone his \"DAWG\" and Ethan Hawke his \"nigga\". Did Washington deserve the Oscar for this film... yeah, kind of... well, no... he just deserved the Oscar that he didn't win for Malcom X.Yet the whole time I was watching Training Day I just knew the final scenes would spoil it. I knew that Hollywood conventions would dictate that the film had to end with Washington and Hawke beating the living be-jaysus out of each other, sustaining several gun shot wounds and facial injuries in the process.Yet the final fight was really well staged, not asking the viewer to really believe that scrawny Ethan Hawke could really batter big buff Denzel. I mean, earlier in the film they asked us to believe that Ethan Hawke (a man whose eyelids look like they're on loan from Droopy Dog) had never schmoked the demon weed before... C'mon.Training Day is an interesting study in nihilism and is largely about, as another user has already commented, how important a set of rigid set of ethics should be to the public servants sent out to protect us. Yet the film never really resolves this issue - Ethan Hawke's character is shown to be deeply principled but largely unable to do his job because of his lack of street savvy and pragmatism, while Washington's Alonzo is shown to be resourceful and charismatic but ultimately careless and evil. So who does the screenwriter think should be patrolling the streets: Ethan? Denzel? Dr Dre (who's actually not as bad as you'd think)?Needless to say, I won't be signing up to join the LAPD just yet...",

This day in the life of movie takes them to neighbourhoods of LA and Hoyt, who has great respect for the narcs and Alonzo finds himself in the middle of a corrupt system he doesn't want to believe.\nThe performances are alright. Hawke is pretty good as the naive, new cop. Washington is believable as the expert, rough around the edges with a quick wit. But I don't think it's an Oscar winning performance. I do believe Russell Crowes performance in \"A Beautiful Mind\" was much stronger and deserving. No, I'm not biased because I'm an Aussie, but I think politics and personal feelings got in the way of the voting. I mean, \"Training Day\" was at the cinemas here for what, two weeks? Didn't even make the top ten here. When Washington won the Oscar, they brought it back to the cinemas.

Several scenes were knife-edged (or gun-barrel) violent, reminiscent of \"Reservoir Dogs\". At least one \"coincidence\", as I have seen mentioned in other reviews, was quite annoying.

The film follows a turbulent day as rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is taken under Harris's wing in a \"Training Day\". Pass the tough test he is presented with, and he becomes a narcotics officer, fail, and he goes back to the Valley. What unfolds is a carefully thought out and even more impressively executed plot, that has many turns along the way, and many underlying themes that can be appreciated more on repeated viewings. David Ayers' screenplay beats the hell out of his other two famous ones - The Fast and the Furious and U-571, and Antoine Fuqua's direction is some of the best work I have ever seen. Every scene has it's own significance, even if you only realise it later, and they are cut perfectly to display this.I have heard accusations on here of Denzel being \"bad in some scenes\", and the supporting cast \"having nothing to do\". Let me clear that up with one word: Rubbish. Washington is on form for every second of screen time, showing us more and more of who he really is as the film goes along, but letting us judge for ourselves whether we like Harris or not, whether we agree with his principles or not. And as for the supporting roles, I would welcome anybody who can point out a scene in which actors are completely wasted. Scott Glenn (who also worked with Washington on Courage Under Fire) is solid as Harris's \"boy\" Roger, and Cliff Curtis of Three Kings fame is a joy to watch as a Mexican nicknamed \"Smiley\", even more so considering that he is a New Zealander and does his assigned accent perfectly. This film is brimming with talent, including the supporting cast. Although it recieved an Oscar for Washington's lead role, the whole film is virtually flawless. Hawke is fantastic as Jake Hoyt, and it's always good to see Tom Berenger pop up, even if its only for a few minutes. This film is well written, sharply directed, performed with distinction. The musical score from Mark Mancina deserves a mention too. And as for the so called \"disappointing\" ending, it really isn't. It caps off the whole feel of the film: Firstly, because it has ((Slight Spoiler)) Harris showing his true colours that have been coming out bit by bit all the way through. Secondly, because after the great (((((Spoiler)))) \"King Kong\" speech, the film is finished off in the same vein as the rest of it, with subtlety. It leaves room for interpretation, and, like throughout, it  doesn't over do on emotion. An original, gritty, and refreshing look at a side of street life you don't often see portrayed so well.A well deserved 10/10",

Washington plays an experienced, but corrupted narcotics detective and Hawke as a rookie, but a very loyal detective. Both did very well in their roles, especially Washington which got him an Oscar. Besides the main themes of this movie, it also shows how people change because of corruption and unreliability, therefore portraying the film very realistically. I also liked the fact that despite differences, Harris and Hoyt got along throughout the movie and during the last part, turned against each other: another lesson to learn - money can break anything, even friendship. Good movie, 10 out of 10, i recommend it, a lot of lessons to be learnt.",

            "content": "In Training Day, we get a high energy movie with sharp dialogue, along with a superb performance by Denzel Washington as a rough and tough street cop. It is training day for a rookie cop played by Ethan Hawke, yet, instead of offices, coffee and paperwork, he is given a day with Washington and we the audience are along for the ride.  From the moment both characters meet, we immediately understand who is running the show.  Hawke portrays an innocent, honest, almost naive cop stern in the ways of ethics and laws.  Washington, on the other hand, believes in the law of the streets.  While both arguements for solving crime have been portrayed in a lot of other movies, along with the almost tired partnership of a Black and White cop and their differences, this movie actually works.  Hawke is quite honest and at times naive, but not naive to the point of unbelieveability.  Washington is fiery in his ways of cleaning up the city and his knowledge of 'real policing'. So we come to very much enjoy his presence on the screen because it's as if Washington himself relishes the part of being the bad and disliked character. A role that is refreshingly new for Washington, but you wouldn't know it watching him play it so well. There is a constant back-and-forth sharing of views on how crime should be dealt with by Washington and Hawke. It is amusing to watch Hawke rationalize his views only to be quickly outwitted by Washington's sometimes outrageous antics.  Naturally Hawke must give in slightly because after all, he is the one being trained but also because Hawke sees this opportunity to move higher up in rankings and eventually become detective.Training day is a test for Hawke, but by the end of the movie, it truly is a test on everyone.  A test of judgement, morals, ideals, values.  In other words, an overall test of who we really are as individuals.  And so by the end of training, we and Hawke both find out just that, who we really are. Grade: B",

Just when I thought Denzel Washington with his electrifying acting abilities couldn't blow me away anymore than he already has in past films, he pulls up another trick through his sleeve and dazzles me with yet another powerful dramatic performance!     \nWashington plays an undercover cop teaching his rookie prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ethan Hawke the ways of dealing with the vicious streets of Los Angeles within a single day.  As expected, Denzel is an amazing onscreen presence, but something is quite different here from his previous roles: he is the BAD GUY!  Its quite refreshing seeing him stray off from the usual by-the-book-goodie-two-shoe guys I've seen him portray in his other movies.  Washington has brilliantly acted any character from a freed Civil War era-slave, a South African anti-apartheid leader, a dedicated Gulf War colonel to a tenacious FBI anti-terrorist agent.  Being a crooked officer in \"Training Day\" is a welcome addition to his fine resume of cinematic acting.  \nDenzel's cop is an intriguing exploration into the mind of a seasoned law enforcer bent on utilizing extreme and unorthodox methods of keeping the streets crime-free.  It is quite disturbing and compelling how he attempts to lure Ethan Hawke into his grim underworld of police brutality.  You may loathe his character, but you have to admit that Washington never lets up in keeping the audience entranced in the film.  Had Denzel failed to win the Best Actor Oscar for his awesome performance, I think the Academy should have been sued!  And Ethan Hawke, with an almost equally strong performance (but not quite up to par with Denzel) as Washington's rookie trainee, just as well deserved his nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Here's hoping future cop thrillers will consist of the same caliber as \"Training Day!\"",

On the plus side, I would say that the film's final act is genuinely gripping despite frequent lapses into mindless \"beat-em-up\" mode.

I read some reviews, on here, and frankly I'm astounded that someone will criticise the performance and the film. Its quite obvious that if you didn't like this movie , this isn't your genre. Don't go see it, don't rent it and don't make your comments know. If this isn't your genre ,you don't know Jack about how well made this film was.

I watched a screening copy of it at my apartment in Hollywood then had to walk down the sidewalk for some errands... that's when I realized the hard-hitting nature and true to life perfection of this picture in its portrayal of the LA streets.\nI laugh at the handful of negative comments questioning the quality of writing and/or directing.  Just on the surface (for all those non-film school kids out there), there is a scene where Alonzo and Jake are sitting in a Stan's (?) house when Stan remembers Jake being a great safety in high school.  Everyone who knows football knows that a safety is the lack resort to stopping a quarterback who gets loose.  Later Alonzo makes a comment comparing himself to a quarterback.  Nice writing.  Then there is the scene where Alonzo meets with the heads of the police who are portrayed like Mafia Dons.  It is lit very much like the Godfather with the single (low) light source and a yellow, almost Sepia, filter.  Beautiful directing.Acting?  Coach Boone to Alonzo.  I think that about sums it up.  He does an amazing job and puts you on edge, not only with the lines, but his intensity in his eyes.  That's something that cannot be directed or written.  Ethan Hawke, very subtle but very effective.  Again, his delivery makes the lines jump off the page and turn them into anguish and fear that words just don't capture.As far as just the overall presentation, no, it does not drag.  It's supposed to be scary/real, not over the top unbelievable like Warner Brothers has a bad habit of doing.  It makes you think of what actually could happen, what could go on if it is allowed.Great effort people, keep these types of movies coming.  8/10",

A critic below has argued that there are no flaws in this movie... judging by his writing ability, I'm not surprised he didn't notice any.As a crime-drama, this movie delivers all the violence and fearfully intense scenes that a well made movie of this genre should provide.  However the holes in the plot, particularly towards the end, leave the viewer feeling mugged.  Why would Ethan Hawke's \"rookie\" character, who's defining qualities are his innocence and adherence to moral procedure, decide to go on a vigilante rampage in the end?  Further, how on earth is obtaining that bag of money going to help him out as evidence?  The \"3 wise men\" and Alonzo's crew of rogue NARCS are all after him, to whom is he going to present the bag in order to set the record straight?  And how does he plan on saving his or his family's life for that matter?It seemed like the writers were tired of spinning the tale and decided to call it a night by wrapping the story up in a blaze of glory that left too many loose ends.  As a side note, doesn't anyone else feel that Denzel Washington would have deserved an Oscar for any number of his other roles (Philadelphia, Hurricane, Malcom X)?

I am not kidding when I say the guy next to me was actually sleeping most of the time, and I was close to nodding off too. Ethan was not very believable as \"the tough cop\" in the end, but Denzel was quite good. The film would have been better without the loads of talking, I think people got the hang of the problem within the first 10 minutes of the movie. No need for all that talking. If they cut it all out the film would last about 15 minutes! A lot of \"stars\" was in it, but they didn't really have much to give or say...the director could have made it more interesting if he had focused more on the environment than just the \"problem\".",

            "content": "What looks like a classic cop/gangster scenario at first glance is much more fascinating when boiled down to the interactions of two very distinct character types. The hardened, loud-mouth, streetwise detective (Denzel Washington) against the quiet, nice-guy rookie, who seemingly has a lot to learn (Ethan Hawke). I'm sure most, if not all, know the type of person that easily and consciously draws attention to themselves. Sometimes they are seen as obnoxious and loud, sometimes as lively and entertaining, but they are always at center stage. And weaker characters, be it due to personality traits, social standing or whatever other reason, are often swept away in the wake of such persons. The prolonged exposure to such a character and the struggle to overcome him is what elevates this movie beyond the standard fare of the genre. The other driving point is the old-fashioned standing up for what is right even against the odds, and while those two unfold nicely, the logical integrity of the actual story may become questionable at times. The gritty portrayal of police work and the urban scenery strive to offer a good amount of realism and are indeed successful if one is able to look past the classic police thriller at the surface (and the display of questionable morals that could be too readily decried as wildly unrealistic). The acting and the technical aspects of the movie, as well as the good pacing, help to enable a good amount of immersion.Overall Training Day is a solid movie whose merits lie beyond an entertaining storyline. It is definitely worth a watch, at the very least to relish Denzel's performance.",

In the end this is a good versus evil action movie disguised by a career best performance from Washington and being marketed as a fast paced crime thriller, and if it had presented itself as what it really was I would have like it more.Verdict: The cast do a great job, but it could have been a far greater film had it been directed by, say Spike Lee or Quinten Tarantino.",

THAT IS THE STORY. For the most part, the story works well, with good-guy trainee Hawke finding himself in ever-more compromising positions as Washington builds up to his money-acquiring caper.The only weak part of the plot occurs when Hawke is saved (during a lethal poker game) due to the most far-fetched example of good fortune/coincidence seen in a movie for a long time.

He found unreliable the carefully, rigidly, without unnecessary sentiment reproduced on the screen the realities of one of the megacities of the USA, truly a city of contrasts, where screaming poverty is adjacent to ostentatious luxury, and life flows according to the laws of the jungle? Or did the intrigue itself, which gives the action a sharpness, seem insufficiently tense, or even completely far-fetched, far-fetched?..In my opinion, both possible claims against cinematographers are insignificant and even ridiculous. The first sketches of the idea were ready at Ayer's, for that matter, back in 1995. Among other things, he unwittingly foresaw an inglorious incident related to the exposure of corruption in the ranks of the elite anti-drug unit and entered into the history of overseas law enforcement agencies under the name \"the Rampart Scandal\" (the Rampart Scandal). And the final version of the script allowed the African-American director, who was born, however, in a quieter Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to impressively and accurately write out the mores of the \"bottom\" of life in his urban version. Especially struck was Denzel Washington, who played many roles of noble and idealistic law enforcement officers, who suddenly transformed outwardly2, and above all - internally, presenting himself in the guise of a stern, battered and, as it turns out, a vicious professional. The owner of a strong personality, capable of almost single-handedly controlling a dysfunctional neighborhood, maintaining a fragile social balance and not allowing the streets to plunge into chaos, but at the same time - not forgetting about personal enrichment. Fuqua proved himself a worthy successor of the masters of the 1970s: Sidney Lumet, William Friedkin, Don Siegel.As for the detective intrigue, it, as well as a very subtle, barely noticeable introduction of postmodern motives,3 fits perfectly into the atmosphere. The elements of the popular genre, which turn out to be no less a surprise for the viewer than for Jake, who is genuinely shocked by this turn of events, additionally emphasize the urgency of the moral issues facing the newcomer during this seemingly endless training day - the day of trials.",

Directing was superb and the storyline is believable. My only complain about the movie was that some scenes were just unnecessary. They could have been left out. Definitely a recommended for anybody!

The corrupt cops like Harris appeared with the cop movies but earlyer in secondary roles.Afther the movies like Copland and L.A.Confidential we know that corrupt cops does exist.After 24 hours together with his superior Alonzo Harris,the rookie Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke) will be convinced about this thing.Jake has one day to prove that he is a 'good' cop but he will be pulled deeper and deeper in Alonzo's world,and his life will be changed forever.At the begining he don't knows that his life is in danger,but in the next hours he will run for his life.Housband and father,man of justice,he don't understands Alonzo's actions,he can't cheat,steal or perpetrate a crime.Thinking about his job and his family he respects the orders but when he finds himself responsable of a crime comited by Alonzo takes gun in his hand and starts hunting his superior.Hawke's acting is very good but is a 'shadow' behind Washington's character.Cruel and arrogant,he is Mr.Cool(like John Travolta in 'Swordfish').Denzel Washington is a great actor,this movie is one of his bests. He usually don't plays negative roles but he is the ideal actor for Alonzo. This suspenseful actiondrama is of the 2001's bests,the story reflects the truth,the play of the actors is great and the soundtrack can't be missed.

He did a fine job, just barely good enough to cover up thefact that he was (let's face it) miscast. (And that is a complement tohim, I know I couldn't be miscast into this part and stil pull it off) But anyway, I get turned off by action flicks that try to be more thanaction flicks, and this movie kind of did that. Washington did NOT deserve an award for this. His character wasscripted in such a typical way that all he had to do was put on aconvincing face, hold his gun right and say his lines. Hawk had a MUCH more difficult character to play. There wasconfusion in him, weakness, guilt, value struggle...all that goodstuff. In short, this movie was good in some ways, not good in others.

            "content": "SPOILERS COULD BE CONTAINED HEREIN!The problem with Training Day is not that it's an ordinary film. Far from that, Training Day is a great action film that takes a brutal look at the drug scene and how cops can get lured into its seamier side. The problem is that it could have been a lot lot more than just that.The way I see it there are two threads operating in this film. One is the whole angle of the Training Day. Which is essentially Ethan Hawke's presence in the film and the dynamic of his interaction with Denzel Washington as a rookie cop on his first day. The second angle is that of Denzel Washington as the unconventional cop with the unconventional methods, who finally goes corrupt in a system that's too big and ugly for him.My issue is this - while it can be argued that the first (the training day angle) is nothing more than a plot device, I personally found that it became, at many times, an unnecessary extra storyline.I wish for this - I wish, in some manner, the film had stuck to the downfall of the cop, and not cluttered it with Ethan Hawke's character's presence (no issue with his performance, just his character). I wish it had reduced his presence to a narrator, a fly on the wall, in some way. I wish they'd moulded his character to be like a little man in the big world of drug crime, watching and trying to make sense of what's going on. I wish, in fact, that they'd stuck to the main story - that of an unconventional, yet corrupt cop caught in corrupt world and doing desperate things to cope with it.I feel if this had happened, the film could have been something else altogether. A niche tragedy about a particular profession. A story of the downfall of one powerful man. Perhaps (at a stretch) a bit like how Wall Street is a tragedy about the business world and how it can eat up its very own. Training Day could have been an awesome commentary on the meaning of survival and the sometimes difficult choices one has to make to survive. It could have had us empathising much more with Denzel's character, even while loathing it for his flaws.Unfortunately, the film doesn't entirely play upon this aspect, and in trying to be one too many things, seems to loose its way. No doubt, some elements of greatness are present, or I wouldn't even be writing this - but unfortunately by showing us how good it 'could' have been, the film ends up leaving you unsatisfied. It, of course, remains a terrific action movie worth a look. Unfortunately, it remains just that.",

The good cop bad cop metaphor is taken to new territory in this film.In the movie, the idealism of rookie cop Jack Hoyt (Hawke) is violently juxtaposed with the Machiavelian cynicism of the veteran detective Alonzo (Washington).(In my opinion Washington gives the most stunning portrayal of a jaded cop since Gary Oldman in \"Romeo is Bleeding\".)I will not delve into a plot summary, however, I will note that Antoine Fuqua's third film is by far his most truthful and memorable. It stands so far above the entertaining but pointless 'Bait' and the just plain crappy 'Replacement Killers', that I cannot believe that they were made by the same man. In the previous two films it was as if Fuqua was trying to make movies that were to seem that they were autered by more prominent directors (John Woo and Michael Bay to be exact).However, in this film, the director has garnered his own voice, and he has some very important things to say about race, right and wrong, cops and criminals, and about the lines that blur between them all.The true brilliance of this film, however may not be the message that Fuqua wants to convey, but rather the sheer mix of subtlety and outright vicery though which he does convey it. This film is not perfect (which films are?) but it is very important, and it is very ballsy and that is what counts.8.5/10.",

Still, Training Day is one of those infuriating movies that could have been much better if the writer and director had trusted the audience more. The movie is seriously undermined by the \"motivation\" provided for Denzel's corrupt actions on this day, namely, his need to obtain money to pay off the Russian mafia. Denzel's character has already been set up well to have the mixed motivations of ridding the world of major drug figures and, at the same time, enrich himself for the risk he is taking. His complex character, and the tension with Ethan's character, drive the plot. The extra motivation undermines the drama, making it a more standard shoot 'em up. So for most of the film, the tension and drama is high. But the last few scenes undermine the drama.",

He(Denzel) does a really good job playing a crook , corrupt cop who takes advantage of his position to commit crimes... and he also uses his apprentice , a rookie cop called Jake(Ethan Hawke) to do something the he(Denzel) has set up... Frankly , i seriously think this was one of Denzel Washington best performance ever and that movie should be considered as a classic gangster movie...However, I think that the ending is great but could have been different , less brutal...Anyway, if you are someone who likes crime , gangster movies you'll will really appreciate this movie",

The Academy Award for best actor must go to Denzel Washington for giving what I believe to be the greatest performance of his career as well as one of the greatest performances of any actor in history.  Denzel is the character, \"Alonzo Harris\". He uses every existing talent within himself to make the portrayal of this character as \"real\" as any character that has ever appeared on the screen.  I have always considered Denzel a great actor since I first saw him in \"Carbon Copy\". He is without question, simply the best actor in the world.  \"Training Day\" is the vehicle that puts it all out there. Thank you Denzel for caring enough to give the performance of a lifetime.",

There are no plot holes as far as I'm concerned, although I agree that one should see the film again to catch the crucial conversations that reveal some background plot elements -- but it is isn't too hard to catch on to the storyline. Denzel Washington's performance is incredible; viewers will forget his past \"good guy\" performances as they are absorbed into the dark depth of this crooked, but experienced, narcotics officer.  You will not look at the \"crooked cop\" idea in the same generic way after seeing this film. He deserved the \"Best Actor\" Oscar, but it's a bit disappointing (but not TOO much) that it was for a bad guy role, after all of his remarkable previous movie performances. Ethan Hawke's performance as the trainee was very believable as well, for his \"training\" was a true crucible in deciding whether ridding the streets of criminals took becoming a criminal. Though it's a rough movie in terms of language and thematics, the violence was not as pervasive.  The disturbing imagery gives the film a serious but effective tone in encapsulating street life and the moral clashes between Harris (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), and their dealings with real criminals.  Impressive and disturbingly powerful flick.",

There's too much emotion in this daring story to leave room for cool, logical judgment. This created a paradox: the story may be flawed, but still 100% realistic.  Welcome to L.A., where the most dangerous killer gang is the police, and where half of the city's officials belong in jail.  Both crowds share the same contempt for anything straight, and see the public as enemy.I can fully understand why the authors may have been too carried away by emotion (by their \"beef\" with the cops and corrupt officials) to analyze their own story in detail.  Denzel is one of the nicest, straightest guys you can imagine in real life - and so are most of the others.  Yes, even the rap singers. Previous critics said all that needed to be said about this movie, excepting its amazing realism outside the story.  That's because most critics live outside Southern California.  Planning a visit to L.A.?  You don't need it - just rent this movie and save a few bucks for a trip somewhere else. The joke with the snail, in the movie, sums it up.  Don't visit L.A. unless you \"get it\" - otherwise it may be quite a dangerous trip.",

True, their may be a lot of fact involved in this film which forces people to look for real life issues. To me that is just one of the things that makes this movie good. Denzel plays every character in the movies he's been in very well. It's too bad he had to play a negative role to win an Oscar but that's a separate issue. All in all, Denzel is one of, if not the best out there. I have yet too see a bad Denzel movie and this man has a long history. Few actors can say that. They have at least one stinker.

The film was pre-screened to gang members and the police to ensure its authenticity. This is a gritty, not pretty film. It has not been hollywoodized to appeal to the masses. It doesn't have a happy ending, the good guys don't always win...much like real life. The movie projects a definite shade of gray, so please don't look for black hats and white hats. For Ethan Hawke's character, it is his journey into the Heart of Darkness, with Denzel Washington, as his Kurtz.For those who complain that Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for best Actor; perhaps you should ask yourselves why he was not nominated for Malcolm X, and why he failed to win for The Hurricane.

The reason that i love this film is because the world (or at least those in power for the past 500 years, respectively) IS totally corrupt.

I would have thought Denzel conquered all the risky roles early in his career, opting now for more subdued, sympathetic, and audience-friendly characters like those in `Remember the Titans' and the inappropriately named `The Hurricane'.  I would have thought that Ethan Hawke had an open clause in his contract about never appearing without facial hair.But Antoine Fuqua's gritty and sobering `Training Day' breaks all the rules. Having developed his craft early on directing music videos and television commercials, he emerged boldly into the box office limelight in 1998 with `Replacement Killers' and then fizzled with last years' disappointing and forgettable Jamie Foxx action yawn `Bait'.  He returns this fall, taking the reigns of a virile and invigorating script by David Ayer, a young writer whose career is still in it's infancy but is already well-established in testosterone-wielding fun with last years `U-571' and Universal Studios summer paycheck `The Fast and the Furious' ($144M at last count).Ethan Hawke birthed his reputation as the quintessential slacker, apparently living in a world where combs, razors, and clothes that fit are luxury items.  Dissolving the typecast, he stars (though less brightly than Denzel) as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic straight-edge officer on his first day in a covert narcotics unit headed up by Denzel's Alonzo Harris.  Hawke's character quickly learns that his initiation into the squad is a one-way street, and he has one day to iron out the ethics of either turning dirty or fighting dirty.Denzel Washington, as the bad-ass deep-undercover corrupt cop, revamps the powerfully watchful and angrily militant guise that he first debuted in `Malcolm X', extending something remarkably spiritual and endearing to the prospect of a police officer playing vigilante or dipping into confiscated drug money.  He maintains the sanctimony and passive aggression that built his career, this time laced with the Tourette's-induced, crazed paranoia that first surfaced in his cop-over-the-edge in `Richochet'.  His role here makes you forget that he previously lent his eponymous notoriety to such self-gratifying box-office fodder as `The Bone Collector' or `Virtuosity' and makes you remember that he once took center stage at the Academy Awards (Best Actor 1989, `Glory').This movie also contains notable cameos from Macy Gray and Dr. Dre, the former displaying the most impractical, keyboard-frightening manicure to grace the big screen since Lon Chaney's Wolfman, and the latter serving up the irony as an L.A. police officer (for more information, see N.W.A.'s 1988 release `F*** the Police').  Snoop Doggy Dogg also had a small but all-too-believable part as a junkie, despite a hectic schedule starring in four releases this year, as well as any movie from the last three years with misspelled titles.  See `Hot Boyz' (1999) or `Tha Eastsidaz' (2000).At first, the mood leans toward that of philosophical street-smart police discipline, but eventually vents it's energy in the struggle between the main characters, with each pushing the other to unrehearsed limits.  The ending feels somewhat like the beginning of a saga - the two battle to a completion that seems eternally incomplete, as the hero and villain confound one another's personalities and seem naturally entwined.  This is a must-see for Denzel fans, and a potent oak-hearted battle of wits, might, and morality that can be appreciated by anyone who thinks that society still has much evolving to do.

I thought the plot was as well worked out as alonzo's plan for hoyt and the way the girl's wallet got hoyt outta the bath and previously the 'blood test' no backing out barrier that alonzo enforces. Another reason why i love this movie is for its quotes and when still dre kicks in when denzel flicks the switches is legendary. Not coming from an environment as bad as that myself, i thought that training day like 187 and i a way the shield does, gives a view of that harsh culture not portrayed as clearly in boyz n the hood n menace.

In this movie you really have to wonder if, for Washington, that good vs. evil line is ever drawn.I feel the best part of the movie, and most suspensful, is the poker game scene.  It makes a viewer truly identify with the vulnerablitity of being completely isolated, and defensless, amidst a den of cold-hearted strangers.I would recommend seeing this movie, if for any reason to see a slightly different angle to the traditional Hollywood-cop-movie formula.",

What Denzel Washington's character (Alonzo) mostly does is evidently the 'wrong' convention of doing things; it does sometimes looks like this 'cop' has a pretty decent idea about how things work (he even exclaims during one scene, \"Nothing's free in this world, Jake. Not even arrest..\") This makes Alonzo implausible.The film aptly uses the location of Los Angeles, which suffers from the socio-economic issue of drug cartels and gang wars, also relevant to the plot's context.I've seen it once as of, but definitely wouldn't mind watching again, since it's no-campy, complex story line makes one to delve deeper into it's dialogues, thus increasing it's re-playing ability.",

However, the movie grew more and more violent as it moved along, I thought overtaking the suspenseful first half build-up. By the end, I was sorry we took our teenage daughter. More importantly, the movie's plot doesn't stand up to the plausibility test. Alonzo's driving motivation seems to stem from a hazy, out of the movie run-in he had with Russian gangsters in Las Vegas. Coincidentally or not, the day he must resolve this issue is also an orientation day for rookie Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Over the course of the day, unlikely yet critical events tumble over one another toward a predictable violent climax. One thing I couldn't figure out: Why would Alonzo choose to live right in the middle of the worst drug neighborhood in LA?",

But is Alonzo the truth the way and the light or a seductive demon? There's enough seduction and mystery to keep us interested. There is a boatload of really good acting between the two leads as they drive around the streets of LA fulfilling Alonzos agenda. Unfortunately the movie has two really week moments for which I suspect director Antoine Fuqua is still taking heat. Both moments are heroic unbelievable revivals of Jake. I suggest Antoine should have made an alternate ending without such a heroic revival and stuck that on the DVD for the viewers who were taken out of their theatre seats and put on the streets of LA. 4 stars.",

If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you?

The fact that most of us can not conceive of disliking Denzel Washington is precisely what makes Alonzo Harris ( his character ) compelling. The evil of this crooked \"wolf\" is so plausibly wrapped in charm and humanity, that the decision to dislike him is painful. Denzel causes us to empathize with Hoyt's ( Ethan Hawke's ) gut wrenching dilemma - the audience is forced into the same, brutal indecision. Hawke skillfully plays his part, and is totally believable. I could identify with his character in every hesitation, and each surrender. All in all, a brilliant film.

Jake Hoyt is having such a day as he starts a new job in the narcotics squad with his new bad-ass boss Alonzo Harris. Detective Harris is loud, bad and mean and knows the streets like he was born and bred in them.  Is he for real? Or is he testing Jake to see if he has the right stuff to make it down these mean streets of L.A., we shall see.wont we?Training Day, the just released on video movie that I just got around to seeing, is a nightmare first day on the job film.  It's 24 hours in the life of a rookie who figures on making detective if he joins the narcotics squad and rids the streets of drugs and baddies.  Unbeknownst to him, one of the baddest baddies is sitting right next to him, in the form of the devil himself played by now Oscar winner Denzel Washington.  Denzel's Detective Harris is the devil incarnate make no mistake about it.  He is the tempter in the wilderness, the one who will offer you the world if you would just bow down and worship him.just a little.   Okay, just murder for him and he will grant your every wish and devour your soul in the process.  In the next day, Officer Hoyt will not know what to believe and will not believe his own eyes.  The ideal world he envisioned will disintegrate around him and reduce him to an animal just trying to survive.  Detective Beelzebub will show him that the world is a jungle and there is a fine line between good and evil that cops have to occasionally jump to and from in order to survive.  The lessons being dealt are tough and cruel, to the extent that the film goes from unsentimental reality to surrealism.  No one can be this bad, no one can withstand this kind of punishment and fury, can they?\nBeing good is so much harder then being bad.  Being deliciously bad is so much fun and Denzel Washington is almost giddy reveling in the flesh of Alonzo Harris.  I could not take my eyes off of him, his line delivery and body language is razor sharp and he is truly one of our most gifted film actors.  Every scene he is in, and he is on camera for 90% of the movie, crackles with electricity, talking street jive and howling like a wolf. Detective Harris is the alpha wolf, the leader of men, the prince of darkness who rules hell because it is preferable to serving in heaven. The film is lifted and sustained by him to heights much higher then the pulp fiction it actually is.  His performance is mesmerizing and deservedly received awards and much praise.Denzel's partner in Training Day, playing Jake Hoyt, is Ethan Hawke.  His job is much harder, he is the good one, therefore the boring voice in the wilderness expressing his concerns and unsure of what to believe and do through most of his grueling first day on the job.  Being good is hard work, and Mr. Hawke actually does a fine job delivering the goods.  In the past, I've found him too introspective to be exciting on the screen.  Too often he blends into the scenery and becomes good-looking Scandinavian furniture. But surprise, he actually holds his own beside the evil one and delivers a solid, respectable performance.Director Antoine Fuqua's Training day is a fantasy disguised as a gritty tough street film about police corruption.  Is this really going on to this extent, I don't really believe it.  Are there bad cops playing both sides of the fence, sure, but the 24 hours on display here are movie hours. Nothing can be believed but it can certainly be enjoyed as a surrealistic trip thru Dante's Inferno via Los Angeles.  Fuqua, much like David Fincher's Fight Club, takes us on a trip through the heart of darkness and I went along for the ride and liked most of it, especially Denzel's turn being so good at playing bad.",

With great anticipation, I watched Denzel Washington (who I believe walks on water) take on his first roll as a bad guy. Even though his performance was stellar, there was just something significantly wrong with this film throughout. While contemplating the thin line between art imitating life and its opposite, consider the following.A Hollywood good guy who takes on the role of a bad guy is best served by pairing with someone who is also reputed as good. Remember the movie \"Heat\"? Ethan Hawke is not that guy.While the movie was set in the most notorious urban jungle, the good cop managed to do some things that simply can't be done by a white cop in a real environment of the same notoriety. Even people from the squeaky clean suburbs know that downtrodden minorities have no love (or trust) for white police officers simply because they are white (the oppressor). I could go on criticizing Training Day for other little quirks, but it really would not matter. There truly is only one reason why this potentially great movie (great like Gladiator) won't ever be regarded as such. Somebody made a fatal casting mistake. If Cuba Gooding Jr. had been the rookie, you can bet that this movie would have been in line for several Oscar awards. As fate would have it instead, Denzel Washington's first performance as a bad guy may go down in history as a forgettable moment. Imagine a sequel to this movie starring Ethan Hawke now as a veteran.

From the second the movie began, I was confronted with some of the worst American action movie cliches.  There was everything from frontal nudity during gun fights to gratuitously graphic violence that even had me (a very desensitized American movie goer compared to most) angry at the graphic detail in which some scenes were allowed to go into.  The way that the different races were represented in this movie gives me little to no hope of racism ever ending....especially when I see the way that Hollywood continues to portray ethnic groups.  This movie in particular painted namely females, Russians, blacks, and Puerto Ricans in a negative light.  I was disgusted to see all of the minorities being shown as \"the bad guys\".  I don't think I can say anything positive about this movie.",

The moral dilemnas and predicaments that arise for the aspiring narcotics officer are real problems that officers must face at times.  The movie portrays how some officers find themselves in the \"underworld\" environment, without ever planning to enter it.The scene in the car, after they do the felony stop on the teenagers, shows how a seemingly strong-minded cop might be manipulated and it all starts there.I was also impressed by the realism as far as police work.  The way the suspects refuse to cooperate, the artificial respect of the dealers with the cops, the drug sell hunting, the drug swallowing, the language, etc.If you're a law enforcement officer, especially a patrol cop, this is a REQUIRED viewing.Let's remember that as extreme as the film might seem, most of it happens regularly in the big cities.

It's best if I draw a comparison:Anyone familiar with \"Once Upon A Time in the West\"?  Anyone?  Show of Hands?  Let me illustrate the opening scene.  Typical opener for a Western: Low down, yella bellied, rattlesnake types roughing up a small homestead. Roof burning, windows shot up, family dying.  A small child huddles against his parents' lifeless bodies.  A shadow looms over him.  The boy gazes at the man casting the shadow:  From the boots up, up, up, into the leering face of...Henry Fonda.Yes, THAT Henry Fonda.\"Young Mr. Lincoln\" Fonda.\"Golden Pond\" Fonda.HENRY F---ING FONDA.And THAT is the effect Denzel \"Detective Alonzo\" Washington had on me while watching \"Training Day\".  The exact same shock some filmgoer in the late sixties would have had the first time Henry clean-as-a-slate Fonda was cast as a scummy murderer.Okay, back to your lives now.

Many, many unwanted aspects of society are part of this movie, putting it in another way : they ARE the movie. It gives an extremely dark, pitch-black image of the edges of modern society and the people trying to control it.The tough, experienced officer forces his colleage through nice words and brute violence to break numerous laws, in order to \"adapt to the streets\".

            "content": "The magic of the movies is that they allow us to see worlds and experience emotions that are sometimes distant from our own and our immediate environment. Antoine Fuqua in Training day brings to us a world of gangs, drugs and corruption that is alien to must of us, but which nevertheless exists, sometimes transcending its own borders and coming to us in the form of news (The rampart scandal) and no matter if we close our eyes and ignore it, it will not go away. In that world we have two police officers, officer Hoyt, a rookie just assigned to an elite anti narcotics unit, and officer Alonzo, a veteran of the force, commanding the unit. Each one of those officers has his own set of values and morality, but no one is completely good or completely evil as absolute evil or absolute good are inexistent (in humans at least), ultimately they just want to take care of their own problems. Hoyt wants to take care of his family, his young wife, his new born child, he wants to escalate positions (don't we all) in the force and this new assignment may be the perfect place to start and he will do anything to nail it. Officer Alonzo has a more complicated set of problems, he has to get a million dollars and he has to do it today; otherwise he will be killed by the Russian mafia, but he has a plan and the plan involves Hoyt (a virgin shooter above suspicion) and Roger (a drug dealer with a lot of money in his kitchen floor). Basically the movie unfolds as Alonzo's plan goes into motion showing us glimpses of a corrupt and disturbing world, a world with its own rules and twisted morality, Smiley forgiving Hoyt's life as a return for having protected his cousin's honor, gang members shooting indiscriminately to protect the sandman's property, Stan and his friends giving Alonzo carte blanch to basically kill Roger and steal his money so he can save himself, etc. Denzel Washington work was impeccable; a well deserved Oscar, showing us a man who has moved the line a little bit each time to the point that he doesn't know where he is now, a man who has moved to the edge in a desperate attempt to save his life. Is he really that bad? After all he is a father, a husband, a friend appreciated by his team (if you think you can get away with it, we are with you) and colleagues. Maybe we just caught him in a bad day...a training day. If we want to make a better society for every one, we have to know what are the obstacles we have to overcome, training day show us some of those obstacles and then some.",

However the release of the film hurt its chances of being an Oscar contender by releasing it late summer. If it had been released during Christmas it would have been getting the rave reviews as A Beautiful Mind and Black Hawk Down have been receiving. It is without a doubt, the most underrated movie of 2001.Although, I am glad to have seen Washington nominated for Best Actor in the Golden Globes, hopefully the Academy will carry that over to the Oscars.Acting is superb, especially with Ethan Hawke! With a supporting cast such as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg -- who were unexpectedly GREAT actors, despite their short screen presence (there are no small parts, only small actors.)The realism of the movie makes you think that the director actually went out on the streets of LA and actually filmed the real lives of corrupted cops and druglords. This movie is a MUST BUY DVD or VHS.",

            "content": "(Some spoilers here)I thought that the plot of this movie was just horrible. The movie was somewhat complex, but we don't ever see Alonzo's motives or anything like that until Jake meets Smiley and his crew. Before, it's just like hey, let's go here and beat this rapist, then this druggie, etc. This movie is the type of film that I would typically abhor to see because the script in my opinion was too redundant at times.If anything saved this film, it was the casting. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke gave the best possible performances in this otherwise crappy film. They fit their characters' roles perfectly and you can see it in their eyes. I am wondering why Ethan Hawke wasn't nominated for Best Actor along with Denzel Washington, instead of Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars as I think Hoyt is also a main character. Nevertheless, this acting duo is what has made a film with a horrible script viewable, because Training Day is the worst script with the best possible actors. This is definitely shown because Training Day had two Oscar nominations, for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, and nothing else. Denzel Washington of course won the movie's only Oscar, but I don't know if this was his best performance ever. Nevertheless, Washington deserved the Oscar in 2001, and he is finally recognized as one of THE premier actors in Hollywood.",
