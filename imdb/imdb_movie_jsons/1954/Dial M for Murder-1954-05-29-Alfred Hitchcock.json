            "content": "A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, \"Dial M For Murder\" is Hitchcock's second \"drawing-room perfect murder\" movie, after \"Rope\", the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious \"Rear Window\" which immediately followed it in his career.However. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.Yes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn't grown out of by \"Marnie\" some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it's well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who'd want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it's pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade (since \"Saboteur\" in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes, it's old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it's old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.",

            "review_title": "The stage-originated dialogue sings with intelligence, wit, and an easy transition to the screen",
            "content": "There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's \"Dial M for Murder,\" and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for \"Dial M for Murder\" on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's \"Rope,\" though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen \"Dial M for Murder\" two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though \"Dial M for Murder\" pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: \"Goodbye, my dear.\" The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though \"Dial M for Murder\" was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. \"Dial M for Murder\" is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production.",

            "review_title": "The perfect film for the perfect murder...",
            "content": "After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure, \"Mogambo\", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western \"High Noon\", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. \"Dial M for Murder\" was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.The movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony's plan's infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.Like most Hitchcock's films, \"Dial M for Murder\" was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott's script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it's easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.It seems that Hitchcock's knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock's classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock's use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott's dialog to shine.Without disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly's talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming \"villian\". Milland's performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.In many ways, \"Dial M for Murder\" shares many things with \"Rope\", as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both \"experiments\": while \"Rope\" was conceived as a \"movie in one take\", \"Dial M for Murder\" was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock's use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices' apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with \"stuff coming out of the screen\" (as seen in for example, \"House of Wax\"). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it.\"Dial M for Murder\" is probably less celebrated than the Master's most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as \"Rear Window\" (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him. 9/10",

            "content": "What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.Cold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasn't paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didn't get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? It's incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear - it's fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a now-dead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, it's a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock.",

            "content": "Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player, unhappily married to Margot (Grace Kelly), correctly guesses that she has been cheating, with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.Dial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it's weird in that even though she's cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he's trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.Alfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie.",

            "review_title": "Fantastic Hitchcock murder mystery",
            "content": "Another excellent Hitchcock film, just one of the many that the director made which exceeded all my expectations. This murder mystery has a twist - we know the identity of the culprit from the start, it's just a question of waiting to see whether the cast work it out or not. The film takes place in a single location, a low key apartment, much like the Audrey Hepburn thriller WAIT UNTIL DARK. It's a slow paced and talky affair with an absolutely intricate plot that's likely to tie you up in circles if you don't watch it closely enough, but of course that's part of the fun.Personally, I thought the script was superb - one of the best, ever. Every little detail has been worked out and even if there are a couple of weak explanations along the way, you can easily forgive them thanks to how enjoyable watching the twists and turns play out is. The clever title refers to the pivotal scene, a sterling set-piece of suspense and murder, in which the lovely Grace Kelly is menaced by a sinister thug. Ray Milland is the deliciously slimy anti-hero and I love his stiff upper lip and confident air of self-assurance that propels him along throughout the movie. John Williams, a carry-over from the stage play on which this is based, supplies the much-needed comic relief and Anthony Dawson is as delightfully sinister as he's ever been.The fun from this film comes from watching Hitchcock ratchet up the suspense in numerous unexpected ways - such as the simple turning of a key in a lock. There isn't a clich\u00e9 in sight, just strong plotting and decent scriptwriting. I even enjoyed this over the Hitchcock film I watched previously, NORTH BY NORTHWEST; it's one of those films where I wouldn't change a thing. I know I'm gushing, but this is a real treat. NB. I've recently re-watched this film in 3D, but that aspect is almost needless, merely adding depth to a few sequences; there's only one stand-out bit (during the attempted murder) so I wouldn't go to the trouble, personally.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, directing classics such as Psycho, North by Northwest and Rebecca. While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly.  She played in Hitchcock's classic \"Rear window\" and she won an Oscar for best actress in \"The country girl\" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, \"Dial M for murder\".  Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time.  In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being \"Psycho\" (although I haven't seen \"Rear window\" yet).  Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player.  However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings).  Mark writes crime stories.  The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it.  So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife.  But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go.  So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time.  The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark.  He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife.  What follows this is pure entertainment at its best.  As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery.  He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be.  Another of his great performances is in \"Witness for the prosecution\" where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case.  As for \"Dial M for murder\", well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost.",

            "content": "The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott \"Dial M for Murder\" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film \"A Perfect Murder\" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. \"Dial M for Murder\" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call \"Dial M for Murder\" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes.",

            "content": "With \"Dial M For Murder\", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed \"Rear Window\", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but \"Dial M for Murder\" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.I. Dial M for \u0085 MurderThe Murder takes place right in the middle of the story and like in \"Psycho\", it's defined by what precedes and what follows, it's the emotional reward of a patient but powerful build-up while the resolution is an intelligent case of manipulation. The build-up is the construction of a perfect crime, Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, presents to the killer, a remarkable Anthony Edwards, the killing's plan as if it was a simple technical operation, following an incredibly methodical scheme, admirably meticulous if it wasn't for the purpose of killing. Hitchcock's masterful direction creates a plot within the plot, at a point you wonder if you're watching the adapted play within a film, or a film that transcended the confined setting of the play. And the second and crucial element of the build-up subtly hints the fact that there's always a human factor that undermines any attempt of perfectionism. So, when comes the time of the murder, we have these two parameters, we know how it should happen, but we keep in mind that whatever must go wrong will go wrong. How? When? Where? This is what the whole first part of the suspense is about.II. Dial M for \u0085 MistakeWhat could have been a lazy exercise of adaptation becomes in the hands of the Master, an extraordinary thriller confined in an elegant room sometimes welcoming, sometimes claustrophobic. The handling of the space and the various objects that occupy it, a telephone, sockets, scissors, keys, the way the camera shows them or hides them till the right moment is crucial in the way they organize what would lead to the fatal mistake. We only see what the characters can see and Hitchcock's manipulative effects consists on the way he lets the human factor affect the story only during the villainous parts. As much as we don't really care for the love story, because Christopher Hummings who plays the lover, Halliday, is probably the least charismatic of all, we sort of root for the villains, because of that 'humanity' displayed by the mistake. The point is that the murder is so well crafted, that there's a little evil voice inside us that wishes it could work, but again, this is Grace Kelly, and the sight of that creature in danger immediately reverses the rooting process, and then while her hands desperately seek a providential help, one pair of scissors theatrically conclude the heart of the film and the ruthless killer, becomes a worthless killer, before falling as a victim, or a collateral damage at best. The mistake is not just a plot device, it's Hitchcock's cynical insertion of humanity in a rather cold and emotionless mindset.III. Dial M for \u0085 ManipulationThere's an interesting trivia about the title's translation in French: \"The Crime Was Almost Perfect\", which conveys the inevitability of human factor like fate in Greek tragedies. It is, no pun intended, the key element of the evolution and resolution of the plot, when Wendice will exploit the mistake to his advantage. Tony Wendice is impressive, because he's simply predicted everything, and he puts the level so high, that even Halliday couldn't accuse him, although, in the way he deconstructed the murder when trying to convince Wendice to find an alibi to save his wife Margot from execution, he concluded on what could have been the true motive of the murder but he was not in the same caliber than his opponent, hence the entrance of Detective Hubbard, played by an elegant, suave and scene-stealing John Williams. And it's only justice, that he could outfight Wendice by using his very weapon, manipulation. It's all about manipulating objects, space and people and on that level, Wendice found his archenemy.IV. Dial M for \u0085 MillandRay Milland is perfect as the quintessential upper class villain, elegant, sophisticated and absolutely and totally unflappable, and I use the word 'perfect' as the reference to the French title. A perfect murder needs a perfect villain whose perfect scheme wouldn't be undermined by any external factor, except something under his own control. The casting of Milland also works because he's the one who outshines the other characters, his wife is the victim, the man he hires also appear as the victim, when he tries to kill Grace, you can look on his eyes, that he was a 'casting' error, Milland also underestimated his wife's strength as she managed to overcome her fear and become the killer. But Milland is the only one who doesn't change, totally unflappable, he's the pillar of the film, and the film is so confident that even when he's caught, he doesn't flinch an eye.V. Dial M for \u0085 MelodramaThe film also allows to insert some melodramatic elements to engage our sympathy toward the couple, but it's clear that this just works as the foil to justify the murder, and inspire some sympathy toward Milland, when you see him with Margot, all in white, in the opening scene, then she's wearing a bright and dazzling red dress with Halliday. In one minute, Hitchcock masterfully highlighted the treachery that would inspire Tony's crime. The love will be Halliday's motive to fight for innocence but again, it's only with the same weapons that Wendice could've been defeated.\u0085 so whether it's for murder, manipulation, Milland or melodrama, you know you'll dial a definite M for \u0085 Masterpiece.",

Some of the more clever guys at the lab had connections with hobbyists in the area, and also with local film enthusiasts connected with the city artfilm theater. They'd arranged for a reconstruction of the three-D version of this. I made a special trip for what was billed as the only week ever this would be shown.It was originally filmed in 3D, using an unusual process. Two cameras made two color prints. These were delivered together to the theater and shown with two synchronized projectors on the same screen through polarizing lenses. Polarized glasses allowed the viewer to see color 3D.Almost immediately after release, the process was abandoned because the projectors required amazing skill and were extraordinarily complicated, expensive and unreliable. To reconstruct the original effect, several years went into the location of most of the original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized to create the complete kit of Siamese twin projectors. Some missing precision parts may have been fabricated in a spooky government research lab; I cannot say. That was only the first impossibility.What had happened shortly after the film was released over 50 years ago, within a few months, was that the left and right prints were separated and distributed as \"ordinary\" versions. To reconstruct a pair, you need to have every single frame match. But no prints had all frames complete. Some had been edited by exhibitors for various reasons like time. Others had been broken and respliced and some of those repairs even reversed. Some had frames snipped to create publicity stills. Still others had both some left and some right elements.It apparently was a tremendous effort to scan all prints a frame at a time and reconstruct a matched pair. A previous 3D version had been released, but it was no help, in fact unwatchable. It reduced the process to the older black and white and didn't do the matching this team did. Its horrible, and not even 3D in some places.So I made a special trip to see this in Dayton as it was intended. Hitchcock made this in his spare time while preparing for his masterful \"Rear Window.\" It was already a hit play, and his contribution was to design the blocking for 3D. Its important because Hitchcock was a master in advancing the notion of a spatial camera, a space-savvy eye. Some of what he did here is not only extraordinary on its own, but it can be seen as a sort of sketchpad for some of the indirectly referenced effects on \"Rear Window.\" So if you are interested in the world, then you are interested in film in space, and then \"Rear Window,\" and as a result this in 3D.I not only saw this, but arranged to have the optimum seat in the house. And the place was packed with some of the most enlightened viewers I knew and the swelling of sighs at points was palpable. It was an extraordinary experience. The vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because of Republican actions in Congress. I believe the reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever, so the window may have closed to see this properly.You'll have to extrapolate the 3D effects from a two-d print. Its not impossible I suppose. I'll give you some clues. He places the camera in one of three modes, alternating among them depending on whether we are colluding, witnessing or dissecting. (The trial scene is excluded from this.) Obviously, these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with: the husband (a performer), the boyfriend \"mystery writer,\" or the detective. Its easy to work out and quite thrilling to see how he has \"dialed\" the vision.This is a replacement comment, the original having been deleted (along with scores of others) by a reader unhappy with comments elsewhere I made about an unrelated actor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

Tony quits playing to dedicate to his wife and finds a regular job and she decides to give a second chance for their marriage. When Mark arrives from America to visit the couple, Margot tells him that she had destroyed all his letter but one that was stolen in a depot; then she was blackmailed through letters but she had never retrieved the stolen letter. Tony arrives home and claims that he needs to work, and asks Margot to go with Mark to the theater. Meanwhile Tony calls the scum Captain Lesgate - aka Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) that studied with him in the college and blackmails him to murder his wife, so that he would inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime, and things do not work as planned by Tony.\"Dial M for Murder\" is one of the best thrillers of cinema history, with a theatrical story supported by an excellent screenplay and top-notch performances. Ray Milland is superb in the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice; Grace Kelly is extremely gorgeous and sweet in the role of a wife in the 50's; and John Williams is great in the role of the efficient and fussy Chief Inspector Hubbard. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the picture of Tony's reunion. In 1998, Andrew Davis remade this movie with \"A Perfect Crime\", with Michael Douglas, Gwineth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen.

Tony figures out what might have led his wife astray and fixes it - he gets a real job with a real boss. But what if his wife divorces him? He'd get nothing! Realizing that getting a job may have enlarged his wife's respect for him but not diminished her affection for the lover, he spends a large amount of time figuring out a perfect way to kill his wife so that he can inherit her money. Tony has nothing personal against Margot and her infidelity, he just can't take the chance of winding up penniless. He can't do the job himself - the husband is always the prime suspect in such matters. So, he must find someone who will be willing to do the job for him. He's not the type who hangs with organized crime types, so he has to find someone already guilty of murder but yet untouched by the law and get that person to agree to do the job for him.It sounds perfect. Tony even has the lover with him as an alibi the night the murder is to occur. But everything does go wrong, and now Tony has to retool his perfect murder. Who will kill Margot for Tony? The law of course! Watch this great little thriller and see what I'm talking about.Most directors lose a step after they are in their 50's. There is just something about their creativity that just fizzles, and I say that as someone who is 55 myself. But here Hitchcock is at age 55 doing some of his best and most clever work. This one is so ironic it could be considered a film noir if not for the elegance of the players, the setting, and that great score.Just one thing that nobody ever seems to talk about much - did anybody else want Tony to get away with it just a little? He does play it icy cold and smiling throughout, but when he makes the phone call that sets everything in motion, you can see the regret in his face - the fact that he hates that this is the way that it must be. Meanwhile my sympathy was not with the cheating wife and especially the false friend Mark Halliday. The guy was sleeping with a man's wife while pretending to be his friend, even carrying on a kissing session with her while the husband went down the street for an errand. If you're going to steal someone's wife, let it be a stranger's. Don't shake the guy's hand, eat the guy's food, and accept his hospitality and take his wife behind his back too. Maybe Hitch wanted the audience to be conflicted though, maybe he was trying to add to the complexity of the situation with this added dimension. At any rate, watch this if you get a chance. In fact, watch it more than once. You'll always see something you didn't see before.",

            "content": "This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies  from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace  (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and  bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.  This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must  go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which  the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring  Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering  unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful  Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.  Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her  diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married  mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief  Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian  flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache  after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's  American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who  might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the  photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.  The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that  (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this  movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and  Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed.  I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie  and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood  what happened. Follow the latchkey!  Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such  intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone,  even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury  might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's  fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity  after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by  marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and  something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy  Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries  for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well.  At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display  here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but  certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and  her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She  was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her  ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James  Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window  (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby  for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.  So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore)  look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a  layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.  By the way, the \"original theatrical trailer\" preceding these Warner  Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the \"Coming  Attractions\"--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo. You  might want to fast forward to the movie itself.",

The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly & Robert Cummings both pale in comparison, although Grace is slightly better, for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...The murder is set up and is deliciously evil: The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife, thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch, the placement of the golden key, and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused, her outfits become darker... Kelly is ing\u00e9nue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone, oblivious to the assassin behind her... Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table... John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy-talking husband is trying to cover his tracks...

He takes compassion on Kelly, but unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...The film, however, belongs to the sinister Ray Milland, the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...Milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover, then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan, the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks: Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening; a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment; a stopped watch; an occupied telephone box; Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck; Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie & precarious...\"Dial M for Murder\" is a film that makes you pay attention. It is a definite must-see!",

He blackmails an old schoolmate into committing the crime and plants clues to mislead the police. But when things don't go according to plan, Tony has to plant new clues and think of another explanation to give the detectives, so that suspicion doesn't fall on him.The trouble is, the plot is the only interesting thing about this movie, and the characters are defined solely by how they can affect the plot. For instance, Mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability to \"read\" the crime scene. Most of the movie's dialogue is expository: long scenes where the characters debate the minutiae of evidence found at the scene, without an interesting subtext. The movie is known for taking place almost entirely in the Wendices' living room, and Hitchcock does a good job of varying the camera angles to make you forget there's just one set. But he did this even better in \"Rear Window,\" his other 1954 film.Admittedly, Milland gives an enjoyable performance as the villain\u0097truly a guy you love to hate, a clever and smiling sociopath.

Though serious concerns (adultery, murder, the death penalty) underlie the story, we're never made to feel that they are really consequential.

            "content": "Dial M for Murder is a well chosen vehicle for Alfred Hitchcock, very similar to Rope. A suspense thriller set in the London flat of married couple Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, it had a very successful run on Broadway, 552 performances from 1952 to 1954. Unlike Rope, Hitchcock did briefly give the audiences in a couple of instances a break from the one room set of the play.Although shot in Hollywood, Hitchcock used a few members of the British colony to give the film proper authenticity. The character of Grace Kelly's paramour is American and Grace seems to have improved her British accent from Mogambo. The remake of Dial M for Murder was disappointing because of all the additions to a very simple suspense drama. The key here is that both Ray Milland and Grace Kelly so polite and civil to each other, like any other upper class couple. Then in conversations with other characters, Kelly with paramour Bob Cummings and Milland with Anthony Dawson the audience finds out their true feelings. It's all so genteel and very British, the completely American setting of the Michael Douglas film, A Perfect Murder was the last thing from perfect.Kelly's fallen for Bob Cummings, she realizes Milland is a wastrel, a word I wish would come back into use. Milland realizes he's drained the wife dry or coming pretty close so he hires an old college acquaintance Anthony Dawson to murder Kelly. Or rather blackmails him into it. That scene where he blackmails Dawson is one of both Hitchcock's and Milland's screen highlights.On Broadway, the parts that Milland, Kelly, and Cummings have were played by Maurice Evans, Gosti Huber, and Richard Derr respectively. Hitchcock retained from the Broadway cast Anthony Dawson and John Williams as the police inspector. In the case of Williams I should say THE police inspector. John Williams won a Tony Award on Broadway for his part. He set the standard as far as I'm concerned, maybe even more than Alastair Sim, for a British detective. Calm and detached, Williams goes far beyond duty requirements in relentless pursuit of the truth.Milland's scheme is a tricky bit of business involving his and Kelly's latch keys to their apartment. Quite ingenious in how Williams puts it together.",

            "review_title": "Can Ray Milland get away with the perfect murder?",
            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock loved shooting in studios, and here he had a film based upon a stage play, much of which could take place within a single set. Here he had every opportunity to show his perfect blonde doll in distress, as the impeccably sculpted Grace Kelly survives an attempt by her cold-hearted and jealous husband, Ray Milland, to have her murdered. But she doesn't know that he was behind the incident. Instead, she herself is convicted of the murder of her would-be murderer, by an evil irony, so that Hitchcock gets another crack at one of his favourite themes, the horrifying dilemma of the unjustly accused. It literally is a case of 'Will she hang tomorrow?' The play and the screenplay were both written by Frederick Knott (1916-2002), who did an excellent job of opening it out beyond a stage proscenium, aided of course by Hitchcock's relentless story-boarding and planning of a variety of shots in a single space which makes everything look like it is taking place in a wider context. This play was filmed no less than 14 times, starting with a TV play for the BBC in 1952. Hitchcock's film was merely the fourth filmed version. Somehow, the idea of someone dialling a phone number to trigger a murder attempt seems to have grabbed the public's imagination, and one can only describe 14 films in 46 years of the same play as 'a frenzy of film-making'. It was so popular in Germany that it was filmed twice there within only three years. Of course, the excitement only really works when all the phones are landlines. In the story, Grace Kelly had to stand in a specific position beside a curtain (which concealed the would-be murderer) in order to answer the phone, and dialling M for murder was the signal. It really was an 'M', by the way, because she was in London and her telephone number, for anyone who wants to try the same trick, was MAYFAIR 4399, which in those days before modern dialling codes, one reached by literally putting one's finger in a rotary dial, starting with the letter 'M', to dial MAY-4399. (I just tried dialling it and also the other number mentioned in the film, HAMPSTEAD 7899, adding the modern prefix '7', but neither number is connected. I suppose the shock of Hitchcock's film was too much for them.) To show just how the emphasis was on the attempt to commit the perfect murder, the last filming of the story in 1998 was actually entitled THE PERFECT MURDER, and starred Michael Douglas, who has just the right look in his eyes. In this version, Ray Milland's ice-cold and ultra-polite manner provided the necessary chill factor. Kelly's lover, Robert Cummings, features in the film but has little to do but look earnest and friendly. As for Grace Kelly, being an ice queen was somewhat contra-indicated, because she is simply not enough of a whimpering victim. Instead of being hopelessly distraught, she substitutes puzzlement and disbelief for true emotion. We therefore don't care that much about whether she is murdered or not, except for all that beauty going to waste, like destroying a Botticelli painting unnecessarily. We want to keep her on screen so we can look at her, that's all. What she feels about it all is irrelevant, because it is clear that she does not really feel anything. Ray Milland, as I have had occasion to say more than once, was notorious in the acting community for being obsessively mean with money. I never met him, but I knew some who worked with him, and his favourite trick in Manhattan when working on Broadway was to share a taxi with another actor and then at the end say he had forgotten his wallet. His higher up colleagues knew about this, but many a poor starving supporting actor was left with a huge taxi bill which he or she could not afford, and with a promise of repayment never kept. It was therefore never difficult for Ray Milland when acting to narrow his eyes and look self-obsessed, and let his inner lizard out. And the way he is continually taking his wallet out of his pocket and putting it back in again in this film, carefully minding the incriminating fingerprints of another man on a crucial letter and wearing gloves himself, is simply too reminiscent of his 'wallet problem' in real life. The story of this thriller is so ingenious, detailed, and complex that it is really a marvel of plot construction. And in this film, Hitchcock's personal appearance on screen takes the form of a wonderful joke, for he appears not in person this time but in a group photograph which features prominently in the story.

            "content": "Hitchcock does Experimental Theatre \u0085 That's pretty much to most befitting description you could give to \"Dial M for Murder\"; one of the Master of Suspense's most acclaimed but also \u0096 do I daresay it \u0096 most overrated achievements. The entire film takes place in one single location, as if you're watching a stage play, and there's also the experimental use of unusual camera angles and bizarre compositions, which proved that even the untouchable filmmakers like Hitchcock were attempting to be innovative in order to face the competition with the skyrocketing success of television during the early 50's. Personally, I have to admit I thought of \"Dial M for Murder\" as a very intelligent and competent but nevertheless severely underwhelming thriller experience. Every tiniest detail in this production is flawlessly taken care of, but the wholesome is just so damn lifeless! Every single character stands there talking as if they have a dozen of knives stuck in their backs and daren't move a muscle. Frederick Knott's screenplay is tight and highbrow, but since he adapted it from a stage play (his own), the movie is exaggeratedly talkative and the limited possibilities to switch sets rapidly makes it tedious as well, regardless of all the photography gimmicks.Former tennis star Tony Wendice developed the ideal plot to murder his unfaithful wife and rake in her family fortune. He truly thought up a seemingly waterproof and meticulously all-inclusive scheme that involves blackmailing an old college buddy turned petty crook into committing the vile act whilst Tony is out partying with his wife's lover. But, like one of the characters correctly states, the perfect murder doesn't exist and the more definite a plan looks, the more likely it is for important details to go wrong. Tony's plan does indeed go horribly wrong, but the cagey villain nevertheless comes up with an ingenious alternative plan on the spot. A couple of aspects about \"Dial M for Murder\" are undeniably pure genius. The whole build up towards the actual murder sequence, for instance, is nail-bitingly suspenseful and made unforgettable thanks to the creepy music. Then there are two performances that easily qualify as brilliant, namely John Williams' portrayal of the witty and typically British police detective and \u0096 foremost \u0096 the terrific Ray Milland as the dangerously sagacious psycho Tony Wendice. In fact, Milland's performance is so deeply impressive that you actually cheer for him and secretly hope that his diabolical plan of will succeed, if only just because the characters of his wife (played by Grace Kelly) and her lover are so annoyingly wooden and dull! \"Dial M for Murder\" is a highly compelling and smart film, but by no means a masterpiece and I sincerely doubt it ever would have made it into the top 250 if it hadn't had Hitchcock's name in the title.",

You have to pay attention, particularly at the end when the British police inspector explains how he figured things out.Ray Milland is the big star of this show, being in almost all the scenes. This kind of suspense movie is unheard of today - a thinking man's gentleman as the main bad guy - with little action in the film. That wouldn't be a success today. It was re-made in 1998 but had more twists and action scenes added.In this film, as in that re-make (A Perfect Murder), I found myself rooting for the husband. In this case, it was Millland, although he was a bit cocky.Note: It's a sad comment that Hitchcock, who didn't seem to have a lot of principles, made Robert Cummings - who was an adulterer in this film having an affair with Milland's wife Grace Kelly - into a \"good guy.\" Nobody in the film challenged him on what he was doing. Apparently, adultery was okay with the filmmakers here. At least in the re-make, they made the adulterer into a scumbag (although they made the cheating wife into a sympathetic character! No matter who makes this film, they are still clueless when it comes to what's right and what's wrong!.)",

I like some 1950s movies - those of Billy Wilder are great, but I find Hitchcock gets stiff performances from his casts, uses preposterous plots and in 'Dial M for Murder', there's a surprising absence of action - just a lot of talk. To summarise the story, a man plans an improbably complex murder; when the plan goes wrong, he frames his wife; but when his wife's friend and a sympathetic policeman get suspicious, they manage to trap him (albeit via the peculiar device of taking her from prison on the eve of her planned execution to help find the evidence to damn him and free her). He takes his capture with sang froid, and the film ends. I suppose Hitchcock was an original, in attempting to tell tales more complex than those previously attempted in cinema; but in an age of over-plotted and under-motivated thrillers, I wonder if his influence can be wholly considered good.",

            "content": "Middle tier Hitchcock it may be, by his own admission, but it's still one of the finest mystery thrillers around. Ray Milland plays Tony Wendice, a former tennis player married to Grace Kelly's Margot, who is the source of his wealth. Fearing his lifestyle is about to come to an end due to her dalliances with American mystery writer, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummins), Tony hatches a plan to have her murdered by an old acquaintance whom he has over a barrel with blackmail. However, the plan backfires and a whole new strategy is needed to save Tony from suspicion.Based on the popular and successful play by Frederick Knott (who adapts for the screenplay here), Dial M For Murder was a film Hitchcock had little time for. In fact, having already started work on Rear Window, Hitch treated Dial M For Murder as a jobbing assignment. His mood was further darkened by Jack Warner's insistence that the film be shot in 3D, with all the camera restraints that such a production brings. Perhaps unsurprisingly though, the restraints and general mood of the director brought about very pleasing results. Choosing to go for a claustrophobic single set shoot, Hitchcock resisted the urge to launch things around for 3D effects, instead he used the process to highlight props and angles of the Wendice home. His use of colours here first rate, particularly around his new found favourite actress, Grace Kelly.Having never seen the 3D version (who has I wonder?) I can't say what impact, if any, the gimmick had. But regardless of Hitch's grumblings and general disdain towards the film, he rose to the challenge by challenging himself and actually produced a fine and technically sound picture. Ray Milland is icy cold yet debonair, while John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard strides in and walks off with the film. Kelly is adequate enough, it's her least effective turn for Hitch, so early in her career, she was a bit free with her physical love on the set (source \"A Life in Darkness and Light\"), but this highly appealed to (and amused) Hitch and he of course would use her for better rewards post this production. Sadly Cummings is awfully bland and threatens to lose the film momentum when things start to spice up in the last quarter.Hugely entertaining picture though, one that is ripe with characterisations and of much interest to Hitchcock purists in how he works around the 3D format for his own filmic senses, Dial M For Murder holds up well today as a disquieting mystery thriller. 8/10",

He sets it up...and everything goes wrong.The script is pretty obviously from a stage play and most of the movie takes place in one room. Also the ultimate resolution was more than a little silly. Still this is not bad. I saw it in 3-D and 2-D. In 2-D this is slow and dull...3-D actually helps it. The camera is constantly shooting people in the background from behind lamps, couches, chairs etc etc. It adds a great feeling of depth to the surroundings. Hitchcock (wisely) avoided throwing things at the camera--there are only two instances of this: When Kelly is attacked her hand flies up to the camera--it was so real for half a second I almost reached up to help her! Also when someone holds out a key to the camera it comes right out of the screen at you. Hitchcock didn't want the 3-D--he was ordered by studio heads to shoot it that way. Still, he DID manage to use it in an effective way.The acting is almost completely great; Milland is fantastic--very smooth and suave as the villain; Kelly is just visually stunning and also gives out a good performance; John Williams is just terrific as an inspector trying to figure the crime out. Only Robert Cummings is not that good--he's bland and blank-faced the entire time. You really wonder what Kelly ever SAW in him!I like it but I think it drags quite a bit in the second half. I was getting a little bored. Seeing it in 3-D definitely improved the picture. Also it contains one of the most shocking murders in a Hitchcock film--right up there with \"Psycho\"!So it's worth a look--try seeing the 3-D version. I give it a 7.",

Why kill her instead of a divorce? Well, Kelly is wealthy and Milland wants to remain in the lifestyle to which he's become accustomed.Originally Milland's plan is just to have her killed by an old college associate who's gone bad, but when Grace miraculously survives this attack, his plans quickly change and he tries to make it look like she murdered the assassin. While clearly self-defense, Milland is very clever and seems to have thought of just about everything in order to get her convicted of murder. However, the plan is perhaps too clever and too well thought-out and in the end, there is a terrific confrontation with the police investigator and Milland's plans unravel.Probably the most memorable and amazing scene in the movie is the scene where Kelly kills the would-be murderer. It was done very vividly--particularly when he fell backwards--further driving the scissors into his body. This was a brilliant scene and it made me wince. In fact, throughout the film, there were many well-constructed and executed scenes that make it obvious the script writers and director were in top form.

It's easy to blame the weaknesses of the film on the screenplay, but Hitchcock himself doesn't really bring much to the project. The scene outlining the crime could have been far more compelling, and I can't help but feel that Hitchcock at a different stage in his career would have made it more so. And there's one place where he attempts to open up the play a little by showing you what's going on outside the window when it's obvious that the moment would have been more effective as done presumably in the play, with the suspense generated precisely because you couldn't see anything and had to be told what was happening.Grace Kelly's simpering performance did nothing for me, but it's not her fault she was asked to play a cowering idiot. Robert Cummings didn't have much to do, but John Williams is solid as the inspector.Decidedly minor Hitchcock film that would have been justly forgotten if directed by anyone else.",

In fact, Milland's subtle performance has you wanting the murder plot to work!

Except that it wasn't perfect, as mystery writer Mark Halliday himself opines - \"Well because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to and in real life they don't, always.\" It's great the way Hitch telegraphs his intention and then completely blindsides you with it when it eventually plays out.Ray Milland is perfect here as scheming husband Tony Wendice, planning to off his cheating wife (Grace Kelly) while using her lover Halliday (Robert Cummings) as an alibi. Milland's character has it all worked out like a master chess player, all the moves worked out backwards and forwards, with Swann (Anthony Dawson) his less than willing pawn. The way Tony spins his web to ensnare Swann in the deadly scheme is masterful, and repeat viewings confirm just how airtight his argument is to compel Swann's compliance.I know I didn't imagine it, so I rewound the film to check - weren't those some pesky curtains that Tony had to close twice while discussing with Margot whether she should go out or not?Now even though I thought the story was cleverly done, a couple things did nag me a bit. The whole business with only two keys to the apartment seemed a bit forced, why wouldn't Tony have simply made a duplicate key for Swann to use instead of going through all those contortions to get his wife's? Sure it created some additional tension, but it seemed misplaced, and Margot (Kelly) was never put in a position to call Tony on it. The other issue I had was during Inspector Hubbard's (John Williams) questioning, Margot never reacted to the fact that Tony knew the dead man that tried to kill her. You would think that she might have shown some kind of emotion over that revelation.Still, what works in the picture outweighs what doesn't, and for Hitchcock, it's a much more successful examination of the killer for hire motif than \"Strangers On A Train\" which generally ranks higher among the director's fans. And to top it off, it even has a more creative cameo appearance by Hitch, courtesy of that class reunion picture!",

One easily gets carried away by the flowing dialogues, and wonders where this story is going to lead to. Granted though it is a bit far-fetched but nonetheless it arouses curiosity.

The very simple settings and small cast focus all of our attention on the battle of wits a between a scheming husband, played with style by Ray Milland, and the rest of the characters.The story begins when retired tennis pro Tony Wendice (Milland) decides to eliminate his rich, unfaithful wife Margot.  He has laid out an elaborate scheme that starts with blackmailing an old college classmate to do the job for him.  But things do not work out as planned, and Wendice must spend the rest of the film constantly trying to improvise his way out of difficulty.The blackmailing scene at the beginning makes a great prelude to all that follows.  The way that Wendice approaches such a sordid business in such a debonair fashion both initiates all of the plot action and also establishes some nice character contrasts.  (Also watch this scene carefully for one of Hitchcock's most subtle cameo appearances.)The rest of the plot is complicated and contains some fine surprises.  As always, it is handled expertly by Hitchcock, who makes sure that we focus both on the characters and on the clues.  Milland gives a fine performance as Wendice, making us admire his poise and resourcefulness despite his amoral coldness.  Hitchcock favorite John Williams is excellent as the police inspector.The only thing that keeps this from being one of Hitchcock's very best films is the weaknesses in the other two major characters.  As Margot, Grace Kelly is charming as always, but her character makes too many obvious mistakes for us to sympathize with her as deeply as we could.  As Margot's boyfriend, Robert Cummings is too over-eager and one-dimensional for us to like him very much.  These imperfections keep the viewer's emotional involvement from being even stronger, but even so the story is still filled with suspense and interest.\"Dial M For Murder\" will bring a lot of satisfaction to mystery and thriller fans as they watch it and try to figure out what will happen next.",

However, in my book, whatever it is, it's not good.This is one of the few Hollywood movies that films a stage play like a stage play, requiring only a one room set.

We are peering past Chinese celadon vases converted into lamps, looking through the bars of an iron bedstead at the actors looming above us. It's almost a child's eye view.Notice the colour - Margo first appears as a moving patch of vivid scarlet.The Wendice's apartment, Scotty's flat in Rear Window, the spacious flat in Rope - nearly all the action is confined to a claustrophobic space. Yes, here we are with the actors, and once we've watched the movie a few times and got a handle on the plot and the characters, we begin to notice our surroundings.Am I the only viewer who tries to draw a floor-plan? Who notices the art on the walls? Margo and Tony, Scotty, Brandon in Rope - they all have an eye for art and antiques.Notice that sunlit landscape that appears so often in Dial M - a mid-century artist inspired by Ruysdael. There's a shaft of sunlight but very black shadows.This time, too, I noticed the way the film starts. No dialogue. Margo peers over the Times at Tony as he spills salt - bad luck! - and throws a pinch over his shoulder. What happens to their breakfast table? Does it fold away? Where does Margo keep her clothes? Where is that red and black Chinese cabinet?Tony setting the scene isn't the only overhead shot - we are still up on the ceiling when the police arrive. (Why don't the coppers in the passage get any tea?)I always enjoy the scene with Anthony Dawson. Again notice how the camera moves around, dips and circles. Swan is a spiv. He's been inside. What did he do during the war? He's probably killed once and is willing to murder for money. But I feel rather sorry for him.I agree that Williams seems to be repeating his stage performance - along with some farcical business like wrestling over the bank book and combing his moustache as he rings the Home Secretary.Just occasionally lines that would have worked on stage don't work in the film version. Williams asks Tony sarcastically \"You ARE coming with us? Well, I just wondered.\" Tony has been looking round the room checking that he has left the \"evidence\" in place. On the stage he'd been on the other side of the set.Every time one the keys is passed from hand to hand, hidden, dropped in a handbag etc it emerges from the screen - or would have, in 3D. But the juggling might have looked different on stage where we would have also seen who was NOT seeing the sleight of hand. Just a minor quibble. This is a work of art.",

In the book Hitchcock, by the equally as brilliant Francois Truffaut, Hitch admits that he was playing it safe with this movie and didn't put much effort into it as wasn't especially invested. That was a bit of a buzzkill, considering what the movie means to me, however, whether he was trying too hard or not, Hitch made a great one with Dial M For Murder.

An example of one of the most brilliant storytelling films I have ever seen, Dial M For Murder is cemented in the heart of this Hitchcock fan, whether he would like that or not.Margot Wendice (Grace Kelly) is the beautiful socialite wife of tennis great Tony Wendice (Ray Milland). During one of Tony's tennis tours, Margot began an affair with an American writer, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). The brief, passionate affair was enough to stay in the minds of the adulterers long after Tony's tennis tour was complete and they were back home in London. Margot and Mark began corresponding with love letters back and forth for several months until Margot decided to end the affair when Tony announced he was going to retire from professional tennis. Unbeknownst to Margot, Tony had intercepted one of the couple's letters and decided to give up his tennis life in order to wholly devote himself to his wife. This devotion inspired Margot to fully invest herself in their marriage as well, thus severing ties with Mark. Upon a visit, Margot invites Mark to her home for a night out with her and Tony in order to share with him that one of their letters, that which was intercepted by Tony, has been used against her as a form of blackmail. Conversely, Tony begins to hatch a plan to rid himself of his two-timing wife so he can inherit her sizable fortune. After months of trailing a schoolmate of his from college, and realizing he has fallen upon hard times, Tony seizes the opportunity to blackmail him into murdering his wife. The grand scheme is to occur on the night Mark is in town, ironically providing Tony the perfect alibi. Tony soon finds out that no matter how careful and calculating one is, there is no such thing as the perfect murder. Ray Milland, be still my heart; was there ever an actor who more perfectly delivered lines than this specimen? I only half type that in jest as MIlland's line execution is brilliant and commanding of the dialogue driven film. The storytelling in this film is so wonderfully perfect, the audience feels like a participant rather than a spectator. The entire film weaves a beautifully perfect puzzle in which each piece comes together to create a brilliant example of filmmaking. I love a one-setting film, and after watching and enjoying Lifeboat and Rope, it is clear that the master of suspense is uniquely talented in making one-setting films quite well. Some wonderful overhead shots allow the audience to understand that Tony sees himself as a God-like figure manipulating the lives of those around him to fit his agenda. The colors are also a brilliant piece of Dial M For Murder. The audience is stricken by Grace Kelly and her gorgeously vibrant red dress at the beginning of the film, with her outfits colors growing strikingly darker throughout the film, allowing one to see that Hitchcock may have been gaining inspiration for his most known film, Psycho while making a film he thought nothing of (I promise I'm not too bitter). Turning out Dial M For Murder, the accidental perfection, and Rear Window, the more commonly believed near perfection; I am reasonably certain that 1954 was Hitchcock's best year.",

There it sits, lacking any of his signature technique, stagebound and lifeless as when the first word of it was written, not benefiting from any of his intelligence. Characters talk and talk and talk, always indoors, in a drawing room, because it was written for the stage and Hitch couldn't be bothered to open it up. So it's unbearably claustrophobic. Even if you look out a window it's a phony as can be. Ray Milland is dull as dishwater. For a thrill, after what feels like 5 hours, we cut to the insides of a phone interchange.All of it seen through the eyes of normative British police who can't wait to put things right again. ho-hum. I'd suggest more needed to go morally wrong in this snoozer to generate some interest. For a director whose filmic inventions could fill an encyclopedia, this is a tedious, unimaginative project.The only memorable moment in this (which is also grotesque) is when the stooge hired to kill Grace Kelly fails, and falls onto his back, driving a pair of scissors deeper into his body. Hitch regretted this and never did it again. (The knife is never seen injuring Leigh in Psycho). Rent 'Sudden Fear' with Joan Crawford for some actual thrills eked from this same scenario.This should have been called 'Hitchcock Collects a Paycheck,' Dial H for 'Humdrum,' or Dial U for 'Unremarkable.'",

It's been done before and after and if you want to see how to spoil it watch the TV movie.But this is Hitchcock at his best, believe it or not. The acting is superb.Ray Milland has never been better as a suave, self-possessed villain. Grace Kelly makes you want to squeeze her. Anthony Dawson is a marvelous murderer. And Williams is a great investigator, as he always is. Two points. This was shot to be projected in 3-D and Hitchcock only gives us one blatant (and not very blatant) 3-D shot, in which Grace Kelly reaches behind her for the scissors. Two: Only once does Hitch depart from the procenium, an overhead shot in which Milland dumps suitcases around the floor.Do see it if you have the chance. Hitchcock had had a couple of flops before this, and said he made the movie simply to \"recharge his batteries.\" It's more than that, but you shouldn't expect a flawless movie. If the performances are about as good as they get, the anfractuous plot depends a great deal on curious and sometimes unusual circumstances. Williams visits Milland at home and surreptitiously switches almost identical trench coats with him. Milland's unsuspectingly taking the wrong coat with him to jail is an important plot point. (How did Williams know Milland would not notice the difference between coats, that he would take a coat with him at all?)The chief plot point is that there are only two keys to the apartment, leading to the conclusion that Kelly herself admitted Dawson with the express intent of killing him. But Dawson's own latch key gets mixed up with the two genuine ones and this clears her. Dawson drives an expensive car, which must have an ignition key. He probably has keys to other secure appliances. How come he has no key ring -- just the single latch key in his pocket? The keys on my own key ring number more than half a dozen and I've forgotten what some of them are for. Yet Dawson, a tricky character with multiple identities, carries only a single key in his pocket?None of this matters. The movie is merely first-class entertainment. It doesn't carry a message, anymore than a crossword puzzle does. You'll enjoy it.",

            "content": "Although Alfred Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1940, he continued to make occasional films with a British setting. Some , such as \"Stage Fright\" or \"Frenzy\", were actually shot in Britain, whereas others such as \"Rebecca\" or \"Dial M for Murder\" were filmed in America despite an ostensible British setting. \"Dial M for Murder\" started life as a stage play, and remains very stagey even in its cinema version. Apart from one scene in a gentleman's club and a few views of the street , the whole film takes place in one location, the living-room of a London flat. This is one of the few films in which Hitchcock does not appear in person. As in \"Lifeboat\", his cameo appearance comes in the form of a photograph. Tony Wendice is a retired professional tennis player living in London with his beautiful younger wife Margot. (Guy Haines, the hero of Hitchcock's \"Strangers on a Train\" , was also a successful tennis star, although in his case an amateur). The marriage is not a happy one, and Margot has been having an affair with the American crime novelist Mark Halliday. Tony has devised a plan to have Margot murdered, although his motivation is not sexual jealousy; he displays no malice towards Halliday and the two men even appear to be friends. He is rather motivated by financial greed; Margot is independently wealthy and Tony is the sole beneficiary of her will. Tony gets in touch with Charles Swann, an disreputable acquaintance with a criminal record, and persuades him to agree to kill Margot using a mixture of bribery and blackmail. The film's title derives from the telephone call which Tony will make to his flat and will be the signal for Swann to carry out the murder. The plan, however, goes wrong. Swann enters the flat as arranged, but while he is attempting to strangle Margot, she manages to reach a pair of scissors and stabs him to death. Tony's scheme appears to have misfired, but he is quick-thinking enough to improvise another plan, planting evidence suggesting that Swann was blackmailing Margot over her affair. The police do not believe Margot's story that she killed Swann in self-defence and she is arrested, tried and sentenced to death for murder. Numerous Hitchcock films include a character wrongly accused of a crime, but normally that character is male and plays an active role in establishing his innocence and bringing the real perpetrator to justice. (Examples include Derrick de Marney's character in \"Young and Innocent\" or Cary Grant's in \"North by North-West\"). Margot is virtually the only female character in a Hitchcock film to find herself in this plight, and after her conviction disappears from the action until the end of the film. The lead in establishing her innocence and Tony's guilt is taken by a detective, Chief Inspector Hubbard. Although most of Hitchcock's films deal with crime, individual police officers rarely play an important role; \"Dial M for Murder\", like \"Stage Fright\", is one of the few exceptions. To judge from its high rating on this board, \"Dial M for Murder\" still has many admirers, but I have always regarded it as one of Hitchcock's weaker efforts. Although he made other films with claustrophobic settings, notably \"Lifeboat\", and \"Rear Window\", few of his films are adapted from stage plays (\"Rope\" being another example), and I feel that this one would have benefited from being opened up to a greater extent. The acting is far from distinguished. Grace Kelly looks gorgeous, as she normally did, but this is by far the weakest of the three performances she gave for Hitchcock. (The others were \"Rear Window\", also made in1954, and \"To Catch a Thief\" from the following year). Ray Milland is bland and wooden as Tony. It might have been more interesting if the role had gone to Cary Grant, a frequent Hitchcock collaborator, who wanted it, but apparently the studio were afraid that audiences would not accept him as a villain. There is, in fact, no really sympathetic character with whom the audience can identify. Tony is an obvious villain. Mark is a selfish playboy, and even though he is a crime writer he seems ignorant when it comes to real-life crime. Margot is weak and passive, and as an adulteress does not attract much audience sympathy. (Fifties audiences probably worried more about such things than modern ones would do). Although Hubbard is instrumental in finding the crucial evidence which clears Margot, we are also aware that it was originally his mistakes which led to her being wrongly arrested and convicted, and his change of heart about her guilt is never really explained. The film's greatest weakness, however, is that it lacks that essential Hitchcock ingredient, tension. It is probably the most \"talky\" of all his films, with little physical action except for the scene where Margot stabs Swann. There is no heart-stopping set-piece comparable to, say, the cornfield scene in \"North by North-West\" or the shower scene in \"Psycho\". The denouement is a prosaic affair, involving lots of talk about the location of various keys. In a bizarre twist, Margot is released from jail and returned to her flat to assist Hubbard with his investigations, even though she is supposed to be under sentence of death. (I really cannot imagine the authorities ever sanctioning such an arrangement). The fifties are often regarded as the decade when Hitchcock was working at the height of his powers, and he certainly produced some of his greatest films during this period. (\"Strangers on a Train\", \"I Confess\", \"Vertigo\", \"North by North-West\"). With the possible exception of \"Stage Fright\", however, \"Dial M for Murder\" must count as his weakest from this decade. 5/10",

An aging tennis pro named Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans his wife's murder with the help of an old acquaintance.Wendice is charming, debonair, and intelligent, a man with great foresight who constructs his crime in meticulous detail. Half the fun of this film is watching, and listening to, this guy as he articulates his scheme with confident coolness. Ray Milland is just terrific in the role.Naturally, complications ensue as the film's plot moves along. Not even the scheming Tony Wendice can foresee every possible contingency. And in the second half we get to watch him squirm, mentally struggle, and improvise, as his airtight plan starts to unravel.The Frederick Knott script is heavy on dialogue, but the film is so engaging that it never seems \"talky\". Hitchcock's direction is fine. Color cinematography includes some clever camera angles that help break up the monotony of such an enclosed setting. Yet, the film has a claustrophobic feel that actually enhances the anxiety and tension of the situations the characters find themselves in.Dimitri Tiomkin's elegant score fits well with the formal attire of the characters. The impression is thus conveyed that Tony and his wife are sophisticated, well off financially, and connected to society's upper crust. Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings give fine performances in support roles. And John Williams' performance is as outstanding as that of Ray Milland.This film is not a whodunit. The story is simple and straightforward. It's more of a character study, particularly of Tony Wendice.With a terrific story, engaging characters, excellent acting, clever photography, and credible production design, \"Dial M For Murder\" is thoroughly enjoyable. It is one of my three favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.",

In a carefully planned plot, he approaches a small time conman and blackmails him into helping.  However the carefully planned set up goes wrong and Margot kills Swan in a struggle. When the ensuing police investigation assumes that Margot set the whole thing up, everything appears perfect for Tony.  However, there is no such thing as the perfect murder.Although it is very much a stage play rather than a film, this still works well as a thriller due to solid (if unspectacular) performances and good direction.  The film s split into three main acts \u0096 the planning, the deed and the conclusion.  The planning is easily the most enjoyable part as it moves quickly and seems to have everything tied up.  The deed is good as we begin to see little things go wrong and the conclusion is enjoyable as the pieces are put together.  The plot is quite straightforward, but it's strength is in it's logic \u0096 both in set up and conclusion.  It is a little dull at times due to it's static location (almost 100% of the film is in the flat) but Hitchcock does manage to deliver real tension at key moments.The gimmick of 3D (as the film was originally shot to be) means that the film is cluttered with shots of action in the background and furniture in the foreground.  It all feels slightly weird to have such a good director frame his shots in this way but it is not too obtrusive.  He does better with the dramatic stuff and manages to give a cold, logical air to the planning stages and also makes the actual murder scene very dramatic.The cast deliver quite polished performances without every stretching themselves outside of the character they have been placed in.  So Kelly plays the bewildered wife well, Cummings is a typical tough jawed American and Dawson is a bit of a sub-Terry Thomas.  However it is Milland as the coldly English plotter who makes the film quite watchable in it's first act and is very enjoyably `English'.  The final act of the film is made to feel different enough to enjoy due to the input of Wiliams as the Inspector \u0096 he is witty but also a good match for Tony.Overall this film is a little too stagy for it's own good but it is still a solid little thriller.  The setting make it feel a little too confined and staged than was necessary, but Hitchcock is able to use the location well rather than be hampered by it (3D aside).  An old fashioned detective film in the style of a B movie.",

Grace Kelly doesn't have much to do here but she does her job admirably. It was a great year for her.

            "content": "If you read Patricia Highsmith's novel STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, it does differ from the film version that Alfred Hitchcock made. Guy, his tennis pro hero, actually does become quite close to Bruno, and at the end confesses to the murder of his wife (after Bruno dies). The hint of homosexual attraction between Farley Granger and Robert Walker in the film (mostly due to Walker's performance) is allowed to go so far, but the conclusion is firmly on heterosexual grounds. Granger goes off with Ruth Roman at the end. It was 1951, and you did not show a favorable eye towards gay lovers.But it has been pointed out that in a strange way, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is like an introduction to DIAL \"M\" FOR MURDER. Guy is a tennis pro (which is how Bruno recognizes him to begin with). He is romancing (although still married, if estranged) Ruth Roman, the daughter of a wealthy U.S. Senator played by Leo G. Carroll. So his marriage is one of potentially great social importance to Guy. The marriage of aging tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) to his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) is to a wealthy fan. They are living in an expensive flat in one of London's most posh sections. But the marriage is souring on Milland's part - he has found that she has been having an affair with family friend novelist Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). This is too much for Milland's pride (which has suffered from his physically forced retirement from tennis into working in the corporate world - and living off Margot's money). So he decides he has to kill her. One wonders if Guy's marriage would have done better.Frederick Knott's tight little melodrama can still be revived with a set of good actors and good direction. In fact, it was remade into two television versions and another movie (in 1998) with Michael Douglas in the Milland role. But Milland's smiling, plausible villain is one of his best performances - a toss-up between this role and his Devil in ALIAS NICK BEAL as to which villain was a better performance. He is in complete control of the \"game\" until the last fifteen minutes when he is finally tripped up by John Williams' Inspector Hubbard, who finally pieces together the mystery of the flat key (you will have to watch the film to understand).Some of the best moments are between Milland and subsidiary villain Anthony Dawson (Captain Lesgate / Swann), who is blackmailed into agreeing to be Milland's agent in his plot against the unfaithful Margot. An example of the dialog between the two scoundrels is shown on this thread, with Lesgate finding he can't scare Wendice into dropping the scheme and letting him alone. The whole sequence has to be seen - especially as Wendice keeps wiping off surfaces Lesgate touched during the scene...no fool our Tony! Hitchcock's film is usually shown in regular film stock, but he shot it also in 3-D. Unlike INFERNO there is little that is original in his use of 3-D (he probably did not know what to do with it). But in one of the critical scenes, wherein Grace Kelly is defending herself, he shows how 3-D can...err drive home a point about violence. It's one that is effective too.",

The family home is not comforting, but made strange: objects don't blend in, but are threateningly present (lamps, drinks bottles etc.), always getting in the way of human communication (the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film).  In a traditional detective story, it is through the displacement of ordinary items, taken for granted, that marks a rupture - the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife - he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties, he walks with a cane, ostensibly a fake prop, but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home, dependent on his wife, serving her and her lover drinks.  He is probably gay - the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him, is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly, the conjugal home resembles a stage set.  This is the governing motif of the film.  Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play, by drawing attention to its staginess.  Props are foregrounded; Wendice is clearly a stage director/author who is putting on a play (planning the murder of his wife).  He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor, giving him his lines, showing him round the stage, telling him what to do, where to move; crucially, giving him his cue, timing, the 'call'.However, although Wendice seems in control, the gaze of the film does not belong to him - his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels.  Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle, this scene with Swan is shot from above, spied on from a seemingly unmotivated, godlike position, which only emhasises the unreality (theatricality) of the sequence.  There is another author beyond Wendice, who is really running the play.  Is it God?  Fate?  Hubris?  This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters, in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated, it belongs to the Inspector, suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter, from whom nothing can be hidden.  And this is true, but not reassuring: the Inspector is cold and detached; but, more unforgiveably, like the other male characters, two of whom tried to murder her, he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice, pushing her out of the story, in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed; she is absent for most of the film's second half.  The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical, rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority, both trying to shape meaning, and 'create' truth, while in reality concealing it (Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality) is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin, the stolen letter. Poe, a favourite of Hitchcock's, wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister, form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship.  What's written in this letter, and who controls it, becomes a site of power between the two male characters, who squeeze out the female character, who owns it, altogether.  Knowledge, authority, power, and the artist are linked, all are abused, all are stolen from women.  Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's (or play's) smooth mechanics.  Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot.  he had a profound grasp on the workings of society, and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power - Wendice is suave, hilarious, imperious, mandarin, the motor of the film, a joy to watch, and yet an automaton.  Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork.  The author was really only an actor, parroting perfectly his fed lines.  It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him.",

            "content": "Mostly enjoyable movie, but hardly a 'great' movie. I am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the Grace Kelly and Cummings characters, which are both one-note uninteresting roles. Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive, weak, and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!), she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed, and amazingly, the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife, but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland, cardboard harmless people and were a little more human, with real emotions (jealousy, hatred, passion, even a little evil).Milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. Unfortunately, as he is the only interesting character, you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail. Oh well, it could have been a lot more 'noir' if they had not glossed over the fact that Kelly and Cummings are far from the sweet innocents they are portrayed.",

            "content": "There wouldn't be many brave enough too dispute the call that Alfred Hitchcock was and quite possibly remains to this day, the quintessential master of the murder/mystery thriller.Throughout his fabled career with the likes of Suspicion, Rebecca, Strangers on a Train and Vertigo littering his filmography, the grandfather of mystery and suspense crafted an impressive niche in the genres he gravitated towards the most and while at the time this adaptation of Frederick Knott's stage play didn't get the plaudits some of his more esteemed films got upon release, this well-liked effort has continued to be regarded as one of the best films of its type in the years that have followed since it first appeared.Teaming up with Knott to bring his scheming and intricate work to life, Hitchcock is relishing being in an environment such as this, one that he thrived in so frequently with the tale of Ray Milland's seemingly upstanding ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice plotting to murder his wife Margot when he uncovers the truth behind her affair with the younger and charismatic Mark allowing the esteemed director to make the most of the films sweat inducing set pieces that mostly take place in the Wendice's apartment building or the offices of John Williams police station.As you would expect from a Hitchcock film the performances are universally solid with Grace Jelly and Williams in particular having a great time bringing Knott's wordsmithing to life while Hitch himself is more restrained than he was sometimes found to be as he keeps things simple but effective, shining a light on a situation that gets murkier and murkier as it goes with a feeling throughout that you're never sure just who might come out on top when Tony's plan's for a perfect murder don't pan out the way he had hoped.The fact the film never tries to make anything too grand out of its simple but at the same time intricately structured plot or delve too far into the characteristics of its four central players means that in some respects its not as profound or memorable as the best of Hitchcock's works but there's no point in denying that it isn't one of his most purely enjoyable and accessible offerings.Final Say -A hugely enjoyable Hitchcock classic, Dial M for Murder has all that you would hope to find in such a film and this smartly made feature has lost none of charm since its initial release many moons ago.4 hand written letters out of 5.",

After watching the entire film for a second time, I realized why I couldn't recall much about it. It wasn't very memorable and it flowed more like a second rate live theater production. If you peel away this onion's skin, all you are left with is a single \"house key\" as the entire mystery/thriller solution.Grace Kelly valiantly tried to save this mystery film with her stellar acting but as for her three (3) leading male co-stars, namely Ray Milland, Bob Cummings, and John Williams, I felt as if they were literally rushing through their own lines so that they could grab an early lunch together. The mystery musical score was most likely grabbed from an episode of TV's long running \"Days Of Our Lives\" and added no suspense to the film. I was struggling to pay any more attention to the film as Ray Milland continued to roll his eyes as the noose around his own proverbial neck was tightening with each response to he provided to Chief Inspector Hubbard's questions.Now that I have seen the movie twice and can confirm without a shadow of a doubt, they \"key\" defense to this rather dull Crime/Thriller genre film is not worth seeing a third time, nor a second time, and only because it was directed by Alfred Hitchcock should be watched at least once. I believe the higher than deserved IMDB average rating of 8.2 from over 155,000 IMDB reviewers is blindly giving a higher rating due to Alfred Hitchcok's directing this film and Grace Kelly starring as the film's unjustly convicted villain.As for my IMDB rating of 5.0 watch it for yourself and see if it can hold your attention for any more than half of the films runtime.",

            "content": "Dial M For Murder is superior Hitchcock, not because of how much it embodies him, but because of how much it embodies what he is attracted to, the remarkably impressive perfectionism in a deed of malice, an ideal occasion for him to apply his own perfectionist style. Hitchcock was not a perfectionist in the sense that he was a refined, nitpicky gentleman of poise. He was in fact a shameless attention hog with a snooty English comportment. The perfectionism in his film-making comes from the same place that generates his never-ending need to appear on his own TV show, interviews, at some point at any cost during each and every one of his movies (this time, due to the story's confined setting, in a black-and-white reunion photograph), and even as the on-screen guide in the trailers of his later movies: An inexhaustible pride on his accomplishments, pure and obsessive joy taken by his prolific mastery of a challenging cinematic effect, suspense. This approach to perfectionism meets halfway with writer Frederick Knott's mature and controlled perfectionism. Knott details a rigid, clockwork scenario upon which Hitchcock magnifies just how inspired Knott's script is.Ray Milland plays the lead role with the same capacity for darkness and wickedness that he brought so stunningly to The Lost Weekend, another top-notch picture in which one would never have guessed for a minute that he was British. Well, here, he implies that he told you so, as he brandishes his classic native accent in his wicked portrayal of an ex-tennis player who impeccably hides his ulterior motives for having married the angelic Grace Kelly. For a solid year, Milland carefully and methodically plans her murder once they've named each other as beneficiary in their respective wills. She has no semblance of a clue that he is at all aware of her love for an American crime writer.The extent to which Milland effortlessly goes to polish every facet of a facet of his plot is astounding, we learn. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag holding one of the adulterous American's letters, and even simulated the role of an anonymous blackmailer to observe whether she would pay to have it back. He even surveyed them having a little farewell party in the American's studio flat, remembering even what they ate for dinner.Knott's firm and intricate narrative is as tight as a drum, infused with snappy complexity and even the humor and rhetoric grandeur residual from the original theatre production. Hitchcock emboldens the visual bearing of the movie. He cries, \"I'm here, too!\" with scenes shot entirely through a bird's eye view from the ceiling, and in his decidedly superstylized impression of a courtroom scene, with no props but lighting of various alternating colors.One example of a scene that streams seamlessly from one eye-bustingly gripping scene to another is one constructed entirely out of the technical aftermath of cinematography and editing, when we see Milland, repressing his anxiety for appearance's sake to an outer shell of petty restlessness, frequently looking at his watch. It is already past eleven when he notices that it has stopped. This is the unraveling arrangement of a minuscule race versus time swelled by theatrical music. Hitchcock's unabashed pandering for the status as his film's main character in spite of being on the wrong side of the camera for that ambition is actually an incidental charm, as opposed to the outcome of many self-conscious overstylized movies. You are a true artiste when your biggest weaknesses enhance your work, in this case by creating an inimitable spirit that permeates it.",

The film takes place primarily in one room, the apartment.Rear Window is a far superior film to this one.

Alfred Hitchcock directed this one and it is better-done, IMO, than the remake. More believable, better acting. So, here are some of the significant differences--This is set in London, the other in NewYork. Here he is a retired tennis player, the other he is a financial gambler. Here he goes out with the lover of his wife, and hires a petty crook to do the murder, instead of blackmailing the lover who then hires a crooked friend.

Nowadays I look back at many films from the '50s and '60s and definitely appreciate them, but feel cinematic ally they are much slower and not always as engaging as movies from the '70s, '90s and yes, even the '80s.Hitchcock was a truly great filmmaker, and evidence of this is that nowadays his films are STILL packing a punch and they don't seem outdated in the least! I mean, when was the last time you watched \"Psycho\" and checked your watch? Unfortunately Hitchcock did make a few errors in his resume (namely his last project) and \"Dial M For Murder\" is somewhere in between. It's a good \"talky\" movie in the sense that a bunch of people are in a room acting civilized and sophisticated and upper class (much like \"Rope\" starring James Stewart, also directed by Hitchcock).But the suspense is lacking and the film is not of the same calibre as \"North by Northwest\" or \"Psycho.\" It's a good film, and for my money it's better than \"The Birds,\" but don't expect any sort of masterpiece -- otherwise you might feel rather disappointed.(For the record, critics seem to generally consider this Hitchcock's worst movie if only for the reason that it was made during a time when he was very popular and it didn't do very well -- kind of like the 1950s' version of \"1941\" or another flop, people -- primarily critics -- didn't take a real liking to it and it'll probably always be considered his worst mainstream US movie.)",

            "content": "Tony Wendice has everything you might want in life: A mantel full of sports trophies, a cushy lifestyle, lots of booze, a rich and attractive wife, and a foolproof plan for killing her so he can inherit all her money.We shouldn't like this guy, yet we do, because of a script by playwright Frederick Knott that presents Tony as the victim of his wife's adultery, a performance by Ray Milland that presents Tony as a charming and able foil for many cruel twists of fate, and subtle direction by Alfred Hitchcock that invites us the audience to feel closer to Tony than we do to his victims.The three elements work together at key moments. Wendice has taken great pains to kill his wife at an appointed time, only to find himself with a busted watch. Then he goes to the phone booth to make a call that will deliver his wife into a killer's hands. But the booth is occupied.Milland's eyes go buggy. We worry about whether he will be able to pull off his great scheme, perhaps forgetting the magnitude of his planned crime, perhaps just judging it less serious than the wife's adultery as Knott and Hitchcock have been encouraging us to since the beginning of the picture without our noticing. Then Hitch lets Milland make his call. As the crime is carried out, we finally have a jolt of fear for the wife, played by Grace Kelly at the peak of her beauty. Then tables are turned, scissors beat stockings, and Milland's face falls in an exquisite close-up. Our morbid sympathies are back in his court.Hitchcock fans are down on \"Dial M For Murder\" because it is played pretty straightforwardly on the surface, with little visual trickery. What we do get, like a phony finger poking through a hole in a telephone rotary and an abstractly staged and lit courtroom scene with Grace Kelly giving her deer in a headlights impression, is weak. Grace Kelly gives an inert, unconvincing performance throughout.But Hitchcock's strengths as a scenarist outweigh much else, and he finds a lot of help not only from Knott's script but a score by Dimitri Tiomkin, cinematography by Robert Burks, and set design by George James Hopkins. If we are to be stuck in one place again, like in \"Rope\" and \"Lifeboat,\" it might as well be a posh London flat crammed with period charm and detail.I even think Robert Cummings is a plus here. You quickly dislike him for his smoothness and nerviness as Mark Halliday, the other man in this love triangle, but of course you are supposed to. In a great documentary that comes with the \"Dial M\" DVD, Peter Bogdanovich suggests Cummings represents \"subversive casting\" on the part of Hitchcock, designed to get us to like Milland more. I'll go further and say that Cummings was a knowing co-conspirator, communicating Mark Halliday's smug contempt for Milland's character in subtle ways throughout the film. When he approaches Wendice with his brilliant idea for having Wendice claim that he set his wife up and thus help her avoid execution, we actually resent this ploy despite its inherent validity. Of course Mark wants Wendice to cop a plea: Mark can then get the girl and profit from Wendice's misguided devotion. Lucky for Wendice he's beyond such tricks...And there's the rub. We root for the murderer because he's getting his own back. Never mind that killing people is far worse a crime than cheating on them. This film sticks a magnet on our moral compass and leaves us to work it out long after the last scene, where Tony's sociopathic depravity is laid bare in Milland's best on-screen moment. Chips down, he manages a final wink and a cheery smile as his wife watches with tear-filled eyes. Give the devil his due and he'll steal your soul, but you may be too charmed to catch yourself being swindled.",

You might wonder why Hitchcock would have wanted to film such a creaky, stage-bound piece, (it hardly ever leaves its one-room setting), but it's full of lovely little bits of business and it's genuinely exciting.Much of the fun derives from the casting which, with the exception of that unattractive tailor's dummy Robert Cummings, is spot on. Ray Milland is a hiss-ably suave villain. It's almost as good a part as the one that won him his Oscar in \"The Lost Weekend\" and Milland has a lot of fun with it. As the wife who turns the tables on her would-be killer, Grace Kelly is almost as good here as she was in \"Rear Window\" and \"To catch a thief\", while Anthony Dawson, (the slime-ball assassin), and John Williams, (the upper-crust, debonair and really rather unreal detective on the case), probably do their best screen work here.Originally made in 3D so you do tend to find a lot of objects in the foreground but even in the 'flat' version finally released these visual compositions add to, rather than detract from, proceedings and Hitchcock's placement of the camera throughout gives the film a considerable kick.

At times, it seemed more like a magician's (con man's?) act - now you see it, now you don't - rather than a mystery/thriller. I thought it was quaint that the local police were called instead of the emergency services when there is a dead body in the apartment.  Perhaps we had the ethos of your local, friendly neighbourhood cop on the beat in those days who would clear it all up quite amicably and we could all get on with our lives, and perhaps be more careful in future. Not only are keys swapped with gay abandon but also raincoats (unnoticed, of course). Not at all sure why the crime-writer boyfriend of the wife agreed to go to a stag night with the husband, just after he had admitted that he would find it very difficult talking to the bloke, who he hardly knew anyway.

The performances by the three leads are all terrific with Milland giving one of his greatest performances because even though we know he tried to kill his wife, after things get off target there's still something about the guy that makes us want him to get away with it. Kelly is as beautiful as ever and Robert Cummings is terrific in his few scenes. John Williams is also great and adds a lot of needed comic relief.

Almost a closed room mystery where we follow the crime from start to finish, with the added twist of it happening mostly from the point of view of the criminal. The central question not being who's the murderer, but rather how he's going to be caught. Or whether he will be caught or not.The movie has a delightfully British setting, some great actors, some great dialogue and wordplay, and a score that's an interesting mix of usual Hitchcock creepiness mixed in with an almost fairytale-like playfulness.Although, to be fair, I don't like that the viewers are not given all the information needed to solve the mystery. There's a central scene where the plan derails, but the thing that becomes central for the solution is not shown to the viewers. And it's such a small thing that it could have easily been hidden there. Now the viewer can only solve the mystery if they can make the leap from point A directly to point D. Not impossible, but not exactly viewer-friendly either.Still, a very good mystery film and easily one of Hitchcock's best.",

            "content": "Alas, the 3-D version seems to have disappeared, although one does hear rumors of its screening at special events from time to time. Hitch took great care to ensure that the 3-D effects enhanced the story rather prove a distraction. To this end, he asked Fred Knott to write three or four minutes of inconsequential, introductory dialogue so that movie audiences would get used to the effects produced by the 3-D cameras and could then focus their attention on the plot and the dialogue. He also reasoned that the major effects, particularly the sequence with the scissors would come across far more dramatically if they had a visual element of surprise. When viewing the movie in its flat version, one wonders why the devil Knott is marking time when the curtains part and doesn't get on with the plot. My original theory was that he wanted to accommodate latecomers, but that isn't the case at all. Hitch simply wanted audiences to settle down, so that he could spring a few 3-D surprises later on, such as the all-important scissors scene. On the acting side of the movie, Milland, Kelly and Dawson walk away with the honors. To my mind, Williams' performance is somewhat odd. I know police detectives are supposed to impassive \u2013 especially British police detectives \u2013 but to my mind, Williams overdoes the impassivity. In fact, he simply repeats his stage performance and makes no effort whatever to cater for a movie audience \u2013 except, of course, to lower his voice. Because Williams is so impassive, it's possible to notice several gaping holes in the plot, which a more colorful performance could have disguised. All in all, though, despite the shortcomings of the flat version, Dial M for Murder is still a must-see movie. Available on a superb Warner Brothers DVD.",

Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings form the triangle in the case of a husband who wants to eliminate his wife in order to inherit her considerable wealth. That his wife is involved in an extramarital affair means little to him as he sets into motion his plan that eventually unravels due to dogged detective work. As with most murder mysteries, money is the reason Milland wants to dispatch Kelly and enlists the help of an outsider to do the dirty work. John Williams is the droll inspector who takes the case apart and puts it back together with logic and old fashioned police sleuthing. The film has a parallel with another Hitchcock film, \"Rope\", in that both pictures were filmed almost entirely with one set piece. Still, this mystery remains one of the genre's best films.",

            "content": "In a review I did on Hitchcock's 1948 movie Rope, I stated that nobody can deliver a suspense movie like him, and once again, he proves the validity of this sentence. Dial M for Murder is a film that has been praised for over 60 years, and it isn't hard to see why. Hitchcock knows which elements to use in his story to tell a convincing and engaging one. The movie is about a guy named Tony played by Ray Milland who is married to a wealthy woman named Margot (Grace Kelly) who, unbeknownst to her husband, was going out with a writer named Mark for a while. Once Tony discovers this, he decides to formulate\na plan to kill his cheating wife, and her huge amount of money definitely catches his attention as well. Tony wants an old college friend of his to commit the crime for him, and blackmails him into doing so since his friend already has a criminal record. Meanwhile, the plan is put into effect. Mark and Tony plan to go to a party, which leaves Margot at home alone and vulnerable to attack. At 11 o clock at night exactly, Tony will call her from his party and his college friend must choke her to death as she goes to answer the phone. He will then leave and make the whole thing look like a burglary. However, things don't\ngo as planned and Margot manages to stab her assailant to death with scissors as her husband tries calling her. Tony is now in serious trouble since his wife is supposed to be dead by now but she managed to foil the plan. This is where the movie becomes very confusing in my opinion, but basically what happens is Margot manages to get herself incriminated by making several conflicting statements to a police investigator about how Tony's friend was blackmailing her. She is found guilty and sentenced to be executed. Thankfully it all works out in the end, since Tony is eventually found guilty on the grounds that\nhe bribed his college friend to murder his wife, and this theory is later confirmed when Mark finds a briefcase filled with money. Margot escapes the noose and Tony is rightfully found guilty. The movie is similar to Rope in many ways, mainly the fact that it takes place mostly in one room and a character who knows he is guilty of something eventually gets proved guilty at the end. I would say they're about the same in terms of quality.",

While the former is the most famous, the latter is also something. Portraying ex-tennis player Ray Milland trying to blackmail someone into murdering the man who has been having an affair with his wife, they make the most of everything: Grace Kelly's beauty, Ray Milland's tense expressions and camera angle. I read that Hitch filmed it in 3D; seeing how suspenseful the regular version is, I would love to see how intense the 3D version is.All in all, this movie grabs like few others do. You just may never trust anyone again after watching this. The 1998 remake \"A Perfect Murder\" was also quite well done.",

The name of the game is inheritance, by way of a murder most foul, with an unfaithful wife (Grace Kelly) set up as the unwary victim. She's a wealthy young socialite, bored by a trophy husband whose glory days are already in the past, while he's a listless retired tennis ace who seeks to spin his jaded love's infidelity into a comfortable life as a well-paid widower. In spending months preparing his ruse, it seems the villain has thought of everything, but, as we're often told, even the best laid plans often go awry.Dial M For Murder has roots on the stage, where it enjoyed a favorable run, two years prior, on both sides of the Atlantic. As such, there's plenty of quick-lipped dialogue and few changes in scenery, but it's more than just filmed theater. Under Hitchcock's enlightened direction, the screen brims with hints and cues. As various nasty plots come undone and/or bear fruit, the camera whirls and spins like a dizzied housewife, establishing a sense of overwhelmed helplessness. It's crafty filmmaking, smart and inventive with no blatant flaunts. Doubly impressive when we consider its original format as a 3-D showpiece. This could've been an extra-tacky disaster, but instead it's aged very gracefully. Thank the director's restraint, and the razor-sharp script, in equal measures.

The chilling way Milland explains to Swann the why and how of the details for murder. No one has ever captured the pathology of murder the way Alfred Hitchcock did in this movie with Ray Milland. (I can't see Cary Grant--apparently considered as an alternative for Tony Wendice--performing at the same level as Milland.) And Milland brought to the role a unique set of vocal talents that was perfect casting for a pathological killer. Almost a monotone with his demonic concern for the crime. Good looks and charm that prohibits him from looking like a pathological killer. Even at the end of the film where all is revealed--what does he do, he makes himself a drink and offers a drink to Margot, Mark, Chief Inspector Hubbard...So the movie really isn't about Margot, after an attempted strangulation, having strength to thrust scissors through a trench coat, a woolen sport coat--to reach a vital organ for a near fatal thrust. It is not even about solving the 'crime'. It not about the Hitchcokian macguffin of the key.The movie is really a character study of a pathological killer; and Ray Milland fulfilled the role with excellence.",

With Margot being the rich one Tony fears that if she leaves him he will be broke even though the relationship is a front, since Margot has left her fortune to Tony in her will he decides to commit the perfect murder. Tony blackmails small time crook Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) into killing Margot, Tony says he has devised the perfect murder & that no-one will suspect anything but even the best laid plans can encounter problems & on the night of the murder it's not Margot who ends up dead...Produced & directed by Alfred Hitchcock this thriller was based on the 1952 Broadway stage play by Frederick Knott & he also wrote the screenplay here, very talky & exposition heavy with only one main indoor location you can certainly see the stage influence here & while Dial M for Murder is a solid film I personally don't think it's a classic. Although very talky barely a line of dialogue is wasted as a complex plot of murder, blackmail, adultery & detection is painted over it's rather excessive one hour & forty five minute duration. One big problem I have with Dial M for Murder is that there are no mystery elements here, nothing is ambiguous & it's all far too obvious whats going on as it's spelled out very clearly during it's numerous exposition scenes. While Dial M for Murder is a decent thriller the fact that nothing is ever a mystery & who did it & how it was done & exactly what happens is made perfectly clear I did sit there watching but not really getting involved. Also the climax in which Tony is very confusing as it's all about a key, where it has been, where it is, where it should be & the film just left me behind a bit here as you can't keep track of who has what key or or the movement of the key as again it's all talk rather than say a flashback which would have made things clearer. The character's are good & Inspector Hubbard reminded me of Columbo, in fact the film itself reminded me of a Columbo episode with someone committing an apparently perfect murder before a nosey & clever cop figures it all out as he pesters the suspect & has endless questions.Dial M for Murder was a stage play & it's easy to see here, there's only one main location & that's indoors & it has lots of people sitting or standing around talking with little action. Originally shot & briefly released in 3-D some of the compositions are obvious with strange placement of foreground objects although I doubt the 3-D changed the film much. Being from a more innocent time there's no swearing but someone is stabbed in the back with scissors. You know Dial M for Murder is rated number nine on the American Film Institutes ten greatest mystery films but again I will say that there is no mystery here, it's all made perfectly clear from the word go what going on & people's motives are also very black and white.With a supposed budget of about $1,400,000 this is unspectacular stuff, it's very static & stagy but I am sure that was intentional. Although set entirely in London this was filmed in California. The acting is alright, it's not terrible but again there's a lot of standing around.Dial M for Murder is a good solid thriller, I enjoyed it for what I was & can certainly see the Columbo influences here but there's no real mystery going on & there's no great twist either. I don't know, it's good but I certainly wouldn't cal it a classic or even one of Hitchcock's best. Remade numerous times for telly & as A Perfect Murder (1998) with Michael Douglas.",

He would have to have the perfect plan to pull it off, but that plan would also require the perfect execution.Things didn't go according to plan which made the movie all the more compelling as we were treated to Mr. Wendice steadily trying to stay one step ahead of the police.

            "content": "\"Dial M for murder\" has always stand in the shadow of the masterpiece \"Rear window\" that Alfred Hitchcock made in te same year (1954). This may be just, but it doesn't mean that \"Dial M for murder\" is a bad movie.I would like te make three remarks about this movie.In the first place the use of color. In some other movies (\"To catch a thief\" 1955 and \"Vertigo\" 1958) Hitchcock used green in relation to his female lead. This was to emphasize how cool his blonde heroine was. In \"Dial M for murder\" Margot (Grace Kelly) is anything but cool. The color attached to her is red, the color of passion. Right at the beginning of the film we meet her giving a lukewarm kiss to her husband in a white dress and (some moments later) a passionate kiss to her lover in a red dress. This immediately introduces the triangle relationship that is at the core of the movie.Secondly the film is predominantly situated in one room. For a Hitchcock movie this is not unique. It was also true for \"Rope\" (1948) and not to forget \"Rear window\" also from 1954. What is unusual in \"Dial M for murder\" hoewever is that some interior scenes are shot with a bird eye's view (the camara seems attached to the ceiling).Last (and maybe least) I would like to call attention to the fact that in this period Grace Kelly was clearly the favourite Hitchcock blonde. She played in \"Dial M for murder\" (1954), \"Rear window\" (1954) and \"To catch a thief\" (1955). After the last film she quit acting to become the princess of Monaco.",

            "content": "A minor classic from Hitchcock's 50s era. A one-room mystery with a handful of characters keeping you on the edge of your sit with their witty, stagy dialogue, in shining technicolor. Dial M for Murder is a full hit.Ray Milland carries this absolute gem of a script, copied from Frederick Knott's play. He plays Tony, who is cooking a plot to get rid of his cheaintg wife Margot, played by three time Hitchcock sweetheart Grace Kelly, as much as he trades one-ups with Inspector Hubbard, his intellectual equal in the case, played by John Williams. The lover is played by Robert Cummings, who if you recognize him I'm guessing by you being here that it must be as the lead on Hitchcock's Saboteur; that film is one of my favorites from the Hitch, so the familiarity with Cummings comes in handy to not be bothered by his \"flat acting\", which many may critique. He has a modest charm similar to that of a young Tim Robbins.Dial M for Murder embodies a style of acting born with theatre. The script is built for the characters to not make a mistake in their speech at any given moment. Their humanity is not what is at stake, but their intelligence. Dial M for Murder, even though is limited to one single setting almost entirely, lives in another universe, where every dialogue is a piece of a giant maze of information and I'm here for it. Everything that you think is unexplained will be explained on your second viewing. I love films with flawed characters but mysteries sometimes require a little more cutting to the chase.That being said, is it worth it to sacrifice that for the script? I'd say absolutely. The script is admirable; one of the best in the genre, clearly by a talented writer. Every side of it, at least in writing, explores every bit of its potential. Whenever a character says something, it gets them one steop ahead of the rest. It is a game of chess in which those who can think two steps ahead are the ones who will percevere. There is no place for a mistake, because it could cost you your entire enterprise. This is the logic Dial M for Murder presents. You don't need to root for anyone, because you know either way there's gonna be some serious back-and-forth between the characters eventually, and line by line the final result will be revealed.Coming from Hitchcock, this is one of his finest pictures. And there's no doubt he was in his prime. Dial M for Murder is interesting in his filmography because he doesn't fully show off his capacity as a director as he had previously with vastly more aesthetically complex pictures; Strangers on a Train, Rope, to name a few. Would I like more prescense from the director? I'm not sure. We get a glance of what it looks like when Hitchcock grabs the helm of the boat mid-way through the film. Without going into detail, I'll say his involvement with the most intense scene is one of his finest examples of suspense and framing, and the way it stands out in the film speaks to Hitchcock's ability to know when to not overdo his job. He knows the disctinction between plot and action and I respect it.The rest of the picture is very cerebral, and it embodies that by being focused on the dialogue and the characters. It's incredible to listen to. But there's one only thing ticking me a little: I don't know how much more can you get by watching the film than you would seeing the play, listening to the radio show or reading the novelization. Probably not much, I'd have to admit. Even to the point that the ending, as fitting and satisfying, doesn't come off as striking as I'm used to with Hitch. The film is great, but not for him, which is the only disappointment.Nevertheless, it is absolutely worth every minute of it. It is entertaining and one of a kind. You couldn't ask for much more from the Master, regarding such a tight story.",

Well, the primary reason was that I'm in love with Grace Kelly, but the plot description was also appealing. Dial M reminded me of Rear Window, in a few ways. Most noticeably, the sparse (yet effective) action, and the use of a single apartment as the major setting for the film. In the hands of a lesser director, those two elements may have been a detriment to the overall quality. But Hitchcock once again works around them marvelously.\u00a0It's not hard to guess the stage origins of this movie. It actually feels more like a play than a movie. \u00a0And while that is in no way a negative, it does mean a lot of exposition. The story is explained to the viewers instead of shown, and because of that I cannot rate Dial M as highly as Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window.

The plan is worked out in fine detail but it goes wrong on the night when the would-be murderer is killed by his intended victim.Dial M for Murder is another film which perfectly showcases the variety of styles Alfred Hitchcock was able to turn his hand to in order to tell a suspenseful tale. In this case, he adopts a smaller scale approach, with the film being pretty stage-bound. It's a dialogue-driven piece where the action happens almost exclusively within the confines of one house. Interestingly though, I never really noticed this when watching it, which I think has to be a testament to Hitchcock's mastery of the medium, in which he can make a stagey set-up feel pretty dynamic and involving. Despite its intimate nature the studio insisted it was shot 3D to ride the wave of popularity the format experienced briefly in the early 50's. Hitchcock obliged although he refused to pander to the gimmicks of the format and used it in a more subtle manner, although it is admittedly used quite strikingly in the attempted murder scene where a hand reaches out to the audience somewhat memorably.This seems to be a Hitchcock which generates quite mixed responses. But for me, it's definitely an upper level entry. Its plot about the execution of the perfect murder is one where we sort of know where it's ultimately going to go, what we don't know is how we're going to get there and I thought the story was masterfully paced and plotted. Its character-driven nature means it's a film set-up perfectly for actors to stand out. And the one who rises to the top is Ray Milland, who stars in the central role of as the villainous husband. It's a very dastardly character and Milland plays him with some relish. Grace Kelly, as his wife, once again has effortless screen presence, while Robert Cummings as her lover has a pretty cardboard role but he does okay with it. All-in-all, very entertaining stuff.",

I'm not saying this to placate the film school dropout we all know and hate to watch movies with; I'm not saying this to please your fifty-year-old mother who is a fan of his movies but still views Along Came a Spider (2001) as a guilty pleasure. I'm saying this because it's a fact. Vertigo (1958) is his enduring critical gift to the art of cinema while Psycho (1960) is his pulpy gift to the masses and in-between the two greats, sits 52 other spellbinding films in addition to the much beloved Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955-1961). Everyone's got a favorite and while some may get their kicks from North by Northwest (1959) or Rope (1948), my personal favorite has to be 1954's Dial M for Murder.Dial M centers on a single question that many people find themselves asking out of morbid curiosity; how do you plan the perfect murder? If it were someone close like say your wife, how would you do it? Maybe you can hire someone to do it for you. Perhaps someone you can blackmail and functions outside of your social circles. Someone compliant enough to be exploited and use laundered money to pay them for their services.Indeed the supposed murder planned by Tony (Ray Milland) is set up like a beautifully played game of chess. As Tony coldly explains his plan to murder his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) to Swann (Anthony Dawson) his hired assassin, every angle is thought through. Every movement is calculated and timed, every detail addressed. Unfortunately for Tony, Swann and the rest of the principle characters, \"the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go astray.\"Dial M for Murder is my personal favorite Hitchcock film primarily for three reasons. Firstly, the film is shot almost entirely on one set, in one room of one domicile. There is a short scene in a jailhouse, one in a theatre and one in the bedroom of the flat but every important plot point and reveal takes place in the den of Tony and Margot's apartment. Limiting the space like that can be an advantage in that it heightens tension though very few directors can truly do such a thing well. To my recollection the only modern example to come close to chamber-proximity sustained suspense like Dial M was Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth (2002).The second reason I enjoy Dial M for Murder is its unabashed British-ness. I mean this in two ways; The characters are Torrie upper-crust types who always have a snobbish one-liner to spare. Additionally British movies of the era expect audience investment and even participation in the intrigue. Modern sensibilities tend to favor simple action centered plots we can all easily follow. Modern studios do this largely to cater to international audiences who don't want to be bogged down with subtitles and Americans who want to fiddle with their phones, fold their laundry and check their Facebook all while watching Bad Boys II (2003). I find myself doing this from time to time while watching movies but never with Dial M.The third and most important reason why I love this movie is because you know exactly how it's going to end. Not in the \"know how it ends\" kind of way of say every stupid, pointless, unoriginal, mediocre horror movie ever made, but rather in the way of we know Tony (spoiler alert) gets his comeuppance, we just don't know how. The characters Margot, her \"friend\" Mark (Robert Cummings) and Detective Pearson (Patrick Allen) are left in the dark for most of the movie. Only the audience is privy to all the dirty details of Tony's deceit and yet the question is left; will he get away with it? On that level the movie gives you a artfully done suspense thriller without a sub-par mystery cheapening the story.Alfred Hitchcock is said to be the master of suspense; a title certainly worthy of such a giant figure. His films have a complexity that leaves many to fervidly comb his filmography for interpretation. Whether you're a fan of a psychoanalytical approach to Hitchcock, a post- modernist or auteur theory habitue, you have to admit Dial M for Murder needs more credit than its been given which, up until today has been seen as a \"lesser work\". Don't be taken in by those in the supposed \"know\". Check out Dial M, and while you're at it, check out some of Hitchcock's other \"lesser works\" like Lifeboat (1944) and I Confess (1953).http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "The best laid plans",
            "content": "DIAL M FOR MURDER is easy to underrate. It's talky, lacks big suspense set-pieces, and loses a bit of steam in the second half. Hitchcock himself dismissed the movie in his famous interview with Francois Truffaut, finding it too theatrical. I myself would never argue that it is Hitchcock's masterpiece or anywhere close. However, repeated viewings make its treasures more apparent. Just as Inspector Hubbard wanted to take a second look at Margot Wendice's case, I too was compelled to rewatch DIAL M in spite of my dismissive initial evaluation.Based on Frederick Knott's most famous play, DIAL M's main conceit is simple: even the best laid plans go awry-- or in this case, the perfect crime. Knott's stage thrillers repeat this theme like a mantra, featuring master criminals whose arrogance and meticulous plotting always fall prey to chance, oversights, and underestimation of human psychology. Here, our master criminal (and some might even argue our protagonist) is ex-tennis champ Tony Wendice, a well-spoken sociopath whose competitive spirit seems to be apparent off the court as well as on. After discovering his wife's infidelity, Tony decides to off her and nab her money before she can divorce him, leaving him without a means of pursuing his luxurious lifestyle. Blackmailing a college chum into committing the murder, Tony appears to leave no detail unchecked, only for things to unravel when he makes one small mistake.Much of the film's pleasures come from this first half of the story. Tony is heartless, ruthless, and narcissistic, but also charming and affable, qualities played to perfection by Ray Milland in his best performance. The blackmailing scene is nothing but exposition, and yet both Milland's acting and Hitchcock's direction (famously evocative of a tennis match in the mise en scene) make the suspense palpable, even though there is not a hint of violence. All of this culminates in the attempted murder, a scene that could have been effortlessly inserted into a bonafide horror movie with its uncomfortable close-ups.Unfortunately, DIAL M loses a little something in the second half, once it's up to Inspector Hubbard and Mark Halliday to rescue Margot from the noose. While John Williams is an understated delight as Hubbard, Robert Cummings is a blandly handsome nonentity (though to be frank, Mark Halliday is hardly an inspiring character), and one does miss Milland's oily presence. That's all quibbling though, since the second part still features Knott's exquisite dialogue and then my favorite ending moment in all of Hitchcock. DIAL M might be perpetually overshadowed by its sister release REAR WINDOW, but like Truffaut said when discussing the film with Hitchcock, I enjoy DIAL M the more I see it.",

A clever (although typical) \"Hitchcock-Twist\" makes for a thrilling change to an unexpected \"Plan B\". Not as well known as similar Hitchcock films, this one is no less of a gem.

Hitchcock has taken a rather \"talky\" play and turned it into a suspense classic. While the screenplay screams to be \"opened up\", Hitchcock does a nice job of making the small one bedroom apartment interesting.Helping him do this is Ray Milland, who is nothing short of brilliant as the jilted cuckold, Tony Wendice, who plots to kill his wife. A former tennis pro, Tony must now live off of the wealth of his cheating wife, marvelously portrayed by the radiantly, beautiful Grace Kelley. Robert Cummings plays the love interest to Kelly. Cummings is pretty bland as Mark Halladay, mystery writer. But then, Halladay is the least interesting character in the play/screenplay. John Williams almost walks off with the picture as Inspector Hubbard.The score by Dimitri Tiomkin is appropriately eerie.But Milland is by far and away the stand-out of this film. Icy, a little creepy, and calculating, this is also, other than \"The Lost Weekend\", his finest performance.In my opinion the only major flaw is the last 12-14 minutes. Too contrived and unrealistic. Although I did like the final moment, where all they want to do is have a civilized drink together.A wonderful performance, wonderful suspenseful direction and score all add up to a truly great film",

Dial M for Murder suggests not, showing how a meticulously planned, seemingly flawless murder plot can quickly unravel due to the unpredictable nature of life. Likewise, there may be no such a thing as the perfect murder-mystery movie, but Dial M for Murder sure comes close\u0085If it ain't broke, don't fix it: that's the motto director Alfred Hitchcock seems to have taken to heart with this movie, wisely remaining very faithful to Frederick Knott's highly successful stage production, even so far as to confining the majority of the action to the play's single apartment setting. When this tried and tested plot is combined with Hitch's masterful direction and a superb cast, the result is a thoroughly riveting murder mystery that grips like a vice until the very end.The complex story takes real concentration, and I suspect that, if studied very carefully, it might be possible to pick holes here and there, but Hitch's superb handling of proceedings, and the terrific central performances, mean that one is never tempted to try.

            "content": "Usually, the formula for a great Alfred Hitchcock movie is to include the kernel of a mystery, then allow the suspense, drama, and acting to follow suit under his impeccable direction. In \"Dial M For Murder\", though, Hitch puts the mystery itself at the forefront of the plot, with the suspense coming in the detective work needed to solve the puzzle.For a basic plot summary, the entire story focuses around three four characters: a jealous husband (Ray Milland) who plots a murder scheme to kill his wife (Grace Kelly) for cheating on him with another man (Robert Cummings), as well as the police investigator (John Williams) who tries to put everything together.In one key way, this film is way ahead of its time (par for the course with Hitch, of course) in that (like the later Columbo TV series) it actually shows the murder right up front, thus shifting the focus from \"whodunnit\" to \"who figures it out correctly\". Seeing the characters squirm and emote is much more interesting than focusing on the one \"whodunnit\" issue.Plus, as usual, \"Dial M\" is classic Hitchcock through and through. The camera work is interesting, the suspense is palpable at times, and the plot is well thought out and intriguing. Only a bit of a letdown towards the end of the film prevents me from giving it a full five stars (but then again, Hitch never did know quite how to end a movie...).Overall, this is an exciting, suspenseful film much in the vein of a \"Columbo\" TV series episode. It may not be Hitch's very best, but it entertains the whole way through.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock was and wasn't the right person to direct Dial M For Murder, just as it turns out to be a film that contains some of his best gifts and some liabilities that are more-so apparent here than in most of his movies. It was based on a play, written for the screen by the same author, and close to all of the story and action takes place in the living quarters of the Wendices, Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot Mary (Grace Kelly), and it revolves around a murder plot by Tony to bring in someone no one will suspect (old college friend) to do in his adulterous wife so that Tony can collect the life savings and insurance. Then, of course, everything slowly starts to go wrong, however not until way into the second half of the story, as it usually goes of course.Hitchcock manages to garner some wonderful performances from Kelly and Cummings as mystery writer Mark Halliday, the one Margot is sleeping with, and the inspector played by John Williams (and no, not the more famous John Williams of musical scores). With Milland it's a little trickier to tell; sometimes he's very good as an elegant bourgeois husband, and other times it's obvious as hell as to the look on his face as to what he's thinking or plotting or, frankly, just the plain guilt showing and hiding ever so slightly. I couldn't peg whether or not it was very good or not, but whatever the case they all serve a plot that is burdened (all in vain of Hitchcock's attempts like with the 'legal processing\" of Margot with the stark composition and surreal lighting or certain close-ups and zoom-ins for detail or just the murder itself) by the \"stagey\" quality. That is to say, it becomes slightly predictable a bit of the way through and only gets intermittently tense.This isn't to say the writer Frederick Knott is necessarily bad at all. On the contrary, much of his dialog is extremely good depending on the scene or conversation, like those between Milland and Williams are best at a kind of double-gaming that adds to the dark humor as well as the suspense. But there are more than one moments when Hitchcock succumbs to not knowing what to do much more with the camera; there was a somewhat similar situation to the film Lifeboat, and however much Hitchcock tried to circumvent the limitations it was still a play being filmed. Certainly a must for fans of the Master, yet I wouldn't know if it's one of his better or lesser works. It's a combination of both, really, hence the rating.",

There's certainly no heart in the material. As a vehicle for stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings, it works well enough. Milland, in his last major hit as a star, is icy and convincing as the villain. Kelly was never a great actress, but is a pleasure to behold. She's well cast as the victim, though I can't resist the notion that any man who, however desperate, would seek to have her killed is not merely of the criminal bent but just plain bent. Cummings is bland in thankless support, yet his amiable disposition and general familiarity are somehow pleasing. John Williams, as a droll police inspector, steals every scene he's in, and became somewhat of a \"name\" for a while as a result. The movie is watchable, and hard not to get involved with once the plot starts to hum, yet it never shifts into high gear, due mostly to its theatrical origin.

            "content": "When you watch this movie it's impossible not to feel that Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! Whether it's a thriller like \"North by North west\" where the viewer is taken half-way across America, or an espionage movie that treks across Europe in \"Foreign correspondent\" or just simply a plain case of mistaken identity in the \"The wrong man\", Hitchcock was always able to find the right tempo, atmosphere and chemistry for his films. It's hard to imagine a simple stage play being transformed into a Hollywood box office hit, because with the exception of one or two short scenes, the entire movie takes place in a confined environment of a ground floor flat in Maida Vale London. Not surprisingly Hitchcock does not disappoint and is able to pull it off by producing a highly entertaining film!It is a well written story with great dialog between the characters, but it is the tension, the incidental music and the camera angles that make this movie compelling viewing. Needless to say the movie was blessed with some big box office draws of the day in Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Ray Milland, with fine support from Hollywood based Brits character actors Anthony Dawson and John Williams. I'm not suggesting that Dial M for murder is Hitchcocks best movie, the best of course is a subjective viewpoint, but the lead character here Tony Wendice who plays the villain, a washed up former tennis pro is probably Hitchcocks most diabolical killer. I say that because he is not deranged or violent but cold and calculating, he is able to personify evil in an easy-going and matter of fact way. For example not only does he really enjoy blackmailing Swan but takes great pleasure in detailing the way he plans to kill his wife and get away with it. In addition you can see that he is proud of the meticulous planning and ruthless dedication that has gone into this. What's fascinating about the character is that when he gets home and finds Swan dead rather than panic he does some quick thinking, takes advantage of that and is able to stitch up his wife Margot for Swans killing. With his marital woes now behind him (his wife going to the gallows) and the only person who knows other wise unable to talk you can see that he is pretty pleased with himself. Things couldn't have worked out any better for him and he even starts spend the cash he did not have to pay Swan. Even at the very end, a very nonchalant Wendice just casually pores himself a drink as if he had just come in from work. Watching him is like watching water of a ducks back, you'll simply never see Ray Milland in a better role!Robert Cummings plays crime writer Mark Halladay who is Margots lover, and Grace Kelly plays Margot who comes across as mostly bewildered the whole time, even before the attempt on here life. John Williams plays police inspector Hubbard who at first one just dismisses as an eccentric dunce. Initially you underestimate him and wonder if he is in over his head, but as his role becomes more prominent you realize that he is smarter than he looks and is way ahead of Wendice as things unravel. Lot's of twists and turns as you would expect from a Hitchcock movie and despite some obvious legal problems with the crowns case against Margot, it's well worth a watch! (Note: even if the initial crime had been successful and Swan had been able to extricate himself from the flat the police might have been puzzled why there was no wet footprints, grass or mud on the carpet bearing in mind that the garden was wet and that was the way he had meant to have gained access?)",

Its a good story about deception, suspicion and pure greed. Ray Milland plays the sneaky and quite bastard like husband Tony Wendice. He is married to Margot Mary (BAFTA nominated Grace Kelly). Tony has talked to an old school friend and planned a robbery for this \"friend\" to do in his house, for some reason. When the robbery goes wrong and Tony's friend is killed by his panicking wife, she is suspected of murder. (Coincidently when he calls her he dials the letter M, hence the title). Luckily in the end Tony gets what he deserves when the cops suspect him of deception. Hitchcock's cameo is on the left side in the class-reunion photo. It was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

            "content": "It is absolutely incredible when one reflects on the fact that Alfred Hitchcock made Dial M For Murder purely to fulfil his contractual obligations to Warner studios, and considered the film to be an effortless work that required little of him. He joked on several occasions that he could have \"phoned-in\" his direction (a clever little joke, as the film's most impressive suspense sequence involves Ray Milland \"phoning-in\" to his wife Grace Kelly in order to distract her while a murderer creeps up on her). The reason I say Hitchcock's casual attitude about the film is absolutely incredible is that it remains a very powerful and suspenseful film. How many lesser directors have expended every shred of energy on a film, only for it to be met with indifference or derision by the public and the critics? Yet here we have Hitchcock admitting that he has been neither meticulous nor ambitious in the making of his film, and has still produced something better than what most people could have done!! Such genius is at once arrogant and wonderful! Wealthy playboy Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is increasingly worried that his ravishing wife Margot (Grace Kelly) is about to ask for a divorce in order to run away with her lover Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Tony is especially fearful that a divorce will cost him rather a lot of money, and so plans to have his wife killed. Since Tony realises that the police would pin the murder onto him rather easily, he decides that his best chance is to ensure that he has plenty of alibis to prove that he is NOT guilty of the crime. He contacts an old school friend, Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson), and blackmails him into agreeing to carry out the murder for him. Tony plans it so that he will be at a social event on the night of the murder, ensuring he will have countless witnesses to confirm that he was nowhere near the murder scene. However, the plan goes horribly awry when Margot survives Lesgate's attempted murder and fights back, fatally wounding her assailant with a pair of scissors. Tony secretly tries to convince the police that his wife killed Lesgate in cold blood \u0096 he figures that if he can get her arrested for murder, it will be just an effective as actually having her murdered. But Mark smells a rat and works with the police to clear the name of his distressed lover.Dial M For Murder took a mere 36 days to shoot, but is a very rewarding and cleverly assembled thriller. Milland gives a terrific performance as the sinister playboy, and is excellently supported by the stunning Kelly (who would later go on to make two more movies with Hitchcock). The attempted murder sequence is a highlight of the movie, with considerable tension generated as Dawson creeps from the shadows towards Kelly as she chats on the telephone. Dmitri Tiomkin provides an effective music score, and photographer Robert Burks makes brilliant use of lighting and shadows to emphasise the suspense. While the story is rather static, and virtually no effort has been made to use the openness of the film medium as opposed to the stage, Dial M For Murder remains a solid exercise in tension. It might not be Hitchcock at his best, but it still beats the hell out of most Hitchcock wannabes!",

Dial M for Murder is an exception, and next to Jamaica Inn, it might be my favorite of his movies!Grace Kelly, a classic icy blonde of the Hitchcock movies, plays the unhappy wife of Ray Milland. I usually call him \"Ray Mi-bland\" but in this movie he's pretty exciting. He knows Grace is cheating on him, and he's going to do something about it. He's planned out all the details of a perfect murder, including an alibi for himself and an untraceable link between himself and the murderer. However, since this is a Hitchcock movie, you can be pretty sure something's going to go wrong. Otherwise it would be a very short movie.I'm not a Robert Cummings fan, and I just don't understand why Grace would cheat on Ray Mi-bland with someone so seemingly insincere. Ray's too good-looking for the part. If she's so terribly unhappy and seeks solace in her husband's friend, she should have had a better reason. This movie never gives a reason, so we should at least see she's not attracted to her husband.After you've seen this classic, check out the remake, A Perfect Murder.

Cinematographer Robert Burks gives the proceedings a nice coat of gloss, and Grace Kelly is attractive (though one-note) as the wife of scheming Ray Milland.

            "content": "That Frederick Knott's 1952 play \"Dial M for Murder\" should be chosen for Alfred Hitchcock's only venture into 3-D proved to be advantageous for the author, as there are only four main characters seen on screen, the rest being policemen, and really only one major set required, quite a challenge for anyone else to undertake. Warners was insistent that shooting be done in Natural Vision's two projector 3-D process, though few screenings could be viewed that way, the fad having died out in little more than two years. Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a recently retired tennis player who has deviously been plotting the demise of his wealthy wife Margot (Grace Kelly) for a year, ever since he learned of her dalliance with American mystery writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), expertly luring an old college chum who has fallen on hard times as the perfect patsy to commit the crime. Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) is aghast that Wendice has gone to so much trouble to ensnare him in this web but, comforted by the prospect of easy money for a few minutes work, uses the latchkey hidden in the stairwell to secretly enter the apartment, then wait behind a curtain to strangle his victim from behind after she exits the bedroom to answer her husband's telephone call. From his end of the line Tony hears the sounds of a struggle only to be stunned to hear his wife confess to killing her unknown assailant, requesting that she not phone the police until he gets home. In carefully laying the groundwork to have Margot arrested for murdering a blackmailer (the incriminating love letter placed in the dead man's pocket by Tony), the husband is able to get by watching his wife undergo a swift trial and conviction, while Scotland Yard's wily Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) keeps track of his spendthrift ways, using the cash intended for Swann had he carried out his task. Ray Milland was perhaps a bit old to be playing a retired tennis pro but he's absolutely sensational in a tricky part, constantly on screen and having to cope on the fly when his meticulous plans unexpectedly go awry. In such capable hands the talky proceedings never grow boring, and repeating their Broadway roles for the screen were John Williams, one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, and Anthony Dawson, also remembered as the wicked Marquis in Hammer's \"The Curse of the Werewolf\" from 1961, and devious Professor Dent in \"Dr. No,\" the very first James Bond feature.",

Hitchcock's approach to the material is somewhat hampered by the fact that the film was originally shot in 3-D, and although the scene in which star Grace Kelly confronts her attacker is justly famous, the film is essentially a meticulous recreation of the stage success rather than a Hitchcock original.Although familiarity with the material robs if of impact, most viewers will find Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER entertaining in an old-fashioned sort of way. For myself, I wish the film could be released to DVD in the original 3-D format, so we might see how effectively Hitchcock handled the requirements of the form.

Ray Milland plays a tennis player in the cruel old days when it was not good enough to be good at something. His wife got the money. Grace Kelly did not need much acting talent to play a boring woman but this is not why Ray wants to get rid of her. She falls in love with another man - Ray Cummings of all people. This casting is of course the reason why this film works. We are supposed to sympathize with the greedy husband and at the same time the wife has to be an angel. Very difficult but Hitchcock succeeds. And mainly because we cannot forgive her for even thinking of giving up her husband for a man like him. Still, at the crucial time when she is about to be strangled our sympathies shift to her. We want her to reach the scissors.And then we admire Ray Milland again and hope he will make it. His eyes are the most wonderful thing in the movies. It is a great pity that he played only in a few good ones even after \"Lost Weekend\". This is one of the few thrillers that can be watched over and over again. One drawback of course is that after a while you start thinking about the acting and the great directing and the simple pleasure of watching a good movie shifts to the background. This is true for all great films except for the greatest of them all like GWTW or \"Thief of Bagdad\" that can be watched a hundred times and still be seen like the first time -where you just enjoy the story.",

While there's a lot of talking and expository dialogue, that's simply because of the single location and the commitment to stick to it - aside from a few asides in a single scene where cutaways are necessary to enhance the plot and, more importantly, the tension - while also just 'shooting the material', as Hitchcock put it, so as not to 'ruin' what was already a captivating and clever source story. 'Just shooting' is to Hitchcock what 'working for a lifetime to achieve a mastery of your craft' is to anybody else, though. Indeed, it is well known that this wasn't one of Hitchcock's favourites and that the studio essentially forced him to do it. He once said, to a room full of journalists, that he could've \"phoned it in.\" This was almost certainly said in irony but I don't know what's worse: if it was or if it wasn't. There's no denying that Hitchcock, whatever you think about him personally, was a master of his craft and even this, one that he didn't care for as greatly as something like 'Rear Window (1954)' or 'Vertigo (1958)', is shot to perfection. It really is an astutely directed picture, one in which each frame is set up to make the most of every situation, and every moment truly is as taut and 'edge-of-your-seat' as it could possibly have been. The overall narrative is remarkably unconventional - since it essentially puts a 'villain' in the role of protagonist - and manages to switch our sympathies superbly, sometimes within seconds, so that every character is as empathetic as the last and there is no clear 'hero', as well as no moral compass other than that of our own. Plus, that murder sequence truly is one of the most intense and nail-biting of its kind. 8/10",

When things go wrong, he improvises a nearly perfect plan B. The original and the plan B are well designed, the film follows an intelligent and well-written outwitting of the main protagonists, and the story is so interesting that many will not even notice that the whole film takes place in one room with only a few characters. But this \"mystery thriller\", although very interesting, is neither mysterious nor thrilling, because the most of the \"mystery\" was revealed to us at the very beginning. The audience knows from the start the entire plan for \"perfect murder\" and follows the main character at every step of the improvised plan B, so there is no room for tension or speculation.The movie should have been opened by the scene of Grace Kelly answering the phone and the mysterious man attacking her from behind. From there they could build plot further, with occasional flashbacks to the time before the attack, where mystery would slowly unfold. If the audience observed the story from the angle of Grace Kelly or the police, instead of a man who devised the crime, the movie could have been straight ten.

            "content": "\"A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake.\" - Alfred Hitchcock Hitchcock made a number of \"smaller pictures\" which took place in confined or claustrophobic locations (\"Lifeboat\", \"Rope\", \"Rear Window\" etc). Of these, \"Dial M For Murder\" is one of the director's best.The film stars Ray Milland as a retired tennis pro who concocts an elaborate plan to murder his wife (played by the always enchanting Grace Kelly). The plan fails, however, resulting in a subsequent battle of wits in which Milland, Kelly and a police detective (actor John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard) attempt to outsmart one another.Based on a stage play by Frederick Knott, \"Dial M For Murder\" is, unsurprisingly, all sparse indoor locations and back-and-forth banter. Still, Hitchcock's clinical direction elevates things tremendously. Every line of dialogue oozes macabre delight, characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys, and the Master's plot unfolds like a well oiled piece of machinery, Hitchcock's camera, dialogue and cadence cold, immaculate and precise.Best of all, though, is the way Hitchcock juxtaposes up-market sophistication and respectability with devilish secrets and dastardly deeds. Despite their social standing, everything in this film is devious to the core.Of course there have been many films about \"the perfect murder\", and countless TV shows/films which rely on \"Dial M For Murder's\" Agatha Cristie inspired \"drawing room mystery plot\" (Hitchcock's own \"The Lady Vanishes\", \"Strangers On a Train\", \"Rope\" etc all rehash this formula somewhat). What separates \"Dial M For Murder\" from such films is how stripped down it all is. Hitchcock liked such no-nonsense efficiency. If you're going to indulge in a little bit of cinematic sadism - what Hitch unashamedly called \"celluloid cake\" - then you want it as lean and devoid of fat as possible. You know, like a skeleton.Incidentally, \"Dial M\" utilises a now-famous narrative structure known as the \"inverted detective story\" (every episode of \"Columbo\" utilises this structure). In the \"inverted detective story\", or \"howcatchem\" (as opposed to the \"whodunit\"), the audience/reader is shown the crime being planned and committed in lengthy detail, is aware from the start who the criminal is, and then watches as detectives and/or criminals slowly jostle for superiority. Author R. Austin Freeman is believed to have invented this format, but Hitchcock was the first major director to repeatedly utilise it, the format fitting the Big Man's darkly comic sensibilities.9/10 - \"Dial M For Murder\" was released the same year as Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\"(1954)). Both films take place in confined or fixed locations, Hitchcock concluding the spatial experiments he started in \"Rope\" (1948) and \"Lifeboat\" (1944). Worth multiple viewings.",

In thinking it was really Margot's that he hid under the floor-mat to try to let himself it. That ended up not only proving him guilty in this entire mess-planning a murder where the attempted murderer ended up himself getting killed by his targeted victim-as well showing us what an incompetent jerk he is.",

            "content": "In the book of dialogues between Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and Alfred Hitchcock, the master of thrillers states that he does not think there would be much to discuss about 'Dial M for Murder'. Truffaut contradicts him immediately and rightly so. 'Dial M for Murder' is a special film in Alfred Hitchcock's filmography, the adaptation of a theater play, a seemingly trivial film and which has many reasons to be strongly marked by the 67 years since it was filmed. And yet, even for the contemporary viewer, this film offers many reasons for interest and satisfaction. The main reason is that Hitchcock does not hesitate to look for and invent the most appropriate means to tell the story and create suspense, turning the interesting but quite conventional detective plot into a significant theatrical and cinematic experiment.The screenplay is written by Frederick Knott who adapts his own text that was successful on stage in London. It was originally a script for the BBC and has all the characteristics of the genre - a complex plot, a dramatic structure based largely on dialogues between smart criminals and equally smart cops, who play sophisticated games of cat and mouse, full of traps and brilliant reasoning. The story seems simple. A man discovers that his beautiful wife is cheating on him and plans to assassinate her. He hires a paid assassin through blackmail, but his plans to commit a perfect crime fail, as do any plans to commit a perfect crime. The main heroine survives the attack but gets into big trouble, like all Hitchcock heroines. I will not write any more details leaving you the pleasure of discovering the plot and the solution by yourself, but I will warn you that things are much more complicated than they seem, and the road to revealing the truth will be long, a road sprinkled with surprises for the viewers.As always in Hitchcock's movies, it is interesting to watch what happens on screen and also how Hitchcock presents what happens on screen. The master director never hides the fact that he is adapting a play. Most of the story takes place in the London couple's apartment, and the view is that of the spectator in the spectator's armchair. I don't remember whether we ever see the fourth wall of the room. However, the perspective is far from static, and that is why we never have any feeling of claustrophobia, or the impression that we are witnessing a filmed theater show. Hitchcock experiments a lot of new tricks in this film, from 3D cinematography or unusual filming angles, sometimes raising his camera to the height of the roof of the house, other times placing it on the floor. He also uses the technique of oversized objects to exaggerate perspectives at a time when computerized special effects where not yet even dreamed of. Dimitri Tiomkin's music dramatically accompanies the action and is one of the best in Hitchcock's films. Grace Kelly's acting performance (in the first of her three collaborations with Hitchcock) is remarkable, she is beautiful and charismatic, and Robert Robert Burks' camera follows her with devotion and admiration. Among her male partners, Ray Milland honorably plays the role of the cheating and vengeful husband, while John Williams fits well into the role (and the overcoat) of the police inspector. Excessive verbosity may sound very artificial to today's viewers, but at Hitchcock the text, music and image combine to provide the multimedia cinematic experience. The entertainment in this case is of good quality.",

            "content": "The great master himself, Alfred Hitchcock, wasn't the biggest fan of this picture. While it doesn't compare to the complexity of the likes of Vertigo or North By Northwest, it's the brilliant simplicity that sets Dial 'M' For Murder apart from most other Hitchcock films. Taking place mostly in a small apartment, Hitchcock builds the suspense through the claustrophobic environment and that way that he deals us enough information to follow the plot, while keeping the real important cards close to his chest so that it's difficult to guess what's coming next. The film never has you sweating on the edge of your seat as you desperately try to guess what's coming next as some Hitchcock films have done; but Hitchcock still manages to achieve tension through his relaxed plotting, and that shows what an adept technician the man really was. The plot has the usual Hitchcock murder formula, and it follows a man and a plot to murder his wife. He blackmails an old collage buddy into doing the deed for him. After that plan goes awry, our villain sees an opportunity to turn the situation to his advantage again...but there's no such thing as 'a perfect murder'.The film has a cast of only five main members, and this helps the claustrophobia of the film, while ensuring that it's easy for the audience to know where they are with all the cast members. Grace Kelly is the biggest name on the cast list, and while her performance is a little too one-note, and she isn't given much to do; it's always a pleasure to see this classic actress in a movie. Starring opposite her is the excellent Ray Millard, who manages to achieve a great sense of underlying evil with his performance as Kelly's murderous spouse. It's Millard that really makes the film, and he was the perfect casting choice for the central role. My favourite performance in the movie, however, isn't from the leads; but from the excellent John Williams as the Chief Inspector. Whether it was intended or not, Williams brings great comic relief to the film and also manages to capture the essence of the great detectives such as Sherlock Holmes with his rather small part in the film. The plot is intricate and well thought out, and it will require thought to aptly grasp exactly what conspired. While Dial 'M' For Murder isn't Hitchcock's best film - I rate it among the best, and it comes with high recommendations!",

It basically consists of a murder plot gone wrong, and it's a good example of one. The writing is often amazing, and you're always trying to guess what's coming next. What results is quite spectacular. Dramatic irony is used to the max.I happened to see it in 3D before I saw it in regularD, which I was glad to get a chance to do. Unfortunately, the Master does not use it very well. I cannot imagine a single film of his that would benefit from such a gimmick. To do so, it would have to be rather light, which this one is, and also contain action. Perhaps To Catch a Thief would be best. Maybe North By Northwest, but that one is probably far too good for that. Dial M for Murder is one of Hitch's talkiest films, and only during the murder scene is the 3D used to great effect. Otherwise, it just distracts.",

It abounds with small touches of humor and wonderful character interplay.The cast is terrific. Grace Kelly made four other films in 1954, including \"Rear Window\" immediately after this one. She plays the wife of Ray Milland, who is antagonist to two clever men: Robert Cummings is a friend of the family and John Williams is a police detective whose professional pride prods him into pursuing every possible clue.This is not a murder mystery.

            "content": "Dial M for Murder is your quintessential Alfred Hitchcock thriller. Now it may not be his best work, but it's pretty darn close. The story is engaging, and often quite thrilling. Despite the location of the film being mostly in the single apartment room, the audience never gets the sense of claustrophobia. It takes a tight screenplay and fantastic performances to make a one-room setting movie and it mostly works here. There is one tense murder scene, but I love how the rest of the movie is mostly talk, but somehow does not take away the aura of tension and suspension. The build-up for the justifiable ending is really, really fun to watch, especially since we have to deal with the charm of Ray Milland's character.Hitchcock's film is about a pro-tennis player named Tony who decides to settle down and be there for his wife. Meanwhile, his wife Margot, had an affair with an American named Mark. One day, Mark comes to visit. As they were going out for the evening, Tony decides to stay at home so he can plot a murder. The murder of his wife. But not all plots go according to the plan\u0085.The acting cannot get much better than this. Ray Milland injects his character with such charm, and one can see why people never suspected him of murder or blackmail. His charm even won me over despite me knowing exactly what is going on. Also, Grace Kelly delivers a magnificent performance. Her performance during the murder scene should have alone nominated her for an Oscar. Robert Cummings does a fine job as the man at the other end of the love triangle, Mark. Finally, I have to mention John William's fine performance as the police inspector who little-by-little pieces together the hidden clues.Overall, this is a film that shows why Hitchcock is the master of thrillers. He takes such simple stories and turns them into twisting tales that pierces the heart with thrills and dread. Despite a one-location, talkative movie, my heart kept on churning wondering what was going to happen next. I love how Alfred Hitchcock pays close attention to stuff like the keen details, the small camera movements to further enhance the audience sense of terror. This is a really captivating thriller thanks to amazing performances, a tight screenplay, and wonderful directing.My Grade: A",

            "content": "1954 was one hell of a year for Alfred Hitchcock. May saw the release of one of his most revered films, Rear Window. Then, only a few short months later he released another classic in August called Dial M for Murder. Rear Window might be the more well known of the two, but I don't think I'm prepared to say that it's the better of the two. Dial M for Murder is a thrilling story about an ex tennis player who plans to murder his cheating wife for the vast fortune she would leave behind. However, things go awry and he must elaborate a new scheme and comes up with an incredible plan B. It's a story full of intrigue, mystery, suspense, blackmail, two-timing, double-crossing, etc, etc. And it is absolutely awesome.This has to be one of the most brilliantly imagined and ingeniously constructed plots of all time. The plot is so elaborate for a story that only centers around three characters and the police chief investigating them. The plans that are devised are so well constructed and so meticulously played out that the suspense grows wonderfully throughout the whole film. There's a lot of dialogue and not a lot of action, but the genius all comes from this dialogue that perpetuates one of the most brilliant tales of deceit and deception I've ever heard. It is true genius via storytelling and it is certainly one of the most eloquently devious crimes I've ever seen in film.Of course, all the while the brilliant auteur that is Alfred Hitchcock directs the story with keen eye for witty detail, and beautifully arranged scenes with all sort of subtle brilliances that you don't quite catch at first. Hitchcock's flare that he always plays up in his films can come down to the simplest things, like how Grace Kelly's character begins the film wearing bright and vivid colors, but as the story grows darker and the situation more harrowing her clothes darken. It's brilliant things like that that make this film and all of Hitchcock's other masterpieces just that, masterpieces.I'm prepared to say that this is one of Mr. Hitchcock's finest directorial efforts and one of his finest films. The story is so elaborate and so masterfully told. The execution of Frederick Knot's script is perfect and the story is so enthralling and so exciting all the way through. The film isn't boring for a second. It is exactly what every crime story should be.",

            "content": "The only problem that some people may have with this film is that it's very talky, and filmed almost entirely in an apartment. However, that in a way was the brilliance of Hitchcock here. Talky, because it was a psychological drama about a man planning to have his wife murdered, and most of the talking is how he suckers a man into doing it for him, and then how he gets out of that after his wife kills that man during the attack. It virtually all takes place in the apartment, because this was a film translation of a play, although it doesn't really have the feeling of a play like a few films have.The cast here is excellent. Top billing went to Ray Milland as the murderous husband, and here is another case of an actor who today is very underrated. Milland, who has more dialog in the film than anyone else, handles it brilliantly. Grace Kelly is the wife. I'm not a particular fan of Kelly, but she was very good here...I can't think of a thing about her acting here to criticize. Robert Cummings, who devoted much of his career to comedy, had a few very fine dramatic turns, and this is one of them (another is in Hitchcock's \"Saboteur\"). As good as Cummings was in comedy, perhaps he missed his mark...he could have easily been a straight dramatic actor! He plays it just right here. A real treat is character actor John Williams, who steals many of the scenes he is in...as Chief Police Inspector. As good as the 3 leads are, Williams makes the film special.So sit back and relax with a great Hitchcock film, though it is not one of his bigger hits.",

The character is obviously meant to be droll, forcing the murderer to reveal himself by pretending to be amere bumbling cop, but Williams to me doesn't bring this out atall.

Things don't go according to plan; Margot fights back and her attacker ends up dead. Now Tony has another plan\u0085 while acting as though he is trying to help her he works to ensure she is hanged for murder!Given that this film is based on a play it isn't too surprising that it has a very theatrical feel; largely because almost all of the action takes place in the Wendice's flat. This isn't a problem though as the story is solid. Tony's scheme is just about plausible and the way he reacts after it fails almost makes him feel more villainous and the scene where the attempted murder takes place is intense as the attacker tries to strangle Margot with a stocking and she fights back with a pair of scissors. Ray Milland does a fine job as Tony, keeping him outwardly respectable rather than a pantomime villain. Grace Kelly is also solid as Margot. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Inevitably some of the attitudes displayed are rather dated; most notably when a policeman warns a junior colleague to be careful how he carries Margot's handbag or he could be arrested himself\u0085 no doubt this was meant to give viewers a chuckle but these days seems rather shocking.

            "content": "From what I've read, Hitchcock took the job of directing Dial M for Murder as little more than the last contracted film he had to do to complete his relationship with Warner Brothers. It also lacks certain marks of Hitchcock's, like how he was free with adapting material to change things such as who the killer was, keeping the original stage play pretty much wholly intact. And yet, despite Hitchcock's apparent disengagement with the material, he still managed to craft a highly entertaining and twisting mystery.Tony Wendice is a former tennis pro turned athletic equipment salesman who married the wealthy Margot. He's known for a year that she carried on an affair with the American mystery writer Mark. When Mark comes back to London for a visit, he sends both of them off on the town for the evening and invites Swann, an old schoolmate of Tony's, over. Tony knows of Swann's troubles with the law that he's always just a step ahead on, and he, in a steady drip of storytelling and implied threats, convinces Swann to murder Margot for a thousand pounds.The first thirty minutes of the film remind me of Gambit, the Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine film from more than a decade later, that spends its first long stretch outlining an illegal activity in rather exacting detail only to watch the scheme (a murder and a con) begin to fall apart almost instantly as the action begins to move. Tony can't get his wife's key as easily as he expected, so he has to have an extended back and forth in order to take it from her handbag without her noticing. He can't place the key outside the apartment where he expected because he and Mark, going out for a stag party as his alibi, leave the apartment in the wrong order. But what's most interesting is how the plotted murder can end up going so wrong and Tony had covered his tracks so well that he can easily lean into another lie that implicates Margot in, not self-defense, but as a calculated murder to silence a man blackmailing her over a letter Mark had written to her (that Tony had stolen, gotten one of Swann's fingerprints on, and placed in the dead man's pocket before the police arrived).The movie promises us one series of actions and then proceeds to completely undermine it by the halfway point, giving us well beyond the promised and delving into the unknown with intelligence. There are details that get dropped (like Tony switching out Swann's scarf for Margot's stocking) that feel inexplicable at the time but get nicely paid off later.One of the things that helps the movie feel so entertaining is the performances. From Ray Milland as Tony to Grace Kelly as Margot and, especially, John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard, the actors embody their roles really well, letting the presence and ability to hand dialogue carry us through the actions. Milland's alternatively slimy and sincere performance makes Tony's moves between scheming and supporting of his wife convincing. Kelly's dazed state in the later parts of the film sell well, and Williams is just simply entertaining as the police officer who seems so far behind Tony and then suddenly so far ahead.It's a highly entertaining mystery that moves through its twists deftly and with charm. It's not Hitchcock's best, but, if he was as disengaged as the stories say, then it's probably his best work when he didn't care.",

For several months, Tony has been investigating C.J. Swann (Dawson), a disreputable fellow Cambridge alumnus who lives in London, in order to blackmail him into murdering Margot.Like the earlier \"Strangers on a Train\", this film involves a tennis star's dislike of his cheating wife. Either Hitchcock has a weird love of tennis, or tennis players in the 1950s had really bad luck in picking wives.What makes this story really great is how the original idea backfires! A few times, the plot goes in a direction that the lead does not expect, but he is able to think quickly and modify his story for the police in away that keeps him looking innocent and his goals within reach. It's pure brilliance.But best of all is how this film works through like a detective novel, relying on logic more than physical evidence. The mystery writer, without blood or fingerprints is able to deduce a great deal of what happened simply by running thought experiments. How plausible this is, I don't know... but in this film, it works! I personally prefer \"Strangers on a Train\" or \"Rope\", but \"Dial M\" is by no means a bad Hitchcock film.

The business with the key is extremely effective and the lynch pin that destroys the husband's alibi.GRACE KELLY is smooth but rather bland as the wife (a role offered first to Olivia de Havilland whose salary demands were too high), and ROBERT CUMMINGS has a rather conventional supporting role as the man she really loves.

            "content": "1954 was an excellent year for fans of the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Not only did he release 'Rear Window' \u0096 widely considered his best film \u0096 but also 'Dial M for Murder,' his lesser-revered, but certainly not inferior suspenseful murder film. The first of Hitchcock's three collaborations with the beautiful Grace Kelly (along with 'Rear Window' and 'To Catch a Thief'), it was arguably 'Dial M for Murder' that cemented Kelly's reputation as a genuine acting talent, assuring her enduring legacy despite a painfully short-lived film career. The film was adapted very closely by Frederick Knott from his own stage play of the same name, which had previously premiered as a BBC television play two years earlier.'Dial M for Murder' bears certain resemblances to Hitchcock's 1948 film, 'Rope,' in that both are based on stage plays (the latter adapted from a play by Patrick Hamilton), both take place largely in the one setting, and both plots entail characters attempting to get away with \"the perfect murder.\" The setting for 'Dial M for Murder' is an upper-class flat at 61A Charrington Gardens, Maida Vale, London. Most of the film's plot unfolds within these walls, though there is also a single scene set in a restaurant, and a very brief, highly-stylised courtroom montage. Staying true to its stage roots, the film relies heavily on character conversation to advance its plot, a style that could potentially become tedious in less experienced hands. However, the mastery of Hitchcock, coupled with the quality of the acting performances, successfully infuses the film with an ever-present atmosphere of intrigue and suspense.When famous former tennis star Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) discovers that his beautiful and wealthy wife Margot (Grace Kelly) has been cheating on him with American crime writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), he begins to plot the perfect revenge. Enlisting \u0096 via blackmail \u0096 the services of an ex-college acquaintance (Anthony Dawson), Tony plans to orchestrate the perfect murder of his unfaithful wife without implicating himself. However, as Mark points out to him, the \"perfect murder\" might not be quite as achievable as it seems: \"because, in stories, things usually turn out the way the author wants them to; and in real life, they don't... always.\"Just like in many of his films, Hitchcock heightens the suspense by subversively enlisting our sympathies for the villain. Nobody in their right minds would wish for the lovely Grace Kelly to be murdered, but somehow we are manipulated into almost hoping that Tony's plan is a success, and we revel in his sly brilliance as he recovers from his initial failure to implement an equally-devious Plan B. By doing this, Hitchcock makes the audience feel as though they are, themselves, a part of the crime, and as though their own fates hinge on the outcome of Chief Insp. Hubbard's (John Williams) investigation. Nonetheless, it is inevitable that the villain be brought to justice, and Tony's inability to accurately predict human behaviour becomes the single, gaping flaw in his flawless plans.To counteract the potential tedium of a film set almost entirely in the one room, Hitchcock makes clever use of colours and camera angles. To trace the downward spiral of an innocent woman who became the focus of sinister deeds, Hitchcock arranged for Grace Kelly to be dressed in bright colours at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. A viewer would also, no doubt, have noticed the prevalence of low-angle shots with household objects sometimes, such as lamps, standing between the cast members and the camera. This was done to exploit the 3D-format in which the film was originally shot, though, by the time of the film's release, interest in this gimmick had substantially waned, and only a handful of cinemas showed the film in this way. Nonetheless, even without the 3D, this style of cinematography places the viewer in a unique position, as though they are hidden within the room and secretly observing the characters' most intimate moments.Whilst 'Dial M for Murder' managed to keep my attention throughout its running time, the first half of the film was noticeably more suspenseful than the subsequent half. This \"drop-off\" might well have been because, in the film's final act, the audience's perspective parts from that of the villain and meets up with the shrewd Englishman detective, Hubbard. From this moment forth, the outcome of the investigation was never really in any doubt, and Tony was bound to be arrested and tried for attempted murder. Every moment up to this point, however, was completely unpredictable, and one hundred percent genuine Alfred Hitchcock suspense.",

            "content": "This feature was dismissed by critics and the director himself. Hitchcock had been forced into filming it to complete his contract with Warner Brothers before moving to Paramount, and has stated he could have phoned in direction on the project and the finished product would have been very much the same.Nevertheless, this Hitchcock suspense still deserves plaudits for its intricate plot, and above all, a masterful performance from Ray Milland as the dispassionate architect of a plan to murder his unfaithful wife. It is to our benefit that the studios refused Cary Grant's wishes to perform the role, convinced that the movie-going public would not accept him in the role of a calculating, cold-blooded, murderer. Milland's portrayal of this debonair and unflappable cuckolded former star of the tennis circuit, Tony Wendice, as he engineers both his initial scheme to have his wife murdered, and the subsequent attempt to cover up his involvement in the foiled attempt, should have merited an Academy Award nomination. Other notable performances are provided by Anthony Dawson and John Williams, both of whom reprise their roles from the original theatrical production. Williams would present the most notable cinematic role of his career in this as Chief Inspector Hubbard. This tall, urbane English actor had been a regular on the Broadway stage since the 1920s, and had secured a 'Tony' award for this very same role the previous year. Williams is majestic as the archetypal British detective, who so deftly orchestrates the villain's downfall.For his part, Dawson shares screen time with Milland for this movie's tense, unforgettable, exposition of the latter's plan to blackmail the former into murdering his cheating wife. Part of this extended sequence sees Hitchcock employ an overhead scene where the audience can enjoy a different perspective on the stage on which the planned murder is to take place. This technique would later be more gainfully employed in the staircase murder scene in Hitchcock's masterpiece, 'Psycho'. This sequence also contains a variation on the theme of the director's cameo appearances as Hitchcock is seated at the social gathering in the photograph used to establish Dawson's character's true identity.Hitchcock had turned to adapting this play after a project he was developing entitled 'The Bramble Bush', in which a man who has stolen a passport discovers he has taken in the identity of a murderer, fell through. There are flourishes of Hitchcock at his best, most notably in bringing such tension to a plot largely built on dialogue, and principally set within the four walls of one flat in Maida Vale. Specific scenes which convey his artistry include that of the shadowed pair of lovers on the door to the flat abruptly ending their embrace as the husband is about to enter, and the use of lighting and coloured backdrops behind a static close-up of Grace Kelly to sketch the courtroom setting. Most memorable of all, especially given the fact that this film was shot for a 3D format, is that of the frantic heroine's fight for survival as she reaches out towards the audience to grab the scissors with which she will ultimately fend off her attacker. So important to the director was it that this scene would have the same powerful effect on audiences as he had envisioned it would, that he lost twenty pounds from anxiety at the effort expended to achieve this.Such attention to detail is captured by one of the great director's most famous quotes. In seeking perfection Hitchcock mused: 'Scissors that don't gleam are like asparagus without bearnaise sauce'. In order to capture the moment the scissors impale the attacker's body as he falls upon them, Hitchcock had a pit dug and perched a camera on its edge to film at floor-level.With his studios in the financial doldrums, facing the advent of popular television, Jack Warner had invested heavily in 3D technology which had temporarily caught the imagination of the industry over the previous year to this feature's production. As Hitchcock would muse, this technology was a 'Nine-day wonder' and he had arrived on the ninth day. Indeed, after the film was premiered in the Randolph Theatre in Philadelphia, Grace Kelly's hometown, in its 3D format, by the second evening the performances reverted to 2D after the Theatre's management complained of poor audience feedback and low turnout. One uncharacteristic imperfection to this Hitchcock vehicle which is a vestige of the great director's attempts to harness 3D technology is the giant, and obviously fake finger and telephone, used for Wendice's fateful call from the club to his apparent defenceless wife.The original theatre screenplay by Frederick Knott loses none of its atmosphere from Hitchcock's treatment and is given greater punch by wonderful musical accompaniment. Interestingly, Knott only produced three theatrical plays in his professional career, but they proved so successful that he was able to live off their income. Moreover, the choice of tennis star for the principal protagonist in this work is of no surprise given the fact that the playwright was a gifted player himself whose participation at Wimbledon was prevented by the advent of the Second World War.This was the third and last collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Dimitri Tiomkin in nearly as many years. The latter provides a refrain with a tempo to match the mounting tension for both the phone call to initiate the attempted murder - wrapped around the clicking of the telephone exchange - and Milland's desperate attempts to inculcate his wife as having committed murder in response to attempted blackmail. Despite many voiced concerns over the complexity of the 'latch key' sequence, upon which the unveiling of Milland's plot hinges, for this reveiwer, it holds true tension. Other criticism of this feature centres on Hitchcock's having not 'ventilated' the screenplay by confining the screenplay to within the apartment walls. A master of exploiting confined spaces, such as in 'Lifeboat' and 'Rope', for this reviewer Hitchcock uses this limited space to accentuate the tension, of the developing plot. As Hitchcock commented to Truffaut, opening up a play for cinema audiences 'overlooks the fact that the basic quality of any play is precisely its confinement'.The only true weakness of the film is the casting of Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings as the unfaithful wife and her lover, both of whom fail to engage the audience, so much so, that one almost wishes Milland's character succeed in his despicable plot. In her cinematic debut, Kelly is undeniably beautiful, but comes across as characterless. Ironically, Kelly's character declares at one point: 'What's wrong with me? Shouldn't I be emotional?' As for Cummings, he would never attain a cinematic presence, and would prove more successful on the small screen. One only wonders how much the film would have achieved greater renown had Hitchcock been able to cast his first choice of Deborah Kerr. It is astonishing that to the omission of those cast members who performed so ably on screen, it would be Kelly alone who received a nomination at the BAFTAs. Her most positive contribution to the production was in terms of a costume suggestion. Though Hitchcock had arranged for Kelly to wear an expensive robe for the scene where she is surprised by her assailant, the actress rejected it, stating that no woman would bother to be so attired to answer a phone call when alone in her flat. Thus, this scene was shot with her simply wearing a shift, probably making it both more shocking and titillating to audiences of the time.Offscreen, Kelly's record of dalliances with her older co-stars continued during this feature, but the romance which blossomed between her and Milland almost wrecked her career. Talk of Milland's plans to divorce his wife and marry Kelly soon ended when he was thrown out of the marital home and realised what he was about to lose financially.As for the movie, the director himself in conversation with Francois Truffaut would disregard the film as evidence of him 'coasting' ahead of his move from Warner Brothers to Paramount. He similarly stated to Peter Bogdanovich, when the latter asked why he had directed this adaptation of Knott's play, that: 'When the batteries are running dry, take a hit play and shoot it.' This dismissive attitude is further evidenced by observations made by Grace Kelly that the great director was working on 'Rear Window' even while this production was underway. Whatever his level of motivation was, with this movie he proves himself a master once more at utilising a claustrophobic setting to its best effect.",

            "content": "Dial M for MurderAlmost a parlor piece, something like Rope in that sense, and yet more taughtly written and directed, a play of wits, a game for the viewer to follow and anticipate. It is based on a play and, to its benefit, it feels like one. The dialog takes first row, and is crisp and intelligent. The original 3-D intended for the sets (and the sense of claustrophobia, apparently) is lost on most of us, of course, to the point that the color and lighting seem too high-key and pasty instead of rich and dramatic, but you can write it off as a period effect, just before Cinemascope and other wide screen efforts went mainstream.It's surprising how little pyrotechnics you need (and no blood) to make a suspense movie have real suspense. Not the kind where your hair stands up, but your brain snaps on to figure out what's going on, what's likely next, what would you do. By keeping the setting consistent for most of the movie (in Ray Milland's character, the antagonist's, apartment), Hitchcock also avoids any of the false back-projection he seems to be happy with in other, generally better films of his, like Vertigo or North by Northwest, which are both from roughly this period. In all a brilliant piece of writing and elegant, restrained film-making. The acting, too, is worth noting, Milland being utterly convincing, and the inspector, if a bit of a caricature, is also believable. Grace Kelly is always a bit too wooden for her sculptural prettiness for me (I've never understood her iconic appeal at all), but she plays a witless victim well, the kind of dull-headed blonde that Hitchcock favored, to the ill of all smart blondes and women in general. Woe to sensibility!And so we have a brilliant bit of British film-making, made in America (at the Warner studio lots). The original play, and TV teleplay, were both British, the emphasis on words over action is certainly an English clich\u00e9 in the movie world (and not always a bad thing), and the setting is of course London, with the clich\u00e9 Scotland Yard types at hand. All of this is quaintly appealing, and keeps an airy feel even as the main character plots the murder of his wife. What ensues is no joke, but it still comes across with Hitchcock's facile touch, knowing all along it's entertainment, not shock, that we are after. And get, first rate.",

Wendice blackmails an old college friend with a murky past into killing Margot while he and Mark are at a party, thereby giving him a perfect alibi. But of course there's no such thing as the perfect murder \u0085Hitchcock was a little disparaging of this movie, famously quipping that he \"could have phoned it in\". And yes, perhaps it is a bit stagy and talky, but that's doing it an injustice - it's a brilliant little thriller, with a terrific twist in the middle and a fantastic denouement involving a misplaced latchkey. It has a great villainous leading performance by Milland and a deliriously overenthusiastic score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Most importantly, Hitch fills it from start to finish with delicious visual flourishes; Tony spilling salt (foreshadowing his doom), the lovers' shadows parting on the door, Swan's shoes squeaking as he paces out the apartment, Tony's chilling goodnight kiss as he leaves Margot for what he thinks will be the last time, Swan's gleefully horrible demise, many others. The mechanics of the plot keep us gripped, but the director adds so much flavour with tightly composed shots, dramatic lighting and maximum suspense. I must confess I think this film has a liability however, and it's Kelly, in the first of her three roles for Hitchcock. She's a fair player but she has almost no range - check out the aftermath of the attack scene, where she simply is unable to play hysteria or look less than perfect to camera; all we see is her back and hear her voice over a phone. A great actress can play anything, and isn't concerned with how she looks, so Kelly doesn't qualify. This minor quibble aside however, this is a perfectly crafted little murder thriller that hasn't aged a day since it was shot. Based on a first-rate stage play by Frederic Knott - for another great film written by him, check out Wait Until Dark. Remade several times for TV and perhaps most interestingly as a feature in 1988 called A Perfect Murder, but as with so many movies the original is the best.",

            "content": "Hitchcock was looking for the perfect crime. He imagined that a person gifted with coldness and intelligence would be able to organize and carry out a violent murder, without it being discovered. But he was overcome by slips and also by an audacious counterpoint, always present in his mystery plots. This clash between the criminal and an insistent inspector fueled many of his works, such as the exceptional Dial M for Murder, based on the Frederick Knott play, shown in 1952. Both the original text and this first adaptation present a plot of surprising twists, with a reduced cast and an almost unique setting, whose main merits are the convincing performances and the well-structured dialogues. On top of that, there's an extremely captivating villain, a case of infidelity, and a seemingly foiled crime. The three vertices that are the main (but not the only) attractions of the work and, also, some of the main aspects that are repeated in a peculiar way in the filmography of the master of suspense.Against his will and after firm insistence from Warner, Hitchcock agreed to direct Dial M for Murder in 3D, which brings us to the first major element of observation regarding the film, apart from its obviously theatrical construction: there is a wide effort by the director to put things in perspective, and even the most famous copy of the film, in two dimensions, demonstrates this.Frederick Knott, who in addition to the play, is also responsible for the excellent script, presents, in addition to striking and very well-crafted dialogues, disconcerting twists during the narrative. Shot most of the time in a single setting, the film never becomes tiring, thanks to the good editing by Rudi Fehr and the delicious dialogues of the script, which are even more attractive due to the good performance of the cast commanded by Hitchcock. In fact, the director has a large share of responsibility for the exciting pace of the feature, thanks to the firm direction of the narrative, which wastes no time and seeks to present the conflicts between the characters right away in its introduction, making the viewer aware of the problems between Tony and Margot and of her affair with Mark. In a few minutes, we already know about the extramarital affair, the intercepted love letters and the disappearance of the purse at a train station. In this same scene, Margot's red dress alludes to the violent future that awaited her (in addition to highlighting the character) and the luxurious house in which they live shows us the couple's good financial situation, revealing the good work of art direction by Margot. Edward Carrere. That is, in a single scene, Hitchcock presents us with vital elements for the progress of the plot and which will have a future reflection on the narrative.A clear example of the quality of the dialogues in \"Dial M to Murder\" is the long conversation between Tony and Swan (Anthony Dawson), which, at first, serves to introduce us to that new character and his past, and then show Tony's power of persuasion, who convinces his colleague to kill his wife through blackmail in a convincing way. Intelligent, Tony had studied Swan's life for a long time and knew that he could not refuse the proposal. The scene unfolds with incredible naturalness, thanks also to the excellent performance of Milland and Dawson, who move and speak as if they were in a real game of chess, where every word can mean an advantage for the \"opponent\". In this scene, it is also worth noting how the camera follows Tony's movements as he simulates how the murder will take place, preparing the viewer for that remarkable moment. After the dialogue, Swan finally takes the money - and Dimitri Tiomkin's dark trail emerges to reinforce that he's accepted the proposal.With this kind of dialogue loaded with cynical humor, but with so many frightening truths being told that it instantly manages to make us laugh with nerves for the mere suggestion of the violent act that the perfidious mind of the duo suggests. Mere words that manage to be as tense as the iconic murder scene itself, and you already know that this in a Hitchcock movie is already cathartic entertainment in itself and where the director has already broken all potential expectations of how this takes place and has its denouement. Orchestrating everything almost like a musical scene of absolute tension, from the brief 'rehearsal' scene of the act, where we see Wendice walking around the apartment and teaching step by step what Lesgate should do on the night of the murder, with Hitchcock leaving the camera almost like a penetration, capturing everything from above and following the movement of the characters with simple movements from one side to the other. And when the act finally takes place, the spectator is already almost taking off from the seat of tension, not knowing how the violent spectacle of aggression will end or who will emerge \"victorious\" from the agonizing strangulation.Like any good play, the film cleverly manages to split in half between two long acts with an intermission in between. With the first half having been devoted to a play about a murder thriller that defies expectations, while it has reserved a beautiful investigative drama ala Agatha Christie reserved for the second half of what this story has to offer, while also being where the movie is. Decays in its few slips. Although the character of Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) who is basically playing the detective Poirot or Sherlock Holmes of the story, it gives the feeling that it drops a lot of parachute from the middle of the plot, which leaves the character of Mark Halliday, being the supposed author of serial killer novels, becoming almost a cynical anecdote of the director himself within the film, the supposed expert in murder and who soon becomes a laughingstock of both Tony and Hubbard.\"Dial M to Murder\" also features small moments of pure tension, like when Margot looks for something in her bag and says \"I'm looking for my... aspirin\". The viewer thinks, for a few seconds, that she would discover that her key wasn't there. Also notice the slow conduction of the scene in which Tony waits for the police to arrive at the same time he \"prepares\" the crime scene, seeking to incriminate his wife. Once again, the master of suspense prolongs the tense moments to the fullest. This is the secret to the story's success. During the investigation of the astute Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), Tony plays the correct game, not making clear his real intention to frame his wife - and Ray Milland does well in this aspect, demonstrating confidence in his words. Notice how, whenever he can, he tries to be solicitous and concerned about defending Margot, when, in fact, we know what he really wants is to condemn her. Hitchcock makes the viewer know more than many characters in the scene, creating, as he himself stated, the real suspense atmosphere.Elsewhere, Hitchcock frames Margot, Mark, and Tony, who says goodbye to his wife while surreptitiously placing the key under the rug. Mark observes everything, but doesn't realize what is happening. At the farewell, Margot finds her husband's kiss strange, as if she sensed what was happening - and Grace Kelly accurately demonstrates this through her worried face. Moments before, the conversation about the perfect crime helps to create the ideal atmosphere for the moment of execution of the plan, in addition to being reflected in the last scene, when Tony remembers a phrase from Mark. And then, as planned, the men go to the party and she is left alone, at the mercy of the cruel fate engineered by her husband. The even darker track indicates the tragedy as Swan approaches the Wendice house and even Robert Burks' photography, which until then had lighter tones, carries on the shadows and creates a very dark look, which increases the distress and collaborates with the atmosphere of suspense.As usual, Hitchcock works his big scene in every detail, starting with the time difference between Swan's and Tony's clocks, perceived first by the spectator and only later by the characters. It's these small details that can disrupt the duo's entire planning and serve to increase the tension even more. In addition to the clock, Tony comes across a man on the phone, just as he is going to call his wife. And then the phone rings and its ringing seems to make the viewer's heart flutter. Hitchcock knew how to extract tension from simple things and, in this case, an ordinary object like the telephone seems capable of hypnotizing the audience and leaving it in shambles. When she finally picks up, we don't know where Swan is, who is revealed through a beautiful camera movement, rotating around the entire scene until showing us the killer at the agreed location, right behind Margot. But he can't strangle the poor victim (and his hesitant look, seconds before attacking her, indicates that Swan wasn't the cold and cruel killer Tony expected) and, after fighting for his life, Margot manages to grab a pair of scissors and hit her. Him, killing him immediately. \"Dial M to Murder\" she then takes a big turn. What would Tony do now? It is precisely his meticulous and orchestrated action that we will follow, during the tense investigation that, without having a single action scene (in addition to practically taking place in a single scenario), manages to leave the spectator glued to the chair the entire time.With a lot of creativity, a good cast and a wonderful script, Alfred Hitchcock made \"Dial M to Murder\" one of the great films of his glorious career. A visual and indirectly metalinguistic experiment in conducting a plot in a closed space, Dial M to Murder is the elegant representation of a crime planned in detail and finished with the same class with which it is thought.",

Others were pretty OK for this material and the time when movie was made - but Ray Milland's performance was kinda ahead of its time. Directing by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock was great - at running time 1 h 45 min this movie was perfectly paced and was highly involving all the way long.Overall, \"Dial M for Murder\" is a simple mystery / detective story excellently told. Its not much as mystery actually, as we witness the whole crime story from the beginning. And its been a long time since i wanted for a bad guy to succeed. All in all this is an excellent movie.",

            "content": "I don't get the Hitchcock negativity with this film! I suppose it arises because he made so many greats over decades.The film was originally shot using early 1950s 3D technology by Warner Bros. 3D in the sense of some strange camera angles and vivid colours of household objects rather than the action/comic book 3D movie you get nowadays. It's not really needed. I watched the film in good old 2D and don't feel I missed out on the (early example) technology. I suppose it's another string in director Alfred Hitchcock's repertoire. He was always at the forefront of film gimmicks or experiments be it the long takes/real time of Rope (1948) to even the miniatures in The Lady Vanishes (1938).The casting includes Ray Milland and Grace Kelly as a married couple, Tony and Margot Wendice with Margot hiding an affair from Tony that of course he knows about and is planning deadly vengeance. Milland reminded me very much of a Cary Grant character and indeed I believe Hitchcock originally wanted to cast Grant who was unsure of playing a 'baddie' as such.The other major role is Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). An American crime author who had an affair with Margot 12 months prior.Tony hires someone to kill Margot but the murder goes wrong is all I will say about the plot.The ending and indeed the Inspector provides twists to a mystery that appears solved. John Williams plays the Inspector role very much like Alastair Sim in a British film I saw recently, An Inspector Calls (1954).The film was originally a stage production and you can see why with the film nearly all set in the London home of the Wendice's.A typical Hitchcock murder mystery that is worthy of a viewing.",

            "review_title": "Incredible Hitchcock Thriller!",
            "content": "If you are looking for a well-crafted thriller to enjoy, look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, Dial M for Murder. On the outside, nothing much seems to happen with the film, but once you see it, well you are in for a surprise. As Hitchcock films goes, this one is more off-beat. However, you can classify the film as one of best films of the legendary director's career.If you look at the film from the outside, you are wondering how on earth is this film even good. For starters, most of the film is located in a single apartment room save for exterior shots and a scene at a theater. You need a well-crafted screenplay for single-location movies to work. Also outside of one rather fantastic murder scene, most of the film is talk, talk, and more talk. But this film does work because everyone plays their cards right. The screenplay is well-crafted and despite all the talk, it creates an aura of tension and mystery which builds up over the course of the film, before we reach the shocking ending. The build-up is excellent and it is very much worth it when the end is revealed. I also like that despite the movie being located in one room 98% of the time, you never get that feel of unintentional claustrophobia. So thanks to the excellent screenplay by Frederick Knott and masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, you never really think about that one location.Now it's time to describe the plot of the movie, which takes place in London. The wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with an American author named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Her husband, Tony (Ray Milland), a professional tennis player, was away from home at the time on a tour. However, he quits tennis because he wants to spend more time with Margot, and help a marriage that is crumbling apart. One day, Mark decides to visit the couple from America. During the affair, Mark had written letters to Margot. She insists she destroyed them all, but one letter was stolen. She claimed she was blackmailed, but she never really thought much about that letter. When Tony arrives home, he insists Mark and Margot go to the theater, and he will arrive shortly thereafter. However, he ends up calling an old colleague, Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson). Together, they plot the murder of his wife so he can gain her fortune. But complications arise in the form of failed opportunities, the police led by Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), and Tony trying to constantly cover his footsteps so he will not be implicated in any wrongdoing.Here is a film that is a masterpiece when it comes to delivering acting skills. Ray Milland injects his character with an incredible amount of charm, and his character is often likable even if his motives are not. His simple charm was enough to win me and many, many people over, enough to believe how he would do nothing wrong. Grace Kelly is absolutely magnificent in her role as Margot. During the murder scene, her performance was enough for me to wish she was nominated for an Oscar, which sadly enough she wasn't. These were the two main attractions of the movies, but there was another great performance to point out. John Williams (no, not the legendary composer), has been a staple of Hitchcock movies, so it is no surprise for him to show up here. I really loved his finesse role as the police detective who figures out this case, piece-by-piece with a remarkable eye.Hitchcock is one of Hollywood's most famous auteurs. When one think of his works, usually The Birds, Vertigo, Rear Window, or, Psycho comes to mind. But never count out this underrated film. During the first phase of 3-D phase in the 40's and 50's, many films were subjected to 3D treatment. However the faze begin to die out in the mid 1950's, and this is the last film to use 3D during that phase. I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie in 3D, but it could have been cool. For those who watch Hitchcock films, you should be familiar with him appearing in his movies somehow, someway. In Dial M for Murder, you'll really have to search to find him and it's a genius move to see where you'll find him.Overall, Dial M for Murder is just pure, classic Hitchcock. It's one of his underrated films, but there is no denying it is a masterpiece. The premise is a simple one, but Hitchcock turned into a twisting tale that pierces the heart with a load of dread and thrills. It's a very captivating movie, not only from the direction, but also from charming performances from Milland and Kelly, whom characters are likable. The film is good at talking, but you should be good at watching. I highly recommend this fine thriller that has Hitchcock in top form.My Grade: A",

Therefore, and to avoid giving up her fortune, Tom decides to murder her but his plan goes wrong and Margo kills, in self-defense, the man who would kill her. Tom, to avoid the risk of being discovered, quickly creates a plan to take his wife to be sentenced to death.Directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock (one of the most brilliant directors of all time), this film, like others he directed (\"Rear Window,\" \"Psycho\", \"The Rope\" etc.), is based on a police investigation, and the dramatic tension of the plot resides in its development, putting the audience in expectation, waiting to see when the killer will be unmasked in their eagerness to try to save himself. That's a formula that Hitchcock used so often in his movies that it's difficult today to see this movie and don't feel that disappointment of those who expected something more, or something different. Nevertheless, this movie is good, is very well done and has a great cast (headed by Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings, respectively in the role of Margot, Tony and Mark Halliday) toasting the audience with great interpretations. The technical aspects (photography, soundtrack etc.) also seems faultless.\"Dial M for Murder\" is a film that already has a few years, and probably we've already seen it on the small screen.

            "review_title": "Skating on Pretty Thin Ice",
            "content": "\"The best way to do it is with scissors.\" (Alfred Hitchock's 'humorous note...)Charles Ramirez Berg notably points out that \"Alfred Hitchcock deftly blended sex, suspense and humor.\" Although there are plenty of other, more outstanding productions that prove the skill unquestionable, DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception from the rule. This film, however, will leave you speechless because of three aspects: confined feeling, improbable MacGuffin and excellent trio of leading stars. Consequently, the movie appears to be skating on pretty thin ice likewise the leading character who too earnestly plans but too easily slips up...The setting of this movie is no great spectacular location, like it would be the case of NORTH BY NORTHWEST or VERTIGO; it does not reach a loud crescendo like in A MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, it is no psychological drama in the mode of PSYCHO or SPELLBOUND nor does it reveal any Hitch's haunting effects like THE BIRDS or REBECCA. DIAL M FOR MURDER, the first movie made in 3D technology (paradoxically, released in the format after Hitchcock's death) with the screenplay by Frederick Knott, can boast of something on its own: striking use of colors, innovative experiments with visuals as well as almost claustrophobic settings that results in a rather confined feeling. The camera-work beautifully corresponds to the perceptions of viewers who are, in a way, involved in the world of the characters. Sometimes, the camera positions itself in such a way that even our perceptions resist the supreme spell of suspense. Consider the image from the top when the murder is being planned. We see the flat suddenly, in a different way, more from the watcher's point of view. For every little step is measured, every movement planned. Yes, we cannot escape being there, feeling the mood of the growing action and awe inspiring magnetism of single details.The movie's MacGuffin (famous Hitchcock's concept) revolves around the key that requires particular attention absorbing a viewer entirely. Here, as nowhere else, the director's precision and considerable commitment is remarkable. Mainstay thematic concerns, like suspense, wit, obsessive desires, neatly-planned murder are present here along with the director's cameo presence that does not make us wait forever. While tension grows, mistrust appears to place seeds of doubt about the motives. Objects like notes, a latchkey, gloves, watch and telephone create this tension remarkably. Unlike some other films, we know what happens, we seem to know the motives, nothing truly might appear as 'unpredictable' and yet, the viewer's attention is kept throughout in truly impressive tension. You cannot simply allow yourself for skipping even the slightest detail though you know who the villain is and you know that the villain is doomed to be punished (for unlike in real life, movies of the time had to punish the baddies). But this is achieved primarily thanks to wonderful performances.Although there are many supporting cast who do wonderful jobs and also contribute considerably to the magic of the entire movie, the trio of Grace Kelly, Robert Cunnings and Ray Milland is unforgettable. One of the three films that resulted from Grace Kelly/Hitchcock's great rapport sheds light on some new aspects of this beautiful, talented, highly sophisticated woman that embodied Hitchcock's ideal of beauty. She is captivating as Margot, a woman torn apart between two men, whose feelings are constantly changing, a woman whose relationship with her husband appears to be on pretty thin ice, whose illusion turns into disillusion and trust into mistrust. The entire emotional scheme of the movie is placed in her and delivered perfectly. Ray Milland is another milestone performance of a man who is exact, precise, stylish, decisive, extremely controlled and yet, not thoroughly. Something must break him at last...Robert Cunnings is a typical Hitchcock's positive character who is though very lucky to merely witness all that is going on.Among the supporting cast, particular attention should be paid to Anthony Dawson as Captain Lesgate, a reflective, rather sympathetic character subverted to a murderous scheme and punished most. John Wyman also does a fine job as police officer Hubbard. DIAL M FOR MURDER, though not one among Hitchcock's top movies, is a highly entertaining, extremely involving movie that I would recommend to everyone who is bored with fake development of schemes and silly climaxes that we encounter so often nowadays. Yes, authentic make-believe is something that makes this film so convincing, like Tony who makes everything look authentic since this border between reality and disguise might be placed on pretty thin ice. And...you will never forget these scissors... 9/10",

Nevertheless, let me add a few key points (pun intended).First, I decided to give ten stars because this really is a very entertaining flick. Is it a crime or thriller movie? Not really unless the viewer came directly from Mars/Venus.Second, a rich socialite lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment? Yeah, right.Third, what kind of people don't have spare keys (aka latchkeys)? It appears that no one in England has any.Fourth, and most significantly, it looks like that in England every man keeps his bare keys in his (one and only) coat pocket. No keychain, no keyring, no nothin'. Gimme a break.Anyway, I had fun watching it yesterday in 2D. I saw it some years ago in 3D as well, but that was a torturous experience (because 3D is weird).In summary, I highly recommend \"Dial M for Murder\" to anyone who wants fun but if you want a genuine hair-raising experience then pick another Hitchcock movie.Sincerely, PaulN (the proud owner of roughly speaking a dozen spare keys to his house even if he is not a rich socialite or the husband thereof)",

            "content": "\"Dial M for Murder\" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a man that organizes a \"perfect murder\" for his wife with an accomplice. An important distinction between this and other Hitchcock films is that mystery and suspense come not from attempting to ascertain what is happening, but rather if any of the characters can discover the details of a crime the audience has witnessed.Ray Milland is Tony Wendice, the man organizing the crime. Milland is well-suited to his role as a man calculating and resourceful. Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Anthony Dawson are solid in their roles as well. However, my favorite performance comes from John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Williams skillfully presents a subtle characterization that gradually makes a transition from easily dismissed to commanding.Though I generally prefer films with mysteries to be solved to those where the crime is known to the audience but not the characters, this film's story is tense and engaging. There are a number of interesting twists in the story that keep it interesting. \"Dial M for Murder\" is an excellent mystery and suspense film from Hitchcock.",

            "content": "It is said that Hitchcock filmed the successful Frederick Knott play 'Dial M For Murder' as his creative juices were running dry and he needed a little inspiration. Hitch saw it as perfect vehicle for his favourite ice-cool blonde Grace Kelly. She stars as menaced wife Margot alongside the great Ray Milland, who creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable 'charming villains'.Ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice (Milland)needs money fast. His young, beautiful wife Margot is having an affair with another man, the writer Mark Halliday (an uninteresting Robert Cummings). Milland sees no problem with murdering his unfaithful wife- he's tired of her, and she has a very favourable bank balance. Of course, he doesn't want to do the dirty deed himself, so he blackmails an old college chum into committing the crime. He will enter the Wendice's apartment late at night, with Margot being home alone on account of Tony's perfectly-timed business-meeting, wait for Tony to call the residence and then sneak up behind an unknowing Margot and strangle her to death. It reads as the perfect murder- until things start to go terribly awry when Milland places the crucial phone call...Milland oozes charm as Hitchcock's villain. This is one of his best performances, coming close to the perfection of his portrayal of Don Birnam in 'The Lost Weekend'. He's so dry and funny and supremely confident in the success of his plan that we end up hoping he'll get away with it. One wonders why Grace Kelly tumbles for Robert Cummings. Boring, plain and unromantic as Halliday, he and Grace share zero chemistry . Is this is a deliberate ploy by Hitchcock? Grace herself is physically magnetic here. One of the most stunning women ever to 'grace' the silver screen, her timeless elegance is on full display. She equips herself much better here than in 'Rear Window' in terms of acting ability. Grace handles her role very well, she's never brilliant but she has some great moments, particularly in the notorious 'phone call' scene (watch what she does with those gleaming scissors). Hitch loved his icy blondes, and he also loved to place them in dangerous situations. Grace gets the worst of it here, but throughout her ordeal she looks beautiful, and her appearance in a sexy slip is given plenty of attention.There is plenty of great Hitch touches in 'Dial M'. It's essentially stage-bound, with most of the action taking place in the Wendice's apartment, and rather talky, yet Hitch works his magic and takes what could have been a standard crime pic into a very good suspense thriller. The latchkey McGuffin is a Hitchcock trademark, and I do love the opening sequence. Milland and Kelly (in white, with a strained look on her face)are seated opposite to each other at the breakfast table. Cut to a scene of the newly arrived Cummings, with Grace kissing him passionately (well, as passionate as these two mismatched screen lovers could get), a true scarlet woman in a bright red outfit and lipstick. Subtle brilliance by Hitchcock.Not up there with Hitch's masterpiece 'Vertigo' or 'Notorious', but a fine film otherwise.8/10.",

Audiences who Like Hitch's \"Rope\" (1948), \"Lifeboat\" (1944), and \"Rear Window\" (1954) will no doubt Fall in Line among the Fans of this \"Flat\" Film that Takes Place entirely in a Flat, ironically, Artificially Enhanced to Provide Depth.Although coming at the End of the 3-D Experiment the Movie was Released in a Limited Run in that Format but Quickly became Only Available in the 2-D Experience Until 1980. The Dialog Flows Smoothly from Ray Milland and Grace Kelly but Robert Cummings is Unconvincing, Stiff, and almost Stutters at times and it is an Uncharacteristic Nervous Performance.The Rest of the Limited Cast does OK with Anthony Dawson as the Slimy Snakelike Contract Killer Remarkable. The Movie is very Well Done, but of course its Hitchcock and Compared to others in His Filmography it doesn't rise to the top, Although it is Immensely Popular. The Third Act is the Weakest when Things are Pieced Together in a Rush.Overall, certainly Worth a Watch for it is Hitchcock, and the Movie Stars Ray Milland and Grace Kelly. But Truth be Told, it isn't Much more than a Good Play Filmed by a Great Director and it's best left at that, for to Try and Stretch and say this is Great Hitchcock, well it just doesn't hold up.",

            "content": "DIAL M FOR MURDER just might be Alfred Hitchcock's least exciting film -- the least Hitchcockian as it were. It is based on a one-set play and Hitch does little to open it up. There is an action scene that bows to the then-new concept of 3-D, but it is only mildly exciting. Indeed, most of the film is just people talking. And on first viewing, it doesn't seem all that interesting or well done. Yet, it is a film you can watch over and over again and enjoy just a little more each time. Eventually, the idea of it being a \"Hitchcock\" film fades and you begin to see it for what it is, a simple, no-nonsense drawing room mystery. It doesn't need the Hitchcock stamp on it -- no theatrics or gimmickry like that found in Hitchcock's other one-set filmed play, ROPE -- only simple, straightforward direction. The play's the thing, not the director. As such it is less a Hitchcock film than a prototype for what would become \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents...\": a twisty sinister little tale that is a showcase for a special guest star.The star in this case is Ray Milland. In one of the few times that a mere actor has ever upstaged Hitchcock, Milland takes the film and runs with it. It is not a great performance (or a great role), but Milland obviously has great fun playing, the devious, oily and self-amused villain. The film is his for the taking, since the other actors, with the possible exception of John Williams, seem indifferent to the material. And it is apparent that Hitchcock found little of interest in the material either. That gives Milland ample opportunity to amuse himself with this trivial little toy.",

His wife had had an affair with an American associate of his, who comes back to them. The wife tells him that she had destroyed all the letters relating to the affair, but one had been stolen, and a note was sent to her demanding money. She sent the money to the blackmailer, only for that person to vanish without even taking it. Unknown to them, it was the husband who had stolen the letter and written the note, and is plotting to have his wife murdered-not for revenge so much as to inherit her money.His next act is to blackmail an old college classmate into committing the murder, while he arranges for his wife to stay home while he takes the former lover to a dinner party. Near midnight, the husband calls his apartment to lure his wife into answering it while the classmate tries to strangle her. But everything goes wrong when the wife ends up killing her would-be assassin instead. And then the story really begins! The husband then plants evidence to make his wife appear to have killed the man because he presumably tried to blackmail her. She is found guilty...but can she still be saved? The movie is less a thriller than a police procedural, as a police inspector, along with the former boyfriend, suspects what really happened and tries to puzzle it out.The movie is a detective story, not a thriller like \"Psycho\", so don't expect bloodshed and mayhem.",

A young wealthy woman marries a tennis player and I suppose they have a happy marriage for some time. But after when our protagonist finds out that his wife is having an affair with a mystery novelist, he fears his wife would leave him and leave him out of her will and decides to murder her.Now, this is one of the only problems with the film. For me, this is not a good enough motive and I know he depends upon her but a murder is a little too far. He makes an almost perfect plan in theory and wishes to find someone to do it for him as he thinks police will instantly suspect him. Now he has this college mate which was always a trouble maker and decides to follow. This is an another problem as it is very peculiar and I know the protagonist is very smart but it is odd he follows someone when he could have been caught. He realises the trouble maker is scamming lodgers by changing his name again and again and doing other illegal things too. So he calls him because he is selling a car and pretends to be another person. Our protagonist tells him everything he knows and proposes a solution. He pays him some money and asks him to murder his wife which he agrees to. It is a clever thing done by our protagonist. The plan from the start goes wrong and the troublemaker is murdered by the wife in self defence. The police arrests the protagonist's wife as it seems she intentionally has done it. The husband is happy. But one detective senses something fishy and checks his doubts out and it is found the husband is guilty of ordering the troublemaker to murder his wife. The ending is terrific. But at end, it's not as interesting as other Hitchcock films",

It could be Ray Milland's cool portrayal of the scheming former tennis pro Tony Wendes, or Grace Kelly as the unfortunate Margot. Of course there is also John Williams, terrifically over confident as the police inspector who investigates the case, or Anthony Dawson who convinces as the cornered confidence trickster, Captain Lesgit.We must not forget the subtle, sublime touch of the master, who closes us into this fated two room apartment and involves us in the murderous goings on.

So this comes from the point of view of someone whose first viewing of this film is of the remastered version in 3D (and filmed in 3D rather than a post-production conversion).From the distance of 2013, this film doesn't have much in the way of surprises - the story, while a good one, is nonetheless fairly familiar. And its stage origin shows - despite a handful of scenes in other locations, this remains essentially a single set drama with a small cast.So, given that we have something which is not necessarily the most exciting property in the world, what has Hitchcock done with it? He has drawn excellent performances from his cast, to start with, and he has made the very most of his single set. The camera prowls around it, constantly seeking new viewpoints to reinforce the dramatic impact of what is happening, lighting changes create a number of different moods - impersonal, comforting, dark and menacing - and the mobility of the camera is all the more remarkable given the bulkiness of the 3D rig.For the visual impact of the film, especially in 3D, is amazing. The remastering is excellent, with pin-sharp image and saturated colours. And the 3D is stunning. Hitchcock joins a scant few directors as an artist who understands how to use 3D as an artistic tool to enhance what appears on screen. Nothing is going to jump out of the screen at you, but the true 3D image has staggering depth, particularly when the camera is on the move, and this adds enormously to the visual appreciation of the film.This film should be compulsory viewing in 3D for any director who is currently in the position of having to make a 3D film.",

            "content": "Another top-notch thriller from the master of suspense, 'Dial M for Murder' is one of Hitchcock's smaller films but still has all the hallmarks of quality we expect from him.The film is based on a stage play and, similar to 'Rope'(1948), has all the action (bar one scene) set in a single location - the living room of a London flat. The story develops around Ray Milland and his cunning plan to do away with his philandering wife, played by a rather lifeless Grace Kelly.The basic storyline is very strong and in some ways Hitch merely goes through the motions to produce a fine effort. The dialogue is first-rate, which it needs to be as some of the performances are run-of-the-mill. Milland is good, if not spectacular, but Grace Kelly seems bored and Robert Cummings, as her lover, registers little impression. It is left to the supporting roles of the killer and the Chief Inspector ( Anthony Dawson & John Williams respectively) to provide the only performances worth a curtain call.The plot is great though and despite the whole issue of the latch-keys becoming a little confusing, holds the viewers attention right to the end. As good a reputation as Hitchcock has, there are plenty of other names who would have done as solid a job with the source material, so whether 'Dial M for Murder' enhances his reputation or not is debatable.The 1998 Michael Douglas/Gwyneth Paltrow re-make, 'A Perfect Murder', whilst not in the same league as the original, is still very watchable and well worth seeking out. No doubt Hitchcock snobs pour scorn over it, but I was pleasantly surprised and Gwyneth Paltrow is better in the role than Grace Kelly.  Also, maybe its me but I always think the poster for 'Dial M for Murder' seems a bit strong for the time. Grace Kelly looks like she is being attacked sexually as she reaches back for the scissors. Maybe Hitchcock was playing out his fantasies !!!",

Time has shown, however, that the movie is probably better than its filmmaker claims.We might even say that this is what a mystery-thriller should be - not really all that serious, clever, absorbing, still popular (IMDb 8.2). Hitch may be disparaging, but Dial M For Murder is one of the better attempts in the 1950s to translate stage material into cinematic language.Knott's play pits two British intellects against each other -- upper-class gentleman Ray Milland and Scotland Yard Inspector John Williams. There is clever combat here. We are in a lair, full of tricks and treachery. The camera snakes about the expensive London flat, looking for things, taking off-kilter perspectives on the actors, pausing on key objects: sports trophies, heavy green draperies, the handbag, the crucial telephone, and a quite renowned photograph on the wall.As a bonus, Dial M For Murder contains a pivotal - and still startling - \"telephone\" moment of the movies. Grace Kelly answers the pre-arranged phone call from Milland just as murderer Anthony Dawson creeps up behind her with a strangling weapon. Contrary to all expectations, Grace makes adroit use of a pair of scissors.As a further twist, the prestigious society woman becomes a convicted felon herself. This unexpected reversal gives Dial M For Murder a real mid-point surprise. Tension keeps increasing. We know that the story engines are busy devising a way to free Grace from the hangman's noose, but we are never quite sure how this is going to work in the details.The film suffers a bit in the third act. A miscast Robert Cummings interferes in an annoying way. And the culminating trap to expose the villain seems needlessly entangled, with its criss-crossing of trench coats and latch-keys. The inspector, truth be told, turns out to have quite a remarkable skill at guesswork.This was apparently intended for the new 3D camera, but Hitch has never needed 3D, or, for that matter, wide-screen or loud-screen to enhance his effects. They exist in pure cinema. Even with something as stage-bound as Dial M For Murder, he still grips our attention with his clever, sometimes mischievous, devices.",

Of course later on, he is positively conniving, but it's hard to believe his conviction to begin.There are a few holes that could be easily picked in the story, especially in a day and age when everyone is so naturally suspicious and has seen every episode of 'Miss Marple' to know how to get away with just about anything, but I can imagine the storyline seeming more clever back in 1954.The detective is very unconventional and not the best actor to be honest, but his odd ways of dealing with the case almost seem a bit like entrapment. It's like he's trying to be Poirot, but without the genius and the 'tache.Other than that the cast do a fine job.As a whole, it's not a bad story and a slightly different take on the usual unhappy relationship leads to murder tale, but perhaps it is slightly old hat today, thanks to the hundreds of TV crime dramas available at the push of a button, some with far more complex plots than this one.Maybe it's not one of Hitchcock's best, even he claims to have phoned it in, but it's still an intriguing way to spend a couple of hours and I think that someone clever could do good things with the general premise and polish it to a modern standard worth watching even more, given the chance.448.45/1000.",

            "content": "Dial for Murder is one of Alfred Hitchcock's worst-yet one of the most famous-movies. The plot is about a man who wants to kill someone by, when she uses the phone next, strangling her. However, it backfires as she kills the henchman with a pair of scissors and a Plan B has to be devised about killing her while the police on the case. The story isn't the best, the only part of the story that intrigued me to watch this was to see what it had to do with a phone. The only scene that I excited me at all was when the main character realized that his plan backfired. Other than that, this is actually a very dreary film. But it's not all bad; the acting is great. I recommend this to anyone who likes murder, Alfred Hitchcock or just to see why it got to be so famous. If you're not one of these things, I suggest that you shouldn't be watching this movie at all.My Rating: */*****",

He blackmails an old college associate to commit the crime for him, but when things don't go according to plans, Wendice quickly hatches up a Plan B.The plot almost immediately gets to the point at the beginning, from Mark and Margot's dramatic talks about their relationship to Tony hatching up his plan for the perfect murder. Director Hitchcock brilliantly combines drama and thrills in the movie that will make you go along with all the detectives' investigation of the crime and them putting pieces of the puzzle together. Hitchcock keeps the suspense going throughout the film, filling you with intrigue from start to finish.The cast did an outstanding job in their acting roles, giving us classy and dignified yet dramatic performances in their characters. I especially enjoyed Ray Milland's crafty yet calm portrayal of Tony Wendice and Grace Kelly's beautiful and determined yet vulnerable portrayal of Margot Wendice. In addition, Robert Burks did a great job on the cinematography, especially in achieving the brilliance in color of the Wendices' upscale apartment flat.For the first time watching this 1954 movie in 2015, the story still looks fresh and captivating to me and it is highly recommend to any fans of mystery movies.Grade A",

But she has an affair with Mark (Robert Cummings) a writer in visit to London where the Wendice couple lives. What Margot and Mark doesn't know is that Tony knows about their affair. They also can't imagine what Tony's planning to do with her: He blackmails an old college associate (Anthony Dawson) convincing him to kill his wife in what is called a perfect murder. The associate believes and we believe in Tony's words, because his imminent presence and his plans seem to be flawless. The day of the murder is on the next day of the proposition made by Tony but something goes wrong and now Tony has to make all sorts of plans to get rid off the wife and her lover, and of course, a way to keep his hands on a large amount of money. But on his way is a veteran obstinate police inspector (John Williams). And what's next?This is one of those films where you always gonna ask what's next and it doesn't bore you in any minute. A very clever plot, with excellent tension moments, with a cat-and-mouse game between all the characters, a brilliant conclusion and very good performances by the cast. Ray Milland is fantastic playing the bad guy we all love to hate. He really knocked his performance out of the park. Complex, quite funny, a very dangerous mind, he makes of Tony Wendice a lonely genius of crime very cold hearted but at the same time you might always believe every word he says because his presence dominates every moment, even when his out of the screen you think of him imagining what happens next, if his plans are going to succeed or not. Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are very well too, but Milland and John Williams really were the most impressive performers in the movie. Williams in the inspector role created that logical characteristic presented in many detectives movies almost like an old version of Hercule Poirot in Agatha Christie's books. He's always one step ahead of everything and everyone, the guy who gets all the answers leaving the audience in that state of \"Tell us what you got, we want to understand how you got to this conclusion\". This magnificent movie is directed by the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho, Strangers on a Train) based on a famous play. For those who watched \"Rope\" it might seem very similar because both are based on plays and on screen it's almost one set (the apartment) and both main characters of both movies want to know if the perfect crime exists. But they also have in common the greatness of great acting, a very complex story and thrilling moments that makes you to be glued on the seat. \"Dial M for Murder\" is a wonderful masterpiece. Remade in 1998 under the title \"A Perfect Murder\". 10/10",

            "content": "This movie is a testament to the above mentioned proverb. After finding out that his wife Margot is having an affair with an American writer named Mark, ex tennis star Tony Wendice is enraged to a point where he wants to murder her. But before doing so, he wants to take possession of her money and property as she is the richer of the two. Thus, he concocts what he believes to be \"The Perfect Murder Plan\". He blackmails a former college friend Charles Swan, who has a rather murky past, into doing the dirty work while he himself goes to a party, thus giving the perfect alibi. He meticulously plans out every detail right down to making it look like a burglary gone wrong. But the above mentioned proverb takes effect and Swan is killed in self defense by Margot. Having no other choice, he improvises a new plan to cover his tracks and make Margot look like the killer. What happens next is the rest of the story.Hitchcock lives true to his nickname \"The Master of Suspense\" by directing a movie that to this day, keeps those who watch it on the edge of their seats. Just like with his masterpiece \"Psycho\", he has the ability to build up anticipation in every scene and spill it all in an exciting climax. Very few modern-day crime movies are as good as this one and that says a lot. The acting is good as well. Ray Milland portrays Tony pretty well while Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are almost as good in their respective roles of Margot and Mark as are John Williams and Anthony Dawson in their roles as Hubbard and Swan(though their screen time is relatively less). Along with good acting, you do have good characters that you could feel for as well.But of course, what I'm bothered about is how correctly Mark guessed at Tony's motives. Even if he was a mystery writer, it seems too much of a stretch for him to be that accurate. Besides that, this movie does tend to a drag a little. This is probably because, good as it was, this movie was also a product of its time.Overall, this was a pretty good movie and a must watch for movie buffs. My score-8/10",

            "content": "This is a top rate suspense film from Hitchcok featuring many memorable moments, and some very strong performances from Kelly, Milland, and Williams. With a brilliantly executed plot and twisting story, this is one of the most impressively constructed films of the time.Kelly stars as Margot, an unhappily married woman who has been seeing crime writer Mark behind her husband's back. Her husband Tony is an ex tennis star whose wealth is slowly draining. Mark is an American, and is travelling over to visit the couple in London. However, Tony has known for a year that his wife has been with Mark. Tony concocts an ingenious plan to murder his wife, blackmailing an old college friend into doing it, and getting his wife's money in the process. It is the perfect plan, as Tony believes there is nothing to link him to the murder- a burglary gone wrong while he is not even at the house. However, the murder goes wrong, and Swann, his old friend is killed by Margot in self defence. The police are eventually informed, but not before Tony has come up with an even more impressive plan which will see his wife framed for the murder. Enter the Sherlock Holmes like Inspector Hubbard whose intuition and genius, along with the help of Mark's crime writing paranoia lead to the truth.There are so many twists in this film that the viewer is completely led in circles by the director. Aside from the brilliantly constructed plot, special mention must go to Williams as Hubbard, whose tongue-in-cheek performance steals every scene he is in. Like Hitchcock, he is in control of the characters and deftly unravels the crime. This should not be overlooked because of Hitchcock's bigger, more familiar hits as this is one of his best.9 out of 10",

He blackmails an old college acquaintance into murdering his wife and making it look like a burglary gone wrong. But when it backfires, Tony finds himself forced to frame his wife for murder and to work a new angle to take the heat off himself.Adapted from a play, \"Dial M for Murder\" takes place almost exclusively in the one room save for one or two scenes. Thanks to Hitchcock's directing, I only really noticed this when I read about it afterwards. No scene feels stale or repetitive. He brings the apartment to life with different angles, as we delve into every nook and cranny. Ray Milland is the star of the film and he is backed by decent supporting performances from Grace Kelly and John Williams. Robert Cummings roles as the American was not really fleshed out enough and he was nearly just a prop. \"Dial M for Murder\" is riveting in watching Wendice plot and blackmail but by the end I felt that it loses the run of itself a little as the plot begins to get very far-fetched, and it's maybe not as clever as it thinks.",

            "content": "I first watched Psycho when I was only first becoming a film buff. I was unimpressed. For years I wondered why everyone loved Hitchcock so much. Then I grew and matured and found an appreciation for art and style and the effort and creativity that goes into film making and re-visited Hitchcock with Rear Window and Rope and my jaw dropped. I saw it...I saw the brilliance, the eccentricities, the suspense and the camera angles and the way he made his actors portray their characters. His best work (in my opinion) seems to be Stage Plays adapted for the big screen. I've never seen anyone perfectly capture a Stage Play and make it so perfect on film. Dial M For Murder is no exception. This absolutely breathtaking murder mystery reeks of suspense and dark characters and a nearly perfectly paced mystery that never misses a beat for even a moment. You can absolutely tell it was originally meant for stage given the entire film nearly takes on one set but you never once feel confined or like its the same drab backdrop. In fact, that apartment setting will come to feel like home and like you're sitting in the living room watching this story unfold before you.If I had one major complaint about this film...it wouldn't even be a complaint. I liked this cast. They all did very well and I loved this film so to speak ill of them wouldn't be right. However! The Main cast doesn't have quite the legendary charisma and chemistry of say...Cary Grant or James Stewart...if either (or both!) of those men had played the leads in this film...well the sheer mention of it gives me goosebumps. In fact, I understand Hitchcock wanted Grant for the role. Still, Ray Milland is excellent and absolutely menacing and twisted as the ex-tennis pro and husband Tony. At one point in the film I realized that I quietly mumbled something under my breath that implied I was inadvertently rooting for him! He is the ultimate villain and the film revolves around him. The stunning Grace Kelly (this woman defines elegance) plays his wife and the would be victim. Kelly is very good and she can do very little and still seem amazing because of her own level of chemistry on screen. She has a more subtle performance as the victim compared to the men but she is very good. Robert Cummings is good as her lover and the amateur detective of the film. He is sort of a background character but when he is on screen (especially during the climatic ending in his scenes with Milland) he is very good. Anthony Dawson was absolutely perfect as the menacing would be killer and the entire plot scene with him and Milland will be forever burned in my memory as an amazing dialogue scene. John Williams is also very good (reprising his role that he played on stage) and the lead inspector of the investigation. Every player in the film gets at least a moment or two or several lines where they really shine.How does Hitchcock take a story...or a play...and make it this soul searching story about the good and evil in men. Each shot, every take, every scene, every moment of dialogue is brooding and dark and gets under your skin. This film is an exception because it actually wraps everything up in a neat and tidy little bow but everything leading up to that will have you on the edge of your seat. People often get tired of hearing the old phrase \"they don't make them like this anymore\" but if you watch this film and dissect it or don't even do that...just watch it and pay attention to the characters and story and the tiny little things they do to make sure every part of the plot works and you'll realize they literally are incapable of making a film as effective as this anymore. Dial M For Murder is the perfect thriller!! It demonstrates why Hitchcock is a master of his genre and it is absolutely thoroughly entertaining. 9/10",

The ye olde they did what they could with what they had.What they, of course, should say is our scriptwriter and actors lack talent what do you expect. Nobody wants to say that so he or she blame the budget. What could you expect for so little money? Literally, you could perform this entire film in your own living room.Now in all fairness to all those aspiring Hitchcocks out there, most of you don't have a successful stage play as a starting point neither do you have a Grace Kelly or Ray Milland among your group of friends. (You probably have at least one Robert Cummings). That really does make a difference in a one-room play to screen adaptation (See Glengarry Glen Ross when it comes to stacking the acting deck).The story is nice and tight and expertly told.

            "content": "Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review is the awesome movie thriller Dial M For Murder (1954), where we the audience get a chance to see the perfect murder which is a husband plans and arranges his wife's murder after finding out she is having an affair. I wont go into full details of the story but you movie goers defs need to watch this, it's a treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain. The film is extremely well acted in almost every role and even though there are moments it might seem you are watching a theatre play (believe it or not this flick was based on a play), you are still peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes, which keeps you alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. Ray Milland is excellent as this charming witty and intellectual bloke yet he is actually a snake-in-the-grass sly husband who has an awesome poker face by covering his tracks as this innocent loving husband and his scene with Anthony Dawson who plays the would-be murderer Swann demonstrates a rhythmic dialogue of how each man orchestrate an ingenious murder. And of course, we get to see the actual murder scene itself, even if one can't imagine how a pair of scissors can be used to stab someone in the back. Hitch's shots with Grace Kelly in a colourful court is interesting as we Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few brief minutes. The actor who plays the chief inspector, John Williams is pretty much the audience member who has missed out the first hour of the film as he is like an overgrown kid in a candy store who is trying to uncover the plot holes and finding the that the devil is in the details, which include a pair of shoes and a pair of house keys. And as the inspector uncovers the truth you see how the drama reaches a boil point as the layers of truth peel away. Things are rarely ever as people say they are, and there's a devastating irony to be found in a final prosecution founded on what is ultimately incorrect policework. The film is really justified by the by the impeccably-well written dialogue and the intelligent minutiae of everything that can go wrong in a perfect murder. To me this film is where Hitch is at his best and is really at the top of his game, overall 9/10.",

            "content": "Now here is a suspense film that is almost purely that. There is only one murder scene, obligatory to the genre, and the rest is all dialog from the actors and Hitchcock's ever interesting camera-work. The result is a terrifically tense film that simply doesn't let up. Hook, line and sinker it gets you and keeps you to the very end.This film is especially interesting today when compared with other thrillers to see how vastly the genre changed. How much more about simple shock it has become, in large part. How much more about the superficial as most thrillers today have to have at least some sex or nudity, which often results with hilarious and bizarre results in the odd PG-13 category. Strangely enough this Hitchcock film feels like an inspiration for the Dogme movies as there is nothing but dialog to keep you interested. Of course, Hitchcock used sets and the apartment in which virtually the entire film takes place is surely a set (thus not true Dogme) but that feel of essence is there. It is a thriller that provides the bare essence of a thriller: a game of wits between characters. All the shootouts, car chases, explosions, hostages, etc... can provide great ingredients for tension, but any fan of the thriller genre should thoroughly enjoy this film since all those chases and explosions are merely icing on he cake. That game of wits is the real dough and substance of the genre. It is that one essential element that will ultimately make or break a thriller, because if it is poor then all those chases and explosions will seem pointless.In this film are but 5 principle characters and the camera work while engaging is pretty straightforward by today's standards. Yet the way these two elements - characters and camera - all interact are the main parts of this thriller and those precious essentials of any other thriller. --- 9/10BsCDb classification: G --- good for general audiences",

The technique is great, but there will be many small accidents in the play. In addition to being assisted by the hostess, the hostess did not want to stay at home to watch the show and wanted to go out to watch the movie according to her usual habits (which is also the killer's expected plan). Wanting to keep the key and other things that did not meet the plan, the murderer also responded with tact. This also shows that the plan can't keep up with the changes, but the killer responded quickly and smartly. In addition, the biggest accident was the lethal scissors on the table. I do n't think it was by the phone suddenly. In the previous small accident, the husband used his means to keep his wife at home to cut the newspaper in order to complete the plan. The scissors appeared. The second point, when the husband explained the plan to the accomplice, the wife always forgot to close the window, so she was a person who easily forgot things. In this way, it is normal for the wife to leave the scissors on the desk next to the phone. It is not an accident where the scissors are, it is a matter of course, the writer arranges well. And I think this is also the result of the husband 's self-reliance. In order to keep his wife at home so that the accomplice killed her, she let her cut the newspaper at home, and the scissors used led to the accomplice being counter-attacked, so that the husband had to change the plan and show his feet . I have to say that the male host's resilience is indeed strong. One of the most ingenious parts of the show is the key, which is also extremely important evidence. After the accomplice killed his wife as planned, he put the key under the stairs mat, but the accomplice put it back before opening the door and preparing to kill. This is really a second. Normally, everyone opens the door and comes in. Anyway, if you kill someone, you can get out of the room. You do n't need a key. Therefore, there is no difference between replacing the key at the scheduled time and opening the door. It is estimated that the accomplice thought so. This was also normal and logical, and it is no wonder that even a husband who is so smart did not find the key problem. There is also the problem that the male owner did not find the key. Part of the reason is that since he found a key in the pocket of the corpse of the murderer, he took it for granted that it was the key used to open his own door (the wife's key). The detective thought that he usually carried a key to his body. But the husband didn't think about this. If the accomplice waited for the person to kill and then put the key back, there should be two keys. On the one hand, it is the husband 's guilty conscience or that the accomplice will be implemented according to the plan. After all, the accomplice also practiced a wave of plans in advance at home. It may also be a fan of the authorities, and behold the spectator. Compared with the husband of the planner, the detective is a \"bystander\", and it is easier to find the key problem. But the problem of keys is indeed very clever, and it is not easy to find out. Finally, there was a wave of screenwriters. Most of the scenes of the movie (including the final reveal) were completed at home, but they can show a \"nearly perfect crime\" story. There are also so-called bugs in the movie, but there are also many details. When we are looking for shortcomings, do n't forget how good it is. The first time I wrote such a long film review in Douban, I thought about it silently before. I hope I can communicate a lot and discover new things.",

            "content": "After all the previous reviews, what can one add? Simply that I adore this film, see it again and again, always with the same delight, never getting tired of it. Curiously, though, it does not seem to me like a typical Hitchcock film... There is not a \"good guy\" fighting some \"bad guys\". The hero is a cold blooded schemer, who wants to murder his wife, but she is not so innocent herself, since she has a secret affair with another man, while her lover comes into their house seemingly as a friend, but is determined to make her leave her husband. There are no action filled scenes, the story is confined within the couple's house, and all is done with the utmost politeness and keeping of appearances. There is no \"murderer\", because the one that commits the actual killing does so in self defense.And yet, we are watching with undiminished interest, to see what will happen next. All the fascination emanates from the \"plan\", the setting, the idea, the master mind that orchestrates the crime scene,like a director does his movie, only his \"actors\" play it differently from what he had arranged. He swiftly opts for an alternative plan, and concludes his \"scenario\" with success, until a police inspector with unorthodox methods finds the loose end, the small detail that leads to the truth... At least 80% of the film's value is due to the performance of Ray Milland, he is pure perfection in his portrayal of the ex champion, the sportsman who organizes his last game, and almost wins the bet... I am very much surprised that he did not get a second academy award for this one, it really shows how unfair the whole system is. It is impossible to point out any favorable scenes, as he is brilliant from the first to the very last moment he is on screen. I especially love, though, the little scene when he hides Margot's handbag behind his back in order to steal her key , while she clings to him, so as to prevent him , both laughing while they struggle... Grace Kelly was very very beautiful in this film, more girlish and sexy than in any of her other roles, not at all like her usual sophisticated and coolly aristocratic self. With Ray Milland they made such a charming couple, that one is almost disappointed that things did not work well for them in the film. If only Tony had a way of knowing that Margot had decided to abandon her ex lover and stay with her husband, the story would have a totally different end! In such a case we would have a romantic film instead of a thriller, but I would surely love such a happy end! Something else that should be said is that Tony would not get the death penalty for what he did, because he did not actually kill anyone, he just PLANNED a murder that did not take place in the end, so he would probably be out after one year or so... I trust that he would be able to make a new life for himself quite easily after that! A film that has no need of any recommendation, its value is well established over the years, but I give mine just the same, as well as 10 points out of ten.",

            "content": "Tony (Ray Milland) is a former tennis star who, quite fortunately, married an heiress named Margot (Grace Kelly). Until a year ago, Tony was still on the circuit and often away from home. As Margot felt deservedly neglected, she turned to another gentleman, Mark (Robert Cummings) for love and affection. Quite by accident, Tony found this out. At once, he changed his schedule and stayed in London most days. Also, he started paying more attention to Margot and she is grateful. But, to what purpose? In his heart of hearts, Tony is SEETHING with rage and is plotting revenge in a big way. First, he is confusing Margot about who she loves and, also, has underhandedly taken a love letter from Mark and returned it. She is very alarmed that someone knows of her affair but she doesn't guess its Tony. More importantly, Tony has found a two-bit criminal to blackmail into bumping Margot off; this man has been cornered and will follow Tony's directions. Its quite an elaborate plot to get to Margot at just the right moment. But, as mystery writer Mark attests, \"perfect\" murders only happen in books. Sure enough, the plan goes off the rails. Now, Tony must cover his tracks and make sure HE doesn't get the blame! Is Tony smart enough to defeat the local detectives and, worse, turn the tables on Margot for her money? This fine Hitchcock film has great performances, especially by Milland as a suave, smiling killer. Sets are nice, costumes are lovely and production values are high. The main problem with the film is that it started as a play and the change in settings is very minimal, with most of the action taking place at Tony and Margot's house in London. Naturally, Hitchcock mixes up the camera work and tries valiantly to keep the viewers' attention. But, at least for this viewer, the mostly \"talk\" and lack of action becomes a bit boring. Nevertheless, just to see Milland work his evil ways as a \"gentleman murderer\" is worth the watch.",

            "content": "Wouldn't the world be so simple if everyone processes information as logically as the characters do here. An extremely low budget single set piece movie with 4 central characters doing a hot and cold job. One moment the action and dialogues feel irritating and the next moment they are intriguing. Works more as a 'what if' game you might enjoy on a lazy afternoon and talking about lazy somebody else is playing it and you just have to sit back and watch it.Tony (Ray Milland) has retired from professional tennis and living off his rich wife Margot (Grace Kelly) who is having an affair with Mark (Robert Cummings) a crime fiction writer. When Tony learns of this affair, he comes up with an elaborate plan for a perfect murder involving his ex-college mate Swann (Anthony Dawson). When the implementation goes horribly wrong, Tony quickly turns it again to his advantage. But he has to convince shrewd Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) along with Mark.Though it is highly inconsistent in terms of performances and dialogues, the screenplay is watertight with gripping suspense and a witty plot. What actually is a simple perfect plan, Hitchcock's brilliance shines here with his masterful placing of pieces and strategically joining them. Ray Milland's dialogue delivery is horrible in the beginning but gets better later and Mark's cautious and caring character could have been a little more interesting. Grace Kelly is beautifully shown but John Williams steals the show as the tactful inspector. Background score is loud as in all Hitchcock's movies including a thread that does not leave your head for sometime.Low budget thriller at its witty best",

People are mean by its nature and their greediness, selfishness, jealousy and vengefulness will get right back at them sooner or later. That's why I think there's no point of killing or murdering or hurting other people because those who do it will get what they deserve in the end and we should not stoop to their level.\"Dial \"M\" for Murder\" is probably the best detective story ever told by the master of suspense and it has one of the best dramatic performances by Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings. The plot is simple: a husband finds out about his wife's unfaithfulness and decides to get rid of her by blackmailing his college friend who chose the wrong path into doing it for him. Sounds similar because we've already seen and read many identical stories but what differs this one from the rest is Alfred's delivery of the material. He tells us from the very beginning who the killer is so that there's no guessing - only the detective's deduction in order to search for the truth fueled by the quickwittedness of the villain played gorgeously by Ray Milland. It's such a pleasure to observe him inventing more and more ways to get out and confusing the investigation.Beautiful score by Dimitri Tiomkin accompanies you throughout the movie and long shots and unusual camera angles help you enjoy the story even better. Mr Hitchcock knows how to frighten you, how to scare, how to confuse and leave you wondering, but he is also a master of entertainment; \"Dial \"M\" for Murder\" is a great entertainment tool for every cinema lover - a detective story put together with a love triangle drama where superb performances by Ray, Grace and Bob along with John Williams who played the police officer will leave you speechless until the end of the movie.",

            "content": "The success of this film is mostly attributable to a combination of (1) an excellent original script and screenplay adaptation by Frederick Knott, (2) meticulous direction by Alfred Hitchcock, and (3) outstanding performances by Ray Milland as the suave, scheming Tony Wendice and John Williams as the wry, amusing Inspector Hubbard. Imagine that Milland was acting as happy-go-lucky Professor McNultyin 1950's television show at the very same time that he was playing this cold, calculating villain. While the roles of Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings do not stand out as well, they do make a smashing, adulterous couple, and their special charm helps to make the film, which is shot almost entirely in a small London flat, much less claustrophobic than it otherwise would be.Wendice is a former tennis star who is accustomed to a high standard of living but who has suddenly been relegated to selling sports equipment, which he laments as being far less satisfying and lucrative. With the discovery of his wife's unfaithfulness comes the fear that he will lose critical access to her money. Rather than the prospect of a life of poverty, he decides to plot her elaborate murder before she ditches him altogether.Not having the guts to do the dirty deed himself, Wendice stalks and investigates a former classmate, Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson), a man with a very questionable past, before recruiting him as the hit man not only with the \"carrot\" of badly needed compensation but with the \"stick\" of revealing incriminating information about him to the authorities. As in the case of Louis Calhern's brilliant portrayal of Alonzo Emmerich in \"The Asphalt Jungle\", Wendice uses his false, outward image of respectability as a protective shield to avoid his potential implication in a very serious crime. At one point, he even warns Swann that no one would ever believe Swann's word over his own. In the case of both Emmerich and Wendice, their deceptively upright reputations do not save them from fatally flawed, criminal plans.Although Hitchcock was reported to be emotionally detached from the film and once claimed that he could direct it from a phone booth, he did nevertheless take great pains to perfect the filming of the actual crime, and his diligent efforts paid off. Whenever I think about the one death that occurs here, I still wince in excruciating pain. Ouch!Tiomkin's dramatic musical score adds significantly to the high moment of tension, but, at the same time, I didn't understand the overly dramatic music at other, less critical times during the movie, which seems excessive to the point of silliness, as is the case in another Hitchcock-Tiomkin partnership, \"Strangers on a Train\", a film which also features a professional tennis player as the central character.Before you try to trace the crucial movement of the latch keys, don't miss the director's trademark cameo appearance. It's hilarious! Hint: this time, he is not an anonymous pedestrian on the street.If you appreciate an intriguing screenplay, brilliant direction by a master of suspense, superb acting, especially on the part of both Milland and Williams, and the always glamorous presence of the Princess, this time gravely endangered and more than only once, you will not be disappointed here.",

            "content": "The film is too succinct to be critical. Hitchcock takes no more than two minutes, and margo's smooches with Tony and mark quickly clear up the characters. Then, through the dialogue of the characters to elaborate, account for the two men's fornication, and buried a lot of foreshadowing, also put forward a lot of questions. By the time Tony closes the door and turns around, the building of the film's dramatic premise is almost complete. Given the title, it is not difficult for the audience to know what the story will be, but they can only get a vague guess, because the director can only give the audience so much information. Suspense ensued. The audience wants to watch.\nFrom the house behind the policeman, the audience learns where the story takes place; From margo's newspaper, the audience learned about mark's occupation (which was important because he was an American writer, making his reasoning logically possible). This is the information provided to the audience visually. In terms of hearing, that is, a large number of dialogues, the topic of \"lost letter\" is raised, which makes the audience think together with the two of them. Who stole the letter? Whether or not Tony stole it, the director's goal is achieved -- and the audience is drawn into the drama.\nAll drama is conflict, and without conflict there is no drama. The conflict is revealed in the film's title, which is murder. There is no doubt that murder is bound to produce conflict, because if someone murdered, someone would be murdered, and no one wants to be murdered. As we know, themes are illustrated by characters and actions. Without characters, there is no action, and without requirements, there is no character. Demand, we learn gradually from the hero's elegant and easy dialogue, is the death of his wife. The theme of the story is obvious.\nAfter the hero Tony and lees plan to kill, the film appeared the first plot point, that is, lees picked up the money on the sofa into his pocket, Tony's face is grim. This is where the plot ends and the murder begins.\nAt the end of the second act, margo is sentenced to death by the court. The audience will ask, will margaux die? If before this plot point her fate fell to the bottom, then after this plot point, it is inevitable that she will rise from the bottom, that is the turning point.\nFind out the plot point, the paragraph of this film also came out. That is, the four points of the story: the beginning, the plot point at the end of act I, the plot point at the end of act ii, and the end. The episodes are, in turn, margo's affair with mark, Tony's plot to kill his wife, margo's wrongful imprisonment, and the real culprit's capture. Of course, this is only a general paragraph, you can continue to paragraph on this basis. For example, the third paragraph can be subdivided into three parts: the killer failed to be killed, Tony handled the scene, the police investigation and questioning, and margo was sentenced to death. The fourth paragraph can also be divided into mark's reasoning, the attorney general's inquiry, the three men's confrontation, margo's return home, and Tony's self-capture.\nAs a master of suspense, the plot of the film is by no means intended to disappoint the audience. And suspense effect rendering, turning this skill is not small, the story if there is no turning, all in the audience expected, and how to suspense?

The two talked at first in an easy, casual way, and then, with recollections, talked of the money stolen from the till. But the conversation turned, turned to the two people care about each other, talk about family, then turn, talk about killing his wife, and turned into a calm narrative, and then turned into a leisurely threat... Ups, downs, tension, relaxation, let a person marvel.\nHitchhiker's suspense can also be understood in the tone of the attorney general later. When the attorney general did not approve of mark's reasoning, I thought he was really stupid, but later I found out that he was playing dumb.\nFu should approach to say a clever use and a regret. Coup the scissors in margo's clip art, which is behind the killing weapon. It was a pity that Tony's careful handling of the fingerprints was not mentioned at all.\nAs for the choice of techniques, it really is to maximize the promotion of the story. Each choice of the protagonist is logical and reasonable, making the film watertight.\nThe story of the murder became a living art.",

            "content": "There are two kinds of murder stories. In those written by Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, the mystery is the identity of the murderer. Hitchcock specialized in the other type where the identity of the killer (or, in this case, the man who tried to arrange the murder) is known from the beginning and the mystery is how he or she will be discovered. Dial M for Murder with Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings is a classic example of Hitchcock's approach, though, of course, the viewer knows for a certainty that Tony Wendice (Milland) will be found out even after his rich, philandering wife, Margot Mary Wendice (Kelly) escapes the hired killer by plunging a pair of scissors into his back. The viewer is likely also to surmise that the third major character, Mark Halladay (Cummings), an American mystery writer and Margot's lover, will play a significant role in establishing her husband's guilt.Despite the obvious sign posts, Hitchcock manages to sustain the suspense thanks not only to his own skills but also to Frederick Knott, who wrote the screenplay and the play on which the movie is based. Without giving away the secret, the crucial question posed by the death of the hired killer is how did he get into the Wendice apartment? Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) answers this question initially by determining that Margot must have let him in and then murdered him because he was blackmailing her. She is convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged. But the chief inspector is not entirely satisfied and, seeking a different answer to the question, ultimately discovers that Tony planned the murder.Milland and Cummings handle their roles in their customarily efficient style. Dial M is perhaps more notable as a reminder, if any is needed, of how beautiful and how classy Hollywood's own Princess Diana, Grace Kelly, was in her twenties when she became a star. She was, of course, one of Hitchcock's muses and it's easy to see why.",

Even though one part is obviously in the wrong, but the fantastic acting and the way in which they are written gives all the cast a sort of sympatheic feeling.The overall premise is somewhat comical and ironic whilst dealing with crude situations, which gives it a spice of Hitchcock's characteristic dark humour in splendid fashion, and much of it takes place in one location, giving it a simple yet interesting aura.Conclusively, this is definitely one of Hitch's best and one of the best movies of all time, it should not be missed!",

Set in London Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans to commit the perfect murder by blackmailing a man (Anthony Dawson) he use to know a university to kill his wife, Margot (Grace Kelly). However, the best lay plans go to waste.Dial M for Murder embraces the theatre origins and is set mostly in the Wendice flat and few scenes take place outside. And like a play there was a two-act structure than the usual three and it is a dialogue- heavy film as characters talk about the set-up and events. The risk of this is it breaks the rule of show don't tell, but Hitchcock and Knott deliberately leaves the audience in the dark, especially regarding the police investigation.The film was also made during the 3D boom of the 1950s and it was noticeable with objects being placed in the foreground. The film has more of a depth of feel then most modern 3D films.Dial M for Murder is great for Hitchcock fans, yet it is far from being his best offering, even from this period of his career. Dial M for Murder a tout film, but some audiences might be driven away by its dialogue-heavy nature.",

Dial M for Murder originates from a stage play, it's evident here. This is a movie who's driving force is the dialogue exchanges between its characters. It's very talky. The cinematography has some odd shots, but that's forgiven for the gruesome action. \"The scene\" is the most violent scene Hitchcock has ever directed. Dial M For Murder dissects the gravity of a murder, every possible thing that could lead the detectives to the guilty one. The film is terrific until the final two minutes which is out of tone with the mood the film held for 100 minutes. Dial M for Murder's ultimately says that everyone is manipulative and to watch out backs (literally Grace Kelly, watch your back). Rating: 9/10Grade: A",

Vertigo and The Birds were solid as well.SO slick and the improvisation of the main character Tony (the ex tennis pro), the guy who is plotting to kill his wife once everything goes to hell is my favorite part of the film. His explanations to his wife that he tries to murder, once she escapes the murder and to the detective and to boyfriend of Gracy Kelly to whom shes having an affair with are all done brilliantly.He thinks of things to say on the spot and he does so in such a clever fashion. Pretty amazing and fun to watch. This whole film takes place in just one or two rooms and that is also what helps it flow. The dialogue is top notch, whoever wrote the screenplay deserves just as much credit as Hitchock does for directing this masterpiece.I love this flick so much that even I enjoyed the re-make with Micheal Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow entitled A PERFECT MURDER. (1998) since I liked Tony the man who plots the murder of his wife in this film, I could not help but root for Michael Douglas in A Perfect Murder.I try and watch this movie at least twice a year, one of my favorite, older, classic movies directed by arguably the greatest in film history: Sir Alfred Hitchcock.I would give this a 10-10 because it is one of my favorite films ever.But I will stick with 9 out of 10.A MUST WATCH!",

            "review_title": "Hitchcock's strong crime thriller is best watched in all three dimensions",
            "content": "If you think the contemporary 3D craze is a new phenomenon, think again. Though the current output of 3D movies far surpasses those of bygone eras, there have been two previous waves in cinema featuring the addition of a third dimension to draw audiences away from their television sets \u2013 first from the sets themselves, the second time from the choices offered by VCR technology: these days it's a combination of high quality television production, the relatively large size of the home cinema screen and the ease in digital technology for users to watch whatever they fancy that threatens audience attendance \u2013 the previous one during the Eighties, the very first one in the Fifties. Then, like today, some high profile directors, fascinated by the narrative and visual possibilities offered by the three-dimensional aspect, tinkered with the technology to see what it could accomplish and add to the overall viewing experience. During the short lived fad of the Fifties, the most notable director to explore the new dimension was Alfred Hitchcock, who used it only once, for his 1954 crime thriller Dial M for Murder. Though its 3D release was almost as brief as the interest in 3D technology itself in that decade, it cannot be denied the 3D version of this classic film still makes for a fascinating watch, both with regards to the use of the third dimension and the story itself. Thanks to the EYE Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, I got the opportunity to experience this film as Hitchcock shot it, in a beautifully restored print that utilizes the modern 3D techniques, which also benefits the vividly rich Fifties' colour palette that would have been absent in the original 3D print with its notorious red & green glasses.It's clear upon watching the film Hitchcock made ample use of the added layers of depth 3D offered, as we get a clear sense of persons and objects in the foreground, the middle and the background of the frame, the depth perception shifting as another person or object moves into frame prominently on a closer layer. Considering most of this Kammerspiel type film takes place in a single room, 3D actually comes in quite handy to make the environment feel more alive and diverse than it otherwise would have felt. Especially notable is the scene where two characters are in mid-conversation and a vase enters the shot, basically right in our faces as we see the two men continue to talk behind it, though separated (both visually and in terms of their narrative interests) by the vase which is positioned in the middle of the shot composition. Of course, a few more typical in-your-face shots are also present, and these work far better than the ones we have grown used to, outstretched arms feeling almost tangible as they seem to hover right in front of us. Also charming to behold is the blue matte lines that appear around characters as they are in motion: the modern 'high frame rate' technology might have been of benefit to avoid such visual oddities, but in this case it makes the movie feel even more historically intriguing from a technological viewpoint. Nevertheless, after the first hour it seems Hitchcock was running out of ideas as no particularly noteworthy new use of 3D is witnessed and the novelty of its sensations wears off. Until that point, this film makes some of the finest use of 3D to this day. The incomparable Grace Kelly never looked more beautiful than she does in all three dimensions in this remastered 3D print.In terms of story Dial M for Murder is simply a little outdated, through no fault of its own. The problem is it has been emulated, copied and parodied for almost sixty years. Though Hitchcock's famous mastery of suspense and the delivery and timing of his actors' dialogue is still of the highest order, it cannot help but make the movie feel like its dragging its feet just a little too long. The moment police inspector Hubbard (John Williams; not that one) enters the crime scene and displays just how brilliantly deductive the mind of a British inspector works as he spends the next 30 minutes explaining the details of the murder attempt for longer than we care to hear it (we got the point!), while occasionally touching his moustache in every conceivable clich\u00e9d manner, the movie drones on a little too much. Until that time though, the exciting plot offered by a man (Ray Milland) who means to murder his wife (Kelly) by blackmailing a former schoolmate who has fallen on hard times (Anthony Dawson), only to have the assassination gone horribly awry, makes for s striking crime drama of the highest order, good for many a scene of emotional tension like only Hitchcock managed to deliver. 1954 proved a good year for Hitchcock, as the celebrated director released the even more highly acclaimed (and superior) suspense thriller Rear Window \u2013 also starring Grace Kelly \u2013 only a few months later.",

            "content": "When former tennis pro Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) discovers that his wife Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) has been having an affair with American crime writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) he decides to arrange for her to be murdered. He blackmails former college associate Captain Lesgate - (which is merely one of his pseudonyms) into murdering his wife whilst Wendice is at a party with Halliday in order to give him an alibi. However, things don't go to plan meaning Wendice has to come up an ingenious back up plan in order to achieve his original objective.Before I go any further with my review, I feel that I must acknowledge Frederick Knott. Knott is the man responsible for the original play on which this film is based and I must say that it is wonderfully imaginative and an extremely clever idea. Of course, that's not to discredit Hitchcock who I must say has adapted Knott's play wonderfully to film. Hitchcock is helped by a terrific cast with Ray Milland as the vengeful husband Tony Wendice arguably giving the strongest performance. Milland is also well supported by the likes of Dawson, Cummings, and Kelly to name a few.Part of the fun with a lot of Hitchcock films are in their puzzle solving nature and Dial M for Murder is no exception. Right from the initial exchange between Wendice and Lesgate through to the rather clever ending - this film was crammed with suspense, it was exciting and as previous mentioned was both well constructed and clever. The cinematography was also excellent and the numerous scores used throughout the film were also highly effective. As a side note, it's also fun in Hitchcock's film to look for Hitchcock's cameo role - observant viewers will spot him in this film.Dial M for murder is an excellent film and all I kept thinking all the way through was how 'clever' everything was. The amount of time and thought that Wendice put into setting up Lesgate to carry out the crime. The twists and turns in the plot will have you on the edge of your seat and finally the 'clever' twist at the end will probably fool a lot of people. This is another brilliant piece of cinema that is clever, filled with suspense and is engaging throughout. Make sure you add it to your Watchlist.",

            "content": "It feels too much like a stage play instead of a movie. It's similar to ROPE, in that it's a little too confined to one particular living room set. I know Hitchcock tries to open it up a bit and include some exterior stuff, but it doesn't quite work for me. And much of the dialogue, particularly by Ray Milland's character, seems stilted. It's not surprising that when it was remade in the 80s with Angie Dickinson, it was done for television. It's okay as a telefilm. But not as a major motion picture. It's just not even close to things like TO CATCH A THIEF or NORTH BY NORTHWEST.With ROPE I remain a bit more engaged, because I am curious about the director's gimmicks using the long takes. But here, I find very little to keep me engaged. Except for the murder itself. After Grace Kelly stabs the intruder with the scissors it becomes way too talky again. And it takes too long to get to the part where they set Milland up with the key.I also think that while Bob Cummings is a charming actor, he's out of place in this sort of material. He feels very miscast to me. I know Hitch had worked with him earlier on SABOTEUR, but that story played to Cummings' weaknesses as a serious dramatic actor. Here he's supposed to be much steadier, as the romantic 'savior' for Kelly at the end.Something like SUDDEN FEAR is much more effective...with Joan Crawford as the woman in peril, Jack Palance as the young villainous husband, Bruce Bennett as the steady pal, and Gloria Grahame as the femme fatale. That's another thing. There's no femme fatale in DIAL M FOR MURDER. The husband should have had a co-conspirator, a stronger reason for wanting to getting rid of the wife.",

            "content": "\"I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge: I'd make some stupid mistake and never realize it until I found everybody was looking at me.\"Hitchcock loved to innovate and experiment with his films and some might argue that Dial M for Murder is his most straightforward mystery movie. But what we forget is that Hitchcock made this film in 3-D which explains why there are so many low- angle shots. Warner Bros forced him to do so, but in a way we can call this another experimentation from the Master of Suspense. It is by far his most wordy film and just like Rope the screenplay was adapted from a play. The film takes place almost entirely in a small British apartment where Tony (Ray Milland) and Margot (Grace Kelly) live. Over a year ago Margot had an affair with an American crime author named Mark (Robert Cummings) who is now returning to England. Mark meets with Margot and that is where we are introduced to their backstory. They had had a very torrid love affair and he continued to write to her after he returned to America, but she didn't. She explains that after Mark left, her husband had decided to quit tennis to spend more time with her and that she didn't want to leave him anymore. What Margot doesn't know however, is that her husband discovered her secret affair and was simply waiting for the perfect opportunity to have his revenge. Tony blackmails one of his former schoolmates, Swann (Anthony Dawson), and convinces him to murder his wife while he goes to a guys reunion with Mark providing the perfect alibi. Tony has been planning this perfect murder for quite some time so he can inherit her money (she is the one with the wealthy family). But something unexpected happens and the film took some interesting and clever turns that had me at the edge of my seat.I've mentioned before that in my opinion Hitchcock directed his best movies during the 50's and this is yet another great example of a film that was made during the height of his career. There might not be as many innovative filming techniques here, but the heart of the film relies on its clever story full of unexpected twists. This is the very definition of a mystery film and it stands out for the story alone. If you don't like wordy films then this isn't one for you because it feels very theatrical considering it takes place mostly in one room and it relies heavily on explanations. It's no secret that Hitchcock knows perfectly well how to create suspense and he manages to do so in this talkative movie relying on dialogue this time around more than on anything else. Although I do have to say that the confrontation between Kelly's character and Dawson is incredibly tense and filmed perfectly. It's one of the best scenes in the movie and very memorable as well. There is something about the mystery story here that feels like it was taken from an Agatha Christie novel or from Sherlock Holmes, and Hitchcock knew that he had a great story to work with and relied on the power of storytelling this time around.Grace Kelly is perhaps one of my favorite Hitchcock leading ladies and this might be her best role. I loved Rear Window and she was wonderful in it, but James Stewart owned that film. Here Grace Kelly shines in every scene and she is wonderful in the surprise attack scene as well. Ray Milland, who was unknown to me, did a wonderful job in the lead villain role, while Robert Cummings also delivered. I expected his character to be the one to figure everything out, but Hitchcock does include some clever twists and it's someone else who takes on the role of Sherlock Holmes, John Williams, who plays the Chief Inspector in this film. In a talky film like this, it is very important that you have convincing actors to play the roles and I felt that the cast delivered solid performances. This film may fly under the radar in Hitchcock's astonishing filmography, but I had a really good time with the screenplay and enjoyed it more than some other beloved Hitchcock films. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Blending the suitably ostentatious with thrilling consequences is what Dial M for Murder is all about. Alfred Hitchcock decided to opt with the 3D technique when filming Dial M for Murder, a decision which was best suited for its time. Tailored from a stage-play by Frederick Knott, the picture ideally sticks to its original theatrical roots. Set in London and based around one set-piece (an apartment), the film tells the tale of a man who meticulously plans the murder of his wife by blackmailing a former classmate from college.Well known for his unification of exciting themes and sinister humour, Hitchcock crafts the work exclusively through elementary structural procedures. This is what makes the film considerably more thrilling than the generic thrillers of its time. One might go so far as to say that Dial M for Murder is Hitchcock's most alternative picture. For example, rarely does the camera leave the set-piece of the apartment, adding to the claustrophobic quality the film surrounds. Nevertheless, it is the suspenseful ambiguity which keeps the viewer engaged throughout the film's entirety.Hitchcock exploits household objects (e.g. lamps) as a method of creeping extra claustrophobia into the piece, while combining both theatre and film with an underlined posture. He also meretriciously chooses his camera set-ups; this inserts an extra level of composure to the piece. Sudden highlighting camera shots on vital objects often occur throughout, which subtly offer everything a defining edge of expertise. In addition, the editing is performed in a way which observes the characters, rather than manipulating them for the narrative.Yet when you have truly professional stars such as Grace Kelly, Ray Milland and Robert Cummings you can be certain that you are in for a treat. All the cast perform with supreme sincerity, capturing the anxiety through strenuous, one-to-one conversations. It is these conversations that thrust the narrative, but in a somewhat subconscious manner of implicit screen-writing. The presence of the script is that of a miracle, since the characters begin to comprehend situations by realising another person's agenda. Essentially, Dial M for Murder approaches the flaws that become evident through lies, and the morality of the film only enters in the darkest moments. Many of the scenes become a barrage of dynamic cat-and-mouse integrity, with characters \"playing each other off\" to gain the upper-hand.Dial M for Murder further proves Hitchcock's status as an auteur. A recommendation does not suffice; instead, I must tell you that the work is indispensable, making it a must for film fans. Not only does it continue to be unflinching, but also irreplaceable in its novelty.",

This film is different, from my impression, when I compare it to say, my favorite film \"Strangers on a Train\" ( a must see).Wendice is NOT a likable character, nor is his wife as portrayed by a shrill Grace Kelly. Perhaps this was the intent. Interesting. Hitchcock often said he liked to put his characters through their own special torment, and we see a great deal of that here.I also find it interesting that Wendice, a retired tennis pro (and rather useless figure) is like The Farley Granger character in \"Strangers\". Also a life of leisure, the guilty character is an American tennis pro. Is Hitchcock poking fun at these people?.All in all, highly staged, but suspenseful. Not as good as most of his other films. 7/10.",

He has planned the murder carefully for a long time having discovered Margo has an affair with writer Mark Holliday (Robert Cummings); he doesn't care at all about his wife's infidelity but he sees the opportunity to use it in his meticulous plan. But something goes wrong and Margo survives the attack of the hired murderer (Anthony Dawson) and he's the one that gets killed.There's precisely when Hitchcock demonstrates his undeniable skill for thrillers and the film gains interest and intrigue as Tony starts to rearrange things on the move in order to create evidence that will put Margo facing the dead penalty for murder. After all, Tony doesn't really matter how his wife disappears as long as he gets her fortune.Ray Milland renders a classy and most precise performance as the ambitious and deadly husband (in fact the guy is almost sympathetic and you come to sort of admire him). Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings are good in their less compromising roles, and Anthony Dawson was always better in mean and menacing roles as the one he plays here.If not Hitchock's top thriller -I think \"Psycho\" is the one- \"Dial M for Murder\" is for sure one of his best films of the director and an extraordinary film in the genre; and don't waist your time with the 90's remake with Michael Douglas and Gwynneth Paltrow a definitely inferior product.",

All the other major actors give the performance of their careers as well. Brilliantly done and very satisfying entertainment. Interesting that it appears to be the last major film for both Robert Cummings & Ray Milland, who went on to many TV shows, occasional B movies, and guest appearances. Even Dimitri Tiomkin delivered a very inspired score. While he was great at major themes and grand action music, he seems to ramble pointlessly in minor action scenes (\"The High & the Mighty\" is a case in point. Some of the background music for the cabin action scenes seems pointless and unnecessary.) But...not in this case! He delivers a very inspired score that fits the film perfectly! (His last score for Hitch, by the way). Watch it again, you won't be disappointed (I guarantee...)!! Regards, Steve",

Bob Cummings was so oily and unctuous, how could Grace Kelly even get involved with him? And the British may be so stiff upper-lip, but Harrison's tolerance of Cummings is unrealistic.Every other character is dead-on and perfect. I never understood the casting of Cummings.

A jealous Tony then plots to have his unfaithful wife murdered for her considerable wealth. However the scheme goes awry when Margot defends herself and kills her assailant with a pair of scissors.

This film is a chilling for a moment when Miss Kelly is about to be strangled by the assailant, but it is not the greatest.

As always Grace Kelly just mesmerizes you with simple beauty, charm and of course grace. And the murder plotter played by Ray Milland was simply fantastic with his bold yet reserved concern for how this murder would actually play out. Mark played by Robert \"Bob\" Cummings adds quiet humor to saving his lovers life by actually suggesting the premeditated plot that the husband really wanted to carry out.The suspense is concluded with collaborated work by both the inspector, Mark, Grace and surprisingly the husband who actually convicts himself unknowingly.

            "content": "\"Dial M for Murder\" is Hitchcock's adaptation of the hit stage play of the same name. In it, a retired tennis pro blackmails a man into murdering his wife for him. He has an apparently foolproof plan but when it (naturally) goes awry he must improvise a new plan in order to save his neck.Being adapted from a single set stage play, much of the action occurs in just one location. However, Hitchcock varied his approaches enough that this fact didn't even occur to me until after the movie. There may not be a lot in the way of truly exceptional visuals but it should be remembered that this was designed for 3D presentation while all existing home video versions are flat. It would be interesting to see the 3D version since it was supposedly more about immersion than visual trickery.The script is clever and gave the actors quality material to work with. I'd say that Ray Milland outdid his Oscar-winning performance in \"The Lost Weekend\" with his villainous turn here. I was less impressed with Grace Kelly (though she's still good) but Anthony Dawson & John Williams both contribute fine performances in support. The film also benefits from an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin.Overall, \"Dial M for Murder\" is a well executed thriller that falls just a bit short of Hitchcock's best films. Nevertheless, it's well worth watching, especially for Milland's performance and, as always, Hitchcock's masterful direction.",

All right, I agree that it isn't one of Hitchcock's deepest or most personal films but it's really worth seeing -more than once- for it's great, twisted, plot, the acting of Ray Milland and John Williams and Grace Kelly.He originally released it in the 3D-vision system but as the big 3D hit was already over, most theathers didn't give the glasses to the audience.Let's say that it's a really thrilling movie, based on dialogues (wich is very odd coming from Hitchcock) but with a great timing that doesn't let the tension down for a single minute. The \"good\" characters, specially Robert Cummings, are really very annoying, but this probably can't be considered a flaw because the villain played by Ray Milland is very charismatic.SAY NO MORE",

This film, which has a great plot (very intricate business with the latch keys), still comes off as a filmed stage play and is very static.  The sets are uninteresting and the cinematography is mediocre because of the limits of only one major set, the apartment. Ray Milland is superb as Tony Wendice.....Milland can play it both ways, charming and sinister, and does it well here.  Grace Kelly is a bit subdued as the wife and does not get much of a chance to show her acting talents and the charm and sophistication that is her forte.  John Williams is absolutely delightful as the Inspector and brings humor to his part.  His schtick with the mustache comb is priceless.  The casting of Bob Cummings as Mark is a disaster! Cummings is a weak actor and it is hard to come to grips with the fact that Kelly prefers him over Milland. He does not bring believability to the part and therefore, throws the film a little askew. The suspense is good and Anthony Dawson, one of my favorite British villains, does his usual excellent job. This film, despite some of the apparent weaknesses, is another Hitchcock that is worth seeing.

            "content": "In the best decade of his long and illustrious career, Alfred Hitchcock put together yet another murder story that many consider to be a \"filler\" to pass time before his next great film, Rear Window. There is, however, much to say about this one, based on a play and directed in much the same way Hitchcock did Rope, also based on a play about a murder. Here, a man attempts to have his wife murdered, although it doesn't work out. So, he next tries to change stories to keep himself clean. But then there is a nosy detective... and his wife's lover keeps getting in the way...The play was confined to just one apartment room, and Hitchcock kept it mostly that way on screen, save for a few street shots and a party room. Doing this keeps our full attention on what is important; the setting of what will unfold here. Ray Milland does some of his best work here as the cool, sophisticated and unflappable husband Tony. Instead of flashing about as he did in The Lost Weekend, he keeps nearly all emotion bottled up and it is most effective when we think of him capable of murdering his wife. Speaking of her, Grace Kelly charms and wows in her first of three straight Hitchcock roles in a row. Of course, that is expected and Robert Cummings is also effective as the lover. One other role that comes to mind is that of British actor John Williams, perhaps better known as Audrey Hepburn's father in Sabrina. As the determined yet careful detective, he is not only sympathetic but fun to follow around as well.There is a lot to absorb here, and Hitchcock pulls no punches in giving it to us all. In fact, once the motives and clues start piling up, it can be difficult to know who is really the main suspect. If there is one flaw, it is that the final act goes a little long in the teeth and takes away from the marvelous buildup of the beginning. But, the attack scene is the best; effectively staged and quite a shock even after multiple viewings. It may not be one of Hitchcock's absolute best, but it works exactly as he intended it to and that makes it the kind of film that is important to understand the Master's masterful style.",

He gets the man to agree to kill his wife and he has laid out what appears to be perfect plan. Only thing is the man was the one who was killed. Wendice trying to cover everything up, decides then to make it appear that Margo had an ulterior motive for killing the man. And it appears to be working except Halliday doesn't believe she's guilty and the police uncover a few anomalies... Its funny to watch a film made more then 50 years ago, people look, talk and even kiss differently. The manners were different, the way people interact with each other was different; it's a completely different mentality and it's fun to watch how society behave in such a distant decade. However, no matter how many years have gone by, Dial M For Murder is still somewhat effective at creating a feeling of excitement and suspense, mainly due to the first half of the script which was extremely well written. The script does loose a bit of its strength towards the end of the film, because all there is left is to talk about solutions and escapism. The acting, which is also very distinct from today's, was tremendous. Ray Milland was a delight to watch, he played his character perfectly, nice and charming on the surface but truly, deceitful and malicious. Grace Kelly was radiant and every time she's in a scene, she lights up the screen. Having said that, by today's standards, I consider Dial M For Murder a nice little thriller but nothing more then that. After a while the film gets a bit claustrophobic ( the action takes place in one room only) and the third act tends to be a bit tedious. I just don't think, and I know most people would disagree with me but this is my personal opinion, that this film can compete with some contemporary thrillers. A good watch nevertheless.6.5/10",

The plot initially is slow moving as we learn of Margot's cheating and Tony's knowledge of her marital betrayal. After a cleverly masked performance in front of his betrayer he phones Captain Swann about a car for sale and from here the script edges up to reveal the true intentions of Mr Wendice.Ray Milland speaks quickly and acts cleverly to get his way around trouble and looks conspicuously guilty but portrays a deft smear of innocence, and a wonderful performance it is. Grace Kelly is the shining beauty with a troubled agenda on her shoulders as Margot whilst Robert Cummings supplies a rather bland persona as Margot's lover and these performances are irrelevant in the grand scheme of this crime.The real intentions of Wendice unravel in an unashamed mask of honesty as he reveals every rule, every fabrication of his scheme to murder his wife and leave guilt free with her money. The use of blackmail against Swann is at length grammatically sound as they explore the foundations and consequences and benefits of following through with their intentions. As with strangers on a train the resounding use of a delicate issue in murder is given a full working over and yet unlike that film, this isn't short and snappy but overly long and tiresome.For all of Hitchcock's credentials as master of suspense and his adept style at giving the plot tension and excitement this 1954 release is void of any real vintage film making. For one the film is constantly talking and working out its own problems and misgivings and whilst there is absolute no denying the intelligence and brilliance behind one sole event, it grows weary with time and the eventual rapping up comes down to a debatable conclusion.This would be the most perfect picture ever created if there was a bit more action and adrenaline to go with the feel of the script. For example the actual murder is brilliantly twisted and shot and after that the film denies any responsible action, and it all bubbles down to talking about solutions and escapism.This is a good picture with a brilliant cast and a wonderful depiction of murder and betrayal but just doesn't generate a feeling of excitement and suspense other reviews have credited it with.",

I was searching for something to keep me on my toes. A movie where I can't stop watching. \"Dial M for Murder\" produces none of these things.On the other hand, it was originally shot in 3D. The 3D effects of the movie are very subtle. It's more like watching a theater play than a movie. I liked this quite a lot. It makes the film quite pleasant. I don't like those movies where 3D is all about projecting things out of the screen just for scares. I would like more 3D movies using this kind of effect.In overall, I enjoyed watching it. And the 3D is a plus. That's why I gave it 5 stars. It isn't great, but if you want to chill watching an easy film, this could be it. The 3D is definitely a plus.",

I mean how many men lucky enough to be married to Grace Kelly would arrange to have her killed? You'd have to be insane, even if she is fooling around. The almost single location works better than expected. It never gets dull to watch.

That's a real shame.  A crackerjack whodunit(actually since we the audience already know 'who', it's more like a 'how'dtheyfindout'), Hitchcock is well served by a marvelous performance from his lead, Ray Milland. This is the rare picture that actually tells the story exclusively from the point of view of the 'villain'. One reviewer wrote that the Bob Cummings and Grace Kelly characters were too shallow and underdeveloped. But that was exactly the point. The less depth the 'good guys' have, the more sympathetic Milland looks. It's not so much that we want him to get away with it, as it is that we get to know the inner workings of his mind. It is fascinating just to watch his eyes while he thinks on the spot how to change to plan 'b' while the original plan goes awry. You can almost see the wheels spinning in his brain. As with any mystery film, it's not just that we want the culprit caught, but it's how it gets resolved that's important. And for once in a  Hitchcock movie, it's the officer who figures it out(Shadow of a Doubt is probably his only other movie where the police weren't represented as evil, or inept, or nonentities altogether). John Williams, as the inspector, proves to be the perfect foil for Milland, and seeing the two of them in action is the key to the film. Cummings and Kelly obviously have the thankless roles, purposely underwritten, in my opinion, to heighten the tension. It's tough and unfair to judge those types of roles. They do the best they can with what they have.",

The greatest challenge for any director is bringing a stage play to the screen because its like he has to work in such a small area. Hitchcock also did this in Rope. By the way, the scene where Grace Kelly is being stangled is the best scene Hitchcock directed. Grace is a good little struggler and it is a joy to watch.

Grace kelly was beautiful as always but her lover was very annoying because he was messingup a marriage and really gave poor Ray no choice but to off his wife.

There are several reasons for loving it: the acting is generally superb, the plot is very clever, and even though the directing is not as groundbreaking as in many other of Hitchcock movies I don't see how it could have been improved on.Ray Milland plays the betrayed husband planning to kill his wife. His character is so charming and intelligent, that even though he is obviously a psychopath and his wife is stunningly beautiful and lovable, one almost hopes he will get away with it. Grace Kelly plays his wife, and it is one of her best roles. Anthony Dawson is great as the petty criminal who is more or less blackmailed into carrying out the murder. John Williams plays the police inspector with a combination of humor and cunning that is really hard to make believable, but he does it marvelously. Anthony Dawson is also good as the wife's lover, although he pales somewhat in comparison with the others.I won't go into all the twists and turns of the plot other than saying that it is really quite elaborate, and one has to focus to grab all the details on the first viewing.Although 95% of the action takes place inside one apartment it never feels claustrophobic or boring, which can be a problem for filmed plays as this is. This movie was made the same year as \"Rear Window\" and though the general opinion is not on my side, I would say that this movies is clearly the superior one.",

            "content": "\"Voici l'anglais avec son sang froid habituel.\" This French saying -- roughly translated as, \"Here come the English with their usual cold-bloodedness\" -- has never been more fitting than in Alfred Hitchcock's \"Dial M for Murder.\"After he discovers that his wife Margot has been cheating on him with Mark Halliday, an American author of murder mysteries, Tony Wendice spends a year stalking his old schoolmate Charles Swann, then blackmails him into killing Margot. Tony has devised a complicated strategy for the perfect murder, but he plans it out down to the most minute details so much that when a few of those little details go wrong, the entire plan is botched, and Swann ends up dead instead of Margot. But Tony refuses to be discouraged and immediately hatches another scheme to have Margot convicted of Swann's murder and sentenced to death. It works, but as Margot's execution date approaches, her lover Mark Halliday begins putting his skills as an author of detective stories to work to save Margot and uncover the truth.While this movie may prove that there's no such thing as the perfect murder, it also proves that there is such thing as a perfect murder mystery, one that's gripping, scary, and smart, and all completely without any nudity or profanity. To me, the most interesting thing about \"Dial M for Murder\" was the impeccably polite behavior and iceberg calm that was maintained throughout. Sure, Tony is trying to kill his wife without getting caught, but that's no reason for anyone to get very upset, or even raise their voices. When Margot discovers of Tony's true intentions, for example, she simply says, \"I don't seem to be able to feel anything\" (!!). When one of the characters does get mad, it's more likely to be because no one offered to take his coat than because of the murders and attempted murders that are flying around. And after his plots are finally revealed by Mark Halliday and some clever policemen, Tony simply offers his wife -- the one he has just made two attempts to have killed! -- a glass of brandy. She accepts!",

The script may not loan itself to the 3-D process, but Hitch and cinematographer Robert Burks (who had previously photographed the 1953 WarnerVision feature HONDO) employ the illusion of depth with remarkable clarity, framing characters between foreground objects (lamps, tables, etc.) and the physical space of the screenplay's primary location (Milland and Kelly's apartment); aside from the opening and closing credits, there are only two examples of 'off-the-screen' effects, both crucial for dramatic purposes. Otherwise, Hitch makes few attempts to widen the play's narrow canvas, but plot and dialogue are so compelling, and played with such relish by a top-notch cast, the film's 'staginess' goes largely unnoticed. Milland and Kelly are terrific in their respective roles, and Robert Cummings is equally fine as the young man whose dalliance with Kelly sparks Milland's murderous plot, but they're all upstaged by John Williams, reprising his stage performance as the dogged police detective whose investigation reveals the fatal flaw in Milland's near-perfect crime. The 'murder' scene represents one of the great moments in American cinema, and Milland's climactic comeuppance is a show-stopper.NB. Though framed for 1.37:1 aspect ratio, the film was projected theatrically at 1.85:1 in some venues.

The script is well done and the acting is consistent- I think this is the movie where Grace Kelly does the most acting and doesn't just sit there looking pretty. She is given quite a bit to do, more than she would be in one of her usual parts. She deserved an Oscar for this one instead of the dreary The Country Girl. But back to this film. The camerawork is Oscar-worthy, and the direction as a whole is sublime. Well deserving of its 'classic' moniker.However, Ray Milliand is a very unconvincing liar, especially when you've seen the film more than once. The murder sequence is a whole is also somewhat unconvincing, especially the fact that Grace Kelly just happens to have a pair of footlong shears beside her head while someone who was hiding behind the curtain is trying to choke her to death with a scarf. (Was that a spoiler? If so, I'm sorry.) Everyone also seems to figure out everything pretty much seamlessly.So, when watching this film, willingly suspend your disbelief. I didn't the first time that I watched this film, but I did the second time.

The story mostly takes place in one room. Confined space, with a very good dialogue, offers a lot of tension and excitement.Mr. Hitchcock, at the very beginning of the film to the forefront threw a perfect motive. Adultery!

Every single scene, angle and line in this movie contributes to the ultimate plan, and it's every piece that makes Hitchcock's movies such a puzzle. Always sitting on the edge of your seats, constantly wondering what will happen next and having butterflies form in your stomach -- these are just some of the side effects you will have from watching this film. Playing detective is a role that is never easy, especially when you're against a criminal who leaves traces that lead to the wrong people.

It has great suspense, like every Hitchcock film will and should have. It have terrific performances by the new Hitchcock star Grace Kelly, a great performance by John Williams, but not the composer. It also of course has the very good Robert Cummings in it. Some of the parts of the film, however, make no sense.Here is the plot. Like most Hitchcock films, it is not that easy to follow at first. Okay, here it is. A husband named Tony wants to murder his wife named Margot. He knows she loves another man named Mark. He also wants her money. Tony hires a man named Swann to kill her. Tony sets up the perfectly, or so he thinks. The plan can not more wrong than it did. For one reason, Swann is killed by Margot. She does it in self defense. She is arrested anyway. She is planned to be killed. An officer and Mark find clues of the murder. They find out that Tony did plan to kill her. Margot is released and they set up a plan to trap Tony. They do and the film ends with everyone have some alcohol.Overall, this is yet another classic Hitchock films. Like I said before, it is a little complicated with all the different clues but if you really think or listen closely you will understand. Also, I think that ending seemed a bit too rushed in my opinion. I mean, the alcohol is poured and the officer goes on the phone. Then there is the The End sign and the credits roll. That is all, no more, no less. Also, there is a scene in which Margot is found guilty that is so bizarre you might want to fast-forward through it. Anyway, this is a truly fantastic Hitchcock film that anyone that is a fan of suspense or Hitchcock of course will like.9/10Recommended Films: Rear Window.",

            "content": "A little bit dragged out at times...everyone seemed to love the sound of their voices in this one, lots of talking, not much real action. Ray Milland gives the best performance of the film for me. Grace Kelly is fine, but bland and stiff. She isn't required to do a whole lot but change her expression from time to time and barely does that. To me, she is always aware that she is on screen and instinctively models for the camera. Of course she is beautiful, but she is so staid it is difficult to believe she ever had an affair passionate enough to cause all of this drama. And what the heck was in that darned letter at the center of the film? Still, you have to stay with it and watch all the way through to learn the great mystery of the latch keys. I have to admit, I hadn't figured it out. Some parts are a little unbelievable, such as seeing Grace's character coming back at the end, allegedly still facing execution the next day, and yet she is carrying her little purse, the center of so much controversy, as is a death row inmate would still have possession of her things, and she is shown standing alone on the sidewalk in front of her building, rather than in handcuffs, etc...since the audience does not yet know that the police have figured the whole thing out, it is a little beyond belief.Also, if she has so much money, why do they live in that cramped apartment? I've never seen such a small apartment in a film not set in the lower income brackets. I guess they wanted it small for atmosphere, but goodness, they were tripping over each other in there. I guess Grace spent her money on clothes...that nightgown alone was probably several hundred and just what one would really wear to bed, lol, tight bodice, zipper and all. I can picture Hitchcock salivating behind his lens as she struts about in that, and her infamous red dress, which signals danger ahead. Her wardrobe was pretty restrained overall, lacking any turbans or astonishing hats, the better to show that shining blond hair, which in the early scenes is as stiff as a helmet, but a little softer later on.With all of my griping, an entertaining way to spend your time, especially for the performance of Milland and the wily old chief inspector.",

The film is one of Hitchcock's better-executed novelty experiments; cinematography, art direction, and screenplay are built up together to take advantage of the gadget. It must be seen in 3D, otherwise cinematography, which is precisely calculated to emphasize the depth with objects such as lamps, would look terrible, for example. Most actions take place in one room so that the audience could feel as if they were watching a play. The theme, tugs-of-war between the husband and the others, e.g. the hit-man, the wife, her lover, and the inspector, is a bit unrealistic but suitable for the setting.",

Margot doesn't really have a problem with the marriage; she's got a boyfriend (Robert Cummings) who's going to take her away to a better life.  Tony, on the other hand, has a problem with Margot's plan. Not only will he loose his wife but she's the one with the money and Tony has grown accustom to his life as a kept man. Mark Halliday (the boyfriend) comes to London for a visit.  Tony sees an opportunity to solve his marital and fiscal problems with a simple phone call.  Actually it's rather complex. How else would Hitchcock weave a plot around the mystery of what might happen when things don't go as planned.The mystery, tension, and resolution are all very well executed by Hitchcock.  One of the really interesting aspects is the cunning of Inspector Hubbard (John Williams).  He figures out who killed whom and who is plotting to deceive whom.  This must be one of the rare movies where Hitchcock doesn't portray the cops as fools.  Another interesting aspect of the movie is the way Hitchcock can twist our feelings.  We know Tony's bad, but his plan is so cleaver it's easy to wish him success at murdering his wife.  We know Margot is a lying, cheating, and `back stabbing' adulteress but when we see her being tried for murder, it's easy to wish for an acquittal.   If you're thinking of seeing the 1998 remake starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow (`A Perfect Murder'), go rent `Dial M for Murder' instead.",

            "content": "A terrific film by a terrific director. Setup mostly in a single apartment with lot many details of apartment and characters explored in very little time, this is a very good detailed film about murder. There is a lot of conversation, for the most part of it. Most of it is planning the murder, and the rest of conversation is about covering up by culprit, then the culprit being brought to justice. The best part is in the first 10-15 minutes itself we know of what would come. Who has planned whose murder that is setup very clearly. Now the rest of it is for the police to bring the murderer or the planned murderer to justice. To categorize this as a mere thriller might not be apt for this. This has a lot of drama, it's cold blooded drama and a meticulously planned murder. It's not mystery either coz there are many things that are clear. We know who plans it, what is his motive and how he wants it. What happens perhaps is different but, the person who has planned needs to be brought to justice. The only driving point from then is how is he brought to justice. Ray Milland does a terrific job, less of emotion and so much of cold-bloodiness in him. Damn, that is very tough to pull off and he does it with considerable ease. The master throws up a masterful film in this. Also, there is a significance in the title \"Dial M\" though shown very briefly, it has it's place. Without much to say about this film any further, I am going with 4/5 for a film by my favorite director. Hitchcock rocks again in this film.",

            "content": "You have to put aside your preconceptions of Hitchcock as creating \"pure cinema gold\" in terms of this film; it exhibits some of the worst contrivances of classic screen writing, with some decent dialogue and approximately three (3) scenes of nerve-wracking tension. That aren't actually all that tense. Boilerplate thriller/whodunnit plot features a retired tennis pro planning to kill his glamorous, beautiful Hollywood star wife for cash, who's played by Grace Kelly. In the movie, she's just beautiful and glamorous, but is more of a socialite, and her husband is played by ever-so-well-spoken Ray Milland, a Cambridge grad who loves details, logic, and lying all the time. Just the right type of guy to plot a purely filmic murder trope.He plans to frame the murder on an old college pal, that he manipulates and blackmails after digging up some dirt (that's hardly life threatening), in exchange for a thousand pounds Sterling. Which, by the way, is nearly $32,000 in today's US currency.The film then turns into a series of unfortunate sexist tropes. After Grace Kelly's attempted murder fails, she spends the rest of the film alternately sobbing, collapsing, near-retching or near-fainting, whilst capable, repressed, emotionally dead men wearing impeccably ironed suits and hair oil discuss the facts, counterfactuals, allegations, timing and probability of her attempted murder with about as much emotion and involvement as a bunch of guys trying to isolate what part of a car engine is faulty.It's not an involving film, and Ray Milland's initial murder plot is so contrived and hair-brained it's inevitable something, somewhere will go wrong. I guess, in a kind of clever/failed way you could suggest that out of the psychopathology of planning to commit murder he planned to fail, as the possibility of killing his estranged, adulterous wife is too painful to actually commit to, but he plans it anyway out of selfishness and a kind of appalling, smarmy pride which oozes from every line of his screen time like the thick fifties hair oil that so sharply reflects the studio lighting in most scenes throughout.Pseudo-sophistication was the lingua franca of these cheeseball 50's era crime pics, and this movie is right up there with the Hepburn/Cary Grant vehicle \"Charade\" in terms of suits, polished little European sports cars, glamorous socialite blondes, and scheming, evil men in suits. Oh yeah, there's a suitcase full of money also. The worst thing about the film, despite it's wonderfully phrased dialogue is that there's just too much of it, and elderly John Williams appears as suave-but-forceful Chief Inspector Hubbard, literally a patriarch that treats everyone with polite contempt, utters homophobic asides that would make most people cringe today, and of course nearly sentences a woman to death for a crime she didn't commit but never apologizes. Thanks to his intervention and \"good skills\" as a cop we find out that the scheming upper class morality vandals have been dipped in the cow turd by act three.",

Milland knows all about them and plans to use the opportunity to have her murdered. Ray Milland is very good in his role. The devilish grin he uses during the scene of plotting the murder is eerily similar to the one Jack Nicholson has made famous.Grace Kelly looks absolutely gorgeous on screen. She was also in Hitchcock's \"To Catch a Thief\" with Cary Grant and of course the great (and one of Hitchcock's best) \"Rear Window\" with Jimmy Stewart. Supposedly she had an affair with Milland which ads to the strangeness since he's playing a man who wants to kill her. Robert Cummings is rather weak in his role. This is not one of Hitchcock's great films by any means but, but with any Hitchcock film, even his lesser offerings are still highly watchable and better than 99% of most films made.",

Robert Cummings is another milk-white nonentity in this movie who fits well as Kelly's lover - the best thing about it is Ray Milland, a somewhat underrated actor.

You can see how the coolest film effects of today owe tribute to the master of suspense in their setup and composition . . . but I didn't really like Dial M for Murder.Granted it does have its share of Hitchcock trademarks we've all come to look for and appreciate, and it has Hitchcock's instinct for making shots interesting . . . I didn't like how this movie is 75% dialogue describing the 25% of action that is in the film.  The premise is clever and intriguing and the laid back pacing is always welcoming, but the movie explains itself to death.  I hate doing plot synopsis in a review but I'm compelled to here: basically, in the beginning of the film we hear a full blown explanation of Wendice's plan to kill his wife.  Then we see the plan in action and something goes wrong (of course).  Then later on another character comes up with a `wild' idea of what happened (which is surprisingly accurate), then that idea gets told to the cop to humor him . . . yeah, you get the idea. \nIt is amusing in its own way watching character's reactions to each retelling, especially those who do know what was planned and what really happened and that in turn gives each recitation its own distinct flavor and atmosphere so it's never entirely monotonous . . . but you're still ultimately hearing the same basic thing over and over again.  It's still surprisingly fun, but without the likes of Hitchcock behind it I don't think I'd of had enough interest to finish.  Definitely not one of my favorite Hitchcock films.

If you love mystery movies, this is one you will have to take the time to see.The saying that all things work together for good kind of came into play in this movie, the acting was in top shape, the script and dialogue were intriguing. This will not go down as the best of Hitchcock but it still stands out, the cinematography isn't classic since majority of the movie was done in a confined apartment, the screenplay was not as grand as there is little room pull out all the stops but the plot is as grand as they come. The plot takes you on a journey where you get to see things in the view of the three leads; each one is giving a scene time to win you over to their side.Done in 1954, this movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on a stage play done in 1952. The screenplay and the stage play on which it was based were both written by English playwright Frederick Knott, and the movie did well in the box office and was well received by critics.The stories plot is all about Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) obsession to take revenge on his wife for cheating on him.He decided to kill her and the best way to do it was to allow a stranger take the fall, so he plotted and thought through how to commit the perfect murder, one thing he forgot to think about is his wife Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) will to live, as the man he sent to murder her, was murdered.But that didn't stop Tony as he still found a way, how? You have to watch Dial M for Murder to find out.A remake of the movie was done in 1998 and it was titled A Perfect Murder directed by Andrew Davis, the remake had Michael Douglas play the husband and Gwyneth Paltrow was the wife. In the 1998 remake the characters of Halliday and Swann are combined which was played by Viggo Mortensen.Alfred Hitchcock is the king of mysteries and this movie does plagues of it from the get go to the last scene where Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) served everyone a drink. Dial M for Murder is in position 48 in the AFI's 100 years\u0085100 thrills. Dial M for Murder was released in the same year as Rear Window.So take the time to watch this classic.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "To say this movie is as fantastic as it is and then it not be considered one of Hitchcock's very best, well it only goes to prove how amazing a director he was. Dial M for Murder is a very dialogue heavy movie, but don't let that fool you into thinking it may be boring or well, too laden with conversations. The film is truly thrilling and working out what will happen next is no easy game, Hitchcock gets the absolute most out of the play it is adapted from and the most from the cast too, with the likes of Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings all shining in their respective roles. It of course centres on a plan for a husband to off his wife called Margot (Kelly) by her husband Tony (Milland), of course Tony thinks he has the perfect murder, and even if he hasn't, he has a few tricks he can pull.The story moves along at a nice pace, never too fast or too slow and constantly fits itself nicely into its running time. Hitchcock just knew here how to truly get the scenes he wanted and uses things like light to truly create a sense of doom or a sense of hope, fine work from the director considered one of the best at suspense. I wasn't all together sure on the score for the film which can at times sound like some kind of cartoon or in any case a much happier film and although it can be used well, it just doesn't feel right sometimes. To be fair other than the score there isn't too much wrong with this at all, acting maybe not always on point but I'll come to that next.I wasn't always so sure on Grace Kelly, many a person who has seen this has mentioned her as doing a good job but I didn't feel she was at her very best. The by far best cast member has to be Ray Milland who kind of has to step up in this movie so we see him as the evil he is, but that also we can follow him through the story without getting bored. John Williams as Inspector Hubbard is a good addition to the cast and can actually at times add a little comedic relief randomly here and there, he over time becomes a character you come to not mind as much as maybe when he first walks in. One thing about this movie that I can't say I have seen much is the way in which it lets you follow the protagonist but he is not good and although inside you do not want him to succeed, you expect that everything that happens will all go to plan (whether it does or not well you will have to see). Yet again Hitchcock brings us this nice little gem of a thing, he really gets the camera put on Milland but in a way where although he is in the shot, he remains behind peoples backs and he moves away from others a lot, it feels like it is meant for him to seem distant and of course more sinister than other characters.Overall Dial M for Murder is as I said not really thought of as within Hitchcock's absolute best works but this is really an excellent little piece, worth a watch whether a fan of Hitchcock or you have never seen one of his films before. He does of course borrow elements from past films and that makes this not any copy of his previous works, but it actually also makes it much better as he can draw from his own inspiration but then make a film like this that feels like a play (of which as mentioned it is based on).",

The screenplay is well put together and complements Hitchcock's style. Ray Milland is great and very charismatic as the duplicitous Tony Wendice.The character of Tony Wendice is somewhat similar to the character of Brandon in 'Rope'. Both characters show a bit of glee and wonder in the way they plan their respective crimes. They both represent Hitchcock's own mischievous ways of messing with the audience.But the problem with 'Dial M for Murder' is the fact that the film has nothing much to say. It operates on the surface with Hitchcock's masterful camera work and his uncanny ability to create tension and atmospheric thrill. But beneath that suspenseful surface, it is pretty hollow. Even an experiment like 'Rope' at its core was a commentary on the condescension of some members of the rich, upper class of the urban society. I couldn't find any thematic meat in 'Dial M for Murder' which prevented the film from having a genuinely lasting impression on me. It's still an example of Hitchcock's directorial mastery and hence deserves to be recommended, but it's not one my personal favourite Hitchcock films.",

Get your popcorn and go to the bathroom before pressing play because you won't want to pause as soon as the movie starts.Ray Millard plays Tony so well, a marvel to watch. Never before have I seen so much confidence on the face of a sly man, walking the line of truth and lies you almost find yourself siding with him. Grace Kelly, as per usual, gives us a stunning performance adding so many layers to the plot. The similarity you could draw with all the characters, those played by John and Robert too, was that you could never quite tell what they knew. This is a movie of secrets and the actors support that superbly well.With dialogue that's punchy and not overly wordy, Dial M for Murder sets itself apart from other Mystery movies. This movie throws the whodunit idea out the window, and does better because of it!Finally, cinematography; taking place for the most part in one house the cinematographer found ways to light and frame scenes to make the same room feel cozy one moment, then confining and uneasy the next. Hitchcock's classic high angle shots, mixed with low and some slightly dutch were used wonderfully well in playing with your emotions and telling the story.\"I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge.\"",

He threatens Tony by going to the police, but Tony would deny everything, plus with Swans past no one would believe him. Then the offer of money comes into play with a 100Lbs up front. The rest Tony promises would be delivered to a safe box for him to pick up afterwards. Swan decides to do it, and asks when, Tony replies tomorrow. Tony believes he will pull off the perfect murder. He tells Swan to come over to the flat while He and Mark are away at a stag party. He will be able to get in with his wife's latchkey that will be under the staircase. While at the party, Tony will call him at 12 a.m.. This will wake Margo to answer the phone. Swan is to hide behind the curtains, and once she answers the phone he is suppose to strangle her.The next night Tony and Mark are getting ready to leave for the party. Margo wants to go to a movie while they are out; but Tony throws a fit. It alarms him so much he threatens to cancel everything. Mark doesn't like his attitude toward his wife, and starts to suspect something. That night Swan shows up and gets in. He waits around awhile and notices it's after 12 a.m.. At the party Tony realizes his watch has stopped. He knows he has to make a quick phone call to the flat before Swan leaves. He tells everyone he has to call his boss and leaves. Swan gets ready to leave then the phone rings. Quickly Swan hides behind the curtain and waits for Margo to answer the phone. Once she answers Swan wraps the scarf around her neck. Margo luckily gets the upper hand and stabs him in the back with scissors. Tony who is still on the line realizes his plan has failed. He tells Margo not to do anything, he is coming home. When he meets Mark he tells him that he needs to leave because Margo isn't feeling well. Mark wants to come; but Tony says it's nothing serious.\nWhen Tony returns home he acts concerned about his wife's welfare. He tells his wife to stay in the bedroom while he calls the police. Meantime while waiting for the police he plants evidence on Swan, The letter; and burns the scarf.When the police arrive the Wendice's are questioned by Chief Inspector Hubbard( John Williams). Hubbard is suspicious anyway, but continues his questioning. Mark later arrives and is questioned, he has nothing to hide. While the three are there Hubbard has to get Tony out of the house so he tells him to check out the crowd outside. Hubbard asks Mark and Margo how much does Tony know about their affair. When Margo is taken to the police station she is found guilty for the murder of Charles Swan. The reason nobody believed her story and she is to be quickly executed. While she is in jail, Mark does some investigating with the help of Inspector Hubbard.Mark later comes to Tony and tells him to confess to the murder for hire of his wife. Tony refuses and Inspector Hubbard knows there is more to the story as each day passes. Hubbard knew that Tony wasn't telling the truth when Mark found the blue case with money. Mark and Hubbard have to prove Tony is guilty. The way they start the plan is with the latch key. A plot between Mark and Hubbard is made to see if they can catch Tony in the end.This was a great film, even though it is mostly in one setting. This marriage was doomed from the start. I kept thinking that Tony was old enough to be her father, so it had to be a marriage of convenience. The moral of the story is there is no such thing as the perfect murder, a better solution is D-I-V-O-R-C-E.",

Though, I don't think anyone would expect less of Mr. Hitchcock.The story is about a man who finds the perfect murder for his wife but finds out that it isn't so perfect at all. It makes for a lot of great plot twists and edge of your seat scenes. Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings make this a star filled movie with absolutely wonderful acting. The editing is also brilliant as usual and I would say that this in one of Hitch's best. However, I say that about most of his movies so what do I know?

There are so many possibilities and very often a twist is thrown at us. It is great to watch Ray Milland react to and deal with each new arrival. He gives a grade A performance. And just when we think there couldn't be any more twists, the final one comes.I have to say: I always find moments of genius in Hitchcock's films. In this film the shot that was genius to me is as follows. When Margot and Mark are talking in the apartment and they hear Tony at the door, it switches to a shot of the door with their shadows on it, and the shadows quickly separate. I think that shot is a pure Hitchcock moment.This is a very thrilling movie to watch. I never knew what was going to come at me next.",

The Master of Suspense works his magic on Dial M For Murder, but only sporadically. A clever plot allows Hitchcock room to breathe, while viewers become claustrophobic. Dial M's storyline makes that happen. It's complex enough to follow, so one might face a hard time playing catchup. (especially when distracted at certain pivotal scenes).The sequence leading to the attempt murder of Margot (Grace Kelly) is typical of Hitchcock. The tension slowly rises to an unbelievable high, and is the only entertaining highlight of the film. Even though the plot is clever, it sometimes get boringly executed. Hitchcock tends to indulge in overlong dialogue sequences in Dial M, a justifiable flaw that slows down (but builds up) the film tremendously. This is not Hitchcock's best, but it still gives an occasional chill whenever I recollect that above-mentioned sequence.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

            "content": "This is #12 in a Hitchcock marathon that I'm presently on. I just can't wrap my head around how inconsistent the quality of Hitch's films are. I've found the early ones in the 1930's particularly weak. But during a time when he made some pretty good films, \"Dial M For Murder\" is not very good. All the Hitch \"stinkers\" have the same thing in common for me. The story lines are from Outer Space. Admittedly, I'm a film fan that feels that a coherent & believable storyline in a film is MOST Important, but that's just me. I view a film myself to see & hear a \"good yarn\" & everything else is just icing on the cake.There are Just S-O-O-o Many UNREAL aspects to the storyline in \"Dial M For Murder\", that I don't know where to begin. That the husband would spend SO Much time following his former classmate to get enough \"dirt\" on him suggests that THIS was his full time occupation at least for months, if not years. That the husband was tailing the henchman-to-be so closely & for so long, but yet the henchman was Clueless about it is very improbable. The business about the key is Just STUPID since it has ALWAYS been a simple matter to get a duplicate key made. That the BF/mystery writer put it all precisely together in the end by sheer speculation is just unbelievable. That they would let a condemned prisoner \"temporarily\" free to go on some unlikely adventure the day before she was to be hanged ..... Well, you get the idea.Even though the storyline was unreal, Hitch did make this a very suspenseful film through great cinematography & editing. His usual technique of weird camera positions PLUS a rapid shifting of the camera focus between different details of the story was quite effective. The acting was very good by the whole cast. Overall, it was an interesting experience in my Hitch Odyssey. It's an OK film, but just OK.At this point in my Hitch marathon, I must conclude that all the \"fan hype\" about Hitch is just that, \"fan hype\". Hitch was very good, but he certainly doesn't deserve a seat on the Mount Olympus of Cinema. Sadly, at this point, I feel that although he was a great director, he lacked total control over his films, most notably the selection of screenplays. If he had more control over the selection of screenplays, he might today be worthy of the seemingly universal accolades he still gets. As far as his \"cult following\" among film fans, I can only quote PT Barnum's words --- \"There's a sucker born every minute.\"",

I enjoyed it quite a bit, particularly the ending, but I do have one gripe with it. The film is shot like a play so there is a distinct lack of visual style, which is disappointing. I have heard that this movie is also sometimes shown in 3-D, maybe that somehow hindered the look of the film, or maybe it's the fact that I saw it in 2-D that made it seem like there was something missing. I don't know for sure, but that's my theory. Otherwise, the movie plays out just fine and it's a lot of fun to watch, particularly towards that conclusion where all of the clues and everything start falling into place.

            "content": "So far in my life at least, my second favourite of this director's work, only losing out to 'Psycho'. Frederick Knott's play has been faithfully and superbly reproduced for the screen, losing none of its glamour, nor becoming boring in the adaptation process. Every minute of it is so satisfying to consume and it is one of his very best.Ray Milland stars as Tony Wendice, a former tennis player plotting the (very elaborate!) murder of his wife, played by Grace Kelly. Rather like 1948's \"Rope\" (another great Hitch production), the action is almost exclusively set in this one flat in Mayfair, but it still remains surprisingly engaging. That's Hitchcock for you. Not many directors could have pulled that off.It took me a while to grow accustomed to Ray Milland's performance. I initially thought he was quite flat, but having reconsidered I now very much enjoy him as the cool, calculating villain. Grace Kelly is of course also fab, as is the wannabe-Poirot detective at the end.Admittedly, part of this film's success is definitely the source material, not just Hitchcock's contribution. The play is just so effective and gripping that pretty much any rendition of it is going to be a decent piece of entertainment. Hitchcock has nonetheless succeeded in adapting it, reproducing it with accuracy and care, whilst simultaneously cementing it into the cinema canon as well as the theatre one. What more could you ask for?",

            "content": "You might scoff at my notion that this film is underrated since it was listed on AFI's greatest mystery films of all time list, so clearly it gets some respect. Where I would consider the movie to be underrated is that it just never seems to come up in discussions of people's favorite Hitch films and, personally, I would consider it to be one of his best.I brief aside for the complete Hitch noob. There was a time a decade ago when I really only knew him for his two horror films (PSYCHO and THE BIRDS) before I really started delving into his catalog of genius movies. One thing that might strike you is that there is often a familiar feel to Hitch movies, like you've seen this before. That is generally because his movies have been ripped off and \"homaged\" so much that you probably have seen the plot redone in different ways on TV shows and other movies, that shouldn't detract from how good the original product is, though.This movie is taken from a play and feels very stagey throughout. Aside from a few shots, the movie takes place almost entirely in one apartment and, mostly, in one room. Few directors could have pulled this off successfully, but Hitchcock is not your average director, is he? It never feels claustrophobic or repetitive. He creates so much creative divergence in his shots that you almost don't notice that you've never left the room during the movie until you reflect back afterwards. Speaking of those shots, there are a lot of very interesting angles here, most of which were employed to make use of the 3D technology, but it forces Hitch to shoot things you don't typically see in movies, with a whole lot of low angles.Naturally, placing your movie in one room puts a lot of weight on the plot and acting and both come through admirably. The plot is typically twisty as is any of Hitch's work. The idea of a man planning the \"perfect murder\" and the way that plan slowly unravels on him is done so well. There is a lot of complication of detail in both the setup of the murder and in the final \"ah-hah\" moment from the police detective as the truth comes out. All of this could have been very confusing, but is executing very well so as the viewer is never left feeling like a detail is missing.The acting is superb. Ray Milland, as the husband plotting to murder his cheating wife, is excellent. Sort of a poor man's Cary Grant, he is so suave and assured in this movie. Even in the final moments as things are crashing in on him, he never loses his cool. He plays the part so well that we are confused in our feelings towards him. We should be rooting against him for trying to murder the beautiful Grace Kelly, but he's such a likable character that you find yourself hoping he gets away with this, in the end. The police chief is another great character who reminds me a lot of Columbo in that way of playing the role of a bumbler who's clearly much more clever than he's letting on. Grace Kelly isn't given too much to do here, but is certainly nice to look at and plays her limited role well. She's another complicated character as, again, we should detest her for cheating on her husband, but we never want to see real harm come to her.When you've seen the requisite Hitch movies that everyone is supposed to see like VERTIGO and N BY NW and you're looking for another excellent movie, look no further than this murder mystery.",

Has a very unique storyline, terrific acting, and filming. Dial M, though mainly taking place in just one living room, has a good story to tell.

A conspiracy, things not going as planned, and a murder - all possible twists but for the climax. Except for last 15 minutes everything looks good but the movie disappoints us in the climax.Too many legal flaws as to how an ordinary detective gets to remove an accused sentenced to death out of her prison a day before her death penalty, as to how is he allowed to search the house/premises of the house without a warrant and/or without the knowledge of the owner. In the end the movie fails to have any kind of impact on the viewer.Don't try to rate this movie close to 'Psycho' or 'Rear Window'. If you are a fan of thriller/crime/mystery genre then this one is worth giving a miss !",

At the start it had some time to build up whole plot but then it was incredibly intense and suspension rise very high. Then as it was said earlier it is possible that something goes wrong and it did deliver and extraordinary plot development. Then came brilliance of screenplay and it was great how Tony managed that turnout and provided new story and great new way of events that will be very twisty. As inspector Hubbart and Mark, he is lover of Margot, try to solve everything they are picking clues and gave a great detective part of the movie which will lead to final moments that are really tense. Finally as inspector and Mark solved the riddle they only need to prove Tony's guilt and there are good scenes with revelation of everything. Some of the scenes between Tony and Margot were questionable in actions that they take and had a little sense. Hitchcock did a great job in showing us this story and great filming by WB. Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, John Williams and Robert Cummings gave a very good performances in portraying their characters. It was a thrilling ride but it was not convincing and lost some touches in some areas. 3.5/4",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 202Dial M for Murder, a Hitchcock thriller, is about three people: Tony, an ex tennis player who suspects his wife of cheating and plans to kill her. Margot, the wife in question, and Mark, who Margot is with on the side. While none of these people are good, they're far more likable than the two characters in The Postman Always Rings Twice, the film I watched yesterday. These characters are morally grey. A big part of that is the directing. We see what kind of people they are, not just their actions. No one does a better job of that than Ray Milland, who plays the smart and calculating Tony. Depending on who you are, you may want or not want him to get away with the crime.An interesting point to note is how cheery the music is in the first half hour. It caught me off guard in a murder mystery like this. It helped me sympathize with the main characters, because no ominous music played to influence my thoughts.The plot moves quickly, and there's a lot of plot. Tony's scheme is very complicated and detailed, and little time is taken to explain it. It's not a complaint, but you have to pay close attention.It's very apparent this was a play: much of the film takes place in one room, and there's even an intermission.In conclusion, Dial M is an interesting murder mystery for the time you see it. There's not too much special about it, but you'll want to see how Tony's grand plot turns out. 8.1/10",

            "content": "Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder is an adaptation of the successful Broadway play of the same name by Frederick Knott. The movie was shot in 3-D, since in 1953 the movies Bwana Devil and House of Wax started a 3-D craze. But that lasted just after the release of Dial M, and therefore this movie was mostly played in 2-D. Because it's mainly set in an apartment's living room, the movie was shot in only 36 days.Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an ex professional tennis player who retired because his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) complained about his busy schedule and started an affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Out of jealousy, Tony decides to meet with an old acquaintance to blackmail him into murdering his wife by following a plan Tony alone devised.Being an adaptation of a play, the movie is primarily based on smart dialogue that carries the plot and manages to keep us interested while the characters try to solve the mystery, even though we know from the beginning what has happened. This is one of the things I liked the most about the movie. Then, there is the great acting: Ray Milland is constantly indifferent, cold, extremely rational and doesn't let emotions interfere with his horrid plan. Grace Kelly is a typical damsel in distress but doesn't know who her saviour is supposed to be, and Robert Cummings would do anything for her. All of them, along with the supporting cast, are very convincing in their roles. That's probably why it's easy to empathise with everyone, no matter their actions.Since, like I said, Dial M was mostly shot in a living room, many people have talked about the movie as \"claustrophobic\". I would rather say the lack of open spaces gives this movie a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness \u2013 nobody can escape their fate and we're all responsible for our actions. This also proves how much Dial M relies on good acting. Another thing I loved about this movie (and old movies in general) is the thoughtful use of soundtrack. Nowadays, the majority of mainstream movies try to evoke feelings in the audience by being too loud all the time, and that's when a soundtrack loses its purpose. In conclusion, Dial M might not appeal to all Hitchcock fans because of the lack of action and long dialogues, but it's an excellent movie nobody should miss.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

            "review_title": "Hitchcock in his Hollywood days",
            "content": "Dial M for Murder, was made when Sir Alfred Hitchcock defected to Hollywood to make films. It is here at Hollywood that his films receive wider commercial success. This culminated in this iconic director becoming less independent, but one who was obliged to adhere to the film companies' restraints. These restraints were in the view of the likes of Warner Bros' put in place to ensure their films were a profitable, and commercial success. It was this which it can be argued contributed in films directed by Sir Alfred, such as Dial M for Murder receiving negative criticism from the critics.All the same Dial M for Murder is quintessentially Hitcockian. Then, what makes a film quintessentially Hitcockian? For one, Sir Alfred Hitchcock is one of the few directors who really knows how to extract what he needs from his actors. It is because of this, that it doesn't matter whether the actor is good at acting. An example is given here in Dial M for Murder in the form of Grace Kelly. What is important to Sir Alfred here is that she has charisma which can be extracted and exploited by him, thereby making Kelly's acting ability irrelevant to what is required.If Kelly's role in Dial M for Murder was to be cast today, I think either Sharon Stone or Kim Basinger would do it justice, due to their similar charisma.Meanwhile, another aspect of Hitcock films which makes them Sir Alfred's own brand is his ability to keep the viewer intrigued without too much alteration to the set. This is exemplified in Dial M For Murder, as in Rear Window, where most of filming is shot in a stage like set, one room location.It is these elements, which make a film undoubtedly Sir Alfred Hitcock's own, that leaves one to wonder why the man perceived it to be important to have himself discreetly placed in all of the films he directed. Was he not confident in himself, or was he over confident, and therefore purely vain? Perhaps it was just for the purpose of being witty or for that matter cocky which compelled him to be noticed in his films. On the hand it might have merely been a ploy to encourage the audience, or viewer to pay more attention to the films.As to the plot of the film Dial M for Murder itself, I think it is a tad flawed. What seams obvious does not seam so to Kelly's character, Margot. That she is the proprietor of wealth, that her husband envies. This is not least because it undermines his traditional role as the patriarch of the household. Surely she could see that he'd only married her for her money. Of course this would make Margot feel unloved and used. Why else would she have an affair? I doubt that the reason is purely because she could, given that she owned all the economic power. This is because women, especially of that era were conditioned to be emotionally susceptible to the concepts of love and romance. But surely as the only beneficiary of her money, combined with the fact that she felt unloved by an obviously cold husband, was enough for Margot to see who was behind the plot of her murder! Finally, just because the Master of Suspense, Sir Alfred Hitcock, here manages to maintain the audience attention, without changing the set, this film deserves to be noted as worthy by the critics.",

            "content": "Dial M for Murder is one of those deliciously suspenseful films (Hitchcock's forte), where the script is mind-bogglingly good and the results are absolutely thrilling. The plot is deceptively simple; Tony is a retired Tennis Pro, being more-or-less supported by his wife Margot, played by a luminous Grace Kelly in an early film role. Tony's career meant that he was away for extended periods of time, playing in various tournaments, and during one of his absences Margot fell head-over-heals in love with an American writer visiting London. That was a year ago, and since then Tony has cold-bloodedly plotted to kill his wife, all the while playing the part of the devoted husband. But after a chance encounter he decides to blackmail an old acquaintance, a vaguely seedy con-man and womanizer, into committing the crime for him by following Tony's plan to the letter, a plan he claims is the \"Perfect Murder.\"A combination of superb direction from Hitchcock, one of the most magnificent scripts, bang on acting and the technique of suspense all play an active role in making this movie one of the most famous of Hitchock's and of this era.\"Dial M for Murder\" would probably be seen by a lot of modern audiences as too slow, too talky with not enough action. However... I think it's a superb thriller unique in the respect that for once the written word rather than the action creates the suspense. Grace Kelly's attempted murder scene still however packs a real. \"Dial M for Murder\", has so much to recommend it to lovers of suspense from a veteran director in top form. Thrillers and investigation stories don't come much better than they do here and every lover of Alfred Hitchcock and his directing genius should have this superb film in their collections. Enjoy.",

I wasn't completely against Tony's actions, as his wife was committing adultery behind his back. But, his actions are extreme and of course Hitchcock knows this and sets it up so that Tony will benefit by gaining all of his wife's money (which is a lot) upon her death. I really liked how Hitchock makes MArk, the man who Margot Wendice is cheating with, a writer of murder novels and at one point practically describes the whole incident, as it happened for real, to Tony, but actually has no idea that Tony is behind it all. This is a wonderfully constructed triller and just an amazing piece by Hitchcock.",

As one said, the lead in the remake appears gawky compared to Grace Kelly. That's a good way to compare today's films in general. There's been a comprehensive detailing of the production aspects of the film. I appreciated the \"McGuffin\" as Mr. Hitchcock calls it. Just wanted to add an observation about another aspect.Society people of that, and much earlier times as well, had no problem with the husband or wife going out with a friend, dancing with them a lot at parties, etc. It was fashionable to be rather cool with/about one's spouse and uncool to demonstrate a lot of public affection toward. Yet, everyone was shocked when affairs took place. The insincere formalities would extend to the two men going out together just on a friend of one basis. Social encounters covered a lot of ground. It helps understand that this is a society couple. They observe the formalities of the morning kiss, using endearments and all that. One may or may not be dear to one another. You generally can't tell on the surface, since it is the common practice. However, in this case, the wife is having an affair and the man has found out and is busily planning to ensure the continuance of his meal ticket, albeit in another form. Both continue the shell. That's a bit thick for any era. It is true that the straying couple are each sympathetic figures in this. That certainly speaks of the skill of the expert director. However, it seems that it goes a bit far with Margo's wounded response to her husband's attempting to rearrange the setup his way. Let's step back here a moment, madam: You are cheating on your husband, are you not? And, you are even considering leaving him, is that correct? So, what is all this, \"Oh Tony, how could you\" stuff. No question, murder is shocking and inexcusable on any account. But adultery is a serious betrayal. Margo, how could YOU! Her hypocrisy is there all along, but noticeable particularly after the attack when she runs to him for comfort, with full expectation and entitlement to it. He's her husband after all. But, she's an adulteress after all. Is she an elitist amoral? No, it's more that she's a spoiled society girl, brought up to expect accommodation to come toward her without accountability going out from her. And, she's a product of her social system. You played the game no matter what. In any event, this film is a very special one and must-have for the DVD library of Hitchcock fans particularly.",

[\u0085] No, I'm afraid my murders would be something like my bridge: I'd make some stupid mistake and never realize it until I found everybody was looking at me.The scene in which the above dialogue takes place seems to be key to Dial M for Murder, as it stakes out both the theme and the inevitable outcome of the film. The idea of the perfect crime, the failure of it and the idea that crime never pays run throughout many of Alfred Hitchcock's films. It's also the one theme of his that I'm the least interested in as knowing where the film is going takes away some of the excitement. For instance, when the supposedly perfect murder of Grace Kelly goes wrong, but she is still arrested and sentenced to death, it is a brilliantly cruel and sadistic twist, but the stakes would be even higher if you thought there was any chance she wouldn't make it.Complaints about predictability notwithstanding, Hitchcock still shines in his execution. There's a real elegance and assurance about the way the characters act and interact and the way the plot, with some ingenious details revolving for instance around the keys to the apartment, unfolds. Hitchcock can still squeeze a lot of tension into certain scenes. When Anthony Dawson is standing behind the curtain during the attempted murder waiting for that call, Hitchcock makes the audience sweat too.",

Because of all these matters he makes a plan upon murdering Margot by a man. This man is previously convicted and followed by Tony.Tony explains the plan to the man who should come into the house about at 11:00 PM and he is wanted to wait Mark's telephone from party to Margot. \"Dial M\" is the sign of this murder trial in which M letter appears in the phone while Tony calls her. As an important part of plan, Mark say the place of the key which is placed under the carpet of the stairs against flat door. But the plan doesn't work and Margot kills his future murderer with a scissors stroke. The key that isn't found in the pocket of the man make the inspectors get confused because how he open the door is a big mystery due to absence of any stroke of windows or door. At that point two possibilities appear. Tony hires an assassin or Margot lays a trap for the man whom she believes the blackmails is made by him. One of the letters that Mark wrote to her was previously captured by Tony but nor Margot neither Mark knows this one was captured by Tony. Tony uses this from one year before to the appearance of the reality.Hitchcock manages the film very well as usual but there are some important messages that it gave. For example; the conversation between Mark and Tony upon murders that Mark says them as \"No murder is perfect practically\" and the another is Mark's proposal to Tony is saving her execution saying a scenario that is based upon hiring assassin of Tony and another is contradictions of Marks such that no one could believe anything Mark because of his fame about writings upon crimes.How could a small key change the flow of whole film? I think this question can be answered only in a Hitchcock film.",

            "content": "\"Dial M for Murder\" is a 1954 crime thriller directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock. It was adapted from the play of the same name by Frederick Knott, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie. It stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings. \"Dial M for Murder\" is about Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, a professional tennis player who wants his wife, Margot, played by Grace Kelly, dead. Margot cheats on her husband with Mark Halliday, played by Robert Cummings, an American writer who visits frequently while Tony is away on his tennis tour. Margot says that she destroyed all the letters that were sent to her by Mark, except for one, which was stolen, used as blackmail against her, and was never returned. Once Mark gets home, it is revealed that he intercepted the letter, and that he is the blackmailer, after he insists that Margot and Mark go to the theater. He reveals this by explaining it to his old acquaintance, Charles Swann, played by Anthony Dawson, who he studied with while in college. He then blackmails Swann into killing his wife, so that he may inherit her fortune. He sets up an elaborate plan to do so, but when the plan fails, resulting in Margot accidentally killing Swann, he has to think of a second plan to frame her for murder. It's a thriller divided into two engaging parts, combined with a great story and excellent use of cinematography. The movie's use of cinematography is excellent, using several of Alfred Hitchcock's usual techniques. For instance, the camera tends to sit in one place for extended periods of time, not cutting frequently, as other movies tend to. It makes the movie more realistic when it comes to its acting, which brings up my second point: the acting. The acting is very good in this film, and this is proven by the long takes that were used in the film. They couldn't cut, so the actors had to act for quite a long time compared to other films. It also proves how realistic the characters can be while still having that movie feel. Ray Milland plays his character so well, presenting us with a cocky character who manipulates his enemies until the end, while Grace Kelly gives us a confused character desperate for her life. \"Dial M for Murder\" is a classic film and should be viewed as such. The acting is great, and the use of fewer cuts supports this and gives us a more realistic portrayal of the film's scenario. It's a film that should not be missed by film noir fans or movie buffs. \"Dial M for Murder\" is one of a kind, a true classic.",

This film described a tennis player Tony wants to murder his wife to obtain her possession after he found out his wife's affair with Mark Halliday.

The friend is at first unsure, but the Husband traps him into doing it. The rest of the movie centers around conflicts between the characters about who was guilty of the murder. Many of these conflicts are interrogations from police officers, and the inspector. All of these scenes in the movie are very entertaining, well-produced, and well-acted.

            "content": "To say that I enjoyed this movie over and over again would be an understatement. Ray Milland is superb as the sinister husband, who is tired of his wife's affair with Robert Cummings. It would threaten his existence and his lavish lifestyle if she should leave him. The idea of being just a tennis bum with no money does not appeal to him. Therefore he decides to hire an old college chum to murder her. Really we hope he does, because Kelly is after all an unfaithful wife. Hasn't he done all she wanted? He has given up his career as a tennis pro to settle down to a boring life selling sports equipment. And even after he does all she wants she has an affair. Bad girl. Grace Kelly isperfect as the wife who tired of Tony's lackluster commitment to making a living. After all he is a tennis champ. I read that the movie was shown in 3-D but I don't know how that would make it better. I really like the use of the camera shooting down on the characters in the living room. Really interesting is how Tony, when he hears Kelly struggling with the killer actually looks pained. What a guy! The best scene of course is the last when Tony realizes that he is caught, and charmingly sinister just pours a drink and offers one to everyone else including Margo. How good is Milland? Perfect, considering he was head over heels in love with Grace Kelly during the filming. His character displays no hint of this torrid affair. Cummings is perfect also as the lover who is a detective novel writer who after a time figures out that Milland planned the whole thing. The only criticism of this movie is the constant music thru out. Milland is so, so handsome that you can see why Kelly fell for him.",

That thing is pure genius when it reveals itself to you on the screen.This is a fantastic movie and stars Grace Kelly, so what else could you want. It will keep you riveted as you wonder who will stumble first. The story is the great part about this movie. I actually think just about any director could have pulled this off.

Almost all of it takes place in only one setting - Margot's & Tony's small but classy apartment. Evil Is Interesting: we're enthralled by Tony's (Ray Milland's) evolving plot to murder his adulterous wife. Tony is even seen as somewhat justified, since Margot is adultering with a younger, handsomer man, Mark, as played somewhat limply by Bob Cummings. Margot's affair may be acceptable continental behavior, but it's grounds for a man to seek violent forms of \"satifaction\" in solidly-Anglo-Saxon Britain. Tony is a professional murder-mystery-writer, so we the audience root for a fool-proof scheme out of this guy, but just in the backs of our minds. The players are set into motion! The proxy murderer enters the house with Margot there alone! Tony is across town enjoying his well-thought-out air-tight alibi! Mark isn't in a position to save her! Then, Tony's plot fails! Margo physically turns tables on the man set to kill her, smalltime crook Swan. The tension in the murder-room, with Margot struggling while being strangled, then killing her attacker is all thanks to a well-placed common household gadget! Tony's plot fails, interestingly enough, but his wife may be put to death my His Majesty's Government thanks to a plot twist. WONDERFUL, Tony thinks. It could all end there, with perhaps Margot getting a commutation to life imprisonment or something, so we don't feel so bad for her. But, Hitchcock and the author both work skillfully to fool us. The Fat Lady will sing later. Inspector Hubbard, of Scotland Yard, played by the comfortably-English and familiar John Williams, has these attacks of conscience and must \"get to the bottom of things\". Altho his unfaithful wife is now safely on death row, Tony finds a Brit version of Columbo keeps showing up to bother him with little details. Egged on by Margot's old boyfriend Mark, Insp Hubbard, who first helped send Margot up the river, delves even deeper into the case. Using relentless logic, Hubbard drives events forward to their logical conclusion, as we see Tony falling to pieces mentally, a bit at a time. The script is brilliant in several aspects, mostly for introducing murder-plan elements that first confuse the audience. As these puzzlements are solved, a new perplexity comes into play, and we don't understand Hubbard's crime-solving method until the very end. There's no mystery about who did what, but there is a great deal of mystery about how the bad guy is going to get caught! So, this filmplay is done quite smartly.",

She 'does as she's told' even when circumstances scream out for her to take some initiative (well I screamed out anyway;\u00a0 I mean, really...).\u00a0 Her passivity was so well portrayed it made you want to shake her and yell 'get a backbone!' but that was the idea and it just leaves you so utterly thankful not to have been a wife in the '50s.\u00a0 The sharp and elegant apparel sported by the main characters provides a satisfying feast for the eyes and invokes nostalgia for the days when people actually 'dressed up' (even if they were staying in for the evening).\u00a0 Schlepping about in tatty jeans and t-shirts wasn't an option - that's what makes films of this era so visually rich and decadent (not to mention the non-stop smoking and unabated supping of cocktails or hard liquor, morning, noon or night).\u00a0 The jaunty orchestral music is vintage cinematic\u00a0 entertainment as are the dramatic crescendos of stringed instruments . We all know how Dial M for Murder will end but it's a clever and enjoyable ride and so absorbing I didn't even complain about it being\u00a0 two hours long.",

            "content": "Dial M For Murder is another film done by Hitch in the 50s, so the expectations behind this film immediately became high for me. Hitchcock has yet to fail me with his great murder mystery/suspense films, and Dial M For Murder is no exception to his list of great films.Like many other Hitchcock films, Dial M is a claustrophobic film. About 90% of it takes place in a single room. Hitch uses every object in the room very well, which continues to keep the movie interesting. Unlike a lot of films of the time (and even today), the movie follows the killer to begin with. The killer reveals his motive and everything else behind the murder of his wife which is to take place later that week. About halfway through the film, you begin to stop trusting the killer, and begin to trust other members of the (very good) cast. This is where Dial M For Murder won me over (although it wasn't done as good as Psycho).The cast, as said before, is made up of many great actors. Grace Kelly was in her prime, and everybody else had great chemistry with everyone else. The dialouge (as with most Hitchcock films with the exception of Psycho) feels dated, but for the time, the dialouge was handled very well.The movie, as to be expected, has several great moments of suspense. One scene (which drags out for about 5 minutes) contains unbearable suspense. Hitch does his films so that the viewer can't stand the suspense anymore, yet they can't take their eyes off the screen.What makes this film a stand out from other Hitchcock films is the twist at the end. No, it isn't a twist like Psycho. It's more of a small twist in the investigation that you wouldn't expect. The twist actually seems small and pointless, but if affected the outcome of the movie in such a good way.Highly recommended, but only to people who don't mind slightly dated movies.",

As most people know this was the first of three films that she would do for Hitch.  Also, most people know that he sort of developed an unhealthy obsession for her and was devastated when she retired from acting to become Princess Grace of Monaco.

Still you have to recognize that the murder attempt is very impressive and that having reduced Grace Kelly 's  trial to one sequence of some ten seconds expedites matters very conveniently ( the old master's hand ! ). But the casting is  uneven and reflects Hitchcock's  probable lack of interest for the film: he appears to have temporarily lost his fascination for his goddess Grace Kelly ( perhaps because of the affair she is said having then  with Milland ); so she is lovely but ill at ease( except in the murder scene )as the unfaithful wife; Robert Cummings is completely wooden, and  his adulterous couple with Kelly shows no passion, not even warmth, whatsoever and attracts no sympathy.  Ray Milland is better, but has sometimes a tendency to overplay. The best performances are to be credited to Anthony Dawson, aptly sinister as the would-be murderer, and John Williams, a delight as the Inspector.",

From the first meeting with Swann, we are immediately caught up in trying to figure everything out in our mind. How the murder is planned between the two of them, to how Wendice changes the story several times to make it believable for the detective and his wife, to figuring out all the different keys (literally and figuratively) to the real story behind the murder.The cast of characters was amazing with Milland making us believe Tony Wendice and his attempts to escape the law, Grace Kelly playing the blonde (Need I say more) Margot Wendice, and finally John Williams playing a wonderful detective, with his wit and little drops of humor.The storyline was perfect and made for a captivating and interesting movie as the audience tries to figure out the truth behind the murder, hoping that Tony Wendice doesn't get the ending he hopes for.",

When Wendice is explain to Swan how the whole thing will be played out, I was completely drawn in, I thought this was brilliant screen work, it was planned out great too. I kept thinking Hitchcock is a genius for thinking up something as crazy as this! During the execution of the attack, you're not really sure what to expect is going to happen so you're just drawn right in. Your feeling of suspense is at a maximum, and then the fun just stops. The rest of the movie is Wendice clumsily covering up his tracks and his wife being maliciously interrogated by one cop. Then, all of a sudden that cop solves Wendice's whole plan (as if by a miracle or something) and exposes it almost too easily. It's just like they said during the movie, there is no such thing as a perfect crime, only on paper, so the thrill of the movie was a bit disappointing. Other than that the camera-work is really unique if you pay close attention there are some really great shots, such as one when Wendice explains the murder to Swan in the room, the camera is stilted from the ceiling, like a crane shot. The color of the movie is very pretty too, I just feel like there was much more to the movie that Hitchcock could have done to keep his audience.",

            "content": "Having seen several of Hitchcock's movies, this seems to me to be typical of his psychological thrillers. Three strengths of this movie are its plot, characters, acting. The plot is a tightly constructed murder mystery. And while the viewer knows \"who done it,\" only the villain, Tony Wendice (played by Ray Milland) knows what's going on. Whether or not he is able to commit the perfect crime hinges on every tiny detail of his plan going perfectly. When things don't go exactly as he expected them to, he has to change his story. And then the question is, will he be able to escape getting caught and pin the crime on his wife, Margot (played by Grace Kelly). As the plot unfolds, the suspense builds, as one expects in a Hitchcock movie, to a dramatic climax.The characters were believable and well developed, thanks to the good acting of the main characters. Ray Milland does a convincing job as the conniving and ruthless former tennis pro who has married his wife for her money. Grace Kelly is excellent as the unfaithful, neglected wife. And Robert Cummings does a good job portraying her secret lover, mystery writer, Mark Halliday. John Williams, in a supporting role, makes a perfect detective, Police Inspector Hubbard, whose cluelessness early on, adds to the suspense.The weaknesses that I saw in the movie were in its setting and certain parts of the plot. Most of the movie took place in one small room of the Wendice's apartment. Other than that, the action occurred only briefly in front of the apartment building, in the hallway of the building, or at a hotel. I found this a little boring. I would have preferred a greater variety of locations. On the other hand, while that would have been my preference, I realize that Hitchcock may have done this on purpose to add to the sense of claustrophobia experienced by the main characters as the situation seems to close in on them. In terms of weakness in the plot, I thought some of the circumstances were pretty unbelievable. It's hard for me to imagine that the police inspector would be able to bring a convicted and condemned criminal home as easily as he did and have that person hang out in their own home while he was able to continue investigating. I also found it hard to believe that the movie ended with everyone involved acting as calmly as they did.",

The plan is drawn out and as it is being executed the plan goes wrong and Tony quickly must make a plan B.Like in all Alfred Hitchcock movies there is a huge amount of camera work. Hitchcock uses camera angles to show how close the people are and emotions. The closer they are in his wide shots the closer they are in a relationship. Instead of using the actors voice more he uses their faces and their reactions to specific scenes to show their emotions.The acting in this movie is outstanding. You can really see the improvement on acting from this movie alone. You can see the emotion in the actors' face and in their voice.I thought that the movie was very well made and that it deserves a 9/10.

            "content": "Dial M for MurderAlfred Hitchcock's thrilling motion picture \"Dial M for Murder,\" conceived in 1954, invites viewers on a cinematic adventure which places them at the front seat of a carefully devised homicide attempt, and continually keeps audiences engaged in the complex and precise assassination of the protagonist's wife. This gripping film communicates its plot and theme through various film making techniques which are now an iconic staple of Hitchcock's ability to tell a story through his use of the camera. The lifelike performances of Ray Milland and Grace Kelly also contribute an additional layer of fascinating onscreen action, and exhibit that dialogue isn't always a necessary element to a perfected film, and that pictures truly express more than words. The movie takes place in the dense urban area of London, where a couple of two (Tony Wendice and Margot Wendice) dwell in a small quaint apartment. This setting is where the entirety of the film is shot, and all the scenes display how crucial and important a single area can be in a person's life. Within the first few minutes, audiences see that Tony's wife is cheating on her husband with a young author, who becomes a critical supporting character and allows viewers to gain even more knowledge in understanding why Tony displays disappointment in his wife, and seeks true happiness. In his eyes, however, this happiness comes from the prospect of inheriting his spouse's wealth after she is murdered. The following segments of the motion picture all display the protagonist's pursuit to do this, and emphasize the growing tension in mood. Each fleeting second is utilized to Hitchcock's benefit, and clearly comprises to create an incredible product and result.As previously mentioned, the talent of the actors in the film can only be described as praiseworthy and the importance of this aspect should not be understated in the least. Through a divine aptitude for realism, each role inhabits a different perspective and ultimately is a culmination of abstract expression, and traditional acting devices. With a stroke of genius, each character elevates the quality of the story. Delving further into the creation of the movie, we can analyze that cinematography is the primary drive for this thriller, and it essentially serves as the main form of storytelling for audiences. With distinct camera shots, Hitchcock projects an idealized suspenseful drama with a variety of cryptic scenarios. His personalized take on film making shapes a motion picture which is both deeply captivating and moving. To wrap things up, we see how Alfred Hitchcock constructs an enthralling piece which captures onlookers with dazzling acting and cinematic displays. An utmost quality can be seen in every nook of this film's design, and should be looked upon as an exemplary model for this genre of movie. My vote is eight.",

Ego in there too like all her movies.Not to mention the totally off the wall rest of it that no sane adult would do, for instance you wouldn't have detailed long winded talks with police about things without a charge or a lawyer present. And in crime cases there has to be some objective evidence of events happening a certain way, it's pretty obvious that Grahm Kelly's character was acting in self defense and thus there would be no conviction whatsoever. And the police would never go into that detailed of an investigation period, doesn't happen. Fairly dumb that it all comes down to a keys mix up, which would not prove anything but a key mixup, it would be fairly clear that hiding a key in that spot would be a natural thing and in no way would prove murder or anything else.

            "content": "Very intriguing movie! I love this film for a few key reasons, the most prominent being that it is almost hard to decipher at times as to who is the \"Good guy\" and who fills the role of antagonist, and I believe the argument could be made that all 3 main characters (Mr. + Mrs. Wendice, and Mark Halliday) all fill BOTH roles throughout the movie interchangeably. At first we see a couple with a strained marriage (as many are in one form or another) and Mrs. Wendice cheats on her husband while he is away working. SHE is the villain because she did not live up to \"For better or for worse\" in her wedding vow, she went behind her husband's back and betrayed him. We sympathize with Mr. Wendice because he did nothing to deserve this (to our knowledge) and I believe most can not blame him for hatching a plan to have her killed in order to inherit her fortune- she deserves it. However, as the film progresses we see Mr. Wendice become thorough in hiding the evidence, almost maniacal, as he attempts to cover up his mistake and send his wife to her death. Simultaneously we see Margot Wendice slowly torn emotionally by circumstances she can no longer control- we begin to empathize with her because she was set up and nearly killed.Finally, with Mark Halliday, we see a similar situation to that of Margot Wendice. Mark has accompanied Margot in betraying her husband as he is the one whom Margot commits the act with, unbeknownst to Tony Wendice. He then visits Mr. Wendice's home, almost slapping him in the face figuratively. Mark Halliday is evil on the same level that Mrs. Wendice is seen at. He too, however, redeems himself as the movie progresses by trying desperately to save Margot's life by proving her innocence. He is a force for good and turns the tables on Tony Wendice, who in turn becomes the villain halfway through the film.Although each character is unique and each changes throughout the course of the film, I still found myself rooting for Tony Wendice to get away with his ploy. He was a decent man who was simply put in this situation because of his unfaithful wife- he would not have tried to kill her had she stayed faithful to him. Either way you spin it, the good guys prevail and evil is vanquished throughout the film- which characters are \"good\" and which are \"evil\" is entirely up to you.

I especially enjoyed the attention shown in developing the character of the secondary villain Swan/Lesgate, played by Tony Dawson. In lesser movies, this character would have been a glossed-over stereotype, but not here.  Grace Kelley is, as usual, her beautiful self.",

However, in the past few years a remake of this film called \"A Perfect Murder\" was released. That movie was a shocker!!!! I ask you to forget that the film was ever made.Dial M for Murder is a film that binds me in suspense every time I view it. Well worth the video rental and ten times better than any modern horror flick around.",

I was most impressed by Grace Kelly, who only made eight films, but she was a rare talent that made every project she was involved in a must see, and Dial M for Murder is no exception. Under the guidance of one of the world's greatest directors and opposite one of the forties and fifties most reliable male leads, Kelly brings to life a tightly woven script that wastes not even one moment, every second building the tension to the final scene, like few others could. If you're looking to dive into the career of either Kelly or Hitchcock, this is a great place to start. Hitch directed this especially for 3D cinemas so try to respect his wish!",

It goes off with a strong start with the dialogue between Swann and Wendice, which is already intricate on itself.Then the development leaving Wendice to bend the entire event to let once again someone else (the justice system) kill his wife, and then yet again Halliday discovering the truth whilst fantasizing is so quickly and natural.A murder plot that was worked through down to the smallest details, I wouldn't like to be an enemy to Alfred Hitchcock.",

            "content": "I saw Dial M For Murder in the theater when it was re-released in 3D in 1980.  It is the best 3D movie ever.  Unlike other gimmicky 3D movies such as House of Wax that were released in the 50's by lesser directors, Hitchcock didn't try to throw things at the viewer in every single scene. Since it was a stage play, he just concentrated on the depth of the stage in a lot of long shots to lull you into forgetting about the 3D.  He even used rear projection in some scenes that flattened out the movie.  He saved the 3D for the one great scene when the killer is strangling Grace Kelly.  With the great 3D effect, she seems to reach out into the audience for the pair of scissors to defend herself and you find yourself wanting to hand her the scissors.",

Alfred Hitchcock's storytelling excellence is showcased in a profound manner.'Dial M...' is not the classic whodunit. You already know who the killer is, how he plans to carry out the murder and also, without a doubt, you know that he will be caught in the end.But how he is caught forms the crux of this story.'Dial M for Murder' is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece and more so because of the director, Alfred Hitchcock.",

            "content": "The London police, true to form, arrest the intended victim for killing her would-be murderer. The English courts, true to form, condemn her to death. Not many people in the 1950s seemed upset about such miscarriages of justice: did they just accept that a percentage of errors does not invalidate the overall deterrent effect?Throughout his films, Hitchcock pours contempt on cops, lawyers, and judges. He sees them, through personal and systemic inadequacy, misusing the powers society has given them. Is this just mature cynicism about the efficacy of justice? Or is it his innate Catholicism, that earthly courts cannot be expected to discern the truth and that only a divine court can make a final judgment?",

            "content": "Dial M for murder was full of excitement. It starts off with a husband wanting to kill his wife. You don't know what is happening in the first part of the movie but you begin to piece it together after the husband, Tony, starts to explain his plan. As he is explaining it you think to yourself there is no way he has figured this whole thing out all by himself but he surprises you. As i was watching this movie i was thinking to myself well what if this happens and then Tony says exactly what he would do if something were to go wrong and it blew my mind. The way Alfred Hitchcock takes you through a maze of emotions from confusion on why Tony wants to kill his wife to disappointment when you think the wife was the one who would actually do the time for a crime she didn't commit. I think the ending of the movie was a very artistic and bold choice. It ended with Tony walking in the front door with a key he shouldn't have used if he was innocent. It leaves you guessing what happens to him. It is obvious that he will get caught and be in trouble but even though it leaves you knowing what will happen your mind still goes in a thousand different directions. Will he talk his way out of it? Will he do the time for hiring someone to kill his wife? I think its amazing how just not showing the rest of the story can leave you thinking and wondering but also loving the way it ended. I would definitely watch this movie again. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and it kept my attention throughout all the twists and what if's.",
