            "content": "Billy Wilder, a genius when it came to adapting films from another medium, teamed up with Samuel Taylor, who wrote the play, \"Sabrina's Fair\", and Ernest Lehman, to create a a delightful comedy that will remain an old favorite because of the great charm the creative men imbued this movie with.Some comments on this forum remark about the disparity of age between Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. They all seem to forget that Ms. Hepburn played opposite with men much older than her, namely, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck, just to name a few. The actress was always effective and showed she had an enormous charisma no matter who was her leading man.\"Sabrina\" looks as good today, as when it was first released thanks to the timeless black and white photography of Charles Lang. The big asset of the film was the unusual pairing between Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. Both actors were wonderful together, as we witness in the film. William Holden, as the younger Larrabee, is excellent as well.The film is a delightful comedy that, in comparison to Sidney Pollack's misguided and undistinguished attempt to bring it to the screen can't even compare with the witty and elegant film Mr. Wilder gave us.",

With Billy Wilder's story-telling skill, Audrey Hepburn's unsurpassed charm, plenty of talent in the rest of the cast, and a worthwhile story, there is a lot of credit to go around.The story is based the kind of interesting but slight premise that Wilder handles masterfully, and as a result the story is filled with both funny moments and thoughtful moments, all of which work well. There is a variety of well-chosen settings, always interesting but never pretentious.Bogart and Holden both play their roles flawlessly. The two of them make an interesting combination with Hepburn, and it works even better than you could hope. John Williams also plays the proper English chauffeur as few others could have. There are also a number of good moments for the others in the supporting cast.With all the other strengths, it may still be Hepburn's picture most of all.In \"Sabrina\", she has a role that allows her quite a variety of scenes as her character grows and changes. It plays to all of her strengths, and makes Hepburn herself the most appealing aspect of an enjoyable and well-crafted picture.",

Yes, and she's beguiling trying to gas herself in the garage (before quickly cracking a window) because gorgeous, rich playboy William Holden doesn't notice her. But it's nothing that a little time away in Paris won't cure... Hepburn is absolutely radiant in this picture: dark brows over big Bambi eyes, sensual, flirtatious lips, and that long, long neck. She embodies the spirit of the Cinderella heroine, and director Billy Wilder milks her gamine appeal for all the millions it is worth. Holden is blithe and lively, and Humphrey Bogart manages to make his stuffy unease rather charming. Clever, biting, romantic, sweet, this version of \"Sabrina\" has it all. ***1/2 from ****",

            "review_title": "A perfect souffle...Not too high, not too low, and certainly not cooked with the oven off!",
            "content": "Audrey Hepburn followed up her Oscar Winning role as a sweet princess in \"Roman Holiday\" with the perfect Cinderella story, one with the wittiest script, and filled with romance in spite of the fact that her leading men seem far too old for her. She is the daughter of the chauffeur (John Williams, actor; NOT composer) to the wealthy Larrabee family, narrating the film in its unique prologue as she describes the Larrabee estate. From there, the audience meets the Larrabee family which includes the aging old codger of a patriarch (Walter Hampden) and a society matron (Nella Walker) not in the Billie Burke dizzy mode, and their sons: Stuffy Humphrey Bogart and practically worthless playboy William Holden. As she is heading to Paris to attend an esteemed cooking school, she fears that she'll loose Holden (who barely notices her) to one of his silly debutante girlfriends, and after Bogart rescues her from a case of carbon monoxide poisoning, Hepburn faces her future and heads off where she learns how to cook and comes back a glamorous beauty. Holden notices her now, and Bogart steps in to prevent Holden from ruining a business deal by breaking off with his newest fiancee by going after Hepburn himself.Having seen this many years ago and perhaps not in 20 years, I had many memories of the souffle scene, the plastic table testing scene, and of course the opening narration where Hepburn describes the purpose of each of the Larrabee's and the unseen staff. Among that staff is maid Nancy Kulp a decade before \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" (Miss Jane on Long Island rather than in Bel Aire!) and Ellen Corby close to two decades before \"The Waltons\". Each of the cast gets a chance to gain a laugh or two, yet the romantic plot-line is very well played out with intelligent dialog and situations that helps this rise above your typical romantic comedy. Bogart gets the chance to play a character of his own background and even makes a comment regarding Paris that will instantly bring back memories of his biggest hit, \"Casablanca\". Holden's big moment is reacting to having sat on two champagne glasses, and papas Williams and Hampden each shine in their individual moments as well, particularly Hampden when he makes fun of one of Holden's former romantic distractions by imitating her participation in a TV commercial.With director Billy Wilder among the writers, this ends up being one of his best works, quite different than \"Double Indemnity\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" and not as farcical as \"Some Like It Hot\". The first half is appropriately humorous and charming with the second half more bitter sweet and profound. The art direction, photography, editing, use of a new music score combined with some popular standards (\"Isn't It Romantic?\", \"Yes We Have No Bananas\") aiding the film greatly. This film has sustained the test of time, and produced a remake that while unnecessary I didn't mind all that much. (Featured actress Nancy Marchand stands out as the family matriarch in that version....) As far as \"Cinderella\" stories go, this is one of the most unique, and one that its audiences will gratefully never forget.",

As a romantic comedy, it is funny, sophisticated and moving, with beautiful production values, a delightful script and sparkling performances. Wilder's direction is great, while the story is clever and engaging. I also love the cinematography and especially Audrey Hepburn's dresses. The score is romantic, and the script is wonderful and sparkles like bubbles and champagne. I heard this film had a difficult production, if that were the case I don't think it showed. The performances are equally wonderful. The lovely Audrey Hepburn is radiant and charming, William Holden shows real star quality and despite the claims he hated doing Sabrina Humphrey Bogart(or so I think) is perfectly cast. In conclusion, this film is a gem. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I enjoyed the movie immensely despite some issues I had with the plausibility of Sabrina's transformation. The film is moving, thanks mostly to Linus's restrained courting and Sabrina's relationship with her father, and there are wonderful comic moments, thanks to Holden's perfectly timed wise quips and lighthearted nature which clash with the senior Larabee's pragmatism. Hepburn is as charming here as she is in Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's. The ending makes perfect sense given David's commitment problems and the fact that in my opinion Elizabeth seems more alluring than Sabrina, though our heroine is perfect for Linus. Terrific film, 9/10.",

            "content": "Sabrina (1954) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Insanely delightful romantic-comedy from Billy Wilder about Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), a chauffeur's daughter who has always loved David Larrabee (William Holden), the son of the man her father works for. When she returns from Paris the youngest son begins to have a thing for her but he's promised to another woman and there's a major deal on the line. Older and much more mature brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) decides to take Sabrina out until the deal is complete but soon he finds himself falling in love.Wilder made so many great movies in his career that it's easy to overlook some of the ones that are meerly \"good\" or very good. SABRINA is a film that often gets overlooked when one discusses the director's career and that's a little shocking because this is an extremely good movie that works on all levels. Not only is the film extremely funny but it's incredibly romantic, charming and the director's master touch is scattered throughout the material. Not to mention you've also got three legends in the picture! To me the film shows what a brilliant director Wilder was because it's true that the story is pretty much a small fairy tale that Hollywood did every year. There was always some sort of romance dealing with a dreaming girl and an overworked man who put love on the back burner. Wilder's touches throughout the film are obvious and it's really remarkable to see how well this material works. As I said, there are some very funny moments scattered throughout the picture but there's also a bit of intensity because you really do want to see the story work in the favor of the Bogart character. The way Wilder managed to make the romance work so well is a real strong inducator to what type of director he was.As far as the cast goes, rumor has it that Bogart hated this role and the movie because he felt he was too old to be romancing such a young girl. You know, he was probably right but the film is so well-made and the performances are so great that this here really isn't an issue as you watch the picture. Bogart really comes across well here and he manages to play the broken-hearted quite well. Hepburn is wonderfully charming in a type of role that she is best remembered for. Bogart and Hepburn certainly have a burning chemistry that jumps off the screen. Holden is also extremely funny in his bit as the playboy. There's also some great supporting performances from John Williams, Walter Hampden and Francis X. Bushman.SABRINA does run on a bit too long but there's still no question that Wilder does a fantastic job, the romance is perfect and the three leads are simply divine.",

            "content": "The master of many genres, Billy Wilder, does his magic here with this delightful comedy. Although maybe not one of his best, it still holds up after over 50 years. There has been a lot said about the casting of Bogart as Linus, the stuffy businessman and I disagree with most of it. I think that Bogart is perfect for the part of the seemingly humourless, financial wizard older brother. Granted, he is not the prettiest actor....never was.....he's a generation older than Audrey Hepburn.....and reportedly hated the movie and his co-stars. All that aside, he rose to the occasion and his playing of the role is subtle. Seeing him come to the realization that he is falling in love with Sabrina is so well done that it sneaks up on you.Audrey Hepburn is just magical, as she always was.....there is nothing more to say about her....words fail me.William Holden is surprisingly good in a comic role but why the blonde hair?He's breezy, unreliable and thoroughly likable and it becomes obvious that Sabrina is much too good for him. However incongruous it may seem, she belongs with Bogart.The support in this film is top notch.....John Williams....what a great British character; Walter Hampden is a scream as the drinking, cigar smoking father who just wants an olive for his martini. Look for Nancy Kulp as one of the service staff before her days as Jane Hathaway on Beverly Hillbillys.This is a wonderful film........watch it, you won't regret it!",

            "content": "It seems to be not just stating but over stating the obvious to say yet again that Billy Wilder was a writing-directing genius, that Audrey Hepburn was not only drop-dead gorgeous but also a gifted actress, that Bogie and Bill Holden were consummate professionals who were virtually strangers to bad performances but I'm being constantly reminded that there are people reading these Boards whose parents may not have been born in the era when Sabrina was made and I guess you could argue that those of us a tad longer in the tooth have some kind of moral obligation to discuss artistes whose work is now becoming available on DVD in an effort to help them distinguish the wheat from the chaff. Virtually all the books about Wilder - and possibly Hepburn and Bogie as well - mention the tension on the set between lone wolf Bogie and cosy threesome Wilder, Holden and Hepburn and the amazing thing is that this doesn't show on screen. Wilder makes a big thing out of the fact that the 'Baron' - an outstanding cameo by Marcel Dalio - is making souffles at Hepburns Cooking School in Paris as if to reinforce what he (Wilder) himself is doing from beginning to end in this delightful confection. Everyone was on top of their game and boy, does it show. This is one of those films that no one should even DREAM of remaking because that's like trying to reconstitute as an adult a snowflake that enchanted you as a child. Untouchable, unmissable.

            "content": "I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, as I can't see it stated anywhere else; I just have to write it down and see if anybody at all agrees with me. It's very unwise for a Hollywood production to have the stars they've cast shoulder all of the burden of trying to make the script seem convincing.I don't think the screenplay did a very good job at all of explaining just why these two men were so attracted to Sabrina (save for the fact that she happens to be played by one Audrey Hepburn... ) The character of the chauffeur's daughter behaves in the manner of an entitled brat - just because she can't have the man she wants, she writes a bitter little suicide note until she's shuffled off to Paris.Upon her return, only her appearance has changed; her character still remains somewhat aloof, but she's discovered how to utilise her looks to twist men around her little finger. This has the effect of making the two vying suitors we're shown seem shallow. This is a perception that is only confirmed when one of them attempts to woo her using the same seduction techniques he's already tried out on dozens of other girls (yet Sabrina seems amused by this, rather than dissuaded!) Meanwhile, the older brother takes advantage by trying to kiss her under the pretence that he's acting in his missing sibling's stead (as if that type of advance would really go over smoothly... ?!)Throughout the entirety of the film it felt like we were meant to harbour affection for these characters just by virtue of who was playing them; Sabrina/Audrey because of her elfin beauty and gauche naivet\u00e9, Linus/Bogart because the payoff is a reversal of what happens in Casablanca and he gets to be with the girl for once. I didn't buy their motivations as anything recognisably human, and therefore didn't derive much satisfaction from the resolution of the story...I think that established persona's and star wattage should only be relied upon to achieve so much. The underlying construction of what they were given to work with just didn't seem solid enough to me. The one benefit to casting icons is that there are very few 'boring' scenes, there are just quite a few scenes that don't appear to make much narrative sense.",

Grant was originally supposed to play the role, but according to a recent biography of Wilder, dropped out at the last minute. Wilder went scrambling for a replacement and got Humphrey Bogart instead. He also would have preferred to work with Joseph Cotten who played the part on Broadway, but Paramount said he wasn't a big enough movie name for equal billing with Bill Holden and Audrey Hepburn.In fact Cary Grant was asked and didn't do three Wilder films, this one, Five Graves to Cairo and Love in the Afternoon. Eventually though he did wind up working with Audrey in Charade.Bogey was miscast and he knew it. He also knew that this was Hepburn's film and it was Holden's studio. For whatever reason he was reportedly surly and obnoxious on the set. He's got no spark whatsoever in his performance as Linus. But Hepburn has the spark as does Holden. They were having an affair on set so Sabrina's crush on Holden rings true.Very simply Audrey is the daughter of John Williams, the chauffeur on the Larrabee estate in Long Island. Walter Hampden's the head of the clan and he's got two sons. Sober and industrious Humphrey Bogart and playboy William Holden. Gawky teenager Audrey is crushing out on Holden. Williams decides to send her to Paris and cooking school where she matures.So much so, she catches the eye of both Larrabee boys. Who will she end up with?

This is one of those old-fashioned Hollywood efforts which is just a joy to watch, with top-name actors delivering their lines with aplomb. Hepburn has never been lovelier here, with none of those irritating characteristics than some of her other characters possess (I'm thinking of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S in particular).It helps that the calibre of the cast is superb, with a fine turn from Humphrey Bogart particularly notable.

Young and awkward chauffeur's daughter Sabrina Fairchild (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Audrey Hepburn) has had a crush on David since childhood, but he has never really noticed her, until he returns home after two years from Paris.

David is already engaged to be married to another woman, if the wedding doesn't go ahead a big corporate deal will go bust, so workaholic Linus starts a friendship with Sabrina to draw her away.

He was the type of actor (like Nicholson and Redford today), for whom aging did not provide any obstacle, in terms of needing a radical change in his roles -- and we all missed a great deal by his being felled by cancer, without the many additional films he would otherwise have made.The three leads - Bogart, accompanied by Audrey Holden and William Holden, are perfect in their roles. They are throughly engaging in whichever of the three permutations any two are together, as well as when all three are on-screen at the same time.The three primary supporting actors - Bogart's and Holden's wealthy parents, and Hepburn's chauffeur father, are very likable and their parts well-played. The remainder of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.The enjoyment of this film is in no way dependent on any real suspense - the outcome is no surprise, and most of the ongoing events predictable. This is one of those stories where the pure charm of the actors and characters, and a wholly-engaging story stand by themselves for its success.This is also an outstanding nostalgic piece for the film and life styles of the 1950's, and as a memorial to three of movie history's most remembered and honored \"A\" list personalities.(Since I first saw this film, viewing it again also has a special enjoyment for me, During the latter 1980's - early 1990's, my company employed a marketing consultant for several projects. His office was in the building at 30 Broad St., in New York City. This is the same building actually used in this picture, and with a special sign made for the film, was \"The Larabee Building,\" with the family's home offices.

Bogart ( a last minute replacement for Cary Grant), had just completed \"The Caine Mutiny\". Hepburn had just won the Oscar for \"Roman Holiday\", and Wilder had \"Stalag 17\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" completed, and would have a string of hits that started with \"Sabrina\" and continue on until \"One, Two, Three\" in 1961.All of the stars were properly aligned for \"Sabrina\". Although I think Grant might have been better in the part, Bogart worked hard to be semi-tough and likable. I'll be honest and say I found it disturbing to see him try to win over Hepburn. His features were too worn and hard to be completely winning. He and Holden worked well together, which is amazing when you consider they couldn't stand each other off screen.Hepburn, of course, is gorgeous. She's the perfect combination of charming, elegant, tom-boyishness, and beauty.Wilder does it again with his screenplay and directing. First he assembles an excellent supporting cast, especially Walter Hampden and John Williams. Then he keeps the comedy coming and seldom lets up for us to catch our breath. His use of the camera is terrific too. I love the shot of Bogart at his desk in the distance, while the camera shoots through several doorways.Top notch production, first rate cast and wonderful screenplay and directing add up to a classic every movie lover should own.9 out of 10",

            "content": "\"Tennis, anyone?\" That trite statement actually comes from a play. It was spoken by a young, struggling actor of some rugged handsome looks, sometime in the 1920s. He said it with a now - famous trademark lisp. Yes Humphrey Bogart said that line. You see, when he started out in Broadway productions he was a juvenile actor. He played young social butterfly types (hard to believe, isn't it?). But there was a rational reason to think this, among the producers on Broadway - young man Bogart came from a prominent upper middle class family in Manhattan. His father was Dr. Bogart, a physician to wealthy people. His mother was an magazine artist. So yes...one could easily see that young Mr. Bogart would be used to saying things like \"Tennis anyone\" now and then...and so could play the young friend of the hero or the caddish social butterfly false lover or...well you can picture it! It is with great respect to Humphrey Bogart's determination to be a real actor...to play real people...that he broke out of this cul-de-sac of juveniles and ended up in the roles he is loved for: Rick Blaine, Sam Spade, Charlie Allnut, Fred C. Dobbs, Philip Marlowe, Captain Phillip Francis Queeg, Duke Mantee, Baby Face Martin...characters we know are real for better or worse. Not light hearted society types we will never meet in a million years.Yet Bogie did return to this arena once in his later career - after his only Oscar. In 1954 he played Linus Larribee, older of a pair of brothers (his younger brother is William Holden as David Larribee) who are the heirs to an industrial and shipping empire headed by their father Oliver Larribee (Walter Hampden). Into their upper class lives descends Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), the daughter of the family chauffeur Fairchild (John Williams). She has long had a crush on David, a real playboy, and once even tried to commit suicide (to be saved by Linus, without his realizing it was a planned suicide). She goes to Paris to study cooking, and returns after two years a sophisticated, attractive woman. And she turns the world of the Larribees upside down.There is a merger in the works between Larribee Industries and the largest sugar cane plantation owner in Puerto Rico (Francis X. Bushman), whose daughter (Martha Hyer) has always liked David. David is not crazy about this, and when he is reintroduced to the new Sabrina he is knocked off his feet. This jeopardizes the entire business plan (which involves using the sugar to manufacture a new type of all-purpose plastic that the Larribees have the patent rights to). Linus, who is the \"ant\" to David's \"grasshopper\", is determined to undue the effect of Sabrina on his brother, and (if necessary) romance her himself. He does...only to find that she is quite intoxicating, and that he is falling in love with her.It has been suggested that Bogart was wrong in this film (like Gary Cooper was in Billy Wilder's other Hepburn comedy, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON), because he was too old and his image didn't fit. Well, it is true that we have another May - September relationship here, and that Bogart's personae after his string of memorable performances was not as a financial type. Cary Grant, the original choice for the role, might have seemed better. But Grant is as much a misfire here as Bogart appears to be. The problem is Holden. One can see Bogart as a hard working type and Holden's older brother quite easily, but Grant (with his English accent)would have made Holden seem out-of-place. They would have had to change the Larribees into a transplanted English family in America to make Grant fit in perfectly. That might have worked - but it would have strained belief.Bogart rarely played comic roles after 1940, but in his late 1950s films he did do comedy a bit more (here, in BEAT THE DEVIL, and in WE'RE NO ANGEL). He demonstrates a natural gift for delivering comic lines (after David has an accident with a pair of drinking glasses he sat on, he is recovering and wants to write a poem to Sabrina about the accident - when he asks Linus/Bogart for a rhyme with glass, with a slight pause Linus/Bogart suggests \"alas\"). His performance is enhanced with his film partners Holden, Hepburn, and Williams and (best of all) Hampden.Williams is quite upset at the idea of his daughter marrying any of the Larribees. He is quite class conscious (and admits it), and in one of Bogart's best moments he tells Williams he is a snob! As for Hampden, one can only bless Wilder for casting him. Walter Hampden was one of Broadway's leading stars (especially in Shakespearean roles) between the teens and the 1930s. His production of HAMLET was considered one of the best ever on the American stage. But he arrived late in Hollywood, and although an impressive character actor rarely got any impressive role. His performance as Oliver Larribee, the last vestige of robber baron elitism in American society is wonderful. This includes his hiding his huge cigars from his wife (he is caught smoking in Linus' clothes closet at one point) to his sputtering about a young d\u00e9butante with an Adlai Stevenson button. He and Bogart share some nice give and take scenes, courtesy of Wilder's directing, here - just in time for Hampden, who died a year after this film was produced.",

            "content": "As a fan of Billy Wilder, old movies and this trio of stars, I was looking forward to this. But I feel it's a bit of a letdown. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, is luminous (and she is, as usual, paired off with a suitor far too old for her). But part of the problem is what the story does with her character. She pines away for Holden, and then goes away to cooking school in Paris. Why does she go? Did she want to go? Unknown. While away, she writes her father a letter saying she is over Holden. But then, when she returns, she (in a rather absurd coincidence) runs into him at the train station. The two connect. So she wasn't over him after all? Or was she over him, but then fell back in love when she saw him? What was her plan if she hadn't coincidentally run into him? Who knows? Later, Bogart and Holden sort out which of them gets to \"have\" her, which is rather sexist and also robs her of her agency. (Surely a charming girl like that must have other options besides a buffoon and an old man.) Holden hasn't been given much of a character to play. He's all charm and nothing else. The script never rounds him out with grace notes that might have helped us to understand why he lives such a vacuous life. As an actor, Holden has consistently shown an ability to locate the darkness buried inside his characters, but he never seems to tap into that quality here. (It might have been interesting if Hepburn, during the course of dating Holden finally realized what a shallow loser he is and dumped him. And then maybe Holden, in turn is forced to reexamine his life. But the story never explores that darker, more interesting possibility. Instead, Hepburn is a pawn in the men's games.) As for Bogart, he was, of course, one of our great stars and did amazing work in dramas and crime stories. But in a light romantic comedy like this, he's very much out of his element, like Holden is. (Bogart took the role after Cary Grant turned it down.) Bogart manages to capture the cold sourness of his character just fine, but he never locates the man's gradual transformation into a guy in love. He never seems interested in Hepburn at all, which is oddly something of an accomplishment, given how beautiful Hepburn is. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bogart is too old, unattractive and emotionally cold for Hepburn to ever give him the time of day. When these two would-be lovers are reunited at the very end of the film, they hug rather than kiss. It's as if the filmmakers are acknowledging the absurdity of that these two might actually be right for each other. Or perhaps they know that there's something rather gross about the fifty-ish Bogart kissing the twenty-ish Hepburn.",

Despite being poor and him being a hopeless playboy, she has visions of falling in love with and marrying the rich David Larrabee (William Holden). Well, after she returns from college, she has blossomed into a beautiful lady--so beautiful that David is head over heels for her. However, the very business-oriented older brother, Linus (Humphrey Bogart) sees that if this romance is allowed to grow, it will hurt the company business. So, being the manipulative sort, he arranges for an accident to happen to David and takes over the job of wooing Sabrina himself--even though he is a rather cold fish. Amazingly, over time, the mismatched couple manage to create a spark of love--and this leads to even worse complications.As many people have heard, Humphrey Bogart apparently hating being cast in this film, as he felt too old to play this character. Well, he was right--Linus should have been younger and it seemed strange seeing Bogart romancing a lady half his age. However, if you look past this, you'll see that the film is exceptional throughout. The biggest star of this production is the director, Billy Wilder. He exercised such a deft hand and the film just exuded quality--you can't help but get sucked into the story. Sure, the actors were excellent, but it all worked so well despite bizarre casting because the guy in charge was so skilled at creating the perfect mood. An absolute charmer and quite the romantic picture despite dour old Humphrey! By the way, this film was re-made years later with Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond and Greg Kinear. While this is a very good film as well, it certainly wasn't necessary--adding nothing to the original tale--and messing it up a bit along the way (why make the virginal Sabrina more worldly and sexually active??). And my advice is why see the re-make when the original is better?",

John Williams, as Hepburn's deadpan snobby chauffeur father is good fun, as is Ellen Corby (grandma from 'The Waltons') as Bogart's secretary.

With a two million dollar budget and seven weeks of shooting in October/November of 1953, \"Sabrina\" was filming even before there was a finished script. Director Billy Wilder even asked Hepburn to fake an illness on the day they were shooting a scene still being rewritten! The result however remains one of the all time great romantic comedies, casting Hepburn against a pair of mismatched brothers, David (William Holden) and Linus (Humphrey Bogart) Larrabee. Linus in fact is such a corporate stiff that he's seen dictating a letter to his brother about reporting to work on time, while David seems singularly obsessed with fast sports cars and hit and run marriages. I found it amusingly interesting that the Larrabees were getting into plastics well before Dustin Hoffman could get that advice in \"The Graduate\".Two years at cooking school in Paris transforms the waif like Sabrina into a fashionable young woman who's learned how to live. Responding to her father's constant lament that she should stop reaching for the moon, Sabrina counters that now ... \"the moon's reaching for me\".As a stand in for his brother, Bogey proclaims himself Joe College with a touch of arthritis as he begins to court Sabrina. But he does manage to pull off one of the smoothest moves of his movie career when he comments 'it's all in the family' just before kissing her for the first time.One can just imagine how audiences of the 1950's might have been taken with the glamor and party life depicted in the film, unattainable as it was for the majority. Yet in the midst of it all, Audrey Hepburn exhibited a natural and quiet sophistication that endeared her to an entire decade of movie goers. Her self assurance in the role of Sabrina earned her a second Best Actress nomination in as many films.Stay attentive, and you'll catch Bogart's character request his secretary for a pair of tickets to 'The Seven Year Itch\".

The background score adds to the romance. On the surface Hepburn and Bogart may seem like an odd couple but as we see how Billy Wilder brings them on screen, the oddness vanishes. Both the actors are superb. Bogart downplays his part while Hepburn is charmingly vivacious. Holden does well.My only complaint is the David-Alice angle. In the end, why does David decide to go through with marrying Alice since he clearly does not love her? Was that just to create a happy ending? There are some nice location shots of France and America. We don't see much of France but the little we see seems a little too romanticized.

Holden plays David - and he's the man Sabrina has loved from childhood. When she returns from studying cooking in Paris, she's grown into a beautiful, chic young woman, and David notices her for the first time. Because David is engaged to a \"suitable\" woman and fearful of him causing yet another scandal with a woman, Linus tries to distract Sabrina by making a play for her himself.All the actors are superb, of course, if the casting is a tad odd. As usual, Hepburn is playing opposite men many years her senior - Holden by 11 years and Bogart by 30. People often ask the reason for this occurring again and again with Hepburn. The answer is easy. Though she is actually of the Tab Hunter-Robert Wagner era, which is the first group after the Golden Age of Hollywood, Hepburn was a much bigger star and much more sophisticated than anyone of her generation of actors - as big and sophisticated, in fact, as stars of the golden age. Therefore, she was always cast with equals. Can you see her costarring with Tab Hunter? No. Sabrina is a perfect role for her - gamine, sophisticated in her Givenchy gowns, wide-eyed with that amazing smile. Bogart wanted Bacall in this role - she was too worldly to play Sabrina.Originally the Bogart character was to be played by Cary Grant, which makes a little, if not a lot more sense. Holden's hair was dyed blond to give him a younger appearance. At 35, he is disarmingly handsome, very charming and quite funny. He and Bogart don't look much like brothers. A bigger problem, in my opinion, is that Hepburn and Bogart don't really click, as good as they both are in their roles, and they are great. When Wilder was asked about how difficult Bogart was, he shrugged it off. \"Didn't he make fun of your accent?\" the interviewer pressed. \"Oh, everyone did that,\" Wilder said. \"It doesn't matter. All was forgiven\" - and he made reference to Bogart's dreadful death from esophageal cancer.I know many will not agree, but the only downside of this film for me was the ending - without giving anything away, I just didn't buy it. However, it is highly recommended and a wonderful movie. You might not share my feelings about the ending, which will make it even more enjoyable.Wilder told a story about not having the script finished and asking Hepburn to stall for time in filming the office scene where she pretends to be holding a board of directors meeting. \"She would say she forgot a line...\" Wilder recalled. \"You see, what Marilyn did naturally, Audrey had to work at.\"",

            "content": "Sabrina, on the surface, is very much like a fairy-tale, but in that context Billy Wilder gets to play around a bit. Not so much that the material gets too dark- this isn't Sunset Blvd after all- but just enough so that you and I know who the devil made it. It's a story of a girl, dreamy-eyed Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn), a chauffeur's daughter, who has had a crush on one of the two brothers of a prestigious/wealthy family on Long Island all her life. But she is sent off to France to learn how to cook, and she returns as a strikingly beautiful woman to the brother David, who before saw her as just the chauffeur's daughter. But before he can toss away his (next) marriage on Sabrina- not to mention a merger of a plastics deal- the older, loner brother Linus who runs the company, wants to try and sway Sabrina from being with David... and in the process falls in love himself.There is the romance, and the comedy, but also a firm study of class. It's interesting that it's Sabrina's father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams) is even more opposed to her daughter dating a Larrabee than the patriarch Larabbee is. Why can't she just become a cook, he says, and be apart of that class? The patriarch has his concerns as well, but even Linus, after a momentary look at David thinking \"what are you doing dancing with Sabrina\" realizes David should be able to whatever he pleases - \"It's the 20th century after all\", he says. To which the father responds, \"Why, I could pick a century out of a hat, blindfolded, and come up with a better one.\" And yet for Wilder's commentary, via the original play and screenplay, he also serves up some classic Hollywood escapism. What woman wouldn't want to have a kind of story like Sabrina's where love is just so much in or out of reach as to be unattainable, but things always seem bright (that is unless one has to sail off to Paris all by your lonesome). And Wilder casts just perfectly well to suit the wonderful dialog; Hepburn makes this film, even more than her male co-leads, as an adorable figure, irrepressible but with some deeper subtext to her (watch her as she quietly contemplates her lot before her silly botched suicide letter/attempt in the garage). Bogart, despite criticism of being too old for the part, plays his notes of comedy, sincerity and uncertainly just right (I loved the scene on the sailboat where she asks about his past loves, and his response being classic Bogie). And despite his original misgivings with Wilder's sense of comedy, he rises to the occasion just as well as the naturally charming William Holden, who is given one of the longest but funniest ass-jokes in movie history.Sabrina isn't the stuff of super-academic or intellectual movie-going. It's a perfect example, however, of how to do a fluffy-but-serious romantic comedy right. Writers (err hacks) who are assigned the drek that is meant to pass as the rom-com genre today should take a look back at Sabrina to see what makes characters likable or just meaningful, what makes a story work in such a context, and what the right casting can do even when the material is 'light' in nature.",

Bushman, Walter Hampden, Marcel Hillaire, Joan Vohs, Marcel Dalio, Ellen Corby, David Ahdar, Marjorie Bennett, Colin Campbell, Charles Harvey, Nancy Kulp, Kay E. Kuter, Paul Harvey, Bill Neff, Emory Parnell, Marion Ross, Emmet Morgan, Kay Rieh....Director Billy Wilder.\"Once upon a time in the north shore of Long Island\".......Released in 1954, director Billy Wilder's \"Sabrina\" was a highly popular romantic comedy and yet another smash hit for actress Audrey Hepburn, who was still a new star in the Hollywood firmament, having won the Oscar for her debut film Roman Holiday\" in 1953, starring opposite Gregory Peck. She had been born in Belgium to a wealthy British banker and a Dutch baroness, survived the horror of siege and starvation in WWII. In the years following the wars, she delved into ballet and modeling. Before long, Hollywood became enamored of her. With her exotic voice, elfin charm and impossibly thin body, she was a different creature from the other Hollywood female stars of her day. Here she plays, Sabrina Fairchild, the daughter of a chauffeur to a wealthy family, the Larrybees, in Long Island, presumably in the early to mid 50's. She has always nurtured a secret crush on the spoiled and careless playboy David Larabee (played by William Holden who dyed his hair blonde for the role). To get over him and to learn a trade, her father sends her to a cooking school in Paris. There she meets an old Baron who teaches her to be sophisticated and worldly, in hopes she'll return to attract David. She returns to discover that David is engaged, although he is now drawn to the new Sabrina. Before long, David's uptight, workaholic businessman brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) also falls for Sabrina. The tide turns when Sabrina returns Linus' newly-sprung affection. The romantic comedy was quite modern in its theme of social climbing and going after what you want, making Audrey Hepburn a very modern heroine in the movies. But the touchy subject of class and social status, as well as liberal ideas such as going after what you want, is never drilled into the viewer's brain with sharp pain but is instead beautifully handled as a romantic comedy and leaves a good taste in your mouth. Audrey Hepburn, who would become a fashion icon, wears the gorgeous Oscar-winning costumes by Edith Head and her long time French designer Givenchy quite well, but her acting is always above reproach, making her more than simply a model in front of a movie camera. She was able to suffuse the otherwise bland role with enough wit and punch as to make her sympathetic. Veteran star Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca) is simply wonderful and in the latter scenes with Hepburn there is quite a lot of chemistry between them. This \"Cinderella\" type story is incredibly well-written, with an unabashed satirical commentary on the pretentious upper-class and the social class barriers, which was as much a problem in the 50's as it is today, believe it or not. Sabrina is far from being a gold digger, for she is capable of really loving both David and Linus and if she is going after what she wants, this is a modern trait that women at the time would applaud. Hepburn's charm and girlish spirit keeps her from appearing like some cold-hearted gold-digger. Rather than pulling a few tricks to get the rich man of her dreams, she merely blossoms into beauty and \"becomes who she really is\". As usual, she is paired with an older man, Bogart in this case, as she was to do in later films- with Fred Astaire in \"Funny Face\" ('57), with Cary Grant in \"Charade\" ('63), etc; this always done to emphasize Hepburn's youthful appearance. As in \"Funny Face\" and even \"My Fair Lady\" (64), Hepburn goes from plain, unattractive girl to beautiful woman in a classic ugly duckling/swan transformation. This film is greatly responsible for the inspiration of later films, such as Gary Marshall's 1990 movie \"Pretty Woman\". In 1995, a re-make of \"Sabrina\" was released, starring Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford, a beautiful if strangely diverse updated and modern tribute to this classic film. Original music by Frederick Hollander, providing the movie with romanticism and nice melodies, art direction by Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira and fine cinematography by Charles Lang. This is a great movie with lots of heart and a classic of 50's American cinema. Look for such interesting tidbits as Humphrey Bogart's \"Casablanca\" fedora hat, a mention of \"The Seven Year Itch\" which was a play at this time and would be director Billy Wilder's next film, a film which would make a greater star out of Marilyn Monroe and look for a small bit part played by Marion Ross (the mother in \"Happy Days\").",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn, Billy Wilder, Hubert de Givenchy, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Charles Lang. With names like that attached to a project, do you even need a movie? Fortunately we got one. A great one! Sabrina is a charming and moonlit romantic comedy from two masters of the genre. Billy Wilder and Audrey Hepburn. It's essentially a retelling of the classic Cinderella story. The girl who is poor but falls in love with a prince and is made over beautifully to get his attention. There's no wicked step-sisters in Sabrina and no-magical faerie God-mother, but who cares. Hepburn is Sabrina the daughter of a chauffeur to a rich family named the Larrabee's. The Larrabee patriarch has two sons played by Bogart and Holden. Bogart is the older and more business savvy brother. He is realistic and practical and regards the family's name and fortune with the utmost care and regard. This is contrary to Holden who is more of a careless playboy seeking fun and women in life. He's been married three times, always falling in love or at least confusing lust with love. Hepburn at the start of the film is desperately in love with Holden and watches him at a ball from up in the tree under the moonlight. To help her get over her crush she is sent to refining school in Paris where see learns how to cook, speak, and dress. Basically she becomes a lady. What emerges is a swan from the ugly duckling and for the first time Holden sees her and falls in love. However time has passed and Sabrina doesn't exactly feel the same way anymore. Plus Bogart expresses his own interest in the elfin' and glamorous chauffeur's daughter. Watching all this play out in such a romantic and funny way is pure cinema. All the elements come together in this film. Hepburn looks magnificent in Hubert de Givenchy's gowns and dresses. The scenes on the racquetball court are whimsical and absolutely priceless. Frederick Hollander's musical score is breathtaking and haunting, sending the audience far away from their problems and allowing them to become completely involved in the characters and story. Really to tell the truth there isn't much plot, but the story is good because it's so simple. Sabrina isn't a complicated movie at all, nor is it very in depth in exploring what true love is. But at the heart it's a faerie tale. It doesn't need to be realistic or profound. If you're looking for answers about the true nature of love and self-sacrifice then you won't find any in Sabrina. However if you're looking to be swept off your feet and taken to a far away place where naive, blind, and moonstruck romantic love are the rule then this is the movie for you.",

It may sound unoriginal, but there's a little darkness floating throughout Sabrina that makes it gripping. Not every love story starts with a suicide attempt. Nor does the girl become attracted to the more sensible, if less fun, of two brothers. Sabrina is a comedy that deals with social class, but not in a patronizing way. She isn't the poor little flower generously allowed into the family. She's a hardworking girl and the men realise how lucky they are. Bogart is slightly miscast (mostly due to his age), but the trio of him, Hepburn, and Holden is miraculous, despite rumors of offscreen tension. Holden is charming, and comes across as a lusty younger man, rather than the complete sleaze many could perceive him as. Bogart is logical, smart, with a slight cruel sense of humor. It amounts to a brotherly relationship full of love, but also a bit of rivalry and hate. The film works by removing any antagonist, and making love the antagonist itself. This means we are watching people wrestle for attention and admiration and, as the audience, we generally want people to make the right choices and be happy. Another great Hepburn classic.",

            "content": "Sabrina (1954)A sweet, lightly comic film with impeccable credentials, including director (and writer) Billy Wilder. Audrey Hepburn had become a sensational star the previous year with Roman Holiday and she is the charm and light of this one. There is a slight echo of the earlier movie, in reverse--she is now the poor girl who is mistaken (at times) for being cultured and rich, and throughout there are the slight, American versions of class structure being broken down. Mostly though, this is about a girl in love, but mostly in love with being in love, and it doesn't totally matter to whom. Certainly the one she thinks is so wonderful is not, though he's charming in the likable way that William Holden, probably a cad himself, is so good at. Playing his older brother in the film (forget family resemblance here) is Humphrey Bogart, a nice, somber guy completely caught up in being a successful businessman. And so there is a natural set up for conflicts and jealousies, and confusion. It's not quite a classic screwball comedy, though it's funny in a warm way all the way through. The seriousness that Hepburn brings to her role is less crazy and more charming and delightful. And romantic. We need her to be dreamy, and she comes through. Once the end approaches, we really don't care too much what happens as long as she is happy, and we are content enough it works out the way it does for the two brothers, with a small twist or two right up to the end. I do quaff slightly at Hepburn being even remotely interested in the Bogart character, so obviously three times her age and dull as a brick (he is no Rick here). I suppose it fits every older man's desire (in the audience) to think they might actually be attractive to someone so young and obviously pretty. This gets pulled off more convincingly in Hepburn's next major film, where Cary Grant did after all pull if off, Charade, if only because Cary Grant is Cary Grant. But I know, we are supposed to close our eyes to logic in nutty comedies, and the rest of the set-up manages to stay intact here on Long Island, 1954. Bogart certainly is a model of kindness and patience, and we can see a young woman wanting that in her man, whatever their ages. A highlight for me: Hepburn sings \"La Vie en Rose,\" the Piaf hit, while they drive in the car. Twice. Makes you want to go to Paris.Bogart was apparently such a nasty presence during the shooting (partly because he was a replacement for, yes, Cary Grant, who backed out), he later apologized to Wilder. And Hepburn's gowns (which are part of the plot as well as the usual necessity) are not by Edith Head (who won and accepted an Oscar for them) but by Givenchy, who continued a long association with Hepburn. The 1995 remake? Well, the plot line is intact, and you might prefer the new style of acting and filming, but for me this old one has just a perfect balance of love and lunacy, with great writing and a wonderful awkward central cast. I mean, a somber Bogart and zany Holden vying for the ever delicate and slightly clueless Audrey Hepburn? Who would have thought that would work? It does.",

It is to me a little disappointing Audrey Hepburn's acting here. I don't believe her acting coach really helped her have confidence in herself while on the screen. I'm sorry to Audrey Hepburn fans that love this film, but it's not an attack. It's not my favorite film and this is my honest review from my perspective",

            "content": "I have to say, this romantic movie is indeed, a classic from the Golden Age of Hollywood. It was made from one of the best directors of all-time, Billy Wilder. Based on the play, Sabrina Fair; Sabrina tells the story of Sabrina Fairchild (Aubrey Hepburn), a very shy young woman, who lives with her father, Thomas (John Williams). Thomas works for the Larrabee Brothers, David (William Holden) and Linus (Humphrey Bogart) as their live-in chauffeur. Things become very complex, for Sabrina when David fall head over heels for her, after she spent a year, at a Paris cooking school and returns home, transform, into a glamorous classy socialite. Fearing that David, will ruin their company with his cheating and womanizing ways; businessman Linus, starts to take steps in wooing the young woman, in an attempt to prevent David from destroying an oncoming company merger, and his own marriage. Can Linus, stop David from falling in love, or will Linus end up, falling in love with Sabrina, himself? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I have to say, that I was never a huge fan of love triangle films. I always found them, a bit mean-spirited and wishy washy. The plot isn't that strong, when you think about it. It's kinda weak. First off, it takes forever, for the plot to get going. We have to wait, a long time for Sabrina to get back from Paris. I was really, hoping for a quicker pace. The film drags on, a little too much. Second off, the plot is very shallow. It's really hard to believe, that Sabrina wouldn't get notice. I know, it's based on 1950s standards, but she's way too gorgeous, even in the beginning. I really doubt, she had anything really bad about her, that she would try to commit suicide. Honestly, with the pony-tail, and plain clothes in the beginning. She looks a very attractive normal young woman. She's look like, a girl that I would, have love to date at the time. She's way too beautiful. After all, it's Aubrey Hepburn for goodness sakes. This film has that, shallow, 1999's She's All that, unbelievable in attractive. I really doubt, people were that, thin-headed, back then. Films like this, really lacks in storytelling, because of the weak conflict. They isn't as much drama for the script to work with. After all, they still, pretty damn rich, no matter, what the outcome, is. I really hate, how often ignorance, the 1% are, in this film. It's telling the lower social classes to act rich to get notice. Wow-really wow. How- snobby. I was never a huge fan of 1950/1960's glamour type movies, because I felt that they allow the fashion to be a bit overbearing. It was a bit much in the second half of the film. The glamour really went overboard. I really doubt, going to Paris for cooking school, would make you into a fashion model. I really hatred, what Sabrina has become. She rarely show, any of her cooking skills. In my opinion, the whole idea of her, going to Paris, was just there to push, the fashion onto the masses. The costume designs in this film are more famous, than the story. A lot of people, will probably, remember the dress, Aubrey Hepburn wore in this film, than anything else. I hardly remember, anything else. Don't get me wrong, the costumes are great, but I would have, love for the writing and humor to out shine the look of the film, more. The writing was kinda lacking. One thing, the movie could have, done better, is if the filmmakers allow the film to be filmed in color footage, than black and white. It kinda hurts, the look of the film. Despite, the positive themes that the movie is sending out, everything in this film, looks so gloomy with the black and white footage. There wasn't any good reason for this film, not to be in color. It's not a film noir, after all. It's supposed to be a Cinderella story, so it needs to be in color! This film was Audrey Hepburn's second film, meant to capitalize on her rising popularity from her Academy Award Best Actress win from the 1953's film, Roman Holiday. Audrey Hepburn does her best, despite being typecast, yet again as another socialite. The acting from her is very top-notch, here. She's very cute, and really shines when she has to. I don't really think she deserve to nominate for Best Actress for this film, but I'm just glad, they didn't play her, as an obnoxious gold-digger-like character like she would later play in other films. The supporting cast is pretty good. William Holden looks and acts like a believable playboy. During production of the film, Hepburn and Holden entered into a brief, but passionate and much-publicized love affair. Meanwhile, Bogart complained that Hepburn required too many takes to get her dialogue right and pointed out her inexperience. Bogart at this time, was very irritable, frail and insecure with himself as romantic lead. He really didn't want to do, it. He only took the role, when first choice, Cary Grant drop out. He didn't get along with anybody, during this film. He thought Aubrey Hepburn was a spoiled brat. He and William Holden couldn't stand each other. He was very ill, and would die, a few years later this film, from throat cancer. Despite that, Humphrey Bogart is great, as the stern, business-driven, older brother. The May-December Romance didn't bug me, as it could had. He wasn't miscast. The music is pretty good from Friedrich Hollaender. I love the use of La Vie en rose. It's match, so well with the film theme. In 1995, the film was remade with Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, and Greg Kinnear in the respective roles. It's not that good. Overall: While, the movie has some faults. It's still a great watch. A must watch for any movie lover.",

He always shows a particular sense of humor, that is clever and unique. The dialogue in this movie is unmistakably his. It's witty and sharp but it stays mundane enough, it makes you really believe these characters could speak this way, when of course nobody speaks in such an elegantly funny manner.I like these actors individually, and the movie gives them enough good lines and shows them in a beautiful glamour setting and fine clothes, it's enjoyable to watch. Woody Allen once theorized the concept of the Champagne Comedy, as these mid-century Golden Age films where handsome characters elegantly dressed spent their days at parties during the day having romantic intrigues. This movie matches that description perfectly. It's a celebration of ostentation.So what really is the problem? Well it's the movie is incredibly sexist and cynical. The whole movie tells the story of a rich middle-aged businessman, who manipulates one of his (lowest) employee's daughter into sleeping with him. And if it weren't enough, it justifies it by citing a pecuniary imperative; he has to seduce her in order to free his bachelor brother to be able to marry a business partner's heiress, so that their business venture is also a family alliance... What is this?? The Middle Ages?From the beginning the movie puts itself in an impossible ethical corner, from which it never exits. The plot follows Hepburn, who is a na\u00efve young girl and is hopelessly in love with the charming Bill Holden. One early problem is that there is no real reason why one would love Holden's character, he has no discernable qualities, he is a vapid womanizing playboy. But ok, the ugly little duckling becomes a swan and Hepburn and Holden become an item.I was already rejecting the movie's worldview on courtship and romance hard, but whatever, they're spending their time drinking bubbles and wearing evening gowns. But then the worst scene in the history of cinema happens, middle-aged Bogart and his elderly father devise a scheme to trick the girl away from Holden, because of : something, whatever, dollars...It is astounding. It is the type of stuff you will find in bad novels written by self-published incels. Here, it is in a big-budget star-studded big Hollywood movie. I totally lost any respect I had for Wilder. For me this movie could have been done by Woody Allen or Harvey Weinstein. Same difference.That being said, I still liked the aesthetics of the movie. And I would have liked it even more if it had just told a romance without the hush-hush schemes and the corporate subplot and the undertones of labor exploitation. As such the movie does not fail outright; it fails because our culture and values have evolved in a place where this is not acceptable anymore.",

I also enjoyed Humphrey Bogart as the successful brother who likes firing guns at plastic. I'm not big on Bogey, but this role really sold him to me. William Holden is normal here. While he has great potential as an actor, he has some films where he just blends in as an everyman. This is one of those.There should be some controversy over Bogart (roughly 55) kissing Hepburn (roughly 25) -- what's the age difference? Thirty years!

She has always been infatuated with handsome younger son David (Holden), a playboy and heart breaker if there ever was one. But he simply does not care for he nor notice her, and poor Sabrina has to watch on from a tree as he romances pretty ladies at a family party. Unhappy with her present state, she locks herself in the garage and turns on all the car engines, hoping the fumes will engulf her. Good old reliable Linus (Bogart), the elder brother to David, finds her in the nick of time, and saves her from what could have been a very nasty fate. After all, Sabrina is off to Paris soon.In Paris she enjoys herself and meets a wealthy old Count who is only too happy to escort her to balls and buy her pretty things. She returns from Paris the epitome of glamorous perfection- just like the Audrey Hepburn we are used to. She's beautiful and sophisticated, and David does recognize her at first. Of course, she still wants David, and suddenly his blinders have been taken off and he starts to fall for her. A big problem crops up when Sabrina beings to fall in love with the sensible, less exciting yet kind Linus. Linus has feelings for her too, so what we have is a very intriguing brother-girl-brother love triangle! Hepburn is luminous as Sabrina, this may well be the film in which she looks her most beautiful. Her costumes by Givenchy are STUNNING, and Hepburn also proves her unique quality as an actress, turning in a very good performance. The early winsomeness and charm is there in droves, and everyone who sees this will very likely fall in love with her, just like the Larrabee brothers.Holden and Bogart are good in their roles, with many viewers having a query with the significant age gap between Bogart and Hepburn. Yes, he is a lot older than her, but Bogart's control and skill as an actor make this seem less so. By embodying his character as a busy man who has not found the time to fall in love or the right girl who understands him to fall in love with, Bogart oversteps the trap of playing just a simple 'old guy looking for a young pretty girl to wait on him'. Bogart didn't like himself in the role, or the film, but many fans sure did and still do! Wilder's direction and script also contribute to making this film a classic. Beautiful, enchanting and romantic, 'Sabrina' is a wonderful film. I can't use enough superlatives to describe it, unfortunately.9/10.",

I liked the vibe of the movie the romantic tensions, fun etc. But there was too much lacking and too much not making sense. She was in love with Holden her entire life, and then Humphrey was able to on a whim make her forget Holden and fall in love with him. And, there was no great chemistry between them as it happened. He really was too old for the role and not only too old but just not good for it. It just didn't make much sense to me. There should be some romantic deep moments or something to justify such a story. And the ending also, wasn't believable. Great classic actors miscast. Miscast big time! They didn't jell together. Still Aubrey was good. Actually it was Humphrey, who was the weak link in this movie in my opinion. Still it was slightly enjoyable to watch.

So one night when she realizes David might never be hers, she tries to commit suicide. Linus walks in on her in the garage after it makes a lot of noise. She lies about what she was doing there and Linus takes her home. She reluctantly agrees to go to a cooking school in Paris like her father wants. As it turns out, she learns a lot there, and when she comes back she's a changed person (at least in terms of hairstyle and clothing). Once he realizes it's her, David becomes smitten! But shacking up with a chauffeur's daughter spells bad business for the sugar production, and so Linus steps into the picture and tries to make Sabrina fall for him instead.Directed by the talented Billy Wilder, what we have here is an elegantly put together, stylish romantic comedy. And as tired as a love triangle might sound, Wilder makes sure to never make any of the two men pining for Sabrina's attention unlikable. William Holden fills up the screen with his charismatic, wide smile and makes his character an amiable, if very clumsy seducter. He doesn't get as much screentime as the other two stars, but is very good as David Larabee, with a fair share of humorous moments, the highlight being when he sits on champagne glasses hidden in his back pocket and has to get shards off glass removed from his ass. It's made even better by him later trying to get up from a hammock and falling down. Humphrey Bogart gives a very memorable performance, who with just a small, but noticable change of tone in his voice shows he means business in one minute and the next one that he's out for love. His internal conflict over romance versus making money is a driving force throughout. He doesn't realize the problem with trying to steal someone's girl as a mere diversion can result in him really falling in love with her if she's charming enough. Thanks to Wilder's and Ernest Lehmann's script successfully balancing the thin line of a man harboring devious intentions yet also genuinely caring for someone, Linus never turns into a villain. Linus has only known business all his life, falling in love with a woman is something new entirely, that he was never prepared for.When Sabrina does find out he was using her in order to kickstart his company's sugar deal, you can tell he feels a great deal of remorse and regret, even in the moment he's telling her he was about to ship her off to Paris without him. When the ending arrives where Linus changes his mind and goes with her on the trip, your heart feels fulfilled.Audrey Hepburn as the title character lights up the screen with her childlike affectionate eyes, and has a look you never forget.Similiarly to how David and Linus are portrayed, Sabrina is handled with great care throughout. I disagree with one reviewer calling Sabrina a brat. Rather, I see her as the hopeless romantic, who as her father quotes, is \"reaching for the moon\". Many of us have been there at one point or another. The only way she'd come off as a brat is if she was played by Paris Hilton.One criticism I do have is that it was never really explained why David later has so little time for Sabrina. At first he had to heal, but after he had healed, what was the problem? You'd think he would want to spend more time with the woman he really loves. Thankfully this is made up for with the sinewy chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart.Sabrina is one of the all-time great sweet romantic comedies, which never oversteps in sentimentality and treats all its characters with intelligence and respect. It's so damned pleasant that you can't get enough of it.",

            "content": "The scenario is set up whereby a well to do Long Island Family, with all the social register trappings of success and prominence, wind up purporting their New York societal clout through lavish parties! These parties exude a facade of pecuniary omnipotence from the benevolent aristocracy, via the Larabee family. Amidst all the accoutrement of the wealthy Larabee household, are a chauffeur and his daughter who live above the garage of this domicile which houses eight beautiful cars. Now what? The daughter (Audrey Hepburn) develops a precocious crush on one of the Larabees, David (William Holden). All of this is very natural for a susceptible, barely out of adolescence, emotionally distraught female. She is fixated on a young, good looking, devil may care bachelor of a plutocratic offspring. The initial dilemma for Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is that David does not really even notice her, however, after she spends two years in Paris, she returns, and, David becomes seriously intrigued with the woman, Sabrina, as opposed to the girl, Sabrina, he knew a couple of years back, whom he never paid attention to. Therefore, Sabrina's love interest of idealism with David has resonated to fruition, thus making Sabrina's childhood heart throb,her potentially significant other.. \"Isn't it Romantic?\" (Just like the song which was ubiquitously playing throughout the film). So, what's the glitch to this entire panacea? Meet the brother.. Linus,(Humphrey Bogart), and now, for Sabrina, it becomes a proverbial instance of choosing between impetuous passion vs debenture bonds. At first, the fiscally responsible brother, who is running the Larabee empire, Linus Larabee, (Humphrey Bogart) escorts Sabrina around, only in a perfunctory capacity as a result of David's hapless absence. Invariably, a relationship manifests itself between Linus and Sabrina, (Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart), however, it does not involve hanky-panky, it merely entails a largess of candid conversation: The gist of these conversations being along the line of \" You saved me from being ravaged by carbon monoxide\": \"All I can think about is the plastics' merger\": \"I can make a souffl\u00e9 out of oyster crackers\": \"What's French for where's my sister's yellow pencil?\": \"Paris is the city for lovers, that's why I spent only 35 minutes there\"; and finally, \"If you caught in the rain in Paris, leave your hat and umbrella at home\". Sabrina is afflicted by an impressionable infatuation, for David, and for Paris, however, the acutely insightful reality pertaining to the relationship she has with Linus, (Humphrey Bogart) ultimately puts infatuation in its proper perspective. Romance games lose out to the auspicious necessity of cultivating a simple human understanding of one another. Such a characteristic is an indelible element in human behavior which establishes the ultimate foundation for true love! This film, \"Sabrina\", contains a wealth of talent both on and off the screen. It stars: Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, and Wiliam Holden. Writers and directors are listed as follows: Samuel Taylor (Writer of the stage play, \"Sabrina\") Ernest Lehman (Known for works such as; \"North By Northwest\", \"The Sweet Smell of Success\" and \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\") and last ,and most importantly: Billy Wilder (Known for a bevy of classics, including \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"Double Indemnity\"). This film is a fabulously witty romantic comedy! The remake with Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear was testament to the fact that \"Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery\". When it comes to the precarious remora of relationships, many encompassing aspects include; money, intense lovemaking, and dangerously idealistic cavorting.. \"Isn't it Romantic?\", Yet, when it comes to truly being in love: \"Isn't it Utterly Human?\". I give this film: Five Stars- An absolutely, emphatically, perfect ten flick!",

            "content": "You have to be something of a romantic to fully appreciate this remarkable film. It helps a lot to be enchanted with Audrey Hepburn, as most of us are. Her performance as the daughter of a chauffeur who gets to choose between two very rich brothers, David and Linus Larrabee (William Holden and Humphrey Bogart), is subtle, slightly mysterious and delightful. Much of the enchantment of her character is based on things implied rather than things said or acted out. We know that her metamorphosis in Paris is guided by the 74-year-old Baron St. Fontanel (Marcel Dalio), whom she meets at cooking school. We can discern that she learned more than how to crack an egg. The transformation of her heart from one brother to the other is revealed primarily in her facial expressions as she measures kisses and the sharp stab of pleasure in the center of her soul. We are kept in limbo about whom she chooses until the very end.This is a girl's fantasy for grown-ups, and one of the best of its kind. The script, from the play by Samuel A. Taylor, is well-paced and psychologically true in a way that is not immediately obvious. The dialogue, while clearly dated and somewhat pedestrian at times, nonetheless stands up well. The sets are large, very large (director Billy Wilder loved to give us a sense of the vastness of the American corporate empire at mid-century): the Larrabee offices, the garage where Sabrina starts all the cars (I think her father, sleeping overhead really would have awaken instead of just tossing and turning), the family estate with its indoor and outdoor pools and courts. There's some pleasant diversion with old man Larrabee (Walter Hampden) and his huge cigars and olives. (The way Bogie is able to smash the little jar, swoop up the olive and land it in the mouth of the old guy in quick motion was a nice trick that surely wowed them on the set. Did Bogie cut his hand or Hampden swallow some glass?) The servants as Sabrina's cheering section and her father (John Williams) with his very correct class prejudices divert us as well.As for \"old stone face\" Bogart being miscast, I don't necessarily agree, but certainly Cary Grant would have been a better match for Miss Hepburn, as we would see in Charade (1963). William Holden, on the other hand (in blond coiffeur), seemed completely at ease in a comedic role. Nonetheless, the cynical edge that lent depth to his character in, e.g., Sunset Boulevard and Stalag 17, was entirely absent here. I think a scene in which he sardonically justifies his playboy ways might have fleshed him out more.As for Miss Hepburn, she was entirely involved, subtle, driven, nearly flawless, warm and winning. She is especially gorgeous in black and white. Bogart didn't particularly care for her, I understand, complaining about the many takes in her scenes with him. But she was nearly an ingenue, in her second important film, and he was, in his fifties, the veteran of many, many movies. Somehow they both overcame the lack of chemistry, and in a way, made their relationship \"sensible\" rather than heated. I think Wilder didn't mind this because he was aiming at something deeper than \"happily ever after.\"Of course Wilder employs a voice-over, a kind of Wilder signature, almost a joke, because as usual the device is abandoned before long. However it did allow us to hear Hepburn begin the film with the magical words, \"Once upon a time...\" as she describes the fairyland of her childhood, the Larrabee estate.She this for Audrey Hepburn, who occasionally played a teenager in film, but was never one.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "\"Sabrina\" is one of the last films of Humphrey Bogart and one of the early films of Audrey Hepburn. Despite the 30 years difference in their ages (54 and 24), their match in this film works mainly because the plot doesn't have them as star-struck lovers. It doesn't even have them as a match, but as almost distant acquaintances until toward the end. The \"romance\" works as a gradual mature respect and attraction on her part, and letting down one's barriers against a personal life on his part. The film is billed as a comedy, romance and drama. Those who watch this film mostly for the romance may miss something in the drama. For, \"Sabrina\" clearly is a film about classes, and the very distinct boundaries, especially between employers and servants. And, it shows this as a cultural separation deemed an absolute must amidst the professional servants class as well as among the employers. Sabrina's father, Thomas the chauffeur (played superbly by John Williams), epitomizes this. However, the attention to such class separation is treated here lightly and with some humor. Oddly enough, though, children of servants are regarded somewhat differently among the employers. Although the parents would have them follow in their footsteps, to the employers they are in a sort of free state of their own. At least, that's how it appears in this film. There likely has been so little else paid to such situations \u2013 professional servants with families (mostly old European and early American), because so few marry and even fewer have children. The culture being what it is, this film has some nice scenes of the social life of the super wealthy. And of the spoiled children of the wealthy in the playboy David Larrabee (William Holden), and the straight- laced all business caretaker of the family name and fortune, Linus Larrabee, played by Bogart. Hepburn's Sabrina \u2013 at least 10 years junior in the film to Holden's character, grows up pining for the handsome, fun- loving, partying David. Her's is a clear example of puppy love, infatuation or a crush. Only when she is sent away to study in Paris (top chef's school to be a cook as was her mother) for two years, does she grow into young womanhood, develop some refinements and become molded to be influenced by maturity and emotions beyond puppy love. But, she still thinks she loves and wants David, and it will take some time for her to change in her ways. Most of the comedy and the drama is in the plot from there on. All of the characters are very good. For the little time he is on screen, Walter Hampden is very funny as Oliver, the retired patriarch of the Larrabee clan. Here are some lines of humor from the dialog. Linus, \"You make it sound so vulgar, David, as if the son of the hot dog dynasty were being offered in marriage to the daughter of the mustard king.\"David, \"Just one thing you overlooked. I haven't proposed and she hasn't accepted.\" Linus, \"Oh, don't worry. I proposed and Mr. Tyson accepted.\" David, \"Did you kiss him?\"David, \"Oh, you make me feel like a heel. If I don't marry Elizabeth, some kid's going to be running around Puerto Rico barefoot with cavities in his teeth.\"Thomas, \"Democracy can be a wickedly unfair thing, Sabrina. Nobody poor was ever called democratic for marrying somebody rich.\"Oliver, \"All columnists should be beaten to a pulp and converted back to paper.\"",

Never mind, it is so well written that we can enjoy because all three are very well done.

Audrey Hepburn plays their chauffer's daughter, Sabrina, who is in love with Holden. He doesn't even know she exists.

Unfortunately, she's threatening a major corporate deal with Holden's new fianc\u00e9e's father. Bogart steps in and tries to seduce Hepburn away from his brother, for reasons of business only. Who would guess that he falls for her as well? Well, anyone who's ever seen a romantic comedy, I suppose, but the film's lack of surprises is no major fault. Hepburn could carry the movie by herself without a problem. Bogart and Holden are good, but I for one never looked at them, except to be slightly disgusted at Bogart's romantic leanings towards a 20-something gal (what happened, did Bacall get too old for the guy?). Hell, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear were as good in the 1990s remake (which I saw when it first came out). Sabrina also benefits from some truly skillful direction from Wilder. I am not a Wilder fan, in particular. I do recognize his talents, but, as far as I've always thought, he was a talented mortal working amongst the classic Hollywood deities, the directors and stars of that era. Sabrina increases my opinion of him, both as a director and as a writer. The film has some unusually extended sequences. For example, the first time Bogart tries to get Sabrina from his brother's charismatic grasp, when he meets her on the indoor tennis court. The audience understands exactly what's happening plotwise within ten seconds. But the scene is protracted beyond our expectations. When Bogie kisses Hepburn, we sit there watching her slow reaction.

The flip side of\nthat depth was a strange tension between emotionless business and an adult on speed. It's like a charade of opulence,\ncharacters, and the appearance of \"love.\" No. This is not any moving love story ... not close.We need three (legs) to make good film:\n1. Good story\n2. Good acting\n3. Good directingThe story is the problem with this film.Compare this to another Hepburn film - \"Roman Holiday.\" You could argue (I would) that Peck was a more romantic male\nlead to Hepburn than either Bogart or Holden. But that story was far, far more interesting, twisting and provided a wonderful\nbalance of both romance and fun. On top of that, the director (Wyler) shot in BW when he didn't have to so as to de-emphasize\nthe beautiful setting of Rome, Italy for the relationship. Bold and successful move.This film (Sabrina) just feels like drivel.ACTING:\nThe acting is fine, but there are casting problems here:\nHolden was in love with himself, and the film aptly conveys that fact. Bogart on the other hand had broader skills, but beingromantic was not one of them. I would have reversed the actor's roles here.As much as Hepburn was well cast in \"Roman Holiday,\" she's simply too stiff for this. Childlike, but not enough emotional range.Grace Kelly would have been a better pick.TEMPO:\nOKCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nOK, but awfully dark and unimaginativeDIRECTING / WRITING:\nI really enjoy some of Wilder's work. But when you write, produce, and direct a film it often spells \"miss,\" and that's the case here.He was a far more prolific writer than director and sometimes he produced good film juggling these roles, but not here. The other writers\nhad some powerful hits, e.g. \"Vertigo,\" but some big misses, e.g. \"Somebody up there likes me.\" So I'm not sure why this film seemed so\nlacking and empty to me. Dunno.Is it a good film? OK, but flatShould you watch this once? Maybe, but watch \"Roman Holiday\" instead if you canRating 6.0.",

Hepburn looks absolutely breathtaking. I even rewound the DVD to catch a glimpse of her in her shorts. And those stems of hers, whoooieee! Just a little eye candy for 1954. Anyhow, Linus Larrabee (Bogart) courts Sabrina in an effort to distract her from David. He eventually succeeds. The reason was to prevent the wealthy Larrabee family from a scandal of getting hitched with their chauffeur's daughter. However, Linus finds himself falling in love with Sabrina, but tries desperately to hide it. Bogart is good as the dour and business-like brother. He even has some cool delivery with dry humored one-liners. Hepburn is absolutely luminous and doesn't miss a beat. Holden is good at times, although I wish they could have cast someone else.

For this Cinderella Rockefella (for Rockefeller, read Larrabee) yarn to work you really have to accept that Audrey Hepburn's mercurial title character can fall for Humphrey Bogart's staid, aged captain-of-industry Linus Larrabee after for years holding a crush on Linus's younger, better-looking and certainly more flamboyant brother, the feckless David, played by William Holden. I'm aware that in real life, Bogart managed just that with his much younger, glamorous wife Lauren Bacall, but set up here in juxtaposition with the dashingly handsome Holden, it just doesn't come off.We first see Sabrina as the beggar-at-the-feast onlooker at a high society garden party at the Larrabee mansion where her father is the family chauffeur. Unnoticed by both Larrabee brothers in quick succession, it's David for whom she carries a torch and for whom she clumsily attempts suicide only to be rescued by Linus (thinks:- did her dad ever get her suicide note?). She's soon packed off to Paris to forget David, where she learns about fashion and cooking but not how to forget David, as becomes clear when he unwittingly and coincidentally picks up her damsel-in-mild-distress from the train station on her return, somehow without recognizing her. When he discovers her true identity he promptly rebels against his strategically-arranged marriage to the adoring daughter of a rival business magnate as organized by the conniving, eye-for-a-dollar Linus. Egged on by their snobbish father, Linus takes a more personal hand in separating the would-be lovers, taking advantage of an accident to David's derri\u00e8re to dupe the unsuspecting Sabrina and eventually return her to Paris, but on her own, suitably compensated for her trouble.It's all beautifully shot, with wonderfully rich interior sets which positively drip wealth and status both at home and in the executive office suite which feature prominently in the location shots but I found I didn't care much for the lifestyles of these blue-chip New Yorkers. Bogart looks pretty underwhelmed throughout and his non-screen chemistry with Hepburn (I don't think they even kiss in the whole movie) apparently reflected their frosty off-screen relations. Hepburn, at this early stage in her career is as lovely and lively as you'd expect while Holden as the flash Harry of the piece seems underused, especially considering his co-top-billing status.It's a decent enough movie but you sense watching it that Wilder was coasting, possibly slightly seduced by the trappings of luxury and success he's filming, in that sense reminding me somewhat of Hitchcock's French Riviera jaunt at around the same time for \"To Catch A Thief\".Even if the film never gets out of third gear, a ride in any Wilder car is never less than comfortable although this time I wish he'd taken me to a slightly more interesting place and with slightly better company.",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn is exquisite in this film, and coming just a year after 'Roman Holiday,' the two would make quite a double feature. Early on in this role of a chauffer's daughter she somehow manages to look beautiful and yet like an outsider; elegant and yet like a commoner. The film has several wonderfully quiet moments when she's pensive, in one case brooding before a suicide attempt, and in another, writing home from Paris at her completion of culinary school. The scene where she waits on the tennis court at night, swaying and dancing a few ballet steps ever so gracefully, is gold. She conveys such range with her eyes, from being disconsolate to being flirty and playful, and her screen presence is amazing. We feel for her when she pines for one of the rich sons of the family her father works for, and are dazzled by her when she transforms herself into stylish sophistication.Unfortunately the film gets a little muddled in the relationships between the rich brothers (Humphrey Bogart and William Holden) and this young lady, as well as the 'big business deal' that's predicated on the younger one's marriage to the merger partner's daughter. The concept of the story is straightforward, but the way the film goes about it felt a little odd at times. Also, it's hard to believe there is love between Bogart and Hepburn's characters, and it's not just because of their ages (he's 55 and she's 25). The script just doesn't support it, and there is only the faintest glimmer of a spark between the two, and even then it seems to register more friendship. I love Bogart and I love him in this role, however, he just doesn't transform the character enough as the film plays out. At the end, I'm not sure we really feel good about that rather tepid hug on the boat. It just felt a bit weird, really.There are lots of little things in the film director Billy Wilder uses to inject humor, like the antics of the father character who sneaks cigars, and 'innocent' lines like 'what rhymes with glass?' after Holden's character's gotten 23 stitches in his hindquarters. We see Bogart's character obsess over a plastic technology based on sugarcane, which is pretty impressive when a bunch of people bounce up and down on it. The other servants provide a supporting cast who pull for young Sabrina, and it's always great to see the venerable John Williams, who plays her father. There's a lot of production value here, but honestly I wish Wilder had forgone some of this as well as some of the plot machinations, and just given us more time with Hepburn on the screen, and swept up more into a romance with Bogart. All in all though, she makes this film, and it's still a good one after repeat viewings.",

At this point the film turns into a traditional fairy tale, Sabrina escaping class barriers and marrying Bogart. Pauper and prince then live happily ever after.Some have complained that \"Sabrina's\" male love interests are too old, but the \"dirty old man\" aspect of Wilder's plot merely amplifies how tawdry the whole picture is. In keeping with the film's politics, Sabrina's working class father is painted as a self-hating man who begrudgingly accepts that any and everyone can transcend class boundaries (if you're young, hot and can afford finishing school!) and the film contains a speech in which Bogart basically advocates supply-side, \"trickle down economics\". That a speech like this would appear in a 1950s film is very surprising.5/10 - Ignoring its despicable message, \"Sabrina\" is wonderfully lit and Hepburn is somewhat enchanting. Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "If anything, the opening voice-over and the following exposition, warn us that \"Sabrina\" is of pure 'fairy tale' material, borrowing its plot elements from both the myth of Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling.And as a Cinderella-figure, Audrey Hepburn, in her second feature-film, illuminates the screen with her genuine gamine charm, walking barefoot as if she truly waited for the Charming Prince carrying the lost shoe. She's less convincing as an Ugly Duckling though, but if Audrey Hepburn is supposed to be 'physically forgettable', and transform into a glamorous woman in one change of haircut and wardrobe, but since it's a fairy tale comedy, so let's just accept that Sabrina starts as an average adolescent to better emphasize her status as an underdog heroine.Sabrina lives in the Larrabees' mansion in Long Island, as the chauffeur's daughter. In other words, she doesn't belong to that world, but is close enough to dream about being one of these attractive and classy rich girls, just because it's the only way to catch the eye, then the heart of David Larrabee, whose idleness and three consecutive marriages never discouraged her. Why not? William Holden, as a rich and handsome playboy, is the perfect 50's version of the Charming Prince. Yet David doesn't care much for Sabrina, not until she comes back after two years of cooking-study in Paris, as an unrecognizably sophisticated lady.Again, we accept the idea that David wouldn't recognize the chauffeur's daughter, and the subsequent misunderstanding, if not hilarious, is amusing in a cute way. Sabrina finally won his heart, by becoming one of these women he always coveted, and we're supposed to cheer for that. As innocent a comedy as it is, the content gets incredibly shallow and superficial, but it's a credit to the casting of Hepburn, who's so hypnotically herself, that she gets away with it. Simply said, her gorgeous face and innocent expression make any negative thought impossible.Naturally, the on-going romance meets disapproval, starting with Sabrina's father, played by a caring and loving John Williams (the detective in \"Dial M for Murder\"), who wished Sabrina's trip in Paris would cure his daughter from her obsession named David, while Paris only helped her to see life in rose-colored glasses. The Larrabees are also concerned because Sabrina undermines their plan to marry David with the daughter of a powerful conglomerate President and make a highly profitable merger. This is where Linus, David's no non-sense and all-business brother, played by Humphrey Bogart, intervenes.To prevent his brother from the temptation of flying away with Sabrina, Linus spends time with her, planning on a short-term to send her alone to Paris. But the story deals with these relationships rather ambiguously, Davis is in love with Sabrina but never makes efforts to cancel the wedding and we're never sure about the sincerity of Linus' growing affection toward Sabrina. These considerations disappear the time of a magical moment when Audrey Hepburn sings \"La Vie en Rose\", a sweet and timelessly magical interlude that makes us forget the course of the story and gives the film its true reason-to-be.Now, when I watch a romantic comedy, I usually keep in mind the genre-defining pattern consisting on two people that everything opposes, and who end up together at the end. Being the obligatory principle borrowed from fairy tales, we judge a romance less from its predictable outcome than the way it gets to it. And because Linus was cynically about to break a fragile heart like the necessary egg to make the marriage's omelet possible, and because of the ambivalent attitude of David, I didn't know with whom Sabrina should have been to make a satisfying ending. What Sabrina saw in David I could understand, given how immature she was, but what she saw in Linus, I couldn't get either, given how grown-up she became.But this is not a flaw on the story, which is written by Billy Wilder with the usual amount of talent and wit, indispensable for a comedy no matter how unsubtle some situations can get. The film has its share of gags, corny lines, a comic-relief William Hampden as Larrabee's distracted patriarch and even Billy Holden plays his role in an over-the-top joviality as if he really enjoyed being that guy, and his enthusiasm was quite communicative. But there is something strange going between Hepburn and Bogart, precisely because they played their roles with sincerity and believability.Indeed, Sabrina was like a little flower who finally bloom under the sun of optimism and confidence and yet she was trapped in the middle of a business plot that tried not to buy her love, but to console her broken heart with it. And it's precisely because Bogie plays the role with his own dramatic note that I could believe his infatuation and the subsequent redemption. But right performances don't make believable chemistry just like good ingredient don't make a good recipe\u0085 and I'm sure the 'all in the wrist' French chief cook wouldn't contradict me.It's commonly known that Bogart took the last minute role turned down by Cary Grant, and I'm afraid to admit that Grant would have done a great job given how used he is to romantic comedies, and how similar he looks to Holden. Not that Bogart wasn't convincing, but he gave some gravity to his performance, totally contrasting with Holden's jollity, and it's not surprising that Hepburn fell in love with Holden during the shooting, screens don't lie, their chemistry was real.As much as I enjoy the film, I can only judge the romantic comedy from its ending, and on that level, no matter how prestigious the package Hepburn, Bogart, Holden and Wilder was, the conclusion was really telling about how awkward the relationship was: a hug, just a hug. Sabrina deserved more, and so did we, and maybe this is why I looked forward to watching the 1995' remake.",

Taylor's play named Sabrina Fair, Billy Wilder's Sabrina is a delicately crafted, elegantly narrated & fervently performed cinema that also marked Wilder's final collaboration with Paramount Pictures and isn't just one of the best romantic comedies of its time but remains one of Wilder's most celebrated & well-known works of his glorious career.The story of Sabrina concerns its titular character, Sabrina Fairchild; the daughter of a wealthy family's chauffeur who has been in love with one of her employer's sons all her life. The plot covers a love triangle between Sabrina, David; an oft-married playboy she's always been in love with & Linus; David's older brother who's always busy working & expanding the family business.Co-written & directed by Billy Wilder, the film carries the usual wit & charm that is often found in Wilder's films but this time the romance is also handled in a much warmer manner and overall, the famous writer-director has done a splendid job behind the camera, once again. The camera-work is smoothly carried out, editing is pretty concise, music is absolutely heartwarming & even the costume department manage to make its mark.Yet, what's the biggest strength about Sabrina that cemented its legacy in my opinion is its trio of stellar performances from Audrey Hepburn, William Holden & Humphrey Bogart. Hepburn beautifully captures the love Sabrina longs for, Holden feels incredibly natural in his playboy role & Bogart delivers one of his best performances in what's quite an offbeat role for him.On an overall scale, Sabrina may take a much familiar road with its premise, may offer a very predictable story & may not be the masterpiece I expected but it also resonates an irresistible warmth & comfort which, under Wilder's supervision & its trio's magical on-screen chemistry, has played a key role in keeping its legacy alive even after 60 long years.

            "content": "Delightfully romantic comedy about a modern cinderella - radiant Audrey Hepburn - here the daughter of a wealthy family's chauffeur who is in love with family youngest son David (Brilliant William Holden) a happy-go-lucky playboy. Film's best trump card is, obviously Audrey Hepburn as young, dreaming Sabrina. She is simply excellent in her part as the sweet, shy and romantic young girl, an ugly duckling who goes to Paris and returns as a beautiful swan, classy, stylish and refined but without loosing a bit of her gentleness and innocence.\nDavid brother's Linus was supposed to be played by Cary Grant, but he suddenly dropped out and was replaced by Humphrey Bogart. What a terrible miscast! Mr. Bogart does not only do not fit in the role (that is supposed to be serious and straight but tender inside businessman) but also gives a poor performance, disproviding Linus of any kind of personality trait that could make him sympathethic. He is unkind, too old (Cary Grant was too, but his debonnair looks and charm would have made him much more suitable) grumpy and bored so..why is Sabrina supposed to fall for him? Bogart considered Hepburn a bad actress and was all but kind to her and Holden -who shared a romance with her during filming. Bogart wanted her wife Lauren Bacall to play Sabrina role (certainly she would have been a much different Sabrina, more distant and icy) and as a result he appears to be cold and not very interested in giving his role a bit of life and tenderness. Linus' role needs a serious but also charming actor like Cary Grant or Gregory Peck. Bogart disliked both script and director and made Wilder rewrite his part; when he read it he asked the director if was her daughter who wrote it. They had several arguments and the fact that Wilder -that had already worked with Holden and befriended him- frequently shared a cocktail with both him and Hepburn leaving Bogart apart did not help. Upmost, the script was constantly being rewrited and that deeply disliked Bogart, who did not have his lines in advance. One day he did not receive the last script and got really angry with Lehman. Wilder stopped filming until Bogart apologyze to Lehman, which he ultimately did. Bogart also thought that the romance between Hepburn and Holden could eclipse him, as he mentions in his son's biography.\nBut apart of these problems the movie is a romantic comedy gem with witty dialogues and not a low moment: humour, good acting, luxurious settings -Larrabee's office is an excellent example of modern interiorism not to mention Larrabee's mansion sets and landscapes (belonging to different Paramount studios executives: the Long island mansion belonged to Paramount director Barney Balaban and the swimming pool belonged to CBS founder Bill Paley) and Hubert de Givenchy miss Hepburn's exhuberantly gorgeous fashions -the little black dress became an immediate success after the film premi\u00e8re. Special mention to Givenchy fashions appearing in the film: Hepburn asked Wilder to use real Parisian designs in the film. She wanted Balenciaga to desing her wardrobe but since he was too busy, he addressed her to his disciple Hubert de Givenchy, who though \"miss Hepburn\" was established actress Katharine Hepburn. Since the dressmaker did not have time to create a full wardrobe, so he asked Hepburn to choose several dresses for the film among the ones already available and modify them according to movie requirements. The grey suit -black color was discarded- Audrey is wearing at the station was chosen by Hepburn under Edith Head's (movie official official fashion designer) expert advise. White dress Sabrina is wearing at the Larrabee party is inspired on \"In\u00e9s de Castro\" dress made by Givenchy for the spring-summer 1953 season. It has a removable silk organza overskirt with navy blue flower embroidery. Third dress Audrey chose from Givenchy was later-to-be famous cocktail black satin dress whose neckline was modified by designer to conceal her clavicle and adding bowed straps. It became so popular it was named after her \"Sabrina neckline\". Its back v scoop was completed with a matching pair of black gloves and a small glittering hat. Since Givenchy did not appear in the credits, Edith Head claimed she was the one who designed all the fashions appearing in the movie. Years later, when miss Head (who won the Oscar as fashion desinger for this movie) had already died, Givenchy said he has designed miss Hepburn's post-Parisian ones.\nIt is well known that during filming Sabrina director Billy Wilder was constantly rewriting the script (even asked miss Hepburn to pretend a one day illness to have more time to do it. She pretended to have a headache and, since it was friday, Wilder had the whole weekend to re-write the scene). That, plus some script essential changes regarding Sabrina Fair original play by Samuel Taylor caused Taylor's quit from script co-writing and his replacement by Ernest Lehman. Sabrina fair play opened after the movie premiere and it was a box office failure. Taylor was also Hitchcock's Vertigo script co-writer.\nWilder decided Audrey's voice would be heard at the beginning of the film as narrator because he said this would put audience in good mood.\nAs a curiosity, Wilder asked William Holden not to jump so quick when jumping on the garden staircase but the actor did not manage to do it. Finally both laughted at it when they realized there was no way to change actor's weight and gravity. Also, when Linus takes Sabrina to the theatre the play they are goong to see is a blink to Wilder's next movie The seven year itch.\nAs in Audrey Hepburn's previous movie Roman Holiday, her naive charm and joie de vivre are the driving force that conferes the movie its powerful influx. But is the happy combination of a talented group of professionals (from director Billy Wilder to an extraordinary cast of secondary actors, designers and technicians) what made of it a complete success and an eternally young and gay movie.

This must be one of Billy Wilder's very best films, although he usually only made excellent ones, but in this one every single sequence is enjoyable, for the overwhelming charm of the innocence of Audrey Hepburn learning some lessons, the surprisingly good acting by Humphrey Bogart in a very different role from his usual ones and the dashing impertinence of William Holden - Billy Wilder gets the best out of all three. .Let's not forget John Williams as the concerned father. There is much of Ernst Lubitsch here, Billy Wilder's master, using his master's knowledge and way of things to eloquent advantage. Already in Audrey Hepburn's first film everything was perfect, but this is on exactly the same supreme level.",

            "content": "Directed by master filmmaker Billy Wilder, \"Sabrina\" is indeed a Cinderella story. The woman of lower economic status who seeks her Prince Charming is Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn), daughter of a chauffeur. The two brothers of wealth and social status are Linus and David Larrabee, played by Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, respectively.This is a romantic dramedy. It allows Miss Hepburn to use her unlimited beauty and appeal to charm both brothers convincingly. In the end, this is a fairytale, but it reveals, surprisingly, that each of the three has something to teach the other two.My main problem with the film is the casting of Bogart. It has to do with the age of the actor, though I can think of other actors his age who would have fit better. At the time of the film's release, Bogart was age 55 and had already made \"The African Queen\" and \"The Caine Mutiny\", both of which capitalized on his care-worn aspect. Audrey Hepburn was age 25, fresh-faced and between her youthful performances in \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Funny Face\". Note that those two films placed her opposite Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire. Astaire was the same age as Bogart, but easier to accept in the role of Audrey's romancer.William Holden, at the film's release, was age 36 and between starring roles in \"Executive Suite\" and \"The Country Girl\". Our impression of the attraction between Sabrina and younger brother David is informed by the real-life romance between Hepburn and Holden. Each was probably the other's love of a lifetime.Sabrina deals with heartache and comes into her own as a woman. The two brothers, who are very different from each other, struggle with their relationship and their roles in the family company.This is an enjoyable film, but I have always felt that it could have been one of Wilder's best if the casting had been different.",

            "content": "Sabrina is yet another one of those Audrey Hepburn films that personifies just how beloved she can be. She is the definition of everything you want in an actress. Beautiful, elegant, and she has all the charisma in the world. Sabrina is a film that she gets to showcase each of those things, and it works to perfection. Yes, the film is a twist on the Cinderella story, but I actually found it to be much more original than it appears to be.The film is actually pretty dark when you get down to it. It involves our main character attempting to commit suicide in the opening few minutes, and she nearly succeeds. The main love interest to Sabrina, Linus, also had once attempted suicide, so it's not your typical romantic love story. Sabrina is the daughter of a wealthy family's chauffeur and is head over heels in love with one of the family members. Of course, she is barely noticeable to the stuck up family and David never even cares to pay attention to her until she comes back from Paris in a beautiful dress with tons of make up and a new haircut. He comes on as a pretty unlikable character so it was hard to buy into that relationship, which is what the script intended for. It isn't until Bogart's character, Linus, shares his intimate past and they go on a fishing trip that I felt Sabrina fit in. Some people have a problem with Bogart's performance, but I thought it was brilliant. He was going through cancer at the time and had problems on set. But his performance is better than 95% of other actors out there in perfect conditions.What I think I love most about this film is that the ending and where our characters end up fits in with who they are. The whole film we are led to believe that our characters need to change who they are or just stay miserable in order to be most successful. But in reality, Sabrina and Linus deserved a new start and a new life. Paris was that for them. Back in the day, films had a tendency to present a clich\u00e9d ending that really only ended in happiness. This happy ending made sense to me and it never felt forced. Sabrina is an all time classic film, and definitely one of Wilder's best.+Hepburn's charisma +Intimate character moments +They deserve each other +An ending that makes sense, even if it's predictable +La Vie En Rose 9.6/10",

            "content": "#Sabrina (1954) :\nBrief Review -Same old Love Triangle but always fascinating... Sabrina is same old story where a Chauffeurs Daughter has a crush on Rich family's younger son but he never notices her. When she has a makeover the the guy starts gaining interest in her but like always there's a conflict that the guy's more serious and focused elder brother is more suitable for her. As expected the girl Sabrina realises that she really loves the elder one Linus while the younger David was just a childish crush. Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina look cute and innocent. Her performance is fine too. Humphrey Bogart as Linus and William Holden as David shows how matured actors they are. Writing of Sabrina is too simple but quickly connectable because more simple it is, more understandable it is. Screenplay has a few flaws where i felt film was looking dull. There are 2 or 3 scenes where the film doesn't look like making sense but that's ignorable as all passes by quickly. Billy Wilder delivered 3 Classics in a row (Sunset Boulevard, Ace In The Hole and Stalag 17) and then he thought of making this light hearted film which clearly shows how versatile director he was. Making Sabrina after 3 Universally Acclaimed classics was a big risk because you know this kind of simple film may not get high praise like those Classics but still somehow Sabrina lives upto its own standard, if not upto those classics. Billy Wilder doesn't disappoint anyway, but there was certainly a potential to turn this simple film into Classy piece of cinema. Especially the Climax because when all 3 people realise the True Love it's gotto something shattering scene to make them realise it rather than keeping it simple but Wilder didn't thought that way. Like i said this is a simple story but such simple Stories are always timeless because there will be audience for these light weighted films in every corner of the world and that's why Sabrina has been remade many times over the years. This same thing will never happen with those Universal Classics because they were something different and not simple & mainstream. Sabrina packs a solid combo of Simple Love Story, Good performances, Enjoyable moments, Nice direction and anytime watchable feature Film. Don't look at it as a Classic, just watch it without any burden and Sabrina will not disappoint you.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

I sickens me when I think of the actresses we have today and their off-screen antics, but that's another story. Ms. Hepburn gives a wonderful, believable performance as a chauffeur's daughter who goes to Paris and comes back a sophisticated young woman. I enjoyed many of her roles but I think this is my favorite because it is such a lovable and loving role. The storyline is not unique but wears well with age and makes you long for the romantic comedies of 1950s Hollywood.So why did I not give this almost perfect movie a 10? I just never could bond with Humphrey Bogart or his character in this movie. Maybe it was because Mr. Bogart was nearing the end of his life, but there seemed to be a lack of energy and a real sense he was in love with Sabrina or she with him. I heard Cary Grant was supposed to play this role, but I honestly don't know whether it would have made a difference to me - maybe it was just the age thing. James Mason does a better job with a May-December romance in \"Georgy Girl\" in my humble opinion. But then again, did it really have to be a May-December thing? The storyline really never played on the age difference in the first place. Why not have cast a couple male actors with a slight age difference a little older than Sabrina? They really didn't have to be a lot older than the heroine and it would have been more effective and more believable in my opinion.",

            "content": "When I watch this film, I'm a little sad that Humphrey Bogart spent so much of his career -- particularly in the 1930s -- on rather shallow thug roles. The forties were his heyday with a number of outstanding parts, and in the 1950s there were a few particularly impressive films -- \"The Caine Mutiny\" and \"The African Queen\"...both favorites of mine. But perhaps I enjoy Bogart even more in this film because he is cast against type -- it's a rather gentle, light comedy/drama role. And he is so very good here! I also tend to think that one of the reasons he fit so nicely in this role was that in his youth he was somewhat privileged, his family living in New York's fashionable Upper West Side, and summering at a 55 acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in New York State -- just 12 miles from my home town. This is one of a handful of films (including those previously mentioned, along with \"Casablanca\") that if not made with Bogart would have made his filmography weaker.But this film also belongs to Audrey Hepburn...one of her earliest major roles. And, she shines it it...particularly in terms of at the beginning of the film playing a girl who then grows up and becomes very sophisticated while in Paris. A wonderful, wonderful role...and I say that as not a particular fan of Hepburn.And then there's William Holden, who comes off third in this film, though he does so pleasantly. He's very likable here, although he had many other films that were much stronger for hi.The supporting cast is excellent, as well. Worth noting are character actors Walter Hampden and John Williams. They add much to the production.I rarely give an \"8\", but here I will. This is a gem, and it's definitely on my DVD shelf!",

She watches the elegant and lavish parties from afar and is head-over-heels in love with playboy David (William Holden). Attempting to commit suicide, the more business-minded brother of David, Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) intervenes and saves her. Her father decides to send her off to Paris on a cookery course where she arrives back re-invented, capturing the eye of David. Linus has set up the marriage between David and the daughter of a potential business partner, and so tries to sabotage their relationship while falling for Sabrina himself. And so begins a love triangle between two rich brothers and the girl they always ignored.This is a familiar fairytale story of an 'ugly duckling' who is given the chance to show who she really is to the people that have failed to recognise her previously. How this film manages to tackle it from a seemingly fresh perspective speaks volumes about the sheer genius of director Billy Wilder, who is undoubtedly one of the greatest film- makers from the Golden Age of Hollywood. It achieves in equal measures an air of magic and sweetness of which can only be found in the 'golden oldies', with three truly great comedic performances from the lead trio.Yes, it is wholly unbelievable that rich boys David and Linus would fail to recognise someone as astoundingly beautiful as Audrey Hepburn until she puts on some expensive earrings and a nice dress. But that is a minor quibble that one must expect from a romantic comedy. It is instead a film to sit back and enjoy. As strong as all three leads are, I felt this was Bogart's film. Most of my laughs came from his strange obsession with his company's newly designed plastic that he advertises to anyone who will listen. Having only seen him in hard-boiled noirs, it was nice to see him flexing his comedy muscles.In an age where production companies s**t out one soulless rom-com after the other that seem to serve no purpose other than to fill corporate pockets and earn some easy money for some B-list actor, it's reassuring to know that there was once a time when scriptwriters and directors alike would put genuine heart and talent onto screen and page, and create a romantic comedy that can be genuinely entertaining and truly heartfelt.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "With its cynical humor and the European-based sensibilities around different classes, this is most definitely a Billy Wilder picture. Truth be told, it is not quite in the same league as other Wilder classics like \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Some Like It Hot\" or \"The Apartment\", but on its own, it's an airy souffl\u00e9\u001a of a comedy served on a perfectly lovely warming dish. What I like most about this movie is that Wilder keeps the fairy tale trappings of the story grounded in mordant wit and shrewd observations about business mergers, bribery and class snobbery. This is what keeps this movie surprisingly fresh today and why I assume it was ripe for a remake by Sydney Pollack. But only Wilder is capable of making a suicide scene in an extra large multi-car garage slyly funny or a discussion about class differences between a chauffeur and his employer seem mutually patronizing.Torn between the characters played by her leading men, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Hepburn as a chauffeur's daughter is charming. This was her first introduction to Givenchy fashion on screen, and the difference in her appearance between \"Roman Holiday\" and \"Sabrina\" is actually more startling than the one in the movie itself. It is no wonder she became such a style icon from that point forward. With his street-savvy screen persona oddly out of place within the blue-nose Long Island surroundings, Bogart comes across as rather dour in his role of older brother Linus, a role ideally pegged for Cary Grant who canceled at the last minute...damn the luck. On the other hand, Holden is hilariously breezy as shallow, ne'er-do-well younger brother David. I always wished he did more comedy during his lengthy career. The ending is inevitable, but leave it to Wilder to mix sweet and sour better than a Cantonese restaurant. The DVD also includes a brief making-of documentary.",

I've heard that the part was written for Cary Grant, but I just can't see it.  Bogart's battle scarred face and hardened mannerisms truly do make him a surprising match for Sabrina!  If Grant was stuck in there, he'd be bound to win over Holden (in fact, many scriptwriters just skipped the motivation where Grant was involved -- just see the mediocre \"Pride and the Passion\" for a literal example).

Many of you may have grown up watching the 1995 remake, like I did, so when you go back and watch the original, it's very funny to see how much is similar. Much of the dialogue is taken straight from Billy Wilder's screenplay, and the plot points are almost identical. It's safe to say if you liked one, you'll like the other. Just pick which cast appeals to you more and start with that one.In 1954, Humphrey Bogart had already won an Oscar for his likeable role in The African Queen, so be prepared for him to be a good guy in Sabrina. He plays the straight-laced older brother to playboy William Holden, both of whom are millionaires out of reach of Audrey Hepburn. After a thwarted suicide attempt-one of the only differences between the original and the remake-Audrey goes to Paris to forget her love for William Holden and learn French cooking-in the remake, she learns photography-and comes back a completely different woman. She has a new haircut, new clothes, and a little dog, and Bill is smitten with her. Has she changed as much on the inside as she has on the outside? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.The backstage story on this movie is almost as famous as the movie itself: William Holden and Audrey Hepburn had an affair during filming. He wanted to marry her, but if you know your Hollywood history, you know that she married Mel Ferrer instead. It was a pretty tragic romance, and Bill's heart was broken, so sometimes it's sad to see them in happier times during the love scenes of Sabrina.",

There are still cynical characters, but the tone of the movie overall is so much lighter with a much greater sense of fun that it almost feels like it was made by another director.The titular Sabrina is the daughter of an English driver to a rich American industrialist family outside of New York. There are two adult, unmarried sons to the family, Linus and David. Linus is all business while David is all pleasure, and Sabrina is head over heels in love with David. It's a girlish crush exemplified by Sabrina's childish manner in the early scenes, but her affections also go completely unnoticed. David walks right by her at the large party and barely acknowledges her existence before he meets up with a ditzy socialite in the indoor tennis court. There's a great moment where, as Sabrina is writing a suicide note because of her invisibility to David, that she almost blends into the d\u00e9cor of her room. Her dress and the wallpaper almost match in design, creating a sense of camouflage about her that emphasizes her emotional state. It's a subtle thing, but very effective at the same time.Anyway, she tries to kill herself in the garage by carbon monoxide poisoning, but Linus saves her. He's professional and courteous, the exact opposite of the easy and free David. Before we know it, though, Sabrina gets shipped to Paris where she takes a two year cooking course while never losing her affections for the younger brother back in America. When she returns, David is engaged to a wealthy sugarcane heiress at the behest of Linus, who needs her father's sugarcane resources to help with a large business venture.And in walks Sabrina, determined to upend everything for her own happiness, and David is all too happy to upend it for Sabrina at the same time. He's flighty and would rather spend time with this elegant and pretty girl than the heiress being foisted upon him. Linus can't have this, so he pretends to do two things after David accidentally squashes two crystal champagne glasses against his butt. The first is to platonically take Sabrina out and away from the convalescing David. The other is to pretend to make Sabrina fall in love and he with her so he can ship her off to Paris and ensure David's wedding to the heiress.Linus is a deeply cynical man who doesn't believe in love. His treatment of David makes this very plain. He sees David and the heiress as widgets to be moved around in order to accomplish a deal, but his time with the enchantingly charming Sabrina tears that viewpoint down around him. He not only falls in love with Sabrina, he falls so hard that he ends up working to get her and David together, but David has a flighty change of character and loses all interest in Sabrina, marrying the heiress, and giving Linus an excuse to join Sabrina on the boat to France.The movie's light and airy and fun. It's not the weightiest of material, but it's so delightful from beginning to end that it's hard to complain. If I had to, I guess I would complain about David and the ending. David just walking away from Sabrina does seem to fit his character a bit, but it also feels a bit unsupported. I think that has to do with the fact that Wilder and his co-writer Ernest Lehman were rewriting Samuel Taylor's play so much that they didn't even know how they were going to end the film as they made it, so they ended up with an resolution that didn't quite get the support it needed.Though that's a small complaint. The movie's such an enjoyable two hours that it seems petty to complain about something so petty.",

The 1995 version of the movie was good as a whole, but it certainly doesn't compare with the original, and I don't think it ever could.  Not that trying to remake a masterpiece was a bad thing.  One problem:  are there any more Audrey Hepburns out there?  Maybe so.  But she was one of a kind.  I've only seen a few of her movies.  I need to see more. Whether depressed, sophisticated and happy, serious, or just plain silly, Hepburn could do it all.  The actors playing the servants were great.  You really wanted to care about these people, and they showed that they loved Sabrina.  And John Williams was great as Sabrina's father.  The chef in Paris was quite funny. There wasn't really a bad acting performance, as far as I could tell.  And while this wasn't anywhere close to 100% comedy, there were some very funny moments, both physical comedy and clever writing.  And the music was wonderful too.  Some movies today still try to give us the great music of the past.  But too many films have to do today's music.  It's nice to have something different for a change.

I finally decided to plug it in, and I can't believe how much I enjoyed this.Audrey Hepburn plays her typical role of a na\u00efve young woman who falls in love with a much more mature man. William Holden plays David, a rich playboy who's been married multiple times. Bogart plays David's brother Linus, a no-nonsense businessman who only cares about bottom lines and mergers.This is a different kind of role for Bogart, and I really liked it. It's a lot to get used to at first, but the more familiar I got with Linus Larrabee, the more I realized Bogart actually fit the part perfectly. Audrey Hepburn is good too, though not as impressive as she was in Breakfast at Tiffany's or Roman Holiday.About half the comedy is dated, and the other half is actually quite good. Though Sabrina this is labeled as a romantic comedy, it's really got some intense drama. Especially in the case of Linus, parts of Sabrina are really sad and there is no comic relief to ease the sadness. I wish this was written to be more of a drama because the serious moments surpass the comic moments by far.The music is also worth noting. I typically enjoy music in classic movies, but the music in Sabrina is especially good. Though the song is used frequently, \"La Vie en Rose\" is one of the best songs ever written, so I can't really blame the filmmakers for including it over and over.This is a good movie to watch for anyone.

William Holden, as David Larabee, is far too old for his role and he plays the playboy as such a transparent cad that it is hard to generate the slightest sympathy for him. What a free spirit such as Sabrina would see in either man is far from obvious. The development of the supporting characters is bafflingly erratic, particularly Walter Hampden as the Larabee patriarch. Oliver Larabee begins the film as a flinty business man and transforms, without the slightest explanation, into a comic lush by the end. The film is clearly an effort to create an American comedy of manners and class, but the translation into an American setting is a nearly complete failure. I cannot tell how it appeared to audiences at the time, but 50 years on it appears sloppy and dated.

She was often burdened with male co-stars who were way, way too old for her ingenue characters, yet she made her characters' affections and attractions seem genuine. That's definitely the case in Sabrina, as she slowly falls out of love with the flighty David and comes to love the hard-nosed but soft-hearted Linus. Even if Bogart isn't always believable, Hepburn is.And naturally, as a Billy Wilder project, this is a witty, beautiful-looking movie. For once, his cynicism is kept at bay and he seduces the audience into believing this mid-century Cinderella story. The ending always makes me smile-- it's a sweet movie that doesn't rot your teeth and I think it still holds up as a romantic comedy after almost seventy years.",

            "content": "Mediocre is the word that can describe the film.Humphrey Bogart looks truly \"exhausted\" in the film, and Audrey Hepburn, on the contrary, looks too calm. She behaved just the same before and after her training of how to be a sophisticated lady in Paris. Is there any difference that has been performed by Audrey Hepburn that is supposed to be found between a girl of a humble beginning and a lady that has been influenced by the romance of Paris? There should be, but I could not sense that from the unchanged, undisturbed peaceful look of Audrey Hepburn. Worse is that, this so-called \"consistent\" look makes Humphrey Bogart quite a stupid old guy who seemed to be waiting for a crush over a young lady...Humphrey Bogart is an actor that is charming when he doesn't mean to. A review of his works might tell us one thing: clever talks and deliberate witty responses didn't give him an Academy Award. But a tough while tender \"man\" in \"The African Queen\" gave him that. Why? Because he was tortured by the nature, and no so-called acquired sense of humor that disguises a lonely heart could be found anymore, and till then a real man as well as \"actor of the actor\" is therefore reborn. I can't agree more with the Academy that they didn't give him the award until he showed what a man really is, definitely not an old rich guy getting on with a romance with a lady whose facial expression doesn't mind a slight change no matter who she's playing! Every one loves Audrey Hepburn. False! Me, at least, feel nothing for her. She was adored by people throughout her life because she had something that a lot of women craved for, especially the so-called elegance and the way she delivered it. Yet, a true movie fan with critical eyes and skeptical thinking will question her position given by the history. Wasn't it a mistake? Katherine Hepburn, Betty Davis, Sophia Loren, and even Vivien Leigh truly truly did a far better job, but they were not so much loved by the audience. Why? Because they were too good to be appreciated...A film critic shall be fair and objective and this is the only thing that I hope for the people who read and is going to read my comment on the movie \"Sabrina\", an overrated romance full of clich\u00e9s.",

            "content": "\"Sabrina\" contains a far fetched story, loosley based on the Cinderalla fairy tale. It is in the first place an Audrey Hepburn star vehicle. In the 50's building a film around a star in stead of around a story was nothing new, and Audrey Hepburn was \"hot\" after her breakthrough wit \"Roman Holiday\" (1953, William Wyler).Compared to Audrey Hepburn film noir actor Humphrey Bogart seems terribly miscast in the role of a detached and boring businessman. His character was meant to be played by Cary Grant, a far more logical choice.Although the chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is of a different magnitude than that between Bogart and Bacall in films like \"To have and have not\" (1944, Howard Hawks), \"The big sleep\" (1946, Howard Hawks) and \"Key Largo\" (1948, John Huston), Humphrey is doing a rather good job as the man who is the last one to know that he is falling in love.The one who is not doing a good job is director Billy Wilder. Not that watching \"Sabrina\" is a waste of time, some scenes are rather entertaining. However with films such as \"Sunset boulevard\" (1951) and \"Ace in the hole\" (1951) Wilder had shown that he can do much better. Fortunately he would prove it agian (after \"Sabrina\") with little jewels like \"Some like it hot\" (1959) and \"The apartment\" (1960).",

            "content": "Sitting down to watch Sabrina (1954) reminds me why there are so many posters of Audrey Hepburn, rolled up and ready for sale in any respectable big-box-mart or multi-media store. The image of her holding a ceramic cigarette holder, embroidered with diamonds and clad in satin is a famous tableaux from Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961).But even before Breakfast at Tiffany's she was a household name with her work in Funny Face (1957) and her first lead role in Roman Holiday (1953) for which she won an Academy Award. Despite her continued success after Breakfast at Tiffany's in such films as Charade (1963) and My Fair Lady (1964), Sabrina remains in my mind the premiere showcase of the actress's charm.The story of Sabrina begins with the capable actress playing the titular character, a near invisible fixture in the world of the Larrabee clan. The Larrabees would be considered part of the 0.5% today. Sabrina narrates this fact as she describes them and their indoor and outdoor swimming pools and tennis courts respectively. She however is not a Larrabee but a Fairchild; the chauffeur's daughter. Still she pines for, and is unhappily in love with the youngest son of the multimillionaire dynasty David (William Holden). David however has no interest in her and enjoys the life of a playboy while his older brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) takes care of the business. Things change however after she returns from cooking school in Paris with a new air of elegance.It is that elegance that makes Sabrina such a great film. Throughout the film Audrey Hepburn is dressed in a multitude of exquisite dresses and gowns. Rumored to have been designed by fashion master Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy, the Oscar for best costumes went to Edith Head a woman nominated 35 times over the course of a 57 year career.The elegance of Sabrina even sinks into the crisp clear cinematography and set design. Billy Wilder shot the exteriors for the film along Long Island Sound. The area was considered a popular escape for 19th-century wealthy industrial barons, including Charles Pratt and his sons, J.P. Morgan, and F.W. Woolworth. They built large private estates along the island thus many in New York society dubbed the area the Gold Coast; a place where wealth and privilege came to unwind.It was this corner of the world where Holden and Hepburn began a highly publicized love affair on-set. Meanwhile Bogart became increasingly belligerent. The part was originally given to Cary Grant who backed out last minute due to scheduling problems. feeling miscast, Bogart butted heads with Wilder but eventually came to appreciate his work on the film. And why wouldn't he? His comedic timing and swarthy charm while unseen since The African Queen (1951), still hold weight. In fact, next to Hepburn's magnetic smile, his wit and witticisms are the next best thing.There was a respectable remake made in 1995 starring Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond, who as you know went on to do\u0085well, nothing much. Not to say Ormond isn't a gifted actress but the role of Sabrina Fairchild are some big heels few actresses can fill. Ford also produced the film which would lead one to believe it was really more of a vanity project than an attempt of a decent remake.Even with a remake soiling Sabrina's legacy, the movie remains one of Hepburn's strongest films. It's funny, its romantic, it has a lot of heart and its downright beautiful to watch. The script is sharp and witty and is bolstered by the comedic whims of William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. The film is further aided by Edith Head's decadent costume design and stands as one of the biggest reasons to like the late, great Audrey Hepburn.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn made only a handful of films in her career and probably has as high a rate of excellence in her movies as anyone, (at least until later in her career). Some of her movies, (War and Peace, The Nun's Story, The Unforgiven) are about much more than her personal charm. Others use her charm but they are not strictly about her, (My Fair Lady, Two for the Road), and so are not classic \"Audrey Hepburn\" movies. if someone had never seen an Audrey Hepburn movie and wanted to know what the fuss was about, I would recommend five of them: Roman Holiday, (1953), Sabrina, (1954), Funny Face, (1957), Love in the Afternoon, (1957) and Breakfast at Tiffany's, (1961). If you are not an Audrey Hepburn fan after seeing one of those, you never will be.\tI think I'd rank Sabrina second to Funny Face on that list. it might have been first except for a fatal flaw. The flaw is not Audrey, who is the ideal Cinderella and makes every scene she is in glow. Nor is it William Holden, who steals the picture, (as Greg Kinnear would in the same role in the surprisingly good 1995 remake, which recreated the look of the original film amazingly well). But why remake it at all? The reason is that flaw.\n\tWhen I first saw this film and for the next several times I saw it thereafter, I didn't mind Humphrey Bogart's performance as Linus Larabee, the serious older brother who steals Sabrina away from Holden. I like Bogey and he was the right age and looked the part of the middle aged businessman. But more and more, I find I cannot stand his performance, especially when I think of the man most commentators say they would have selected for this role: Cary Grant. All right, grant may seem a stretch as a sober businessman, (which he was, by the way, in real life). But he would have added a lot more liveliness to the part and made with Hepburn and Holden the three most charming people ever to be in one film. The whole thing would have taken off like a paper airplane in the wind. Harrison Ford in the remake was no Grant, either, but he at least seemed to be enjoying himself.\n\tInstead, we are stuck with old stone face. Reports indicate Bogart was in a grouchy mood during this one, didn't want to make the picture, didn't like Wilder, or Hepburn and loathed Holden. He's like a drain the charm of each scene he's in goes down. Grant could certainly play a more mature version of Holden who could get romantic at the end. His scenes with Audrey in Charade, nine years later, sparkle. That should have been their second film together.\tWhen I see this film today, I just can't help thinking of what might have been.",

It's in black and white (that never scared me off).Made 12 years before I was born, I saw it when I was in college (late 80's) and I've loved it since. I like the 1995 remake with Harrison Ford, and my favorite line from the remake (Sabrina to Linus): They say you're the world's only living heart donor. I love that line, but while there isn't an equivalent of that zinger in the Bogart/Hepburn version, I do think this is the superior product. This has Audrey Hepburn (Ormond can't compare), and it has the comedic/surrealistic touches of Billy Wilder (yes, Pollack can do comedy. I thought Tootsie was funny under Pollack's direction, and maybe Pollack should stick to original scripts like that).More than that, Sabrina is a product of the times. Compare the 1995 and the 1954 versions. There are lines in the 1954 version that can't be said in the 1995 version without people laughing at the wrong times. Are these more cynical times? Are there things we can't believe people doing now (like Linus's noble attitude in the end), making the remake seem anachronistic? I think that's the real problem with the remake. This 1954 version exists, and it sparkles and zips along faster than Ford's version. Ford's version doesn't distinguish itself enough. It's likable, there's that one line I really love, the actors are pretty, but it might as well be a Tom Hanks/ Meg Ryan vehicle, or (if remade yet again in the new millennium) a Matthew McConaughey/ Kate Hudson yawner.Remakes have a tough time usually, but it IS possible to improve an original. I thought The Fly with Jeff Goldblum took the story in directions I'd never imagine (focused on the romance!). Howard Hawk's His Girl Friday improved on The Front Page by turning the reporter from a guy to a girl. Or at least, strike out in a different direction. When Howard Hawk's The Thing from Outer Space was remade into John Carpenter's The Thing, Carpenter stuck closer to the original short story and added groundbreaking makeup effects. When Howard Hawk's Scarface was redone by Brian DePalma into Pacino's Scarface, he turned Scarface into a Cuban immigrant, and set the whole thing in Miami. Everything's changed, we're reminded of many things about the original, but the remakes are creatures of their own mind.So, I think I'll stick to this original, with the irreplaceable Audrey Hepburn.",

Unfortunately, she's practically invisible to him; that is, until she returns from a sojourn in Paris looking the picture of elegance and beauty. However, her arrival comes at an inopportune time since her would-be beau is about to be married.This gives a general idea of the plot, though there's more that I've left unsaid. The story turns out to be an interesting one populated with memorable characters. Adapted from a Broadway play by Wilder and Ernest Lehman, their screenplay won a Golden Globe and garnered an Oscar nomination.An enviable cast played a big part in showing the screenplay to the best advantage. All three leads were Oscar winners who contributed countless legendary performances over the course of their careers. Many feel that last minute replacement Humphrey Bogart was miscast but I doubt that original choice Cary Grant could have done as well. Audrey Hepburn is luminous as the title character and William Holden was a welcome addition to the film. The supporting cast is also impressive, especially John Williams as Sabrina's father and Walter Hampden as the patriarch of the Larrabee family.Billy Wilder's Oscar-nominated direction is impeccable and the film benefited from high production values all around. The Edith Head costumes secured an Oscar win while the attractive cinematography and art direction were both rewarded with nominations.

Oh my, such a dilemma for a poor servant's daughter.As I recall, the movie was quite a hit. Certainly Hepburn's svelte figure and pixie-like features presented quite a contrast to the bosomy blonde sex goddesses of the day. All in all, she's a highly appealing screen presence whether as a tree waif or as the belle of the ball. Bogart's a rather odd choice as the older brother. He's showing his age and unfortunately only a couple years away from an untimely passing. Still, he and the much younger Hepburn manage to make their scenes together fairly believable.The plot's really little more than a showcase for screen vet Bogie, and the fast-rising Hepburn and Holden.

I can't help but think that casting someone like Gregory Peck, who was just two years older than William Holden and had such wonderful chemistry with Audrey in Roman Holiday, might have improved things on the romantic end. Despite Bogart's age and reported unhappiness on set, he does a good job. Audrey's charming and beautiful as always. Love her wardrobe in this. Holden has a nice chemistry with her (the two were involved in real life) but I've never been overly impressed with him and this does little to change that opinion.

I love this director/actor combo so much and I wish they would have made more than one collaboration, but from the sounds of the set during the filming of the 1954 film, Sabrina, the two may not have been able to handle any more of each other. Starring along with Bogart was Audrey Hepburn, and William Holden, the film centers around two brothers fighting for the affections of a woman they lived near for years, yet hardly knew existed. A romantic comedy was a fun turn for the veteran actor, Humphrey Bogart, but one audiences have been blessed with for over 60 years. Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn) the daughter of a chauffeur lives in the servants quarters of the home of the tycoon Larrabee Brothers. Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) is the brother that is always about business; handling the day-to-day dealings of the Larrabee business ventures and estate, he has successfully convinced himself to substitute a family life with the corporate life. David Larrabee (William Holden), on the other hand, is a partying playboy more interested in women than his family's business. David is a bit of a headache for his family, having been divorced 3 times. David has never escaped the notice of Sabrina. She fell in love with David as a young girl and was tortured by his presence around the home for years. One fateful night, Sabrina couldn't bear her unrequited love for David any longer and decided to end her own life. Luckily, she was unsuccessful and was saved by Linus Larrabee before being shipped off to Paris. In Paris, Sabrina learns how to cook and bake, but she also learns sophistication and elegance. Sabrina comes back a changed woman, and David notices, beginning his quest for his latest conquest. In the meantime, David has been promised to a wealthy plastic mogul's daughter in order to secure a merger between the two enterprises. Linus begins to lure Sabrina away from his brother in order to protect his fledgling business partnership which works wonders, until he begins to fall in love with her, as well. The first thing that struck me with Sabrina, after the inimitable Humphrey Bogart, of course; who really notices any other aspect of a film first when Humphrey Bogart is in it, was the exquisite lighting. It was essential in this film to display the transformation of Audrey Hepburn's character, so the lighting needed to be top notch to reveal the differences in her character. It doesn't hurt that the film was composed of some of the best stars of the day to keep the light on. The film is also perfectly written, and no one can match the subtle interjections of humor quite like Billy Wilder. Sabrina was a joy of a film, due in no small part to the exceptional depiction of Humphrey Bogart's Linus Larrabee.Sabrina found Humphrey Bogart playing a bit against type as a lead in a romantic comedy. Perhaps unexpectedly, the role suits Bogart well, and his debonair appearance doesn't suffer despite his difference in age with Audrey Hepburn. Bogart also found himself sharing the screen in Sabrina with another man. This had to have been a blow to the veteran actor which could have been the reason he had so many issues in the set, especially with William Holden. Tumultuous set nonetheless, Bogart proved his professionalism churning out one of his best performances. He also had one of the most iconic movie entrances I have ever seen. Ascending from the shadows like a knight in shining armor to save Sabrina from her suicide attempt, Bogart took over the screen. Watching the subtlety he played his part with and the gradual way he changed his character as he began falling in love with Sabrina was beautiful art to watch unfold on screen. This realization that he wasn't all the man he thought he could be without someone by his side resulted in a wonderful \"Humphrey Bogart Eyes\" moment. There is a brief moment in which we see the realization come across Bogart's face that he is indeed in love with Sabrina in a way that only Humphrey Bogart could emote. I will forever be in awe of the way Bogart could convey a wealth of emotions, using only his eyes. Is it any wonder that Humphrey Bogart is widely considered the best actor to ever live?",

This film was nominated for six Academy Awards including two nominations for Billy Wilder: Director and Screenplay.It is a funny and charming film with Hepburn in another great performance only a year after she won her Oscar for Roman Holiday. Bogart won for The Caine Mutiny this same year.

Enough of revealing the plot now.It's SABRINA's story that is played by Audrey Hepburn with histrionics that are good for the scene and with emotions that are apt, she made Sabrina a lovely lively girl. Humphrey Bogart is just fine though I saw a bit of discomfort in few of hi emotions especially when is trying to hide his emotions from Sabrina. William Holden is the lover boy and seems apt in it. All said an above is handling of acting and expressions by Billy Wilder, the master director. I actually resort to his movies when I am not in good mood and he brings back a smile on me. This movie does that very thing again, he sets the screen on a serene charming pace that as the things fold we just are so lethargically in love with the whole it. If there has to be a mention after writing and acting, then it's editing and costume design. A scene where Sabrina denies going out just because its not the right attire speaks for the care taken to keep the dresses right. The dialogues are actually very beautifully told, rain in Paris, oh, such a nice thought. See it to know how romantic are conversations. I believe if you need to have a beautiful romantic film, then the conversation between the boy and girl needs to be romantic is every word. They have to be like poetry, fluid, enticing and ah so touching. This movie may not be having all such traits yet each conversation lights up and adds flamboyance. I go with 4/5 for Sabrina.If you are not willing to see this movie in purest form, then see it in a corrupted form of \"Yeh Dillagi\" in Hindi by Akshay Kumar, Kajol and Saif Ali Khan.",

            "content": "In 1954, when 'Sabrina' was made, the film's director, Billy Wilder, and the three actors who played the lead roles (Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden) had each won at least one Oscar. 'Sabrina', an entertainment movie, a romantic comedy of sorts that would have no chance at such awards nowadays, was also nominated for six awards. In the end, it won just one, for the best costumes, the film marking the beginning of Audrey Hepburn's collaboration with the fashion house of Givenchy. This is probably the only award that the film would have deserved. 'Sabrina', seen 67 years after its premiere, has some interesting qualities, but these are not necessarily the ones that were appreciated at the time.Wilder's 'Sabrina' belongs to the genre of escapist films set in the world of the rich, a genre that enjoyed great success in the United States in the 1930s - the years of the economic crisis and the long period of recovery that followed. The war brought other topics to focus in the next decade, but the genre reappeared in the early 1950s. Success was not the same an America that had changed a lot, much more prosperous and socially dynamic. The Cinderella story we are wittnessing, set in the luxurious East Coast mansion belonging to the Larrabees, a tycoons family, and their sumptuous Manhattan offices, is as unbelievable as the fairy tale that inspired it. It is proof that the gap between some of the products of the Hollywood film industry and reality is not something new, but rather a permanence in the history of American cinema.Films of this kind largely relied on the personal talent and charm of their stars, and 'Sabrina' was no exception. The problem could have been that when the film was made, the couple to fall in love was played by Bogart who was 55 and Audrey who was 25. The writers tried to alleviate this difference by creating for Bogart a role of 'corporate beast', a workaholic aging man whose life was dedicated to the family business, but the change of affection of the girl embodied by Audrey Hepburn is still not convincing. Like in the legend and the movies about 'Beauty and the Beast', to use another comparison with the world of fairy tales and fairy tale-inspired movies. Instead, in the perspective of the 67 years since its making, another unexpected effect appears. Humphrey Bogart's Linus Larrabee, a rather atypical role in the actor's filmography, looks unexpectedly contemporary, a corporate capitalist that today, if a remake was made, the screenwriters would put at the top of the pyramid of a global hi-tech corporation and not many other things should be changed. Audrey Hepburn is a charming and out-of-this-word, as in all her appearances on screen. Charles Lang's cinematography offers a few unexpected glimpses of beauty, and so does the music with a few songs composed by Friedrich Hollaender that play an important role in the story. 'Sabrina' looks obsolete in many ways, but re-viewing it today we can understand many of the reasons why it was successful at its time.",

            "content": "In \"Sabrina\" (1954) Audrey Hepburn plays the role of a chauffeur's daughter named Sabrina Fairchild. Sabrina has always had her eye on a man by the name of David Larrabee (William Holden), but David never paid any attention to her. He lives in an estate with his wealthy parents, his brother Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) and many servants, as well as Sabrina and her father. Sabrina's father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams), sends her to Paris for several years to study Culinary Arts, where at first all she could think of was David. When she returned, she had matured, and David is still on her mind. David finds her stunning and loves her. However, David is engaged to be married, so Linus proposes a plan to ship Sabrina back to Paris without David's knowledge. After spending several days together, Linus and Sabrina fall in love with each other. Their love affair cause chaos and confusion for everyone.\"Sabrina\" is a classic romance movie with a twist of comedy and drama. This movie tells people everywhere that they can find love in places they would have never expected, even their own backyards. In many ways \"Sabrina\" follows the same format as the classic Cinderella story, in which a young, poor child grows up and falls in love with a rich, handsome prince, or in this film, a business man and his chauffeur's daughter who eventually fall in love.Billy Wilder could not have chosen a more perfect person to play the role of Sabrina. Audrey Hepburn's innocence and charm makes Sabrina seem realistic. Hepburn's wardrobe for that time period makes her look the part of a young child turned fashion icon. Humphrey Bogart, on the other hand, seems a few years older than the character he is trying to portray, unlike his co-star William Holden. Holden does a wonderful job of playing the role of the wild, promiscuous male. Together the trio make a great team.",

I did and enjoyed every minute. As is traditional for Humphrey Bogart or Bogie as he is known he plays a smooth, charming sophisticated character with ease and this is apparent throughout. He also reveals in a very believable way his soft side when he admits his reasons for remaing single in the movie and his hurt of a past girlfriend, and of course he is the only actor who can produce the line \"its all in the family\" in such a way as I find it sweet yet amusing. Willian Holden also shines in this movie as the rich and wealthy playboy yet is slightly unconvincing in the role of playboy turned to lover. He does however make the film amusing with a scene when he is having glass removed from you know where. And also implies humour when asking Lynes what rhymes with glass when later trying to compose a poem to Sabrina. Audrey hepburn shows her acting talent aswell as her beauty in this movie as she wraps the two larabee brothers roung her fingers. Its fun to watch and is another film that shall remain a great tribute to the great Billy Wilder who has given us movies like this and some like it hot also a well worth movie.",

It is the kind of movie that is nice to put on on a wet Sunday afternoon.I only recorded this movie from the TV because it has Audrey Hepburn in it. She was a great actress.

She is a chauffeur's daughter who has loved the son of her fathers rich employer since she was a little girl. The only problem, he looks right past her and takes no notice of her, until... she leaves for Paris to get over him. But when she comes back 2 years later... he is smitten. But so is his brother.I thought the story was quite good and the acting was good also. But then it should have. It had some big names from it's time. Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart & William Holden.Like I said... this movie is good for a wet weekend... but it is not really a film I could watch over and over. I will probably watch this again in a few years when I have forgotten it. For Audrey... out of the 3 films I have seen of hers so far... this is the worst.

            "content": "Never again will the screen see such grace as Audrey Hepburn. Marilyn is hot, but Audrey is beautiful. However its Audrey being the goddess that she is which brings about the major flaw in Sabrina - you cannot make Audrey Hepburn look like a scrawny chauffeurs' daughter. It doesn't matter what she wears, Audrey can make any piece of dowdy clothing look glamorous (later in the film she even makes a lumberjack shirt look feminine). After all, in the original stage play, Sabrina Fairchild was played by the down to Earth Margaret Sullivan. Despite this, the sheer enchanting screen presence of Audrey Hepburn, as well as her childlike innocence does help to some degree, overcome this suspension of disbelief. The opening of Sabrina couldn't be more impossibly romantic - a clear sky with a full moon, Isn't It Romantic playing the background and a forbidden love imposed by class differences. Well, that is until things take a dark U-turn and Sabrina attempts to commit suicide by locking herself in a garage with multiple car exhaust pipes emitting carbon monoxide. Even in a moment as disturbing as this, a joke is still thrown in with that one popping exhaust pipe (likewise did Sabrina's father ever discovering that suicide note?).Humphrey Bogart in the role of business mogul Linus Larrabee gets an opportunity to show his flair for light comedy. Bogart is such a pleasure to watch in the many witty lines he delivers, in particular the inter-office memo he sends to his brother David via a car phone. Linus Larrabee is a benevolent capitalist and not the stereotypical archetype of the evil business owner, as he brilliantly sums up in an exchange he shares with David:\n\"A new product has been found, something of use to the world. A new industry moves into an undeveloped area. Factories go up, machines are brought in, a harbour is dug up and you're in business. It's purely coincidental of course that people who've never seen a dime before suddenly have a dollar and barefooted kids wear shoes and have their teeth fixed and their faces washed.\"\nLinus evens has connections to a military general who can get him a bazooka to test against his revolutionary plastic, showing he has some Elon Musk in him. Likewise unlike as seen in many screwball comedies of the 1930s, the servants of the Fairchild family have a perfectly amicable and respectable relationship with their masters.David Larabee (William Holden) is the polar opposite of his brother - a 1950's Billy Madison who lives for hedonism. Holden looks rather ghastly with his bleached hair and the ugly dressing gowns which he wears throughout the film. Sabrina has been head over heels for David since childhood but her love of the man was always forbidden due to class, well until her transformation after spending two years in Paris. David does not appear to be much longer than Linus, which is odd as it's mentioned at one point in the film that David had kissed Sabrina when she was nine during a time they were roller skating. I never quite get what Sabrina sees in the immature David - this goes for both the original and the remake (more on that later).At its heart, Sabrina is a story about true love vs. romantic love. Sabrina may be romantically infatuated with David, but ultimately it's Linus of whom she is destined to be with. The age difference between Audrey and her leading men in multiple films is often a topic of conversation with the casting of a 54-year-old Bogart as a romantic love interest to a 25-year-old Hepburn not being the most obvious choice. Changing social norms since the 1950s and the feminist movement have made it anathema for a woman to rely on a man for money or status, making older man/younger woman relationships age gaps more taboo in modern times. Personally, I've seen enough old films with relationship age gaps that I'm more used to it plus the argument can be made that many women simply prefer an older man. At the very least the movie does acknowledge this age difference (\"Here I am going off on a sailboat to make an ass out of myself with a girl of 22\"). Age aside, with Bogart's arrogance and overly masculine voice, Audrey isn't the most obvious choice to play off him - she's not like Lauren Bacall or Katharine Hepburn. The argument can be made that the original casting choice of Cary Grant would have been more suitable for the part. Regardless these performers are two of my favourite movie stars of all time and they are a joy to watch together so I personally can't complain at the end of the day.That Billy Wilder wit is as strong as ever in Sabrina (\"That good, that's bad\" - I can see where a certain Simpsons joke came from), with the film also including one of the most clever and witty methods in which a film got around the censorship of the day (\"What rhymes with glass?\"). On a technical level, it's also notable that Sabrina was filmed in the 4:3 aspect ratio, despite being released in late 1954, making it one of the last Hollywood productions to do so as almost all movies at this point where being shot in various widescreen formats. Coming off the heels from Sunset Boulevard, Ace In The Hole and Stalag 17, I get the impression Billy Wilder wanted to do something more pleasant and straightforward with Sabrina. I don't consider Sabrina to be one of Wilder's best films but I do enjoy it despite its flaws and the relationship dynamics requiring much suspension of disbelief. When a rom-com sparks an interesting debate on whom the female lead should have ended up with, to an extent it has done its job. However, unpopular opinion time, I will argue that the 1995 remake of Sabrina directed by Sydney Pollack is a superior film.The remake of Sabrina carries the same themes and follows the same basic plot of the original but with some notable adjustments, the most prescient of these being Sabrina's (Julia Ormond) transformation in Paris being far more significant. At the film's beginning, Sabrina really is a scrawny, nerdy girl with a dreadful fashion sense and very long, unkempt hair. Her time in Paris takes up a significant portion of the film (this time working as a photographer for Vogue rather than going to a cooking school) in which she gets mentored by others and comes out of her shell. Symbolically her hair gradually gets shorter over the two year period and returns to the US unrecognizable (I'm just slightly disappointed the remake doesn't include the attempted suicide scene). Unlike the original, the Paris scenes are filmed on location and are the most distinctly 90's portion of the film with the fashions and music (nice cover of Love's In Need Of Love Today). So who is the better Sabrina? I know its sacrilege to outrank Audrey Hepburn, but going from the standpoint on both superior writing and more appropriate casting, Ormond's rendition of Sabrina does have greater depth, is more believable and is portrayed with a greater sense of vulnerability.Who was the better Linus? You're asking me to pit two of my favourite actors of all time against each other. Harrison Ford plays the part beautifully with his trademark comic grumpiness and a real sense of loneliness, and even with the 90's setting, Ford's Linus remains a conservatively dressed man with his glasses, dotted bowtie and Homburg hat. The remake also features a much more resentful relationship between David and Linus. In the original, Linus is not impressed with David but doesn't harbour much resentment, whereas in the remake the relationship is far more antagonistic (\"My life makes your life possible - I resent that - So do I!\"). I do wish however they could have retained the benevolent capitalist aspect of his character as Bogart portrayed. I feel like going for a tie but I know that's a cop-out so ultimately I will have to choose Ford once again due to the superior writing and more appropriate casting - Ormond and Ford are simply a more believable romantic pair.Lastly, who was the better David? Greg Kinnear does a good job at portraying the hedonistic sleaze of David, while his turnaround towards actually doing work at the end is a very nice comic touch. Yet even the additional aspect of the antagonistic relationship, I would choose Holden on the account of simply being a more charismatic and likeable screen presence. Likewise, I do particularly enjoy John Wood as Sabrina's father, a real charmer of an English gentleman, while Paul Giamatti gets one of his earliest screen roles but it's just a shame he's given nothing to do. I'd even go as far as saying that Sabrina '95 provides a greater feast for the senses. The location filming of the North-Eastern United States (notably including Martha's Vineyard) with the gorgeous architecture alongside the breezy John Williams score, makes the film a very relaxing watch (I also have to ask, was the film's poster inspired by that of Billy Wilder's Fedora?). While I hate having to outrank these classic Hollywood legends, Sabrina '95 is a rare remake which remains a classy affair and outperforms the original.",

            "review_title": "One of the best romantic comedies of the fifties",
            "content": "Hollywood has never really bought into the idea of America as a classless society, largely because if it did it would have to say goodbye to two of its most cherished plotlines. These are \"poor boy (or girl) makes good\" and \"poor boy loves rich girl\" (or vice versa). In Audrey Hepburn's first Hollywood film, \"Roman Holiday\", she played a rich girl (a Princess no less) in love with a poor boy. (Poor, that is, in comparison to his royal sweetheart, if not in any absolute sense of the term).In Audrey's second Hollywood film, \"Sabrina\", the tables are turned. She is now the poor girl in love with a rich boy. Her character, Sabrina Fairchild, is the daughter of Thomas Fairchild, the chauffeur to the immensely wealthy old-money Larrabee family, who live in a Long Island mansion. The object of her affections is David Larrabee, the younger son of the family. He has never paid much attention to Sabrina in the past, but when she returns from Paris, where she has been attending a cookery school, as a beautiful, stylish and sophisticated young woman, David falls in love. There are, however, two problems. David is already engaged to someone else, and Sabrina has also come to the attention of his older brother, Linus.The two brothers are very different in character. Linus, seemingly a confirmed bachelor, is a steady, sober workaholic who spends most of his time running the very profitable family business. David is an irresponsible, workshy playboy who already has three marriages and three divorces behind him. His main pastimes are driving fast cars, drinking heavily and spending the money which Linus makes. No prizes for guessing which one Sabrina ends up with.The film is based upon a once successful but now largely forgotten stage play called \"Sabrina Fair\". (The film was originally released under that title in the United Kingdom, although today it is more commonly referred to by its American title \"Sabrina\". It has also been known as \"La Vie en Rose\" after the Edith Piaf song which we hear several times and which becomes Sabrina's personal anthem). The script, although at times witty, is nothing out of the ordinary, and the film could have ended up as little more than just another mediocre rom-com. Instead, in the capable hands of Billy Wilder, it ended up as one of the best romantic comedies of the fifties.That it did so is even more remarkable when one considers the problems which faced Wilder on set. Hepburn and William Holden, who plays David, had fallen in love in real life and, although their relationship was to be a brief one and to end unhappily, it was intense and passionate while it lasted. Humphrey Bogart, who plays Linus, quarrelled with Wilder, Holden and Hepburn. He was also put out to discover that he had not been the first choice for the role- that had been Cary Grant, who had turned it down- and disappointed that he had failed in his efforts to get his wife Lauren Bacall cast as Sabrina.. Bogart, in fact, who specialised in playing the tough, hard-bitten heroes of films noirs and other action dramas, was cast against type as a romantic lead. One would have thought that in these circumstances there would have been too little chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart, and too much between Hepburn and Holden.For some reason this does not happen. All three principals were evidently professional enough to leave their personal likes and dislikes in the playground and they do not carry over into the finished film. Holden, who had worked with Wilder before on \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"Stalag 17\", had something in common with his character; like David he was a heavy drinker and something of a playboy. The one difference is that Holden only had one failed marriage behind him and zero divorces; it is said that Hepburn ended their relationship when she discovered that he was still legally married to Brenda Marshall.Bogart's lack of experience in romantic comedy may, paradoxically, have worked to his advantage because Linus is not a naturally romantic character but a seemingly confirmed middle-aged bachelor who unexpectedly finds himself falling in love, for the first time in his life, with a much younger woman. (Hollywood seemed to love pairing Hepburn with older men. Gregory Peck in \"Roman Holiday\" had been fifteen years older than her, but with Bogart the age difference was thirty years. He was not, however, Hepburn's oldest leading man; that was to be Fred Astaire in \"Funny Face\").As for Audrey, she shows that her stellar, Oscar-winning performance in \"Roman Holiday\" was not just a one-off and that she was destined to become a major force in Hollywood. She brings to her role here not just her acting skills, which were considerable, but also her unique personality and charisma, which is the factor which turns \"Sabrina\" from a merely good film into a great one. Bacall would probably not have been able to do that, and Julia Ormond failed to do it in that nineties remake which, although it was not particularly bad, never lived up to the standard of its illustrious predecessor.The film only won one Academy Award, Edith Head for Best Costume Design, although there were rumours that most of Hepburn's dresses had in fact been designed by the French couturier Hubert de Givenchy. It did, however, receive several more nominations, including \"Best Director\" for Wilder and \"Best Actress\" for Hepburn. Strangely, it missed out on \"Best Picture\". It is perhaps not the best film of 1954- I have always been happy with the Academy's decision to go with \"On the Waterfront\"- but I would certainly regard it as the runner-up. 9/10",

It stars Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina alongside Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, and is directed by Billy Wilder. After seeing these quick facts, it was pretty evident that this movie would be great. But I had no idea that it would be at this almost unreachable level.This was the movie that made me fall in love with Audrey Hepburn. Her father is the chauffeur to the wealthy Larrabee family. She grew up with the hots for the son David (Holden) but he never noticed her. She spends two years in culinary school in Paris and returns home a knockout. I'd say the sole flaw of this movie is Audrey Hepburn is too beautiful for David not to like her back. Her look when she returns is not that much different. But whatever. When she returns, David finally takes notice to her and they start a romance. But he is already engaged to a woman who is right for the family business. But David is a playboy who is a little bit irresponsible. His older brother Linus (Bogart) is a workaholic who happens to also fall for Sabrina soon after. Which brother is right for her? Which one will she pick?Something I love about this film is it actually makes me laugh. I mean actual belly laughs. Maybe not as frequent or intensely as Wilder's Some Like It Hot, but close. And the romance that blossom in the love triangle is so beautiful as we watch the love and characters grow.It honestly doesn't matter who Sabrina ends up with. The movie makes too much love and glory to be disappointed by her decision.Easily one of my ten favourite films of the 1950's.4/4",

Yes, Hepburn is wonderful, and the part seems custom tailored for her. And let me throw in that I quite enjoyed John Williams, always a favorite of mine, delivering his usual strong supporting performance as the chauffeur.But I fail to see why people think this is a hilarious comedy. It had a few amusing moments, but I would never call it a comedy. To me it came off entirely as a light romance story. But then again, maybe I just wasn't born with the Billy Wilder comedic gene. While his serious films-- Sunset Blvd, Lost Weekend-- have always scored high with me, his comedies-- 7 Year Itch, Some Like It Hot-- have always left me completely flat. I don't know what it is, but it seems to be consistent. The quintessential example is Stalag 17, a movie which I consider almost a frankenstein patchwork of serious and comedic, where I love the serious story, and find the comedic side to be pretty dumb. So maybe I shouldn't be surprised that I didn't find humor in Sabrina. Maybe that's just me, and your take will be different.But what I really want to talk about is Holden and Bogart.I've read a number of reviews here that castigate Bogart's performance, and play up the chemistry between Holden and Hepburn. I didn't see it that way *at all*.Holden comes off as a shallow jerk. Chemistry with Hepburn? He wouldn't give her the time of day, and now he's all hot for her? It's clearly the most shallow of shallow infatuations, I didn't find any real chemistry. Well... *her* performance makes you feel like she has real feeling for him, but he struck me as just turning on the charm for the latest hot babe he's lusting for. Which is what his character *should* be doing. It's a fine performance, but it's not *chemistry*.Where's Bogarts performance is more subtle (and should be). I think he does a *fine* job of working against type. I think he's completely convincing and completely on top of the role when he's playing the businessman. Indeed I *loved* his speech about *why* he busts hump to put through big deals like the plastics deal, beyond just the money. A rare bit of pro-capitalism from Hollywood.So you don't think he had real chemistry with Hepburn? GOOD! He's not SUPPOSED TO! Part of what makes the movie interesting is that you, the viewer, is *never sure* just where he's at with her. Is he really falling for her, as it sometimes seems? Or is it all just an act, as he outlines to his father? The movie wouldn't be half as interesting if we clearly knew what he was up to and where he was coming from. And what's more, the gloomy awkwardness he often displays around her, is entirely appropriate, because it seems that he's not sure himself. He's wrestling with himself. He's growing feelings for her but reluctant to accept or even admit them. And what's more, let's face it, this guy, who seemingly hasn't dated since college, IS going to be awkward with women. You would not *expect* him to have this great charismatic chemistry with her under these circumstances. And yet, there's enough there that I, at least, did find myself pulling for the two of them to get together.So I guess I'm the only one who's *glad* they cast Bogart instead of Cary Grant (despite the fact that I'm a *huge* Grant fan, he's my favorite actor). If Grant had had the role, it would've been obvious from frame 1 that Hepburn was fated to end up with him. With Bogart, we were never really sure *where* it was going. And that makes for a vastly better movie.",

Aging business mogul Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart) tells his playboy younger brother David (William Holden) that he thinks of Sabrina as an \"Ethyl\" because she lives over the brothers' eight-car garage and always smells like gas. What every viewer can see for themselves, however, is that Aubrey Hepburn as chauffeur's daughter Sabrina is by far the most attractive belle at the frequent Larrabee balls. This is quite plausible, since modern psychology teaches us that self-made rich people are driven to become so to compensate for their less-than-average looks. Ironically, most of them are so hellbent on remaining rich for posterity that they mate within their \"plain Jane\" peer group, making each subsequent generation homelier than even their unattractive parents. Millions are then spent on plastic surgery (which does nothing to improve the genetics, but that's another story). Darwin explains all this in his Theory of Natural Selection, or Survival of the Fattest. However, long-in-the-tooth Linus thinks outside the box, and eventually realizes that what he will save on the expense of an elaborate wedding by eloping with the hired help--combined with lower plastic surgery costs for the spouse and any possible offspring--will cancel out much of the potential gain to be had by marrying a fellow fat cat Miss Moneybags.

His age did not work against him, not at bit of it, but his personality, even his face. I doubt he could smile without looking hardened or sinister, important in much of his work, but not wanted here in romantic comedy. There was the scene coming home in the open car -- his sad line about being ten years younger -- when he looked not like a greying fuddy-duddy wishing he could charm the young beauty next to him, but a thug.Holden looked much more comfortable than in the more celebrated role in SUNSET BOULEVARD. He also was able to display his athletic prowess.The title character displayed her considerable charms in costumes daring, if improbable, for the mid-'50s. Those SHORT shorts and the one piece outfit more dance costume than street clothes. Accordingly . . . I could not take my eyes off her.This is a fine period piece, but allow some social commentary. Bogart's character speaks for the Good Corporation, a philosophy which arose after the Second World War as  reaction to the piratical reputation, businessman as callous heavy, that reached apogee in the 1930s.

            "content": "By 1954, it had been a few years since Billy Wilder's last foray into romantic comedy, and, in any case, he had achieved the bulk of his success with cynical, often darkly-humorous dramas, such as 'Double Indemnity (1944),' 'The Lost Weekend (1945),' 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' and, most recently, 'Stalag 17 (1953).' His adaptation of Samuel A. Taylor popular play, \"Sabrina Fair,\" marked a significant turning-point in Wilder's career, and it was only after 'Sabrina (1954)' that the director became celebrated as one of Hollywood's finest entertainers, triggering such acclaim that he effectively dedicated the remainder of his film-making days to producing comedy. With a cast to make any film producer salivate at the mouth \u0096 Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Audrey Hepburn \u0096 the film is an engaging Cinderella story {in contrast to Hepburn's previous breakthrough performance in 'Roman Holiday (1953),' which might be described as Cinderella in reverse}, and seems very conspicuous among the director's body of work, but pure Wilder is countless other regards.Sabrina Fairchild (Hepburn, looking impossibly elegant) is the daughter of a chauffeur, and has spent her childhood and adolescent years idolising the youngest son of the wealthy family by whom her father is employed. However, haughty playboy David Larrabee does not share her affections, and, indeed, hardly acknowledges that she even exists. After a two-year absence in Paris, during which she almost comes to forget her irrational crush, Sabrina returns to Long Island as an elegant and mature young woman, and it doesn't take long for David to sit up and take notice of what he's been missing. However, David's weary, business-orientated older brother, Linus (Bogart), fears that such a romance will prove detrimental to an approaching business contract, and so ventures to deflect the imminent passion by showering Sabrina with affections of his own. Meanwhile, the young woman's chauffeur father, Thomas Fairchild (John Williams), silently stresses that his daughter is attempting to break the class barrier, and his wealthy employer (Walter Hampden) is likewise thrown into panic at the very thought.The film's screenplay, written by Wilder, Taylor and Ernest Lehman, is smart and brisk, constantly moving forwards, though never into unexpected territory. The acting is universally excellent, with the performers each finding a steady balance between romance and comedy, and Bogart {just three years from his premature death} obviously relished the opportunity to abandon his typical tough-guy persona and have some fun in a lightweight role. While the story does distinguish itself from its contemporary romantic comedies through several dark episodes, such as Sabrina's attempted suicide and Linus' suspect intentions towards her, Wilder's film is a women's picture through-and-through. The film is sorely missing that trademark cynicism to be found in most of the director's other screenplays, and, by the end of the film, everything has been wrapped up nicely \u0096 perhaps too nicely \u0096 in preparation for a happy ending. As a Wilder picture, it's something of a letdown, but, as far as Cinderella stories are concerned, 'Sabrina' is one of the best.",

            "content": "Sabrina (1954) was directed by Billy Wilder - him of the Sunset Blvd. (1950) and Some Like It Hot (1959) fame - which declares the film worth watching even before we get to the matter of principal cast. The principal cast consisted of Audrey Hepburn (in the titular role of Sabrina Fairchild), William Holden (as David Larrabee, the younger son of a very wealthy family and a thrice-divorced playboy), and Humphrey Bogart (as Linus Larrabee, the older son and industrialist).We meet Sabrina on the eve of her departure to Paris, where she will be studying at the best culinary school for the next couple of years. Her father (beautifully played by John Williams), the chauffeur of the Larrabees, urges Sabrina to pack her bags, but she has other ideas. Two dramatic encounters later - one per Larrabee brother each - the heroine disappears into the pink haze above the Seine. When she returns to the mansion in Glen Cove, Sabrina is equipped with a new hairstyle, a sophisticated wardrobe, and a fierce dedication to joie de vivre. Champagne glasses and hearts get broken.At the time of the film's release, Audrey Hepburn was twenty-five years old, William Holden, thirty-six, and Humphrey Bogart, sixty-four. Bogart's part had been initially offered to Cary Grant (who was fifty - I suppose I have to go on with the statistics here, once started), but Grant declined. Near a decade later, he would star opposite Hepburn in Charade (1963), another example of May-December romance.The work that prompted Sabrina into existence was the play Sabrina Fair: A Woman of the World (1953), written by Samuel A. Taylor. Taylor would start as one of the scriptwriters for the big-screen adaptation of his romantic comedy, but Wilder's extensive revision of the plot saw the playwright quit, to be replaced by Ernest Lehman. Nevertheless, the main elements of the narrative, the bon mots, and - most importantly - the crux of the drama belong to Taylor. Who is the match for our heroine? The matters of personal ideals and social standing were problematic enough to warrant the original comedy of manners, but the casting upset the balance further by increasing the gaps in age and experience. Yet, Billy Wilder - he, who gave us the immortal finale of Some Like it Hot - fit that set-up incredibly well.The film reminds of Oscar Wilde's plays: high society and trivial pleasures, pointed remarks and sincere declarations, elderly relatives who belong to a past era, and the idea that snobbery does not have to be exclusive to the upper classes. There is a bit of absurdity, a lot of situational comedy, and the worst vice exhibited by characters is a certain carelessness of existence. David Larrabee asks his brother why the latter is going to the office on a Saturday. 'It's Wednesday', grimly replies Linus.Sabrina enjoys cocktails with a view across the New York Harbour and wears the most chic dresses (Edith Head received the film's only Oscar for her costume designs, some of which were co-created with Hubert de Givenchy). Seemingly, there are no bad choices in that world, where bitter disappointment can be cured with three new hats, romantic impulses are to be encouraged, and 'La Vie en Rose' starts playing whenever the moment is right.In real life, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden enjoyed a brief but passionate romance on the set of Sabrina. In real life, sixty-four-year-old Humphrey Bogard was married to Lauren Bacall, thirty years of age at the time. They, of course, would remain together until his death.",

The go-after-her trope is something that we see a lot of today as it was popularized in rom-coms in the 80's and 90's. Sabrina was played by Audrey Hepburn and she was the chauffeur's daughter. She was in love with David Larrabee (Willam Holden), the younger son of the uber-wealthy Oliver Larrabee (Walter Hampden) and the younger brother of Linus Larrabee (Humphrey Bogart).David was an irresponsible playboy. He had no interest in the family business and frequently blew off his responsibilities. His only interest was in women--and he had a lot of them. He hardly noticed Sabrina Fairchild though she ogled him every chance she got.After Sabrina was sent to Paris to become a chef, she came back to New York a new person. She left as a plain girl and came back a stunning woman. It was then that David took notice of her. It didn't matter to David at all that he was engaged, his eyes were on someone new. It didn't matter to Sabrina either that David was engaged, she wanted the man she'd been in love with for years.It did matter to Linus that David was engaged. David was set to marry Elizabeth Tyson (Martha Hyer), the daughter of a wealthy plastics magnate. David marrying Elizabeth made it all the easier for the Larrabee Corporation to merge with Tyson's company. Linus decided he would kindly get rid of Sabrina so that she would not be a hindrance.It was when Linus was in the process of kindly removing Sabrina from the picture that the two fell in love. That set up the \"go after her\" scenario we got at the end.I'm quite surprised I liked this movie as much as I did. It is a romantic comedy, which I generally detest, but it has a certain quality and air about it which makes it not sappy. Part of it is Audrey Hepburn and part of it is the era. It was done differently and it wasn't the cliche that rom-coms have become. It had the miscommunication-heartbreak-separation element, but it fit better into the movie and didn't make me roll my eyes as I often do with later movies containing the same sequence of events. \"Sabrina\" is what later rom-coms could only hope to be.Free on PlutoTV.",

The movie may not end as the audience wants it to, but deep down we know that it is the way it should have ended.

Bogie is uninvolved and uninvolving, reads his lines dutifully, and has NO chemistry with Hepburn. The only advantage of his casting (as opposed to Grant) is that the romance isn't a foregone conclusion--Bogie's romantic days were behind him. And shoulda stayed there. Holden is 10 years and several previous Wilders too old for his carefree playboy--the bad bleach job just makes him look older. At least he and AH have some on-screen chemistry (and a lot more off-screen). Not much of a comedy, all in all, and no romance. Audrey carries it, and carries it off, both with ease",

The cast is certainly great, the dialog is often clever and has a way of livening up and energizing the moment, but unfortunately that's not enough to keep the ship afloat and the film very often turns into an very tedious display of overwrought emotions, by overwrought people - Hepburn in particularly. I like the humor of the film immensely and if it were a comedy, and only a comedy, it would be a breeze to watch.After seeing Sabrina for the first and only time I can confidently conclude that not one, but two cinematic first's where achieved. Firstly, a guy named \"Linus\" gets the girl at the end. A lady-killer named Linus? That doesn't exist. Secondly, evidently there's such a thing as a \"hemorrhoid hammock\" and wow that one really turned my existence up-side down. Isn't it simply just amazing at what comes to light sometimes and this movie was made 65 years ago, so on that note it was definitely ahead of it's time. And don't under-estimate the importance of that hammock.The individual performances are all top-notch, Bogart still had the spark, Holden is rarely if ever more energetic and Audrey.....well she cry's a lot as the titular lead-character and at that stage in her life she looked a lot like a less impressive/less exotic version of Sophia Loren - but with much bigger feet (size 10). Not to say that's all that she does. Hepburn, Holden and Bogart all seem to have an equal amount of bright moments and snappy dialog, she often projects an air of sly wit, which is only intensified by her bright and beautiful eyes.It must be said, how beautiful Hepburn's eyes appear in any given scene in this film, the light seems to reflect off them just right.I can confidently say that by no means is this Billy Wilder's best work, that would be Sunset Boulevard for me, but also likely not to be his worst, either.But really I'd just like to know who had the idea for that hammock...",

I think Roman Holiday was just an unconscious prediction of what would come. And that shows here, the moment Sabrina comes back from Paris. Audrey had probably so much of natural ability to captivate sweet attentions on-screen as she of intentional poses. She works with her face above all, also with her pose and her walking (in a distance plan, she works with her subtle body movements). She danced, ballet, that probably counts for the effect. But besides that, there was a collective effort involving many (very) competent people, that would eventually make her the person with more class and charm on screen. Givenchy had a lot to do with this, in my opinion. This makes this film particularly important to watch, for it has the very precise moment in which, on screen, the changing happens. Givenchy only dresses Hepburn after Sabrina comes back from Paris. With the clothes, she assumes a new pose, everlasting, i would say.The film exists to frame the precise moment of this transformation, so the Cinderella set up is used. I think this was all deliberate, and cleverly conceived. So we, viewers, come to fall in love with Audrey, Bogart and Holden represent us on screen, falling in love with Sabrina.A side note is there i think it's not immediate this fascination for the on screen character of Hepburn. Her face captivates, despite its funny look (which would later name other Audrey dedicated film), but her class takes time to absorb. Probably that's why her characters came to love older men in her films.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

In this case, two ... Prince. One is good-natured, but spoiled womanizer and the other is a workaholic and businessman.This is an extremely funny comedy, which somehow works unconvincing. Love is gentle, but it lacks of sincerity.The film is emphasized by certain forms of irony. The story is fabulous and, fortunately, is not intrusive. The emphasis is on humor, from which permeate some serious romantic scenes. Everything is simple, even predictable. However, therein lies the beauty of this film. The scenario is quite \"washed\" and definitely could have been better. Characterization is satisfactory. The focus is on the relationship between daughter and father. That relationship really works extraordinarily.Actors are the biggest advantages of this film. I'm not particularly brag acting. Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina Fairchild is naive, enthusiastic and charming girl who wins with her eyes and a smile and simply exudes warmth and tenderness. Ms. Hepburn was a beautiful lady with a lot of style and acting range. Humphrey Bogart as Linus Larrabee is pretty slick and really in this film can be seen ease of his acting. Workaholic stumbles because of true love. It's a little too much for Mr. Bogart. William Holden as David Larrabee is excellent in the role of a spoiled playboy, who in the most important part of the film has to remove the glass from his own ass. It is a simple flaw in the script. Otherwise, I am convinced that we should enjoyed in excellent and very comical love triangle. John Williams as Thomas Fairchild, Sabrina's father is my favorite in the movie, very funny and excellent in his comments relating to the class difference.Well, this is a typical Hollywood comedy with outstanding actors.",

Again I looked for shortcomings, but again failed, although there is something that strongly influenced the final assessment, but I will mention this in a separate paragraph, but for now, let your humble servant focus your attention on the obvious advantages of this melodrama.\nSo, here they are:\n1. Scenario - it is another variation of my favorite fairy tale \"Cinderella\", but this time it was transferred to America of the twentieth century. Sabrina is the daughter of a chauffeur who has been working hard for a long time in the Larrabi family - representatives of the upper bourgeoisie. The girl is in love with David - a dissolute representative of a glorious family. But a trip to Paris changes the girl beyond recognition, and then Linus, David's brother, comes into play. Well, then there is a series of events that lead to the ending (which I will mention). Despite the fact that \"Cinderella\" is very often transferred to the screen, each with its own fa\u00e7ade, no one dares to touch the base, since it is universal. Here, too, I thought that I would get bored, but I was in for a surprise, because one moment made me closely follow the development of history.\n2. What will Sabrina decide? - I was entirely on the side of this enthusiastic girl who fell in love with a man unworthy of her love and hands (I argue like a housewife, honestly). This unworthy person does not even notice her attention. But the other is clearly supportive, though not devoid of some unpleasant character traits. I rushed about the whole picture and hoped that she would choose a worthy one. How did it all end? See for yourself and see for yourself!\n3. Final - because of this throwing, I thought how this whole canetel would end. I made two options, thought, reasonably weighed the reasons for both, but everything ended predictably, but no less impressive than it should have been. You led me by the nose Sabrina. Oh and led!\n4. Audrey Hepburn - dazzling, gorgeous and charming, as always! Audrey is the real gem of this picture and perhaps the only reason to watch this picture. It is simply impossible to imagine another actress in her place. Audrey did not let me down again, and the acting is at the highest level. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Well, her dresses are worthy of attention, even in spite of such a trifle as a black and white image. Even so, they are admirable.\n5. Humor - you shouldn't expect wild laughter, but a lot of funny situations will make you laugh and smile. This is not a romantic comedy, but pure melodrama. In general, there is humor, and it dilutes the harsh melodramatic everyday life.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Sabrina performed by Audrey Hepburn is a young beauty, hopelessly in love with an unworthy person who does not even notice it. Finds the strength to overcome this feeling, the path even for this took several years and a series of tests. A delicate flower that is simply impossible not to notice. Emotions, a spark in the soul and on the screen, complete immersion in the inner world of her heroine - and at the exit we get a magnificent Audrey, who showed us Cinderella, with a fabulous soul, but in a modern wrapper, so to speak. Touching, emotional and strong. Bravo Audrey again! Bravo!\n2. David Larrabee performed by William Holden is the same unworthy man who took Sabrina's heart. A showman, a merry fellow and a rake who causes only mild irritation. Although sometimes he shows himself as an honest and decent person. But rarely. William played the role quite well.\n3. Linus Larrabee performed by Humphrey Bogart is David's brother. Typical \"business shark\" who gives himself up to his work almost without a trace. She undertakes to help her brother resolve the issue with Sabrina, since the father of the family is extremely unhappy with David's choice. Well, you understand the \"simpleton\" has no place in the circle of the bourgeoisie. Honest, humble, but practically devoid of emotions and not versed in matters of love. Humphrey did an excellent job with such a difficult role.\nNow a little about the circumstances that influenced the final assessment. One plot twist that no one explained, even in dialogue, as if the event had no meaning at all in the context of the story (which is not true). And another frankly stupid moment that knocks out the mood of the picture. I did not find any memorable music for myself. But that's all.\nIn 1995, the eponymous \"remake\" was released with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond. But I will not watch it on principle, because, as I wrote above, except for Audrey in this role, I do not see anyone.\nAs a result, it has a good melodrama about the next variation of \"Cinderella\" with the participation of the magnificent Audrey Hepburn, a good and even exciting script, good intrigue, pleasant and relaxing humor and good acting!\nMy rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

Bogart is a totally unconvincing love interest and we see no reason Sabrina would fall for him after being infatuated with David her whole life, especially after he admits he was only using her for his financial gain. Holden is OK as David, but the character is so shallow, it could have been played by any young male actor just as well. Overall, a blah romantic movie that should have been forgotten long ago.",

Sent away to Paris for two years (partly to learn how to cook, and partly to cure her infatuation), she returns with a sophisticated new look, and finds that he is now infatuated with her.As is clear from the above outline, and from the very beginning of the film which starts with the line \"Once upon a time there was a little girl....\" this film is basically a fairy tale in which Hepburn's Cinderella gets to choose between the two sons of the fabulously wealthy Larrabee family. It features a wonderful cast - William Holden excels as the charming playboy David Larrabee (the original object of Sabrina's affections), and Bogart, somewhat cast against type as a romantic lead, shows a deft touch for comedy as older brother Linus, who attempts to disentangle his brother from Sabrina only to find himself falling for her too.This is a tale which could easily become mawkish, but is kept from doing so by witty dialogue and wonderful physical comedy (Linus manipulating his brother into sitting down on a champagne glass, and then providing him with a hammock with a strategic hole cut out is my favourite, but there are many such moments). But this is Hepburn's film, and she is magnificent. Her transformation from gawky teenager to sophisticated young woman is entirely convincing, and she never looked lovelier.

            "content": "\"Sabrina Fair\" was a very successful Broadway play, written by Samuel A. Taylor, before Taylor and Ernest Lehman turned it into a well-remembered (1954) screenplay for Billy Wilder who also produced the movie. Under Wilder's direction, the project turned into a vehicle film for Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart, instead of Betsy Drake, Van Helflin and Charles Drake,m who could have played the parts believably opposite John Williams as Fairchild (the butler whose daughter Sabrina happens to be). The film retails the story of a girl lost between two worlds who has always been in love with one of the Long Island Larrabee brothers, the oft-married non-working David, but then has to choose between him and his dour, homburg wearing, umbrella toting nose-to-the-grindstone brother Linus as well. Frederick Hollander wrote a breezy score and Charles Lang Jr, provided fine B/W cinematography for the resulting romp. Edith Head provided the high-fashion costumes with uncredited assistance from Hubert de Givenchy. Hal Pereria's and Walter Tyler's Art Direction succeeded throughout, while Sam Comer's and Ray Moyer's set decorations played a subtle but powerful role in bringing the world of the Larrabees to cinematic life. Eugene Loring's choreography enlivened several scenes as well. Among the fine supporting cast, one can notice Emory Parnell, Nancy Kulp, Marjorie Bennett, Marcel Hilaire as the chef, Marcel Dalio as the Baron, Martha Hyer, Joan Vohs, Francis X. Bushman and Nella Walker, Kay Riehl, Walter Hampden as the family patriarch, a miscast Ellen Corby, Raymond Bailey and more familiar favorites, all else well-employed. This is a play with unusually intelligent dialog, whose sub-theme is the degeneration of the U.S. under public-interest lawmaking into what it was to become--an elitism of corporation CEOs, bureaucrats and unworthy gatekeeper 'bosses'. The film's best line may well be the one that suggests that no one ever called a chauffeur's daughter enlightened for marrying a millionaire. The problem with the main actors I suggest is that they are all somewhat miscast. Of the three, Humphrey Bogart gives the best line readings, but he cannot play a successful upper-class professional of any sort. Audrey Hepburn is pretty, fey and surprisingly adept at reading comedy lines for her age, but she never quite seems like an intelligent person who happens to be a chauffeur's daughter who can belong as a grownup to a world of any elite. And William Holden is simply too everything for his part--a bit too old, too polished and too charismatic, as well as trying too hard; his fine steps forward as an actor, however, moving toward \"Picnic\" and his noteworthy later work need to be commended here as well. The film is more thoughtful than one might expect and quite clever in its characterization of human beings stuck in class types within a country that was supposed to have none. Recommended.",

It wouldn't be the usual genre of film that I would typically go for (I prefer Mr Ford when he's fighting Darth Vader).I was even more shocked to find that this original was equally as good if not better. It's hard to say, coming to it as the second version I have personally seen.The beautiful Audrey Hepburn steals any film that she's in, but with William Holden looking so handsome and Humphrey Bogart playing his role so well it was a closely run thing.Audrey was quite simply a coat hanger, she looked gorgeous in everything and the dress she wore to the party was absolutely divine (The mens suits were less obviously nice). And I can say that, because I worked in fashion from the age of sixteen and I've watched loads of episodes of 'Project Runway' and 'The Great British Sewing Bee'.She also played the part with a class and style that has sadly gone out of fashion in later years. She's an interesting and fun character, full of joy to watch.William was charming as the womanising rogue and easy on the eye too, but I think Humphrey fit perfectly in his portrayal of the hard working older brother. It's probably the best performance I've seen from him actually.The story was endearing and a great pleasure to watch with its various characters from all walks of life and situations. I loved old Larrabee and his complete disregard for propriety when it came to drinking, but an old fashioned, if ignored, point of view on people marrying below their station. They seemed to be saying that thinking like that was laughable, which I liked.It's films like these that should be appearing on the Top 100 lists that I am trying to cross off in order to promote good, clean fun and the necessity of a positive romance, as well as laughter making the world go around.620.33/1000.",

Upon her return, the now much older \"David\" (William Holden) offers her a lift and though he doesn't recognise her, it is soon clear that she has lost none of her affections for him, and he now reciprocates. This throws a spanner in the works for the older brother \"Linus\" (Humphrey Bogart) who plans a large scale merger to make his bouncy glass, and that involves his brother marrying the daughter of the partner company. \"David\" is having none of this, but after he has an untimely accident involving his backside and some broken glass, \"Linus\" concocts a plan to send \"Sabrina\" back to France. This erstwhile steely man does not, however, factor in the effect his hanging out with this vibrant and intelligent young woman is going to have on him - and pretty soon he is just as smitten as his brother! John Williams adds value as her stiff upper lipped father; \"Waltons\" fans might recognise Ellen Corby in the role of his hyper-confident secretary \"Miss McCardle\" and Billy Wilder's script is entertaining and witty.

But the LIRR didn't service Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport). in 1954 (and still doesn't), You would have to take a bus or taxi (today a subway) to a LIRR station and then change. Also LIRR is a commuter rail (basically just an above ground subway), not an intercity rail line. This isn't practical for a lady with three suitcases and one dog. She would most likely take a taxi all the way home.At the end of the movie, Linus rushes to a tugboat to join Sabrina on the SS Liberte. Problems:\nTicket had been changed from Linus' name to David's.\nWould the ship stop for a late passenger arriving by tugboat?\nDid Linus have his passport?\nHe had no luggage.\nHe would only have the little cash he was carrying. Except for Diners' Club, charge cards didn't exist.When Linus discussing plans to send Sabrina back to France he points out the Liberte dock (which would have been further north on the west site of Manhattan) from one window.

Well it seemed to be true because watching this film he doesn't seem like he cared for her at all. Poor Audrey.Second, Audrey is much TOO pretty to pass as an unattractive girl in the beginning of the film. This is just like what happened in \"My Fair Lady\". She is a goddess. How can any man in his right mind NOT be interested in her. PLEASE!! You can not make her unattractive. So putting her in this part just doesn't work. Especially with BOGIE! Don't get me wrong. I love Ms. Hepburn, and in this film she is very charming just too pretty.\nThe only one who gets it right is William Holden. He is a charm as the younger playboy brother. In the movies he rarely got it wrong. The relationship between the characters Bogie/Holden and Hepburn/Holden were played well on screen. The rest of the cast were fine and at least helped make this film some what enjoyable. It just ticks me off thinking that this could have been so much better if the casting had been different. Sorry people, I am just a stickler for believablity. My recommendation: The remake of \"Sabrina\" made in 1995 is MUCH BETTER. Now they got it right! Pass this one by like it never existed....",

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart so often played the self-assured man, and he was no less that character here.  It is surprising, in fact, and then almost painful to watch him come to terms with his own heart despite his best efforts.Audrey Hepburn plays the female lead with all her usual grace and charm. It is magical to see her torn, transformed and torn again all while maintaining her incredible beauty and style.I can't miss mention of William Holden, a great actor in his own right, as the playboy brother who, in the end, proves to be the savior of all, even the family business!I found myself laughing and hopeful throughout this delightful film, one that now joins my personal list of Great Movies.",

I thought the acting in both movies was tremendous. While enjoying both versions I must admit the 1954 in color was impressive. My wife and I also enjoyed the wholesome presentation. We have since bought both copies DVD but again would like the 1954 in color. Thank you for the opportunity to share thoughts and ask questions. This has been a fine website to get introduced to. I hope to return here often. Thanks to those who took the time to read and even possibly respond.",

            "content": "What does it tell about me that I'm so thrilled by the movie \"Sabrina\"? I first saw it (the original) once or perhaps more than once when I was a teen. It did impress me but I sort of forgot about it. As a grown-up I heard of the remake and as a fan of Harrison Ford bought the video. I loved it and watched it several times.Now, I finally got back to the original as it was sold on DVD for a nice price. The old magic is back and even stronger. Emotionally, this script and both its interpretations capture me. In my opinion both versions have excellent casts including the supporting characters. Scripts and dialogs are witty and captivating. In retrospect it is really amazing how similar both versions are regarding the script as well as their mental effect on me. The newer one seems to be just this: a nicely refreshed version of the original one.After watching Sabrina of 1954 again, I read from different sources about the trouble between Bogart and his co-stars. This knowledge took a little from my genuine pleasure. On the other hand a certain dislike of Hepburn by Bogart might even have helped to make him believable as Linus. I suppose he's meant to struggle against his feelings for Sabrina - and this shows in a subtle way (even if it might be Bogart trying to hide his lack of interest in Hepburn).There are several absolutely funny scenes in the movie but my favorite scene is the dancing scene with Sabrina and Linus in the indoor tennis court. It's wonderfully written and performed great - even more regarding the possible problems between the two leads. It shows a good deal of chemistry - at least in my opinion.I'll continue to watch and enjoy both versions of the movie probably because I'm a romantic at heart and true romance is so scarce in today's world.",

            "content": "Long Island is the place where the wealthy Larabees live. The family consists of four people, father and mother and two sons, David and Linus. They have anything you can imagine at their mansion, big rooms, sports grounds, luxurious cars, and so on. Life there is like life in paradise. They have a chauffeur called Fairchild who has a shy, awkward, very young daughter called Sabrina. Sabrina has been in love with David, the younger boy, all her life. David is a playboy who has been married three times and divorced every time. She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself \" I don't want to run away from life any more.\" David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.",
