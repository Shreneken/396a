{"rating": 7.8, "release_date": "2020-01-24", "num_reviews": 1734, "genres": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime"], "summary": "An American expat tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.", "Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully": "Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.", "That's Hugh Grant?! It seems so unlike him in his other films!": "Aside from a few very marketable films like \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" and \"Aladdin\", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\"....and so it's not surprising I'd see \"The Gentlemen\". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, \"Swept Away\", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn't really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.", "Guy Ritchie": "\"There's only one rule in the jungle, when the lion's s is hungry, he eats\"\nEverything is perfect. This is the movie you can rewatch many times but didn't get bored.", "Guy's Best Since Snatch.": "It's Guy Ritchies Best since Snatch, it's where he is most playful and comfortable in a film genre he knows well.\nThe Cast is perfectly picked, especially Hugh Grant giving a different but yet so funny performance.\nSit back and enjoy 2 hours of a British crime drama, which doesn't take itself too serious\nIf we hadn't had lock stock or snatch then this would possibly looked at in a more classic Ritchie film so don't expect it to be as great as those.", "Perfect slow burn": "At first I thought it started a little slowly but in hindsight it was just right. A perfect execution of a classic British gangster film epitomised by a charismatic Colin Farrell who stole every scene he entered and left me crying out for a coach spin off. All in all very enjoyable classic guy ritchie film.", "Ritchie Back In Form": "Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for \u00a3400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.Guy Ritchie has returned to his early themes of violence, chaos, and rock&roll from his early career, and has scored a definite hit, with some fine performances, including a blank-faced one by Charlie Hunnam and an outsized comedy turn by Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant does well as the unwanted on-screen narrator of events, putting them into some order; I am impressed by his lack of a posh accent, event as I wished Ritchie had been able to think of a better way of telling the audience the story.Even with that cavil, the unceasing action and insanity kept me more than interested throughout.", "A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!": "The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.Although his 'Aladdin' made a ton of money, critically the film was a disaster. His return to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood-covered-class, is as refreshing as it is entertaining. The film's script deals with two storylines at the same time, almost breaking the fourth wall with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on today's Hollywood and how big movie studios are hungry for some original yet overly mainstream basic content, to lure people into cinemas to go watch their films.Beginning with a quick flash forward that ends with a bang and a pair of brains splattered all over a pint and a pickled egg at a typical British pub, we dial it back to a quiet evening at Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) cosy house. When private investigator and intrusive sly fox, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), turns up at his house, he explains he has been keeping an eye on the different gangs around town for quite a while. Narrating most of the film and making some stuff up to make things more spectacular for himself, he reads his mostly finished movie script to Raymond, bribing him into funding his little project, or else he'll leak all the information he has on Raymond's boss Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a white trash American expat who has build himself a marijuana empire.Mickey is tired of the business and is trying to sell his highly profitable company to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. But when one of the underground weed-plantations gets raided by a group of British lads, filming the entire thing and posting it on YouTube as some sort of fight--music-video, it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses haven't been exactly honest about their meetings and loyalty towards each other. This is when the real war begins - while keeping it classy.Ritchie co-wrote the story with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who haven't written anything before. The idea of the entire film is prodigious, but the screenplay and dialogue is simply unprecedented by Ritchie himself, bringing joke after joke, while taking you on a thrilling ride full of genius twists and new ways to incorporate classic gangster cinema - Ritchie-style. Composer Christopher Benstead is debuting his very first score for a feature film with The Gentlemen, and knows exactly how to set the tone and drive it up to an eleven. A promising talent that won't go unnoticed.Ritchie introduces new characters throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, surprising them with actual cinema, getting the best angles and money shots, thanks to his cinematographer Alan Stewart (Aladdin). When adding layer after layer to the story, going deeper into the underground scene, adding a new protagonist who's into human trafficking and Mickey's queen and wife, the cockney Cleopatra, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), who owns a sanctuary for the ladies as some sort of business coverup to her husband's weed-empire, it becomes clear every role has a purpose and there are no extras involved in this story. One of the best acting ensembles in recent cinema history, and a welcome reminder from McConnaughey as to why he won an Oscar in the first place. But it's Colin Farrell (as the highly entertaining 'Coach') and Hugh Grant who steal every scene they're in with their remarkable wit that'll for sure land them some BAFTA-nominations.'The Gentlemen' is a ruthless first-class kick in the teeth. Do not let the failures of Ritchie's recent career choices scare you, as this is actually one of the best films he's ever made. Who knew Guy Ritchie could raise the bar not just for himself, but for everyone out there trying to brush him off as a has been. 2020 is off to a great start!", "Guy Richie back to his best": "After seeing the film at an advanced screening I was left pleasently surprised. It is one of the best crime films I have watched and the best from Guy Ritchie...even better than Snatch and Lock Stock, which is something.From the acting to the story, cinematography, pacing, dialogue, humour and overall enjoyment I cannot fault it...10/10. Special credit goes to Colin Farrell and his acting.We dont really get movies like this anymore. Movies these days are cheap money grabbers and superhero films. This is a whole different class of film", "I don't understand the critics, this is brilliant.": "The writing, directing, acting and the general production are all top notch. I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. This will go down as a cult classic, so do not miss it.", "Snap, Crackle, and Oink": "Whip-smart 1-2-3 dialogue and film-editing, tension, some seriously laugh-out-loud moments, and a killer unorthodox script equals The Gentlemen.There are a lot of similarities to Knives Out within, but it would be a disservice to say it's only a Knives Out - Guy Ritchie version, because this film deserves to stand on its own merits.It's violent, it goes out of its way to be as anti-PC as possible, and its most definitely not for children under the age of 15...but most of all, it's highly enjoyable. All the performances are excellent. I can't fault this movie in any way. Maybe it isn't the bestest movie evar, but I can safely say it will be one of the best of 2020.Charlie Hunnam is legitimately scary. McConaughey nails his role. Colin Farrell has a great comedic role. All the accents are spot on. Please give me more of this.", "Hugh Grant is amazing": "Fun film! I was greatly impressed with Hugh Grant's performance. Had to do a double take when he first appeared on the screen. Colin Farrell was a scene stealer and Michelle Dockery makes a great mob wife.", "What an excellent film": "Every now and again I go to the cinema and watch a film that grabs my attention straight away and keeps it right to the end. This is one of those films. What entertainment! Better than anything else I have seen for a considerable time.", "It's not enough to act like the king, you have to BE the king.": "This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.", "\"I'm basing my crescendo on the sum of it's parts.\"": "Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of \"Rocknrolla\", \"Snatch\", and \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.This one doesn't seem to be as hard to follow as the earlier mentioned films. All of them prompted a second viewing to catch all the nuance of the characters, but this one, even with the chronology going back and forth, was pretty straightforward. That's probably due to the format, essentially a narration of events by journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) relating his investigative work to Pearson's right hand man, bodyguard and driver Raymond (Charlie Hunnam). Colin Farrell's character is simply known as 'Coach', and he's drawn into the story by virtue of his gangsta underlings botching a take down of one of Pearson's weed farms. What could have been an ancillary character winds up being central to the outcome of the story.And just about when you think it's over, another twist occurs with the introduction of a Russian oligarch and his mission of revenge for the death of his son. All the while you have to wonder how the picture's principal character, that would be Pearson, manages to come out of the story intact, considering all the bad guys who want to do him in. It's a fun watch if you go for this kind of stuff, made all the merrier by the script's creative use of the English language. You know, maybe I will watch this all over again.", "For THE film to watch and THE tracksuits to wear in 2020, look no further than The Gentlemen": "In Love Actually, Hugh Grant, who coincidentally also lends his acting talents to The Gentlemen, tells a group of reporters: \"We may be a small country, but we're a great one too. (The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.\"Well, in my opinion, he forgot to mention Guy Ritchie, who is known for his gangster films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) among others, as well as the Sherlock Holmes' films of 2009 and 2011. With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool \u00a3400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master. With a deft and artful hand and sure command of his narrative threads, he has fun rearranging the linearity of the story (which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing), and delivers something close to a masterpiece.8.7/10", "Must hold the record for the most frequent use of the 'C' word.": "Having spent a decade or so making Hollywood blockbusters (with varying degrees of success), director Guy Ritchie returns to the genre that first made him famous: Tarantino \u00e0 la UK. Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.This time around, the ace in Ritchie's hand is Hugh Grant, who brilliantly plays pivotal character Fletcher, a tabloid reporter who tries to blackmail powerful drug lord Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), threatening to publish an extremely damaging story if he doesn't receive a payment of \u00a320m within 72 hours. The film unfolds as Fletcher tells Pearson's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) the story of how he gathered the dirt on his boss. Grant's performance is pure genius: playing against type he is seriously sleazy and frequently hilarious.Not that the rest of the cast are any slouches: Hunnam is cool and badass, Colin Farrell displays a keen comedic touch as tough gym owner Coach, McConaughey is his usual affable self (but with a seriously dangerous edge), Michelle Dockery impresses as Pearson's spunky wife Rosalind, and Jeremy Strong holds his own as the criminal who wants to buy Pearson's marijuana operation. Even the minor characters are great as well, from the Coach's grime-loving lads 'TheToddlers' to the obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give Ray's 'muscle' the runaround.Ritchie's writing and direction is possibly his best yet, the script sparkling with wit and the visuals both stylish and confident. The dialogue is extremely funny (and loaded with expletives), the violence gloriously OTT, and the characters memorable. It might be a case of Ritchie 'playing it safe' by revisiting familiar territory, but when the result is as entertaining as this, why the hell not?", "Awesome.": "I'm glad Guy Ritchie finally made another of his crime movies once again, it's been awhile. And guess what, it's as good as his other crime comedy movies. It's smart, confusing, well written, unpredictable and funny. Must watch if you love crime comedies.", "Fun Gangster Romp": "The Gentlemen: Wonderful comedy gangster film which though involving savage violence is leavened with a vein of dark humour. An ensemble cast plays out the story of Weed kingpin Mickey Pearson's (Matthew Conaughey) attempts to sell his crime empire. Hugh Grant portrays an annoying private investigator who attempts to blackmail Pearson. Charlie Hunnam is Raymond, Mickey's right-hand man, along with Colin Farrell (leader of an incompetent small gang) he gets the best lines in the movie. When the two of them are together the repartee is razor sharp, great screenplay. Many twists and turns as gang wars break out but there are some really disturbing scenes. I wish this treat had been longer. Written and Directed by Guy Ritchie. 8/10.", "Guy Ritchie at his best": "I am a fan of his movies. Lock stock is a classic. This movie plays on the same lines. It has twists and turns and a fantastic story line. Charlie hunman plays a great part. His accent is actually pretty good. The characters are awesome. Colin Farrell plays a fantastic part. If you liked lock stock you will like this", "Ritchie back at what he does the best. Probably his best movie yet.": "After a couple movies that didn't really fitted Guy Ritchie's style and that were a bit disappointing in my opinion, he's finally back at what he does the best. If you liked Snatch, or Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, you definitely will like The Gentlemen. I thought this one was even better than the two mentioned before. The Gentlemen is a well constructed story that starts slow but that will end in a rollercoaster of emotions. Nice twists, good suspense and action, excellent acting from the entire cast, to me one of the better movies if not the best movie I watched this year and that on the last day of 2020. A perfect ending for a miserable year.", "Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining": "The Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing RocknRolla (2008), The Gentlemen comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema. Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy S&M proponent who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here - if you've seen Lock, Stock or snatch., you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect - but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. The Gentlemen definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around \u00a3400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsan) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him - Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled Bush) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him \u00a320 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable \"cockney Cleopatra\" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices - a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes - Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before - the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes - the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background - gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he \"just hates them junkies,\" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new - traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu - there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.", "Razor sharp script": "Richie's best film since snatch. Hugh Grant gives his best performance. He is simply brilliant , funny, little camp, but deadly. Go and watch ASAP.", "ebtertaining movie": "This is a remarkably entertaining movie. The twists and turns keep you on your toes and the acting is great.\nGood combination of laughs and drama.", "Superb": "Fantastic. Guy Ritchie at his best. Hugh Grant finally (FINALLY!!) playing a different role to any he's done before and does it very very well.", "Not my cup of tea": "I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.Much of the story about the main character (McConaughey's) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant's). So as the narrator character reveals the main character's story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.Maybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it's revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn't overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.Overall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn't seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.I wasn't too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn't understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of \"big reveals\" didn't seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it's better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn't think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn't seem to help the storytelling to me either.I hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money. I know I wish I had stayed away from this one.", "Bloody brilliant.": "This is a bloody brilliant movie.\nThe cast is perfect. Hugh Grant was a delight and Colin Farrell is again like in Horrible Bosses just showing off.If you love movies like Horrible Bosses,Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and The Big Lebowski , this movie is for you.", "A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies.": "I've enjoyed a good portion of Guy Ritchie's filmmaking. While many of his more recent movies rely on franchise appeal (Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Aladdin (2019) are of note), I usually associate his style of filmmaking with the British heist film (like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000)). Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing his recent film, The Gentlemen (2020), as it seemed to be a return to the kind of filmmaking that attracted me to Guy Ritchie films in the first place.Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie has been away from his core movies for so long that he's almost forgotten how to make them. The meta framing with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam was clunky enough that even Hunnam's character was getting bored with the \"telling\" in the exposition provided by Grant's character. Sure, there were a few neat twists here and there, but it was trying so hard to be a meta-movie like Seven Psychopaths (2012) or The Player (1992) that it lost its focus. In the end, it spent too much time trying to interweave the narrator's narrative and the story narrative, and all it ended up with was a jumbled mess of a movie.I didn't feel like the action or cinematography (two elements that defined Ritchie films in the past) was lacking. This was mostly because so much of this movie is told to us via Hugh Grant. Perhaps this was also because the meaningful action didn't even end up being real, but rather the imagined \"movie version\" of events that played so counter to the characters and how they would act as to break the suspension of disbelief. I'd forgive doing this once, but it seemed to happen on more than one occasion, resulting in an annoying \"just kidding\" wink from the narrator far too often. At the very least, The Gentlemen does show the difference between boys trying to be tough and men who are actually tough.A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies, I give The Gentlemen 2.5 stars out of 5.", "Ugh...": "This felt like it was written by a 16 year old who just watched Snatch for the first time.", "No Wedding & Loads of Funerals...": "Guy Ritchie is back in his movie manor of gangsters and plot twists.Hugh Grant is a revelation.Go see it. Nuff Said.", "A Great Way To Start 2020": "The best Guy Ritchie and the most Guy Ritchie movie since Snatch. The ensemble cast is a delight and my only complain is that Henry Golding should have had more screen time. There all the perfect ingredients we expect in a comedy crime thriller filled with witty dialogues and twists.Matthew McConaughey finally gets his much need break since Interstellar and he is very convincing as an American expat in London. The screenplay obviously has been influenced by Tarantino's films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but nevertheless it works. This is the most fun I have ever had in a cinema since Game Night", "Ritchie lost all of the orginality he once had": "Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorite comedies of all time... and The Gentlemen is trying to be that and Snatch but massively fails. The jokes aren't funny, the whole movie's humor is based around racist and sexual jokes... The plot is quite simple and all the characters are unlikeable, like I didn't care for any of the characters. Also, the rape scene was so out of the place. Yes the movie is entertaining but I don't think it adds something new to Ritchie's filmography (feels like recycled stuff from his other movies) and I don't think I will watch this again soon.", "Good British gangster story.": "'The Gentlemen' is a return to Guy Ritchie's return to form. While no 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels', it's a mostly fun British gangster romp, with a token American, this time Mickey (McConaughey) as the pot-dealing kingpin. It's ironic in that they are mostly gentlemen in how they dress and how they speak, except or the number of c-bombs dropped! Great cast, but lots of players, so no one gets much of a chance to shine.Mickey's tale of selling his drug empire to Mathew (Strong) is told via a long discussion between Fletcher (Grant), a journalist, and Raymond (Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand-man. Grant is pretty funny trying to do a possibly Welsh accent. The device of using the discussion to show the narrative, means the film can go back and correct the story when it needs to. There's a few twists and turns and while it's fun watching Grant and Hunnam, the film really picks up in the final act when we're in \"real time\". Good to see Farrell have fun, as well as Golding and Dockery.The main problem with the narrative device is that Mickey doesn't seem real and McConaughey's character isn't really fleshed out. Solid ending, but not really enough action or drama to engage throughout. Some funny moments, but not really laugh-out-loud for the most part.", "A facsimile": "It goes through all of the expected motions but it is just a facsimile, a pale copy, of the original it wants to be.Soft actors playing hard parts.A good movie to watch if you gave something more interesting to be doing at the same time.", "Mildly Entertaining...": "... but ultimately a valueless piece of cinema or film. There are far better purveyors of mindless violence around if that's your thing - unoriginal and nothing you haven't seen before. Poor person's Tarantino at best.", "All over the place": "It might have become better later but after 25 minutes I just did not care and turned it off. What is it with modern films that just jump all over the place leaving you to pick up the parts and try to make sense of them, and more often than not it just isn't worth the effort.", "Ritchie delivers": "Guy Ritchie has always been hit or miss with me especially in recent years but it is safe to say that this film is arguably his best and definitely up there with Lock Stock and Snatch.It does take maybe 20 minutes to get going and get great but once it does, it's fantastic. It's hilarious and a great intelligent crime film.Everyone is terrific here. All delivering great performances. For me the stand out was Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell who provide some of the best moments of the film.It's a very creative and stylish film and I wouldn't say there are many flaws in the film. It's a story which gets a fresh and unique take on it and Guy Ritchie really out did himself here.Also \"old McDonald had a farm\" is used hilariously here.", "Stunning return for British crime capers": "You can't take it from him, Guy delivers a gut wrenching yet fun and often laugh out loud British crime flick. The script was an absolute delight with some of the best dialogue I have heard in a very long time, delivered to perfection by all the main cast. It's a delight having a director and writer like Guy to keep the movie industry fresh, we need more original content like this being rewarded for originality.The cast, well Hugh Grant was fantastic, you quickly realise Grants been underused in films, he has range and this shines through. Colin Farrell too was an absolute standout when on screen, he stole the scenes and had me in stitches. The cast in general though were all brilliant, many many standout scenes.You have to watch this movie, supporting movies like this is important, original content is hard to come by and we need more of it. And trust me, you can't not enjoy this!", "Not that memorable! 5/10": "Review:\nWhen I heard that Guy Ritchie had returned to his old style of directing with this movie, I was excited to see it, especially when I heard that Hugh Grant was playing a cockney geezer, but I must admit, I was pretty disappointed with the final product. It didn't have that funny and clever wit, that we have all grown to love from Guy Ritchie's earlier films, and the swearing seemed inappropriate and over the top in places. The back and forth of the storyline spoilt the flow of the film, and it felt messy in places. Although people were praising the cast's performances, I thought that all of them was a weird choice for there roles, and I must admit, I fell asleep halfway through the film. There were a couple of strokes of genius, like the freezer scene towards the end, and when McConaughey saved his wife, but most of it wasn't that memorable. Personally, I would have used Colin Farell's character much more throughout the film, and there should have been more character building because I couldn't care less who lived or died. It really reminded me of Get Shorty, in terms of McConaughey trying to correct his mistakes in life, but the fact that comedy element was missing, really let the movie down. In all, it's another one watch in my eyes, and I personally think that Guy Ritchie has lost his touch. Average!Round-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Guy Ritchie, who also brought you Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Swept Away, Revolver, RocknRolla, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the Man from U.N.C.L.E., King Arthur and Aladdin. Like Quentin Tarantino, he seems to have lost his passion for movie making of late, after a boost to the big time with his earlier movies, and I personally can't see him making another film that will touch them. As for this movie, he did try his utmost to bring back the golden years, with the cockney gangsters and heavy soundtrack, but it was a right mess. With another Aladdin movie in the pipeline, along with 2 other films called Empire Rising and Cash Truck, I personally can't see them pushing him back into the big leagues, which is a shame because I can still watch his earlier movies, over and over again.Budget: $22million\nWorldwide Gross: $115.2millionGenre: Action, Comedy, Crime\nCast: Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, Jeremy Strong, Lynne Renee, Henry Golding, Tom Wu, Eddie Marsan, John Dagleish and Jordan Long. 5/10", "Play a game with me, Guy.": "'The Gentlemen (2020)' is fine, consistently engaging and occasionally quite fun. It does have a plethora of problems, though. First of all, it's never quite clear just who we're supposed to be rooting for. This doesn't feel intentional and seems to be the result of its odd, flashback-based structure. There isn't a great sense of escalation and the pace remains mostly consistent. The narrative doesn't catch up with itself until far too late and, even then, it's annoying how most of the story is told via narrated exposition to someone apparently directly involved with most of its events. Secondly, the flick is simply an amalgamation of genre tropes and stock characters, almost exactly what you expect from a Guy Ritchie movie that isn't 'Aladdin (2019)'. The characters aren't really given the time necessary to develop properly; they're always walking stereotypes. Some of them even seem like stand-ins for the director himself, with talk of \"proper cinema\" and references to films like 'The Conversation (1973)' being \"a bit boring\". Finally, the flick is kind of racist. Almost every character makes some kind of racist remark, mainly against members of Asian and Black communities, and it's often used for supposed 'humour'. The worst offence is probably when a major character says another has a 'black heart' while specifically referencing race. The flick's treatment of women isn't much better, with the only female character coming under the threat of rape just so she can be violently saved by a white man. It all feels outdated, like someone scrambling against apparent 'PC gone mad'. Plus, a lot of time is strangely spent trying to justify its problematic elements; characters have discussions about whether or not certain racist remarks are actually racist. All of this results in an affair that only sours with time, staying in your mind just long enough for you to consider its faults and then slipping away into complete obscurity. It's really forgettable, probably because it's so generic. It's not terrible, though. As I mentioned, it's often quite enjoyable and it's always engaging. Hugh Grant's scene-stealing performance is a real highlight, too. It's messy and misjudged but it's entertaining enough to keep you in your seat. 5/10", "Guy Ritichie is now his own cliche": "If you've seen any of these criminal Guy Ritchie movies, you've already seen this. It's no Lock, Stock, and Smoking Barrel. It's not even Snatch. It's like Scorsese making Good Fellas for the 5th time in a row with slightly different characters, but MUCH worse dialog. It's worth 5 stars only because it's not horrible, the acting is alright, the technical aspects are fine... It's just boring, and it's been done to death by this director and Steven Soderbergh's Oceans movies. What a waste of everyone's time and efforts. Oh well. At least it's 30 minutes longer than it needs to be.", "This film is brilliant": "I don't understand the bad reviews, this film is amazing. It hooks you in and the acting is just phenomenal. Charlie Hunnan was electric !", "Guy Ritchie is directing the same movie over and over again": "Enjoyable but nothing new.\nSame movie like his old ones.", "Love this perfect film": "The acting, direction and the cast was near perfect. The story was so well cooked that the climax was rewarding. Need Guy to direct more of such? Isn't the TV series on this on the way? Hell yeah", "Familiar Territory, but Guy Ritchie in Best Form": "In all Guy Ritchie's crime caper movies there is, perhaps, an amorality and glorification of violence which ordinarily I would find unedifying. But only once, in the morally bankrupt RocknRolla, did this ruin the film and have me booing, metaphorically, at the end; his undoubted talent as a filmmaker has glossed over these shortcomings on all other occasions.The Gentlemen is the latest in the series, written and directed by Mr Ritchie. Matthew McConaughey plays drug lord Mickey Pearson who is looking to sell his British interests, attracting the attention of other underworld figures keen to inherit his thriving empire.Guy Ritchie's sharp direction and non-lateral storytelling are on top form. The script is crisp and witty, the continual plot twists keep you on your toes. If you feel some of the Mockney dialogue is a little bombastic, well, it'd be like going to watch a Carry On film and then complaining about double entendres - over the top dialogue is what he does; it's his trademark. And his homage to The Long Good Friday is a nice touch and contains a further surprise.Most of the cast are also on top form, clearly enjoying themselves. Special mention to Hugh Grant playing a seedily odious private investigator-cum-blackmailer. His portrayal is something of a meta joke, channelling his hatred of the British tabloid hacks who have famously pursued the illegal tactics which his character practices. Perhaps the only failure is Henry Golding, in his first role outside rom-com, not quite convincing as a would-be Pablo Escobar. And it's a shame the excellent Colin Farrell's role isn't beefed up more. But these are mere quibbles.The Gentlemen is a fast paced and laugh out loud action movie, an enjoyable holiday treat for adults.", "can only watch it once!": "It shows how to be the king of jungle not just by acting but be the king. The story telling by Hugh is ok. The becoming of kingpin is shown quickly but is justified by the way he plans everything and executes it. loyality over anything. Some open ends. But overall funny. The slieght of hand by Guy Ritchie is impressive.", "Critics are idiots": "This was a great movie.Flawless acting with a great story. Solid directing, solid everything...Colin Ferrell stole the show for me as he killed every scene he was in.", "When the lion is hungry, he eats.": "Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) grows and sells pot in England. Perhaps not the best gangster business to be in, but they make it look good. Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a private investigator who claims to have the goods on Mickey. He is discussing the details of the shakedown with Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's right-hand man. The film story is told as flashbacks. In the opening cliche teaser scene it appears Mickey is shot, but we know that can't be so because this feature follows too many film formulas, so we see the \"twists\" coming including who set up the raid on Mickey.It wasn't a bad film except I didn't like how it jumped. It introduced too many players. The whole pot idea didn't fly, but as a tough guy film, it was all right.Guide; F-word. brief rape. No nudity.", "Clever Funny Sophisticated Crime romp": "Our 2nd new Movie of the year was so opposite to Little Women in character but turned out just as enjoyable in a very different way.My Review - The Gentleman. My Rating 8.5 /10The trailers for The Gentlemen doesn't give a lot away and either will my Review except to say if you enjoyed the classic black comedy In Bruges (2008) with Colin Farrell,who is one of \"The Gentlemen \" or Guy Ritchie's \"The Snatch \"2000 you should really enjoy this film.If really full on swearing especially the 'C\" word offends you ( it doesn't bother me at all if it fits the characters but it may not be your cup of tea.\nThere is violence more implied and not graphic and the plots fast paced and convoluted but it's so clever and original and very very funny in parts .I'm really looking forward to seeing it again to catch up on a few plot lines that passed me by.\nThe performances are all top class especially Hugh Grant who I've never considered a really great actor but I've change my mind after today.\nIn fact his performances in the last few films he's been in like A Very English Scandal and Paddington 2 up until The Gentlemen I would say have been his best acting roles.\nHe is cast in The Gentlemen as Fletcher a Private Investigator trying to fleece $20 million from a British gangster hit man cartel . Hugh Grant's performance in my opinion is the funniest detective role to come along since Peter Sellers Chief Inspector Clouseau . He's brilliant as the very camp cunningly conniving Fletcher and his East end drawl is incredibly clever acting .Often fine performances are due to a good director and Guy Ritchie who directed and wrote the screenplay for The Gentlemen has excelled in this film .\nI enjoyed this more than the recent \"Knives Out \" film which was very good but The Gentlemen I think is in a Class similar to the late Blake Edwards at his best.The other stand out performances are from Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Pearson an American expat who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London .\nA Simplified version of the plot is that when word gets out that Mickey is looking to cash out his business,it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Michelle Dockery completely buries any vision of herself as Lady Mary from Downton Abbey in the Gentlemen in her role as Mickey's wife and business partner with a hot gangster moll outfit and figure to match and some red hot lines to match,she's sensational in this role .In fact all the performances are good we see Henry Golding step out of his nice Asian dude character from Crazy Rich Asians and an angel in Last Christmas to play Dry Eye a young gangster protege trying to take over the territory from his Uncle Wang Young. Harlie Hunam as Raymond and Colin Farrell as Coach also give stand out performances\nI was really surprised and delighted by how much I enjoyed The Gentlemen and look forward to seeing it again.", "This is definitely not an action film! Just another fake rate film to deceive viewer to watch! All the action scene super messy, and bored! Really should have done better!": "This film start with a man \"Michael\" drinking at the bar, he looks like being murder, and two people(Fletcher and Ray) talking at the kitchen scene! As turnout, this film is about Fletcher persuading Miramax Studio's honcho to make a movie about Michael, who depict as a drug dealer in the movie! Entire film a bit mystery, but quite slow! The flashback almost every scene, also make the film unwatchable! All the action scene super messy and low satisfaction! Not a single killing scene show to the audience! Just depict the blood on the floor and cup! Barely intense scene is, henchmen of Coach shooting at Michael's driver! At the end, we found out, this is just a film about Fletcher try to getting a movie deal! Still have a post credit scene! The henchmen of Coach rapping and dancing! That's it! Another disappointed film! Wasting time to watch!", "Good but not great": "Edit.... just finished rewatching The Gentlemen and must say enjoyed it much more on the second watch, its still not a nine or ten rated film but I would have scored it a strong Eight this time.Cant really understand all the 10/10, 9/10 scores for The Gentlemen. Was it an enjoyable couple of hours, on the whole yes. Was it as good as Lock Stock or Snatch, never came close. It had it's funny moments but far to much felt a bit forced, the script was no where near as sharp as either of the afore mentioned films and really it wasn't even good or original as Rock'n' Rolla.Now to my main problem with this film and the massive question of originality or the distinct lack of, in Hollywood these days. The Gentleman was basically a tired attempt to redo The Long Good Friday, yes the premise was slightly different but aspects like the gun \"hands across the sea\" engraving on the derringer but what is unforgivable and so,nothing Ritchie should be ashamed of, is where he ripped off the iconic final Bob Hoskins scene when he is taken by the IRA in his own car, everything down to the expressions McConaughey and the gunman pointing his gun between the seats was just copied from LGF, lazy, lazy writing.As I said, it is worth a watch but prepare to be left a little dissatisfied.", "I was bored to death by this": "This film was such a bore to me. Everything here was done 100 times before, the film had a somewhat childlish plot with little to none creativity and imagination. I couldn't connect to any of the characters and I really wanted the film to end as soon as possible. The only positive thing about this movie is the costumes which is delightful, overall I would say this is a waste of time and money.", "Boring Movie. And the 3rd Person Narrative is Annoying": "This film is very boring.\nIt is so annoying to have someone else in the movie tell the story about what happened.\nIt is so stupid. The movie jumps back and forth between the Protagonist a the person telling a story about the Protagonist.\nWhat is the point of all that?\nWhy not just make a good movie that focus on the Protagonist only, and not worry about the person \"Telling a Story\" about the Protagonist.\nBoring movie.

It will not be a revelation for those who have watched his crime comedies or Matthew Vaughn's film \"Layer Cake\". Experienced moviegoers will easily figure out some of the plot twists, and everyone will laugh at the shameful opening scene. It feels absolutely superfluous, like a rap clip, inappropriately pasted into the narrative. The events in the film are developing smartly, the characters with their various accents replace each other in the frame with enviable regularity, and you don't even need to count on at least an average number of action scenes. The whole action is here in the dialogues. Violence is minimalistic, but there is a lot of profanity. Offensive to women (the word cunt is very often pronounced) and minorities (goes to Asians, Jews and a little black). And all this is wrapped in a stylish picture with a cheerful and interesting soundtrack.\"Gentlemen\" is Guy Ritchie's long-awaited return to the crime genre, which can be safely called successful. All the ingredients from past work are in place. Let them not be as exciting as they used to be, but they give a pleasant feeling of nostalgia.", "'There's only one rule in the jungle: when the lion's hungry, he eats!'": "Guy Ritchie both wrote the story (with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies) and the screenplay and directed this peppery caper and the result - another unique Guy Ritchie film that continues his style of entertainment.The very brief plot summary only hints at the momentum of the film: 'Mickey Pearson, an American expat (Matthew McConaughey), tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.' Spin that idea over two hours of action in the Ritchie style and the story explodes like a July 4th evening of color and noise. The language is typically raw and predominantly profanity - and that fits the style of the story.The cast is a collection of some excellent actors: Hugh Grant 'narrates' much of the story to Ray (Charlie Hunnam), Mickey's consiglieri, and intertwines the myriad groups of eager procurers of McConaughey's marijuana estate - Jeremy Strong, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding, Tom Wu, Eddie Marsan, Jason Wong et al. Michelle Dockery is Mickey's hardnosed wife, the reason Mickey performs so well.At times the strained Cockney accents and other permutations of the English language seem forced (or simply undecipherable), but the action never stops, and the script contains some pungent ideas. Noisy and naughty, it is pure Guy Ritchie - and that means, successful.", "Guy Ritchie in his bag": "Went to a New Years day performance, best film of 2020 so far for me.\nThe film combined London gangsters, London Youth, wealthy aristocratic types and even asian gangsters seamlessly.\nThe pacing was outstanding, characters interesting and story competent.\nGo and support this film!", "I cannot believe the high scores !!!!": "Now did I watch something different to everyone else???? To me Guy Ritchie just needs a break from these types of films, to be honest at times it felt like someone was making a \"Guy Ritchie\" rip off. I am shocked, to say the least, at the positive response to this film............its was so poor, and I had no expectations going in at all!!!!!The only ok part of the film for me is, that its mildly entertaining, it wasn't dull. Even though I really really didn't like the film, I will definitely disagree with anyone who tries to say they were bored watching it. There are some occasional laughs to have along the way, however for me its just not enough to cover up from the mind-numbingly bad decisions that were made.The dialogue ! Its laughably bad, I know there is meant to be a certain cockney sort of stereotype in Guy Ritchie's films but this was just so far over the mark. Everyone was just playing a caricature of that type of stereotype and it was straight from the beginning. It stuck out to me and just couldn't escape my mind how silly it looked. The opening scene look how McConaughey dials the number in his phone.............face palm..... I suppose you buy into this stupid reality that is created and go along for the ride but to me no, I just couldn't take any of them seriously...........it was ludicrous!!The acting isn't at its best there are a lot of people coasting, McConaughey looks completely bored thinking what happened to the McCnaissance apart from when he gets angry now and then. I don't really like Charlie Hunman I think he is always trying to hard, but thats me?!?! He accent is always all over the place in pretty much every film he is in, this one is no different. Colin Farrell is taking a pay check and just looks like he learned his lines about a min before shooting. The only person I would say that was doing anything different or at least trying was Hugh Grant who was different to say the least. Had some good laughs but was also probably the worse culprit of the stereotypical accent or just weird persona created.Overall I am really shocked and stunned by the positivity surrounding this film, it came out in January for a reason..........its the garbage month of the year!?!? For me its 30% out of 100 its pretty bad if you ask me for the reasons I've given, I'd high recommend it to people to avoid, don't waste your time watch one of Guy Ritchie's films from early in his career, not this wannabe!", "Bloated script drags for days": "Ritchie is aging but not maturing and no longer seems to possess a sense of humor about himself.

It boils down to the law of diminishing returns - too much of anything and it will eventually lose its impact. This could be said about much of the dialogue and plot trajectory. The Gentleman is fun, it's flashy, it's amusing - it's Guy Richie. But it also feels like a rehashed pastiche of a bygone era. An era when he made crime movies that were genuinely funny and gripping. It is with a heavy heart that the same can not be said of this one. It felt hollow and contrived in comparison to his more iconic earlier works.He does however notably take on the woke brigade; for this, Guy, I doff my cap to you sir.", "This is why I'm glad I own a chipped F\u00edre St\u00edck": "Because if I had paid for a cinema ticket, I'd have felt it was money not well spent.Right, where do I begin... Well, I'll start with McConaughey. He played his role far too straight. He was completely deadpan. Not at any point was there a twinkle in his eye. His wife, Rosalind Pearson, wouldn't look out of place on the set of EastEnders, what, with her obnoxious attitude and aggression. So, as a duo, I was completely detached from them. I certainly wasn't hoping they'd survive being eliminated by their foes. In fact, I was hoping they would come a cropper.I felt the boxing club lads - who recorded their exploits - deserved some punishment for pinching McConaughey's plants and equipment. Yet it was their coach, Farrell, who had to face the consequences of the boys' actions. Yes, he put himself forward, but the lads got off far too easy. I'm guessing the boxing lads were not challenged due to them being (majority) black. Because if you have McConaughey's (majority) white henchmen pasting them AND the Chinese outfit, well, it might appear a little racist. I wouldn't have thought that as a viewer. I also recall reading a review which stated if you take your eyes off the screen for one moment you will lose track of the script. I have to say, I didn't find the picture complicated at all. Not at any point did I feel I wasn't aware of the motivations. I even b\u00fcgg\u00e9red off around the 70 minute mark to change my bedding without pausing the film and returned to it without any problems.It is unlikely I will watch this again. It certainly doesn't have the snappy dialogue or the lasting appeal of Lock, Stock and Snatch.", "A disappointment.": "I expected a lot more from a movie headlining these two but this was just some kind of bad heist movie ripoff using pot as a lure.My personal opinion though, if you liked Hugh Grant's performance, well that's your personal problem now ain't it.", "Slow beginning": "It was very slow to start.

But it's damn boring with an unreliable narrator dictating to the audience the entire plot. It tries to be meta but bores like no other.Such a shame because this film had an A+ cast. Matthew McConaughey, Henry Golding, Colin Farrel, Jeremy Strong, Jason Wong, Hugh Grant, etc, etc, etc. The plot contains drug kingpins, Triad gangsters, blackmail, and a power struggle. With such an interesting plot and cast, you'd expect this to be the action movie of the year. But it falls flat on delivery.And the style of the movie feels unfocused at best.

Really i forgot the other outfits: I liked the smoking jacket, I think that is the one for me.\nOh and by the way Matthew McConaughey is American; I don't know what you will do with this info but it is in the movie, so you all should know.Charlie Hunnam is sporting a modern beard, which has the appearnace of being scruffy but from up close it apperas well kept and clean. It plays well on his outfit because it contrasts with his suit and tie preppy look. Also when you are a mobster that need to chase parkour enthusiasts, make sure to get that genuine leaher strap for you automatic silenced rifle that you are jogging with.\nIt will help you carry that 6.8lbs gun while you are running in a three-piece suit, but more importantly it will also match your oxfords.If you are looking for some fine scotch to enjoy while Hugh Grant sabotages his career, try out Glenfarclas , its smooth and it looks good.There are not a lot of opportunities to BBQ outside in England so you will absolutely want to check out this lovely barbercue table with built-in fire. It can really give your garden some cachet, especially when you have people over.The movie also portrays characters? I am not sure, things happen on screen, they kill a russian teenager I think, the Lion is selling weed technology. If you can sort these words in order good for you, it doesn't really matter\nColin Farell is dressed in a track suit and is the mentor of a Youtube channel, where I can only imagine we can find his merch in the bio, otherwise I don't see how he can monetize his content. It really makes you think how technology has changed the way we buy and percieve brands hasn't it ?\nI like some of the tracksuits. But I don't think I am confident I can rock that look.\nThere is a third choice though between the three-piece suit to go to the pub(or the chase in the bad parts of town, really its that versatile) and the Chanel tracksuit when you go to the gym, after the kebab place. It is : the Chinese-Bond? I forgot the characters name but it was equally racially-sensitive and appropriate. Asian-007 ? Oriental-Brosnan ? Something like that. Anyway he opts for soft looking jackets with a simply a cashmere jumper or turtleneck underneath. It gives him a more agile look and younger apperance.On the culture side of things, it is 2020, so eveyrobdy is gay, wants to be gay, appears to be gay, hates to be gay and hates the gays. All at the same time.\nRace relations? Yeah same thing. It is cool and bad to be black/chinese.\nWhatever your position on these issues is, it will be in the movie. It will have no impact, because this is not trash re-heated 20 year garbage of a director who has become a parody of himself. No this is Art!\nOh and by the way Matthew McConaughey is Amercian, how quirky is that?P.S. : While writing about this I remembered the Hugh Grant dancing scene in Love Actually. I can only respect Hugh Grant in this movie to no play on his strenghs, and give us something absolutely no-one asked for, wanted, or even knew was possible. Bravo Sir! Bravo!", "The Gentlemen": "The new film will definitely be an outlet for those who fell in love with Richie precisely for the crime, vivid images of bandits and intricate plots. This is the \"return to the roots\" that we have been waiting for. Although it is still necessary to take into account the fact that \"Gentlemen\" is no longer being shot by a young aspiring director, prone to enthusiasm and experiments, but by a solid master.But for the most part, it only went to the plus. Richie is not trying to repeat the success of the first films, he shows that even the world of crime itself has changed, where now everything has become more solid and measured. And therefore, the whole action, although it will surprise you with a sudden turn in the first frames, will be a little calmer, leaving room for beautiful filming and just witty dialogues.In fact, the whole film is a direct speech - Fletcher's story about his guesses, moreover, served in the style of \"Get a shorty\". This approach allows Richie to simultaneously shoot a crime comedy and partially deconstruct the genre itself. Since most of what is happening is one big flashback, and even from an unreliable narrator, in a couple of scenes, the action is literally \"unwound\", showing the difference between rumors and reality, ironic about the ability to lip-read conversations, or even completely complement the action with inscriptions on the screen.", "This is a great film, and 24 of the 26 one star reivews are form newly created single use accounts and are probably one or two trolls with multiple accounts": "First of all people writing this is Hollywood are NUTS, This is a quintessentially British frenetic gangster film, and perfection of the genreSecondly the PC police hate this film because while they feel it is racist because some of the villains are minorities -- just like in real life -- they can't actually point to any racism because in fact the film has NONE. Absolute none of the villains are bad guys because of their race, which would be racism. There also seems to be a lot of butthurt because a rape is prevented with a firearm, an idea apparently deeply offensive to the outrage addicted hoplophobics.This is a well paced, very entertaining film with great original plot, a lot of well done stylistic element and no insults to intelligence.", "Poorly Constructed with Appalling Acting": "Look I know Ritchie has the geezer approach to directing, but really you have to be more proffessional than this. With a stellar cast the whole thing should have been sleek and well put together , which it isn't.\nLets forget the numerous continuity mistakes which litter the film , some listed on this site, lets forget the wooden acting of Hunnam who at times appears to freeze as if waiting for a prompt, the fact that his supposed regional accent which appears to roam the UK like a group of itinerants, but can we really forgive the clumsy direction as this movie stutters along from a disparate collection of images.\nThe implausability at times is frankly breath taking. The group of druggies , well known for DIY, miraculously have a hammer on the coffee table in order to give the guy a weapon with which to attack the heavy. The upmarket daughter druggie who just like that gives up her friends and the life in the squat, just like that. The fact that the Hugh Grant character is there, with a camera, at exactly the right second to snap the fallen youth. The Hannam character runs through the street coat tails flapping chasing the guy with the phone, but amazingly a few seconds later , withdraws a big f off assault rifle just when he needs it from beneath the said coat. Lets not go into the ludicrous scene where the trainee boxers do cart wheels etc in the theft of the grass.\nI know it's only a movie but unless you are appealing to the slapstick market, you must do better than this, much, much better Ritchie. Likewise Hugh Grant, his pivotal role was played like someone from a rep company at times, it wasn't funny, it wasn't vaguely threatening as he was hinting at, it was just well blah, pretty much like the whole offering.. I thought Tarantino could ruin a good story with childish amateur directing, well now he has a rival.", "Alas!": "Well, I had high expectations, of course. And I didn't like the movie partially because of that. So, I'll try to forget for a minute that it's a Guy Ritchie movie and will just list the things that ruined it for me, but only those that would have done the same for any other film.\n1. Narrating voice. That is a no-no. Few people manage to do it right. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\n2. Main characters are too-cool-for-school, all-knowing, too powerfull and too lucky. It's simply not interesting. They don't have any vulnarabilities.\n3. Guy Ritchie uses low blows manipulating viewer's emotions with the fake assassination at the beginning.\n4. Characters seem to float in vacuum of space: a criminal organisation of only 2 people. There's no police or other government agencies. Characters out of touch with reality. A rapping and boxing gang of ninja turtles?\n5. Stupid imaginary scenes.\n6. The whole Fletcher line is useless. The movie would have work without it.I guess it boils down to a poorly written script.\nOtherwise the movie is beautifully shot and has good music.", "Finally someone's let Hugh Grant": "ACTUALLY act. Dude got pigeon holed early in his career so it's wonderful to see a director, Guy R at that, allow Grant so show his chops which are on par with anyone else's given half the chance.Good movie.", "Interesting but not exciting!": "Surprised by the good reviews as The film doesn't really get going. I enjoyed the narrative at first but didn't expect it to last the whole film! I love Lock Stock and Snatch but this is way short of the Mark!Some good performances and the acting can't be faulted but the style of the story failed to engage and unlike other Guy Ritchie films I doubt I will ever have the desire to waste 2 hours watching it again..", "A Forgettable Story": "Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) wants to sell his Marijuana crop and business and he has a buyer in Matthew (Jeremy Strong), but there are others who also want that business and they try to do everything they can to disrupt that sale.This starts out with our seeing Michael be gunned down in a bar. Okay, end of movie. Let's find another. But wait, did we really see Michael killed? It did look like we would go back in time to the point of that killing, but we don't do that either. Read on.Instead we have a Private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who gives a movie-long narrative for a movie he wants to produce, and that is basically this story titled Bush (Marijuana). The Story he says is in his imagination, but in reality, it is the story that we will see unfold. The truth is he wants money to not produce his movie or he will be forced to produce and let the world know all about Michael Pearson. Listening to him talking with Ray (Charlie Hunnam), who is Michael's right hand man and the bottom line is that Fletcher is blackmailing Ray to give him $20Million to keep his secrets. We don't know all the players and listening to him doesn't make much sense, but as he narrates, we see the story unfold. I do believe the story could have unfolded more easily without this narration. But that's just me.To make things easier here are the players who are out to get Michael's marijuana business: Chinaman Dry Eye (Henry Golding); and Oklahoma billionaire Big Dave (Eddie Marsan). That is basically all you need to know.\nNotables: Michelle Dockery as Rosalind, Michael's wife; Colin Farrell as Coach, who runs a boxing training facility, and whose boys were the ones without his knowing who violated one of Michael's Marijuana farms. And this caused a big drop in price according to Matthew later on.Not sure why the Title of this movie is what it is. I didn't see any Gentlemen in here. There are twists in here, but keep in mind Michael is on top of everything as you will come to understand at the end.McConaughey is always good and is always on top of his game. Acting by all was very good.Not sure why this story was even told and put on film. A lot of what you will see in here is confusing and there is some unnecessary violence. The story itself did not impact me in any way as it was in my opinion a very simple story. That is to say forgettable. (5/10)Violence: Yes.\nSex: No.\nNudity: No.\nHumor: No, but there were lame attempts at it.\nLanguage: Yes, and quite liberal use of the \"C\" word.Rating: C", "Back to basics": "Guy Ritchie returns to the british crime genre, which is I think where he is undoubtedly at his best. This movie is so cool, from the slick, fast, sometimes even poetic dialogue, the accents, the performances, the characters. Everything about it screams Guy Ritchie and it is really good.There are some scenes in the movie that I think will become classics and maybe this movie will too, I don't know, only time will tell, but a lot of it reminded me of the cleverness of the characters in Snatch. The performances are fantastic, I think Hugh Grant is the best I've ever seen him ever, with a completely different accent and also Charlie Hunnam is so damn cool here, as well.The only negatives I have with the film is that, as is usual for a Guy Ritchie film is that from the very beginning it moves at breakneck speed, introduces a bunch of characters and quite honestly, at times in the film I didn't really know what they were talking about. And also, I love Guy Ritchie, but sometimes he does sacrifice substance for style and I think in some scenes the same thing happens here.I though the first act was the weakest because it introduced too many characters and plot lines, but the movie got better each minute, and I really liked it in the end and definitely want to watch it again, soon.", "Usual Cockney cobblers": "Started off badly with Hugh Grant playing a hard nut and then descended into Ritchies usual fast-cut editing nonsense, which really gets irritating after the fifth or sixth time. The dialogue is as preposterous as ever and I stopped caring about any of the thinly drawn characters long before the end.", "Coach": "I like the bit where he says why does it smell like wee in here", "Any bad? Yes. It's too smart. It simply does NOT want to stop being smart , ending up being boring after half an hour of SMART talk and more smart talk....": "Director Guy Ritchie shot to fame around the year 2000 with 1 terrific, hilarious gangster movie (\"Snatch\", a MUST SEE), but since then he has faded into oblivion as a director. This new story is pretty complicated, weird AND VERY English and full of blunt dialogues the masses probably wont like. And I did not like it either, after a promising smart start...Any bad? Yes. It's way too smart. It simply does NOT want to stop being smart , ending up being boring after half an hour of smart gangster talk.More bad: The story of this movie is about Hugh Grant LITERALLY constantly telling / reciting a gangster screenplay to another gangster. Quirky? Yes. Original? Yes. Interesting? NO!Any good? Brilliant acting performances all around though, especially Hugh Grant is quite surprisingly good in his role as a gangster. He truly pulls it off to look menacing, in a true GENTLEMEN kind of way, hence title...Conclusion: ultimately it is still quite boring. Too much TALK TALK TALK. Too little REAL gangster action or drama or suspense.", "Enthralling experience": "Loved this movie so much! Guy Ritchie is so back with a delightful crime caper that is so much fun! Charlie Hunam, Hugh Grant, Matthew Mcconaughey and Collin Ferrel are all awesome throughout. Such a blast I'm definitely gonna buy The Gentlemen when I can.", "Ritchie for zoomers": "Manner maketh man, as a certain character once said. And Guy Ritchie has turned The Gentlemen into a showcase for that undisputed truth. However, the same character also said that a villain's quality is crucial for the whole film's well-being, and that is where this movie falls flat on its bum.The best Ritchie's films can be described in one sentence: a little triumph for a little guy. Lock & Stock, Snatch and even Rocknrolla are built about the fate of small-time people with quite limited prospects in life. Yes, they are clever, funny and often very lucky, but it's never a \"rags to riches forever\" story, more like a \"rags to riches to probably lots of irrational spending and rags again\" one. And that's what makes those films fun and protagonists relatable for the masses: we all enjoy seeing little men screw over big men once in a while, without becoming the evil they were destined to fight.Here, however, we are supposed to sympathize with a big, very big man and his top minion. I agree that Matthew McConaughey is extremely charismatic and his vocal manner makes my ears melt in ecstasy, and that Charlie Hunnam looks quite the man with a full beard. But Ritchie invests so much into the \"protagonist\" side, yet leaves so little for the \"antagonist\" one. The \"bad guys\" are nether imposing nor cunning nor even well presented enough. You are inclined to root for the good guys because they are usually outnumbered and maybe even outgunned, but here there's no true sense of worthy confrontation, which makes you wish the \"bush brothers\" to break a leg in a literal, not a theatrical sense.All this leaves us with one sad conclusion, that Guy Ritchie still knows how to do things in style but totally forgot how to bring in the substance (except the controlled ones of course, they are still aplenty). All this street gang stuff, fight porn and rap clips, and even the selfie time homage might be fun for those born on this side of the century, but for us old-timers the creative decline is quite obvious.But even today's Ritchie could not have come without a single ace up his sleeve. Hugh Grant as a well-mannered, slightly over the hedge and a tad too clearly mancraving fox of a gentleman, is a true soul of this feature, a real reason to watch this film through. And at the end, he's the only one you truly wanna root for. Which is quite symbolic, because that's the very character who's practically begging for a sequel through what used to be the fourth wall. Don't know about y'all, but I'm interested only if they film what he's writing, kinky parts included.", "Boring and Pointless": "What is this movie trying to say? That crime behave badly. Oh, I got that much. The storyline is thin, the scenes disjointed but above all, it was just boring. Gave up at the 58 minute mark because I didn't want to waste another hour. The acting was good so I give it two stars.", "When Guy Ritchie out-Guy Ritchie's a Guy Ritchie film": "When Guy Ritchie produces, directs, conceives the story, writes the screenplay, then adds a stellar all star cast that perform exceptionally, you know Guy Ritchie just out-Guy Ritchied, a Guy Ritchie film. Sheer brilliance from any angle.", "Guy Ritchie hits it right": "All the films directed by Guy Ritchie over the last decade that I have seen have been disappointments to me, so I was very close to skip seeing 'The Gentlemen' in theaters, leaving it, maybe, for a later viewing. What convinced me in the end was the impressive note on IMDB (8.1). Over 40,000 film fan mates can't go wrong, I told myself, and I'm not sorry. 'The Gentlemen' is Ritchie's best film I remember ever seeing (but I should mention that I did not see 'Snatch' made at the beginning of his career, which I read a lot of good things about). 'The Gentlemen' is a violent action movie, stylish, funny, original, with a select cast. Those who don't like gangster movies would probably do well to avoid it, but all the other movie lovers have a lot of reasons to go and see it.Guy Ritchie is not a director who walks the beaten track. Even when he has an interesting and an already complicated story in his hand like 'The Gentlemen', he chooses to tell it in an unconventional way. In other films I had the impression that preoccupation with his own directorial vision spoils the effect, but here the convention created by him works very well. What we have in the film is a story about gangsters fighting for control over the narcotics manufacturing and distribution industry in today's England. An upper-class Mafia-style boss (Matthew McConaughey) plans to sell his business, and two rival gangs fight to get their hands on it. In addition to the fact that the story is quite complicated already, it is narrated in cinematic style by a blackmail journalist / detective (Hugh Grant), who beautifies it by presenting it in the form of ... a movie script. The pretext is created not only for a 'movie-in-movie' narrative, but also to permanently question what we see on the screen. Do we see what actually happened? Do we see a version invented or modified to serve the purposes of the blackmailer? Or maybe what we see is fiction, the fruit of a script writer's imagination?It will take the average viewer (the category I like to fall in) about 10-15 minutes to understand the unconventional way the story is told and get used to it. If he manages to cross this threshold, I think, there are enough moments of cinematic satisfaction and good quality entertainment in this film. The distribution is excellent. Matthew McConaughey transitions professionally from his roles as a good and handsome guy to the role here of a (very) bad and handsome guy. Hugh Grant already has 35 (!) years of career behind him, but it seems that he is only now maturing and moving from the beau roles to senior acting, and what an actor he is! I think part two of his career will be even better than the first. Nearly unrecognizable and just as good is Colin Farrell. The fourth ace in Ritchie's hand is Charlie Hunnam , an actor whom I know less, but who acts at parity with his famous partners. I was told that I should be familiar with Michelle Dockery , but I am not as I didn't see 'Downton Abbey', and I confess that she didn't impress me here. Certainly, in 'The Gentlemen', the male side rules. There are many memorable scenes in the film, especially those that rely on class differences, as they are expressed in language, behavior, and tools of violence. The scenario is very talkative, which may seem a little inappropriate because gangsters generally talk less and shoot more, but that's part of the convention. Finally, I can say that I liked 'The Gentlemen' and that the film has restored the stature of Guy Ritchie in my eyes.", "This made me realize why I don't like Richie Movies": "So I decided to watch this knowing absolutely nothing about it. During the opening scene my very first thought less than one minute into it was \"oh, oh, this is going to be one of those style over substance films.\" (Besides thinking how fake the blood looked)Fancy camera work when it wasn't needed. I don't wanna watch a film and be thinking of the \"Direction\" of the film. I only want to watch the film and think about the story, characters, relationships etc. There is such thing as over directing, which means your focus is on camera work, staging actors etc, rather than having an organic composition of the scene, i.e. letting the actors play out the scene in a natural way or at least it should feel that way.The whole idea of movies is to suspend your disbelief, not to make us aware it is a movie by constantly doing things that takes us out of the experience.On top of that the actors (likely from being directed this way) were so over the top i.e. trying too hard to create memorable characters. The dialogue didn't help. No one speaks like this. They just don't. The clever monologues and tired Hollywood repartee.I am just so tired of seeing these phony overly staged and directed movies.Of course as I saw the credits, all my intuitive feelings were validated because of course it was a Guy Richie film, the king of style over substance director.So cringeworthy.", "Latest Ritchieflick is half-amusing SHOCK. (We're being generous)": "Watching Matthew McConaughey attempting to keep up with the talent in this latest Ritchieflick (the director who has to have his own sub-genre) is entertaining in itself. McConaughey mistakenly brings his usual earnest acting style to a world that's as real a depiction of the Brit underworld as The Magic Roundabout is of a midsummer's fete in The Wicker Man.As usual, Guy has bought in top artistes such as Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong and similar to convey the deeply wrought characters in his latest Carry-On-Gangsta fairy tale.Thing is, there's no such thing as a good or bad Ritchieflick - you can't really compare him to other filmmakers because, as previously noted, he's all his own thing. You can tell he wants to be a Tarantino or Scorsese, but unlike those auteurs, he swims in a rather more shallow pool of human behaviour, that inhabited by a kind of watery species of cliche. There are so, so many, but here's an example: Ritchie graciously takes the time to have Farrell's character mansplain certain racist terms for the viewer, so if you happen to be black and someone calls you a black c***, there's no need to feel offended. Glad that's sorted then. Has anyone told the rest of the world?Honestly? It's a fun hatewatch, silly without ever being wretched or (god forbid) too serious, but there are so many other filmmakers out there who really do deserve your attention and hard-earned. Taken on its own terms, it's the usual hilariously puerile piece of dog s#!*% - well put together and turned out, like a spotty teen wearing his dad's expensive suit and attempting to fill it out by puffing up his chest. Except this teen will likely never grow up - he'll just carry on making this kind of stunted fare. He thinks it's stylish, and maybe it is, if someone else is doing it. There does indeed come a point Guy, when the young do succeed the old, but you really have to want to grow up first.", "Must watch": "Amazing all I need to say.. Mr Richie done it again", "Bit clunky!": "This is a typical Guy Ritchie film. Plenty of action, deaths, bad language and occasional laughs. Some of the scenes are Pulp Fiction-esque. There's not a lot new here, but the film moves along quite nicely. Not overly keen on the storytelling format of the film, and Hugh Grant goes on a bit too much. Matthew Mcconaughey is well cast, Colin Farrell steals the show and will probably win some awards for his performance. Some poor script writing at times, but overall well worth a watch.", "Atrocious": "Atrocious from start to finish; no subplot makes any sense; no antagonist, only a series of 'protagonist beat'em all up' and that's pretty much it; does it work as a satire? - no way. The Chinese are an organization of four or five; the Russians are three, four as well. It's like a movie written by a 17yo fan-fiction wannabe.if someone else would have come with such a script, wouldn't have ever seen the lights of cinema, right? People are complaining it's 'too wordy', that's not a problem; if you like Tarkovsky, or Bergman, or so many other cinema giants, you know there's no such thing as 'too wordy'; but when the script is this poor that would not make it to straight2dvd - that's another issue entirely.Mr. Ritchie has some great stuff in the past; who knows, maybe his next project will be a bit closer to his own potential.Looks like this generation loves to live stuff just for the sake of loving them; nothing wrong with that.Anyway.Written by Mickey Mouse; for the Mickey Mouse generation.", "Critics have no clue": "Please don't rely on what critics have scored, just read their reviews to understand that they have no clue.", "Tries too hard at being cool and stylish": "At times it feels as if this film becomes confusing for the sake of trying to tell an interesting story as it tries hard in being cool and stylish. The beginning of the film is quite slow paced and provides a lot of dialogue.Although it does get more entertaining in the end, overall this film has that feel of a \"British\" film with everyone speaking in UK lingo making it hard to understand. It gives off the sense that every character is trying to act cool and trying to \"one-up\" the other person.Hugh Grant makes the film worse as he is arguably the worst part of the film with a completely irritating character. Too many British characters and not enough American characters but given this is a Guy Ritchie film, we guess its expected.", "absolute garbage!": "48 minutes in after several attempts. Wooow this movie is boooooring!", "Amazing": "Didn't get a lot of hype, but don't pass it up. Great movie for sure!", "Same old same old": "Someone needs to tell Guy Ritchie just to stop, we're bored now. He's not in touch with the east end or has any insight to offer us about criminals he's just a luvvie behind a camera who tapped a rich vein but that vein has gone. This rag bag of all the Ritchie tropes; jump cut, montage framing, story within a story, quirky characters and an end which isn't an end have all been done before and better.\nMost of the story is told via a two hander narrator and audience device comprising Grant (who has great fun with the role of slimy journalist) and Hunnam makes the audience role work. The narration revolves around McConaughey as the ex pat yank running a large scale marijuana business in the UK which he wants to sell up and retire from, shades of Layer Cake which tells the story a whole lot better, and this is the first problem. Now McConaughey is fine actor who was obviously hired with an eye to the US market and his ability to display a lethal charm but the conceit to make this work; failed Rhodes Scholar who finds he has a talent for dealing weed to the toffs, is just too much of a stretch, not helped by McConaughey basically sleep walking through the film.\nIn the course of the film we meet his Jewish, fey, buyer, played so badly by Jeremy Strong, who naturally tries to put one over on McConaughey, with the assistance of an up coming Hong Kong gangster and comic boxing gym assortment gang of east end stereotypes. Cue overt and covert racist and anti semitic 'jokes' which are pretty tasteless and don't advance the plot.\nIncluded in the mix are a stereotype wannabe uncultured newspaper proprietor, played terribly by Eddie Marsan - why do film makers still hire this bloke? Who wants to bring down McConaughey for the flimsyest of reasons and is the notional employer of Grant. Also McConaughey's wife running a posh car business, an utter waste of Dockery's talents, a missing heiress and of course a Russian ogligarch and his ex KGB henchmen (30 years ago Guy).\nSuffice to say there are mix ups, we are miss directed, there are bodies, there is dark humour but it never really adds up to much, mainly because the idea of a charming yank convincing his posh uni customers who now own stately homes on acres of ground they can't afford to turn a blind eye to his underground cannabis farms on his land is utterly ludicrous.\nThe one bright spot is Colin Farrell as the gym owner with a past who is excellent in every scene he steals.\nCan some enjoyment be had? Well obviously yes but in no way is this a 10 or 9 rating and those who would put such a rating up need to take a look at themselves. This is a bang average piece of work which is 30 minutes too long.has", "Outsnatched Snatch": "What a fantastic return from Guy Ritchie.\nAs I said earlier this outsnatched snatch.\nBrilliant performances all around..especially bu Hugh Grant.\nThe more money put into those awful Marvel/DC and star wars rubbish the less we see of real movies like this.The only gripe I have is the language...they could have easily watered it down to make it a 15.In the days of heros and remakes it's a shame younger people cannot watch masterpieces like this.Help yourself to a fantastic 113 minutes of classy, proper movie making.", "More of the same": "It seems Guy Ritchie keeps making the same movie: A heist/crime adventure with a script that keeps jumping backwards and forwards, numerous quirky characters with different ethnicities and accents, snappy dialogue, sudden cuts and musical moments, all of it needlessly complicated and stylized and a bit annoying.This one is okay. It's better than Snatch, which doesn't say much because I hate Snatch. It's not that boring and not very hard to follow, at least.", "The best one in its genre since \"Snatch\"": "I've missed this. That is a high class \"Guy Ritchie\" movie with a bit more brighter than usual atmosphere. Lock Stock, had discovered Jason Statham along with Vinnie Jones. Snatch was the better follow up. Now finally we get the good new version of the same genre packed with movie stars, and chemistry that actually works. McConaughey delivered an outstanding performance, as it one of the characters he was born to play. He does not succeed in every role, but some of them are a perfect fit. Hugh Grant did an excellent job,as this role was different than his usual movies. For the first time in many years, I loved Colin Farrel as a cool coach, as his chemistry with Hunnam and charismatic presence filled every scene he was at.\nNow for some of the weaker points of the movie.\nI loved Charlie Hunnam ever since Green street hooligans, yet I didn't feel that was the perfect role for him. His character is cool, resourceful and smart. Yet it felt that for some scenes, he was a bit out of pace. Fir example the scenes with the junkies, some deeper disgust form his part was missing from the formula. He still delivered, but for this movie to be a masterpiece, it should have been some one else.\nThe story could have been a bit deeper. It was missing some edge, especially towards the end. That's where the whole idea of Lock Stock and Snatch shined the most, Gentlemen dropped a ball a bit. It needs a different ending.\nThe eccentric antagonist of the movie is not a good counterpart to McConaughey. That casting was off entirely. It felt like Jesse Aisenberg iin the role of Lex Luthor.Other than that, this movie is great and I hope Guy Ritchie will consider to do a follow up.", "Trite": "30 minutes is more than enough for me, it was simply TRITE and BORING.

It was no Lock, Stock or Snatch, but it was an ok way to spend a Saturday evening. The actors enjoyed their roles, which was amusing. It was super cringey at times though, and that took the fun out of parts of it.", "A return to form for Guy Ritchie with a darker gangster movie": "This isn't lock stock or snatch but they are a high bar and this is still a great film. Ritchie almost made it another ten out of ten but this just lacked some of the brilliant humour and unforgettable characters of his big hits.The film has a good plot with plenty of twists and turns, and the pace is very good. The cast of actors isn't let down and there are some brilliant performances, not least by Hugh Grant.It is a film that warrants a second watch and it's great to see Ritchie back to near his best as he does the London Gangster movie like no one else.", "Very respectable GR flick.": "If you like GR's style, then you will like this one. I feel he finally returned to his grittier London underbelly roots. I really wasn't a fan of his larger productions like Sherlock Holmes and that one about a King or something? GR's at his best with a strict \"R\" rating and not having to tell someone else's story. Are his tricks tired? Maybe. Are they fun to watch? Definitely.Good use of dialogue throughout the movie. Thumbs up to Hunam, Farrell and Mr. \"Alright, Alright!\". They all played superb roles IMO.Bottom line. If you liked Snatch, and Lock Stock, this one is worth your time. If you don't care for those movies, you'll probably hate this one too.

I cant wait to see it again..", "Can be better": "After seeing it, I thought it was a great movie, and it was the guy Ritchie standard. Although he is not a prolific director, each one is excellent. From the instant success of \"two bong\", \"snatch\", \"revolver\", \"Sherlock Holmes\" and so on. It really got the fans going. In addition to the brilliant rolled-up story, the British setting, coupled with guy's bloody violence, the comedy, the soundtrack, and the mostly male cast, makes guy Ritchie's film stand out. In addition to that, you'll also see the actors who match the film's title dress (very tasteful), talk, use words, and have a lot of lines (admire Hugh grant) to add to the film's appeal.", "need to see this one again...": "Matt McConaughey is Pearson, who wants to sell off his marijuana business.

As long as I find that the storyline of the movie is designed in the UK and there is a strong British accent, I will know that Gailridge will highlight his view of gentlemen.

It is SO narrative. It's like listening to an audio book. A movie is supposed to be filled with ACTION and ACTING, and a MUSICAL SCORE that moves you. This film has nothing of that. It is like an excuse to get a bunch of Hollywood stars WORKING in SOMETHING to get them paid during the downturn. The story JUMPS, here and here, and here and here and geeze~ ! It is SO obvious that more money was spent on the elaborate costumes of the time, than was spent on the script itself. It's a high school quality play put to film by 'I don't know who' .\nA sore waste of time. I forced myself to watch it for about 30 minutes, then puttered around the house, half listening to it, and finally turned it off. I do not recommend this movie to anyone except maybe /possibly 'people of a certain lifestyle' who might really enjoy critiquing the costumes.", "A Little Bit Of Everything": "I saw \"The Gentlemen\", starring Matthew McConaughey-The Beach Bum, The Dark Tower; Charlie Hunnam-Sons of Anarchy_tv, Queer As Folk_tv; Michelle Dockery-Downton Abbey_tv, Hanna; Henry Golding-Last Christmas, Crazy Rich Asians; Hugh Grant-Paddington 2, The Man From U.N.C.L.E._2015 and Colin Farrell-Dumbo_2019, Daredevil.\nThis is a gangster movie that is directed by Guy Ritchie-Man From U.N.C.L.E., Sherlock Holmes movies, Snatch & Lock, Stock and Smoking Barrels-and it has a little bit of everything in it. Matthew plays a pot grower in England that is thinking of retiring with his wife, Michelle. He has a nice offer from an Englishman but Henry shows up and makes an offer for his Hong Kong boss. Matthew decides to go with the Englishman but it doesn't sit well with Henry. Hugh plays a reporter that is looking for a big payday by selling information he has dug up to the highest bidder-he has dirt on several players. Charlie is Matthew's right hand man that usually does Matthew's dirty work and Colin is a coach at a local gym for wayward lads that like to steal and get into mischief when they are not working out in the gym.

The way, way, way overwrought brocade of morally \"lesser\" crime practitioners orbiting that calm center... Richie expects us to mistake all that heat as the shedding of light on the nature of criminal enterprise.And I don't buy it. For one thing it was complex all out of proportion to the ostensible goal of crime stories to shed that light. The idea that such complexity will make us smarter on this is bogus. Like I say in my title, this generates lots and lots of heat. But absent the *light*, that heat is useless, and in fact a little insulting: Richie thinks I'm not going to notice.", "The Gentlemen - Lore Of The Land": "Guy Ritchie once again defines the dark gritty and hilarious antics of gangster LondonI believe fans like myself would be very happy if all of his future projects were of a similar calibre.

The twists are good, the jokes are great but what stands out are the performances. A 'star studded cast' seems to be the highlight of every movie nowadays but let me tell you, the majority of the performances in this film are oscar worthy and pure gold. I say majority of course because Jeremy Strong enlisted one of the worst acting performances I've seen this decade!It is by far a better tribute to cinema than that 'Once upon a time' nonsense and I urge you to see this film.The only drawback for me is the third act. Too many pipes are introduced late in the film which contributes to a somewhat lacklustre and crammed finale. But apart from that a solid film.", "What a big MEH in British typical, badly scripted crap!": "I've tried to watch this movie as there're so many actors that I like very much. But it's just turned out a big boring disappointment; well, some kinda pretentious, trying to look cool but absolutely unnecessary failure. American actors were forced to speak with some tight-lipped British accent. The stupid beginning already exposed a predictable one-way developed direction. The blah, blah and blah never stimulated your further interest to keep your focus, just a bunch of guys in suits, coats, windbreakers cursed in British accent trying to give you an authentic British product.Well, this is definitely not \"Dallas Buyers Club\", nor any other interesting drug war movie. It's just pathetically trying to create another British style hit-and-run copycat \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)\" crap.Absolutely unwatchable.

The plot follows a poor American boy who wins a prestigious UK scholarship and quickly builds a marijuana empire. Flash forwards to present day, we see he now wants to sell up and retire.The movie is structured around a very camp Grant who is a corrupt newspaper reporter, who has a mountain of dodgy evidence and a related printed movie script. Grant narrates the plot throughout by way of a lengthy conversation with Hannan.The very tangled plot involves lots of double crossing, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to drive down the price of the marijuana empire. This is Ritchie doing what he does best, with his trademark witty dialogue and fast paced edits. Very entertaining watch.", "A Wild Ride": "Matthew McConaughey is great here as an American wheeler dealer who seeks retirement from his violent and hectic life running an elaborate pot growing and distribution network.

Let's get this out of the way upfront. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie's return to London crime-comedy is most assuredly a bit too far removed from today's acceptable Politically Correct line. It features mostly male characters and far too many stereotypes to count. It's also ridiculously funny. Mr. Ritchie doesn't take his story or characters too seriously, but he proves yet again that he's serious about entertainment.The film begins with Matthew McConaughey ordering \"a pint and a pickled egg\", a jolt to the senses, and a very cool opening credits sequence (think James Bond). We then find Fletcher, a sleazy private detective, making a surprise appearance at Ray's (Charlie Hunnam) house. Fletcher is played by a deliciously smarmy Hugh Grant. He is trying to extort 20 million from Ray by offering up the details he has uncovered about Ray and his boss, marijuana kingpin Mickey Pearson (McConaughey). Conveniently, Fletcher has turned the story into a screenplay, which he has generously agreed to include for the 20 million.It's tricky business trying to make drug dealers likable, and Ritchie steers clear of this despite the presence of a few. In addition to Mickey, we have Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) who is trying to buy Mickey's business; Lord George (Tom Wu), who controls the Chinese syndicate; and Dry Eye (Henry Goulding), an ambitious underling of Lord George who is anxious to make his own way, by any means necessary. Other players here include Mickey's wife Rosalind (Michele Dockery, \"Downton Abbey\", \"Godless\") who runs a \"safe space\" garage for exotic cars owned by women; Coach (Colin Farrell) who runs a boxing gym for troubled young adults; and Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), a tabloid editor seeking revenge for a dinner party where he felt Mickey disrespected him.As if all of those characters don't provide enough humorous crime fodder, we also have a Russian Oligarch, street gangs, heritage estate owners in need of cash, YouTube fight porn, and the plight of Laura Pressfield (Eliot Sumner, Sting's daughter) in a heroin haven. Fletcher's ongoing narrative for Ray provides the framework for the film, and each scene is filled to the rim with clever and wise-cracking dialogue - often delivered with flair by one of our colorful characters. Mr. Grant and Mr. Farrell are exceptionally fun to watch, and Ms. Dockery leaves us wishing her Rosalind was more prominently featured.For some reason he's never been a critical favorite, though Guy Ritchie garnered a cult following with his early frenetic crime flicks LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000). Lately he's been focusing on big budget films like SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS (2011), THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and ALADDIN (2019). He's back to his roots here, and is joined by many actors and crew members he's worked with before. Ritchie co-wrote the screenplay with Ivan Atkinson and Marne Davies. His cinematographer is Alan Stewart (ALADDIN) and his film editor in charge of those signature smash-cuts is frequent collaborator James Herbert.Quick listening pays off in some deadpan one-liners that might otherwise sneak by, although most of them can't be repeated here. The \"c-word\" most frequently used in the film is not 'cash', and is rarely a term of affection. There is even a Miramax gag. Too soon? Only you can decide. It's rare for McConaughey to play the heavy, and he seems to relish the opportunity. But then most of the actors seem to really enjoy delivering these lines and wearing these clothes ... well except for Colin Farrell's track suits and spectacles! Certainly this one isn't for the masses, and undoubtedly people will be offended. This is what happens when you make Guy Ritchie play nicely for a decade.", "Matthew McConaughey playing Matthew McConaughey - again. Yawn...": "I am NOT a McConaughey fan. At all. I watched this movie in spite of him and was impressed with the way all the other actors supported him. They did a great job.It was funny and terribly British! Them laughing at themselves - as always.Too bad McConaughey was a lead and took some of the fun out of it. IMHO.", "Guy Ritchie's best in a decade and a half": "This beats every other film that I have seen this month in terms of sheer entertainment.The story and screenplay, by Guy Ritchie, are as smooth as shots of the best single malt scotch. The dialogues, the characterization and the situations in which these characters find themselves are sure to keep you amused and super interested in the going ons. The trenchant British sense of humor is likely to leave you in splits.McConaughey, Hunnum, Hugh Grant, Collin Farrell and the rest of the cast being their absolute A game. Lovely to see such an ensemble cast getting the deserved screen time.Very highly recommended. Would definitely make those 100 minutes of your lockdown go super fast. Hence, the recommendation to watch it in bursts of 30-40 minutes than in a single go. Would increase the pleasure manifold.", "god bless colin farrell": "Colin Farrell is the ONLY and I mean only thing I enjoyed about this movie.The rest of it was too long and too boring and trying wayyyy too hard.

The movie is surprisingly good with a witty script that is filled with humor; a story that is filled with twists and turns, and a huge cast ensemble which everyone does a great job in their characters. I did think the movie was kind of boring in the first half hour until it picks up. The movie is not in a chronological order.The plot follows Reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant) breaks into Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) home. Requesting a lot of money in exchange for a return that Raymond's boss Mickey (Matthew McConaughey) and his organization of pot dealing story does not get sold to a movie studio. Fletcher and Raymond go over the story on what happened in the past. With Mickey wanting to retire from his organization. Which Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is trying to buy his organization but Mickey refuses. Creating a conflict with Dry Eye. Meanwhile, Coach (Colin Farrell) and his group of young adults accidently breaks into Mickey's plant farm. While Raymond is trying to get everything settled with dealing any conflict that Mickey has.It was a good story. It was all over the place. From the perspectives as Fletcher was talking to Raymond about in the beginning of the movie. There is a scene that Fletcher wrote a screen play from when he was spying on Matthew (Jeremy Strong) and Dry eye. Which he has himself and Raymond acting it out. It was funny and stupid. The film does have some fun humor. Then, there are some dark and serious moments which can be tough to watch.The cast ensemble is great with the movie. Matthew McConaughey takes the lead playing Mickey. There are some powerful moments when a dramatic tension leads him to fighting back. Charlie Hunnam was great. Henry Golding was good playing Dry Eye. Rosalind who is Mickey's wife played by Michelle Dockery is also good as well. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan are good. Colin Farrell was good and funny with his character. Hugh Grant almost unrecognizable playing Fletcher was funny and good.Guy Ritchie direction and script delivered a gangster drama movie with witty dialogue, narrative, and humor. It is what you can expect in a Guy Ritchie's movie. There are some over dramatic moments with a powerful music score by Christopher Benstead.Overall, The Gentlemen is a good action crime film. It does have a slow and confusing narrative beginning. The film kicks off with a humorous and witty direction and a good cast to hold the movie together with a story that has plenty of twists and turns to make it worth watching.", "Guy Ritchie's The Player": "Spoilers Warning Elaborated: Review also contains spoilers for \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish\" (1916) and \"The Player\" (1992).A stylish, vernacular dialect-heavy gangster flick, \"The Gentlemen\" is very much in the tradition of Guy Ritchie's earliest acclaimed films, \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998) and \"Snatch\" (2000). But, the storytelling devices here are more intricately reflexive, although his prior efforts are also known for their non-linear composition. As referenced above, it does what \"The Player\" (1992) did, with the script for the very movie we're watching being pitched within that movie, \"Bush,\" which was actually a working title, as written by Hugh Grant's character. Indeed, in the end, the script is pitched to Miramax and Ritchie himself, the actual producer and author of the movie. The entire picture is a deconstruction of itself, as well as this type of Ritchie production--revealing and reveling in the filmmaking processes and the convoluted criminal operations.\"The Player\" and \"The Gentlemen\" are only two examples of this device. The earliest such instance in a film that I recall is interesting and, perhaps, telling. \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish\" (1916) ended in similar fashion, with its star Douglas Fairbanks pitching the scenario to the studio. Both pictures involve that vice of drugs, as one particular conversation in \"The Gentlemen\" elaborates upon, in their plotting. Here, it's a marijuana kingpin and a struggle over his empire; in the Fairbanks vehicle, it's a cocaine-fueled, among other narcotics, detective. The silent film, of course, was a Sherlock Holmes parody. Given that Ritchie has made two Sherlock Holmes movies, perhaps it's not inconceivable that he's seen \"The Mystery of the Leaping Fish,\" despite its relative obscurity due to being a silent film from 1916.There's more to the reflexivity, though. Hugh Grant also stands in as the in-film surrogate camera(man), spying for a tabloid owner, taking photographs and recording video. He runs lines with Charlie Hunnam in one scene. They compete over narrator (un)reliability, for control of the movie. Heck, even those glasses they wear tend to reflect the equipment employed to make the movie. There are also the \"fight porn\" videos as films-within-the-film. That's in addition to the aspect ratio fluctuations and showing the celluloid (I seem to recall there's a German word for that, but I forget it) in fourth-wall-breaking fashion as Grant discusses filmmaking craft, albeit his celebration of celluloid seems odd in a movie that I believe--correct me if I'm wrong (as it's sometimes hard to tell when every film ends up digital anyways)--was shot digitally. I get that it's an homage to a vintage style, as this entire movie is vintage Guy Ritchie, but still, I miss celluloid. It's not unlike, say, \"The Conversation\" (1973), the \"it's a bit boring\" film referenced at one point, showing its soundtrack--indeed, making the film about it--in the film itself. \"The Gentlemen\" is more \"The Conversation\" than \"The Godfather\" films in that way.In the sidelong glance (Grant) at a sidelong glance (Hunnam) in the picture's schema of its central character played by Matthew McConaughey, it's the periphery characters played by Grant and, in an especially superfluous role, Colin Farrell who steal the show. Too bad neither received any awards attention. I think Grant really has the most interesting role here, being charged with the construction of the meta narrative and afforded to be sleazy without the macho facade of the rest, and Farrell's line readings are the best. Of the main characters, his is the least inherently intriguing or necessary, so it was all on him to make the part fascinating, and, come to think of it, he affects less machismo than others, too, despite playing another tough-guy type role--instead employing the brutality in a caretaker capacity for the youths in his charge. When his Coach fights off a bunch of knife-wielding kids, he simultaneously and humorously exploits it as a teachable moment for them. Hunnam, meanwhile, seems to have merely changed outfits to play the same basic role he did over seven seasons of \"Sons of Anarchy,\" and now that we're accustomed to McConaughey not being a mere rom-com personality, this role doesn't appear challenging. He delivers monologues about being the king or whatever with the same gusto, or lack thereof, as those pretentious Lincoln car commercials.One more self-referential aspect here of Ritchie's oeuvre that's worth reflecting upon are the jokes here involving race and sexuality. I didn't think much of it watching the movie--just that they were comical asides. That Grant's character seems to be a bit of a predatory gay trope, but even that didn't cause much more than a raised eyebrow from me in a picture full of reprobates, including a heterosexual rape attempt, as well as the implication of what was done to a pig. As for race, there's a brief gag of a crime-movie Asian stereotype, for instance, there's Hunnam's character musing about \"white guilt\" at one point, and Farrell's Coach arguing at another to a young black boxer that a remark of him being \"black\" isn't racist. Again, nothing much there within the context of the picture itself except as perhaps a commentary on varying racial attitudes among such a cast of characters. But, then, I read some reviews for \"The Gentlemen,\" and, wow, what a self-righteous lot entertainment critics can be--and dull. I mean, obviously, Ritchie like every other filmmaker has his perspective and his films may appeal to one demographic over another, as with all films, so it seems rather witless to focus reviews on that when there's much more aesthetically and cinematically interesting going on. For one, in this light, those scenes are but another reflexive device, of a defense against or rebuttal to criticism of Richie's oeuvre, from Brad Pitt as a gypsy to \"The Gentlemen.\"", "Everybody talks in analogies...?": "As a whole, The Gentlemen was very distracting and odd. The dialog was completely loaded with metaphors and zingers, the editing (and random use of b roll) was jarring and over-stylized, there was no character growth, the meta screenplay insert didn't add to the story at all, to name a few. The tone was intended to be fun, but there was hardly any room for that (aside from the on-foot chase scene, the gym guys' battle video, and Hugh Grant's quirkiness). The dramatic moments could of been a little more tense, but not a single one of the villains posed any sort of threat to the protagonists. The good guys kind of steam rolled through the turncoats and rival dealers. Everything worked out and it was super easy for them, which might be a first for a crime movie.The casting in the movie was excellent, but the character's motivations were so clean cut and obvious that the sense of mystery was essentially absent. The directing and acting shined. Yet, there was no momentum or character moments to really speak of; which, as a viewer, made the whole endeavor seem one-note.Other noteworthy aspects were the cinematography and soundtrack. Nothing bad to say here.I can see why lots of people would enjoy this movie, but I had a hard time getting into it.", "Complex": "A complex movie that's fast paced and with a lot of moving parts, but it's so good. The characters are well cast and the dialogue flows easily. The cinematography and scene effects work really well.", "Special excitement": "It was a wonderful movie. Great story. Interesting and spectacular movie style. Choose a wonderful actor and unparalleled acts of actors. A very exciting movie. The characterization was great too. Worth to see!", "This movie is pure gold.": "The script. The characters. The acting. The comedy. Everything was on point.This is one of the best movies of 2020.", "Brings Guy Ritchie Back To His Roots": "From the writer-director of Locks & Snatch, The Gentlemen presents the English filmmaker returning to his original roots to craft his latest in the same vein as his aforementioned works. Oozing with style, populated with colourful characters & led by a star-studded ensemble, it doesn't score as high as his best-known works but it's still a fun ride.Written & directed by Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes & The Man from U.N.C.L.E.), the introductions are swift, the premise set-up is quick & Ritchie's own brand of quirky wit is on display from the get-go. Although the story is promising at first, its self-indulgent quality & forced twists diminish the interest as plot progresses. There are some positives, however.The sophisticated set pieces, kinetic camerawork, consistent pace & lighthearted vibe, all work out in its favour. And then, there are good performances that lift it above a notch. Matthew McConaughey & Hugh Grant impress the most, with the former brandishing his natural charisma with flair. And they are finely supported by Charlie Hunnam & Collin Farrell who chip in with fab inputs of their own.Overall, The Gentlemen might please some & infuriate others with its unabashed treatment but considering Guy Ritchie's past couple outings, it's an improvement for sure. Slick, suave & stylish, the film rides heavily on splendid performances of its compelling cast, and while not one of the better examples of its genre(s), this crime comedy has got just enough meat on its bones to entertain & appease the crowds.", "Very good, but, ...": "Was a bit formulaic (eg out of sequence storytelling, \"fake outs\" (no, that scene didn't go exactly as you first saw it), loud catchy music, and plot twists (eg Antagonist had a Plan B and C but the protagonist has eyes on the back of his head). Maybe I am being too harsh, but, I did say it was a very good movie and gave it an 8.", "Good gangster film": "A typical Guy Ritchie film with a great cast of characters and good dialogue and scenes.", "Highly entertaining, don't mind the critics scores": "Greetings from Lithuania.Its been some time since i saw more entertaining gangster movie loved by most people (based on scores), and disliked by critics, again - based on scores. I highly enjoyed \"The Gentlemen\" (2019) for its being very entertaining, superbly acted, and wonderfully directed and written maze of a story. Its funny (in a dark way), very involving and keeps you guessing while at the same time glued to the screen. This Guy Ritchie's movie in every way. The only downside of this movie was probably the ending with a bit to much revelations and double cons and triple cons. But even that left me at the end with a big smile on my face. What a superbly entertaining movie. And to ad at the end - Colin Farrell's Coach should have a spin off movie one day - it is that good.", "Trash from the first scene": "The very first shot of the film is a man walking into the bar. The bar is empty, McConaughey's character walks in acting like a depressed king, the barman is depressed aswell but asks \"what's going on?\" as if he knows the difference between a good attitude & a bad one... the camera angle is low to make you look subserviant to them... the depressed god-king then sits down & grumbles to a music montage.All the main characters act like god - acting tough or acting pretty. They look like they have zero idea how to survive in the world without servants & money... Yet they pretend like they're doing it tough and are great survivalists and gentlemen in a rough world.Real people are vividly angry at bad guys with money or slave owners doing well, and are trying to level it out, scott free, while being happy with what they've got.", "Ritchie, back into his area.": "I think Ritchie is back in action with his favorite genre, anyway The Gentlemen was a refreshing joining from the man who made this level of subjects. He was in the slot of making fantasy and adventurous things for a couple of his works but now I think the original Ritchie is back. Not up to the mark of Snatch and Lock, Stock... but this is also a quite interesting one. Narration is good and the cut back formula that he is always using in his movies. Nice on to watch for all Ritchie fans.", "That Guy Ritchie delivers his own directing work with the Gentlemen again after a long time can be seen.": "The Gentlemen is a new crime film action directed, partly written and produced by Guy Ritchie, the director of Aladdin, Sherlock Holmes, and Snatch.In the film, the American expat Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) wants to stop his profitable drug empire and there are rumors that he wants to sell this. However, if one of his drug plantations is sabotaged and robbed, his entire empire loses its value. Private detective Fletcher (Hugh Grant) tells Pearson his security man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) that he has information about who might be responsible for sabotage and theft. He asks a lot of money for this information and Ray is not even sure if the information is reliable. Fletcher keeps visiting Ray again and again to gain his confidence and to show that he has the correct information. In the meantime, Ray tries to do his own research to find out who is responsible for the actions to please his boss and so not to have to buy Fletcher information unnecessarily for a ridiculously high amount.\nWith this film, Guy Ritchie managed to direct his own film again, as he did at the start of his director's career with the films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. After these films, he directed more films where he had to follow a certain direction for the films and elements of the stories. This was the case with the Sherlock Holmes, the King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and the live-action Aladdin films. With these films his freedom and creativity were somewhat limited, but with the Gentlemen he has regained this freedom and creativity. That he did not get this freedom and creativity for some years can unfortunately be seen in this new film from him. He has made a somewhat chaotic story of it. In this film, many different story lines play together. The film is also filled with characters who all try to sabotage each other or scam each other in the hope of being able to get hold of the profitable drug empire itself. As a viewer, you have to pay attention and keep your attention to the film to be able to keep following the story, because the different story lines are mixed at a rapid pace. At the end of the film, some of these storylines have not really had any meaning for the film either, and so ultimately come across as time-wasting storylines that have only made the film unnecessarily lengthy.The cast does a good job in the film, but due to the size of the cast they are not all equally important. The film focuses primarily on the characters of Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant who tell each other the same events from the film and see whose story is most logical and credible. Other actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Mitchelle Dockery also play more smaller roles, some of which actually didn't matter at the end of the film.", "Welcome back Guy Ritchie": "I was listening to the review of The Gentlemen by British film critic Mark Kermode the other day and he said , that Guy Ritchie had taken two steps backwards by reverting to making the type of movie he made at the beginning of his career . I couldn't disagree more. Lock Stock and Snatch are two of my favourite movies of all time and when i heard Ritchie was going back to his British gangster roots i couldn't have been more happier .This is the story of Mickey Pearson is an American who became rich by building a marijuana empire in London. When word gets out that he's looking to cash out of the business, it soon triggers an array of plots and schemes from those who want his fortune.Firstly i'll say that The Gentlemen isn't quite up to the standard of Snatch or Lockstock but it does have a better story line than both of those films.\nSome of the characters are superb and the stand out performers are Hugh Grant as Fletcher , who ironically plays a sleazy journalist and Colin Farrell who plays coach who runs a boxing club . I found the first hour lacking a little in humour but as the story unfolds , so do the laughs and the action.If i had be critical i would say that Mathew McConaughey probably looks a little bit out of place in the film. It feels like he was cast to put a big American name on the poster . Another problem i have is Charlie Hunnam . The man cannot do accents ( Just watch Green Street!) . I have no idea what accent he was attempting here but it sounded like a mixture of Liverpudlian , Cockney , Yorkshire and American .I really enjoyed The Gentlemen and i hope Guy Ritchie sticks to what he does best in the future and takes no notice of the sniffy critics . I have the feeling this is one of those movies that i'll enjoy watching multiple times over the years as i tend to do with Guy Ritchie's work.", "Guy Ritchie Delivers What I'm Longing For": "Honestly, why do critics dislike this one so much? And if not exactly disliking, then throwing it in the bowl of mediocrities. Me? I'm just happy Guy Ritchie has returned to his original form, the genre of crime comedy - which is also why the aforementioned critics seem to dislike it... Yes, \"The Gentleman\" is not breaking any new grounds, but oh man it is fun to watch.Ritchie puts on the table a new spiritual relative to his movies \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", \"Snatch\", \"Rocknrolla\" & \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\", a crime comedy so slick and lively that it's impossible not to like it. At least let the audience's rating show that. \"The Gentleman\" is a story about Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an american who built a marijuana empire in the Britain and is now tired of it, he tries to sell it to another american billionaire Matthew (Jeremy Strong), and guess what - all hell breaks loose in the criminal world around them. A whole bunch of awesome characters, crackling dialogue, amusing scenes, a few cool action sequences, the whole runtime tags along nice and smooth. The beginning or the first half is a tad bit slower than the rest of it & for some time I had fears of accurately predicting the end result, but, of course, the second half includes a whole lotta Ritchie shenanigans. Performances are a treat to watch, McConaughey delivers the goods as usual, but highlights also include Charlie Hunnam (whose character and performance might just be my favorite here, it came more as a surprise) and Hugh Grant, whom I could hardly compare to the other roles I've seen him do. Goes without saying that the rest of the cast is on the same level, never an average performance in a Guy Ritchie crime flick. \"The Gentleman\" is also tastefully filmed, no complaints about the aesthetical decisions, and props for the low-key awesome intro sequence. Also, I can always expect to steal a few songs from Guy's crime movies, \"The Gentleman\" did the exact opposite of a disappointment in that matter.Whereas enough people see \"The Gentleman\" as an old-shtick in new clothes, I see the type of stuff I've always expected from Ritchie since my 9th birthday when I saw \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells\" for the first time. \"The Gentleman\" is fun, playful, contains top tier performances, and is undeniably entertaining. Let the next from Ritchie be just as fun! My rating: 9/10.", "Starts slow ends up great": "He hasn't lost it. He still know how to make a movie that can make us laugh and thrill us with action just like he did in the past. I hope it gets a sequel.", "A fun movie, but nothing too special": "I was actually a bit disappointed by The Gentlemen, since I was expecting more \"ugliness\", if you will (maybe a bit more action as well). Perhaps one has been spoiled by Tarantino movies ? What must be said however, is that it is still a fun film.Matthew McConaughey is good as always. Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrel brings out quite fine performances as well. Hugh Grant is however the star of The Gentlemen, and he's just so damn slimy and spitting out so many comedically absurd statements that you just can't help but smile when he is let loose.The choice of music is perfect. A little favorite of mine; David Rawlings - \"Cumberland Gap\".At times, I think there is simply too much dialouge, which led to some confusion in following the plot. \"Who's side is he on, wait what why did he do that?\" my thoughts could be summarized as during those moments. Still, the movie does not lack funny moments, and I think they serve as \"redeemers\".To conclude; The Gentlemen is a fun movie with fine acting, but unfortunately it is for me lacking in some departments. If you like crime comedies however, this film is definitely for you.70/100", "didnt make it past 25 mins": "This was really really bad. cheesy with every stereotype in the book. typical wannabe hip cool edgy uk gansta flick.. fail.", "Bit of a mess": "The American explaining England to another American at the start seemed like Ritchie trying to reach a new audience. I've no problem with that but the film just downright sucked.Hugh Grant was cartoonish as the narrator, Hunnam as the intimidating right hand man to McConaughey was even worse. At least Colin Farrell was convincing, not enough to save the movie but he did a good job.The crack heads looked like a boy band. The MMA rappers making videos of their escapades with background dancers was a real low point.The story seemed disjointed like it had too many sub threads. I'd forgotten what the plot was an hour in. Ritchie used to make great crime capers but this falls extremely short.", "Slow and boring": "Attempted to watch this movie twice and was bored after 30 minutes and switched off. A movie I would not recommend.", "Not as good as everyone claims": "Read a few reviews that claimed this could be a potential cult classic. This is very far from the truth. Definitely a unique film but no way a 8.1/10 IMDB worthy. Some of these scores are ridiculous. Some people give everything a 8 or 9. I loved how the story was told through the lens of a potential movie script, but at times it was confusing what was going on due to poor character presentation. I will check out other Guy Ritchie films but in my opinion this is no way close to a cult classic. Just my opinion however.", "Fantastic movie": "Really worth watching- best movie I have seen for a long while", "At its High Points The Gentlemen is Fantastic, At its Low Points its Still A lot of Fun": "I've always been a defender of Guy Ritchie. He's made a couple of sub-par films (I think we should all just erase King Arthur out of our collective memory) but when he's on his game, very few can touch him. He might not have been the pioneer of British gangster films but he's the notable name for it. The Gentlemen is him flexing his creative muscles, instead of just carbon copying Snatch or Lock & Stock, he made some interesting creative choices in this. The Gentlemen had his style but it was updated and modern, and it had the same flair yet brought something fresh to the table. Does it get a little pretentious and precious? Yes, it absolutely does. The dialogue and the style is largely gold but I think Guy could have used someone looking over his shoulder and telling him to tighten it up a little. Some of the 5 minute speeches may have been more effective at 3:30 instead but in a movie so filled with memorable one-liners or fun scenes, this is a minor point of contention. I was genuinely impressed that he went the extra mile to present us with something unique.While McConaughey is the first featured in the credits, the ensemble here is surprisingly big and full of famous players. It took me a little while to get used to McConaughey in this role, with The Gentlemen being so overtly British, he's just doing McConaughey in the middle of it. But as the movie went on, you realize how fantastic of an actor he is and his casting seems more natural. Hugh Grant probably has the next most screen time, he's playing against type and while he's hamming it up a little, it was fun watching him do something so different. Charlie Hunnam is surprisingly effective, I've always liked him, he just hasn't had much luck picking movie projects. He's got a lot of screen presence though and this was a reminder that when he's well cast, he's a capable leading actor. My favourite performance was Colin Farrell as Coach, Farrell is a lot of fun and has good comedic chops when he's not being pretty boy Colin Farrell (he's also fantastic in the underrated Horrible Bosses). He had me cracking up whenever he was on screen. Henry Golding continues to rise as Dry Eye, this was a new direction for him and he has more range than just being a romantic comedy lead. I would also note Michelle Dockery as Mickey's beautiful wife Rosalind. She's a well written and fairly realistic character and Michelle does a great job portraying her.While I talked about the updated style, I also want to credit writer/director Guy Ritchie for turning out the great dialogue he usually does. The script here could have just been recycled but the plot has a couple of twists you don't expect (within reason, its tough with this kind of film, you are only introduced to so many characters) and the dialogue is chock full of interesting one-liners and memorable exchanges. There were several points where I was cackling, a lot of them came from Coach. Its very non PC but it fits the culture of the people in the movie.I didn't love The Gentlemen right of the bat but by the time I hit the halfway point, I was absolutely in. It also helped that the ending was handled well. There were a few surprises, some tense moments and some chuckles to be had. I'm glad I got to see it in theatres and I absolutely recommend you do the same. My rating is actually between an 8-9 but I must round down in this case. I hope more people end up going to see it and I applaud Ritchie and his team for returning to form in this release", "Guy Ritchie has style": "I am learning that I am a sucker for complex and witty dialogue. The Gentlemen's pacing is fueled by said high octane conversation between characters, and it managed to keep me fully immersed the entire time. The plot devices lend themselves to natural twists that I could have never predicted. The characters are unique and loveable. Even if you can't love it from a critical standpoint, I assure you that you will have a good time watching it.", "oh dear !": "Ritchie only has one style of directing, and its 'Mockney'........ again ! The name of the production company says it all..... Toff Guy. He must have some willing backers to invest in him because if it wasn't on Netflix he would be unlikely to get bums on seats for this offering. The over accentuated cockney accents, the rapper boy band, the obligatory Chinese villains and the Batman style graphics. Utter Rubbish. Its 2 hours I wont get back.I gave one star for the storyline, in other hands it would be watchable. Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery, Matthew Mcconaughey, Colin Farrell and Eddie Marson must have been desperate for money because it sure as hell wasn't the script that enticed them to do it.", "A True Gentleman": "Overall this was a really cool and original action/thriller that took a very unconventional approach. At first, it was confusing to fully understand and grasp what was happening but once you get into it, it's super entertaining. The acting was good and it was just a fun movie overall with some unexpected twists and turns.", "familiar territory.": "I guess guy ritchie likes quinton tarantino. alot. anyway, bad guys vs. bad guys. no one wins. charlie hunnam and hugh grant are nice surprises. mc conaughey isn't around all that much. henry golding should stick to rom coms. it's not terrible. but is ok good enough? p.s. many folks checked their phones.", "A Guy Ritchie masterpiece": "Intriguing and unexpected storytelling, still can't believe that Guy Ritchie directed this masterpiece. It seems so long and unending but at the end it's worth it. Its nice to see that Guy Ritchie redeemed himself by going back to his roots. THE GANGSTER ROOTS.For me, the dialogues and performance are the main focal point for this film, they are impressive and well executed. Charlie Hunnam nailed each scenes with his perfect British accent. Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant are like the perfect supporting characters.Matthew McConaughey is back to business boys! Wow! What a charismatic performance.", "wonderfull": "Its nice to see guy Richie back to form and what a great film it was. Awesome cast, humour and Hugh grants fletch might be my favourite character now considering I didn't even think it was him at first.", "Pure Entertainment!": "Four words...EYE CANDY FOR EVERYONE! Great acting, thoroughly enjoyed it!", "Lewd, crude and mercilessly gripping": "Guy Ritchie has taken a leaf from Martin Scorsese's book and gone back to what he does best - gangsters.The first half of the movie is very confusing, but Richie ties things up neatly in the second half and at a cracking pace. Matthew McConaughey may be the glamour boy, but Hugh Grant steals the show as a mercenary journalist trying to hawk secrets to both sides. Grant's career is on an upswing since he impersonated Jeremy Thorpe (also playing for two teams!). His posh accent totally disappears into 'Estuary English', as does Michelle Dockery's as Mickey's tough-cookie wife: I nearly fainted when Downton's Lady Mary used the C-word.Everyone uses the C-word. THE GENTLEMEN is lewd, crude, and viciously violent. But mercilessly gripping. This may be Ritchie's best movie.", "I keep getting older, they stay the same.": "I approached this one with a degree of scepticism. I felt the trailer was awful, and having lived through the boom of awful British Gangster movies that followed \"Lock Stocks\" success and wasn't particularly interested in more Mockney accented violence. So, it's remarkable then that \"The Gentlemen\" won me over.Investigative journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) lays out his upcoming expose' about Marijuana baron Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) to Pearson's consiglieri Ray (Charlie Hunnam) in an attempt to secure a bribe to kill the story. Pearson is looking to retire and sell his production and distribution networks to Matthew (Jeremy Strong) but his decision has encouraged other players in the market to step up.The humour was eventually the Trojan horse that won me over. It took a while to warm to Hugh Grant's Fletcher, so camp and letchy it's somehow so far beyond the realms of offensive and back out the other side, that you can't help but laugh at some of the things he says - and that's true of a lot of the film, plenty of moments in isolation would be appalling, but somehow the sheer volume of swearwords, stereotypes and violence overwhelms those feelings to the point you can't begin to take it seriously and start to laugh. And crucially, it's 'with' the film, rather than 'at' it. All this feels like a deliberate choice, rather than an accident - which I think stems from the fact that Ritchie was doing this two decades ago.It doesn't all work though. Charlie Hunnam is as terrible here as he is in everything but this time is saddled by an accent that could be . . .well, anything really . . . Welsh? The twists towards the end are a little more predictable than I would have liked and I'm not sure my justifications from the previous paragraph works for the potential rape scene.That said, I enjoyed the film, as did the majority of the screening that I was in, based on the laughs - and Colin Farrell earns a whole star here just on his own.", "Ritchie's things": "The first 30 minutes or so I was just laughing because of how silly everything looked and how childish everyone was. But after some time the movie sort of drag me in, I started to enjoy the silliness of it just cause I remembered how good Ritchie was with his smug and saucy crime comedies.I mean, the script still feels like it was written by an edgy 15-year-old but it's just so entertaining and fun. Lots of funny lines and exchanges, which get only better when you think about how the actors felt on set trying to deliver those, Farrell is amazing in this, he looks so adorable in his 40ties dressed as a 20 y.o.I'm 100% sure that no one could've made this script work but Ritchie. He does this good balance of childish nonsense and engaging story (with predictable twists, but still). All the main characters were likable enough to care for them, and even though they were not deep enough they still feel like they have some personality to them and that's great.Some of the stuff in the film was weird, like the message that heroin is bad and it kills people but weed is fine or something and some gay undertones, but most of the time it's just pure brainless entertainment.Never change, Guy Ritchie, never change.", "Worth watching for Hugh Grant": "Nice to see Hugh Grant play against type after playing the same character over and over again. Its worth watching for this alone. Unfortunately the novelty wears off long before this film ends.This is Lock Stock with a different wrapper. Same tough guys. Same talk and 'oh-so-witty-and-clever' dialogue. Same macho posturing that would get you smacked down in an instant in the real world. Nothing has changed much in Guy Ritchie's world.The Reservoir Dogs/Pulp Fiction influence has never been more blatant. But there was at least some character insight in Tarantino's films: That these criminal low-lifes were at heart just normal, regular guys like you and me just earning a living. There's no such insight to Ritchie's characters. They're all cartoon characters as might be imagined by an impressionable and naive child.Its like He never moved on from Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Even Tarantino moved on from Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.", "It's different but...": "Guy Ritchie is guy you either love or you don't, he has his style and he like to use it so don't be mad at him because he is doing it very good. It's another kinda dark, gritty, bloody, messy but quite enjoyable piece by Guy.Set in UK, it follows different narrative than usual for storytelling sake and it can be quite fun, somewhat predictable but fun. It gives you feeling like you are in the third person there and watching show that just keeps giving something to hold onto and keep you interested. There is also plenty of humor that sometimes is childish but mostly is pretty good and fits the scenes.The moment when you see tracksuit guys you in for the ride, there is no doubt that they will fail as they are absolutely wacky characters and perform things that you would expect from them. Colin Farrell being one of them is mesmerising, you can watch him speak with his accent and it's great. His character (Coach) will leave you laughing to your bones cause it's bloody dark and beautiful comedy if you have that kind of wiring for humor.Now the rest of guys are also pretty good, starting with McCounaghey playing our lead (Mickey Pearson). He is great you can't hold anything against him because he's a go guy for these kind of things also Hunnam playing Ray is tough, scary, funny and just a gold to watch. Hugh Grant is also pretty good at what he does sometimes you would wish his character (Fletcher) was a bit smarter but he fits at his place.Writing and telling this story is just classical Guy Ritchie style that even if you didn't know it was him that did this you would probably guess him if you saw any of his movies. His directing skills and writing are pretty much all the same but in this movie he has a bit different approach to certain things and there are instances where he magnifies humor with them which is greatly appreciated.It's funny, back to his roots movie with bloody and confrontational scenes that yell its crime comedy even though it's not what you might expect but it is very enjoyable. 3.5/4", "An entertaining return to that classic Guy Ritchie style of British gangster eccentricism": "The Gentlemen is a crime comedy film written and directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Aladdin). Starring Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant, it is an entertaining return to that classic Guy Ritchie style of British gangster eccentricism that has been missing for quite some time.In London, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a charismatic American drug kingpin who specialises in cannabis, attempts to sell off his business for $400,000,000 so he can retire in peace. After first offering the position to billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong), Mickey attracts the attention of Chinese gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding), who tries to buy out the business for a considerably lower asking price, much to Mickey's displeasure. As a result of this, word gets out among the world's crime syndicates as various other high ranking racketeers pursue ways to steal Mickey's empire out from under him.Much like \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\" before it, \"The Gentlemen\" wears its distinct British flavour on its sleeve as we are treated to an erratic and sometimes darkly funny look into the London criminal underworld. The unapologetic approach it takes to depicting violence, drug use, and political incorrectness will prove highly off-putting to any newcomers to the director's work but anyone longing for a return to the style of the aforementioned films will be greatly satisfied. It certainly feels refreshing to watch a movie that isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what would be considered appropriate for a modern gangster film, especially without seeming like it is trying too hard.After experiencing something of a creativity drought in recent years, Guy Ritchie comes back with a vengeance, bringing his trademark fast paced editing and unmistakable British charm to a film much more suited to his personal preferences. Anyone who has seen his early work will remember that he will often punctuate a violent scene with tongue-in-cheek comic relief to help ease the audience through the severity of what they have just witnessed. There were a number of times where I laughed out loud at some of these moments, sometimes out of shock and sometimes out of the genuine comedic value on display. In addition, Ritchie's storytelling technique also remains the same, in that you really need to pay attention to every intricate detail of a character's actions to fully understand the entire plot. There are the odd blink-and-you-miss-it moments where I failed to understand something and needed to look it up later on but they didn't feel as punishing to the viewer as in some of the director's previous films. Once you get used to this style, Ritchie's films take on a unique life of their own and begin to feel as though they exist within their own custom-made universe.Being an ensemble cast, each of the main actors shine in their own unique ways. Matthew McConaughey of course stands out as the main American in a predominantly British gangster world, exuding an unflappable confidence as he does business in a foreign land. Charlie Hunnam brings an intimidating stance to his role as McConaughey's right-hand man, often striking fear in other characters merely due to his presence in the room. Colin Farrell, while not receiving as much screen time as the rest of his co-stars, is his usual Irishman self with a penchant for saying the odd witty quip at the end of a scene. However, the role that surprised me the most was an almost unrecognisable Hugh Grant as a heavily-accented private detective. It actually took me a moment to realise it was even him near the beginning of the film but once I did I was treated to one of his best performances to date. I only wish he'd played roles like this much earlier in his career, as opposed to being typecast as the mild mannered Englishmen in romantic comedies but I suppose it's better late than never I guess.As it stands, \"The Gentlemen\" may not leave as much of an impression on audiences as Guy Ritchie's earlier films but it still makes for a worthy addition to his filmography. There is definitely much to enjoy in seeing a filmmaker creating something for audiences who appreciate the craft of his work in spite of the failures and near-misses throughout his career. If anything, it proves that even after more than twenty years in the film business, he still has plenty more surprises for us to look forward to.I rate it 8/10", "Guy Ritchie back to his best": "Finally got around to watching this and was not disappointed. Superb film, had me hooked from the beginning. Some stand out performances, especially Hugh Grant who was terrific and Colin Farrell was great too.\nGranted, not for everyone, but certainly doesn't warrant some of the negative comments I've read, I wonder what some people consider a good film, anyway, a must watch, very entertaining movie.", "True to Ritchie's Style": "Well, it certainly seems as if Guy Ritchie has got his groove back, but then again I am one of those people that feel that he never quite lost it, namely because I did quite like King Arthur. Anyway, with this film he is back in familiar territory, namely the English Criminal underworld with a cast of anti-heroes. Yeah, that is the type of film that I loved, and this one, well, this one certainly doesn't disappoint.So, we have this American, Mickey Pearson, that won a Rhodes Scholarship and moved over to England. However, while at university he got into the drug dealing scene, namely marijuana, and he basically never looked back (oh, did I mention that he was also studying botany - why not?). However, the movie shifts to a time where he has decided that he will retire and wants to off load his business.That is basically all I am going to tell you about the plot, though I have to admit the his syndicate is really craftily constructed because, well, being a former Oxbridge student means that he made some pretty good connections, and he also learnt how to move in their world, which basically sets himself up among the upper classes of England.One of the great things I love about Ritchie's films is that he doesn't shy away from the use of accents. Yeah, we hear the English, Cockney, and American accents quite well - I suspect that he does this on purpose. Yet, in another way it not only adds a lot of shine to the film, but it also gives the characters greater depth than those films were the actors do away with them.Oh, and I should mention that true to Ritchie's style, there are lots of twists and turns in the film, and of course a lot of black comedy. Sure, it ain't no Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but if you loved that film then you are probably going to really enjoy this one as well. Honestly, expect the unexpected.", "Guy Ritchie is phokin back, mate!": "I was never really a big fan of Guy Ritchie's works; yeah, he's got his style and everything but for some reason it just couldn't resonate with me - both Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch were fine pieces of art but not great. All the rest he has done since varied from ok to mediocre to poor to ok again but this entry in his filmography has unexpectedly taken a crown as being the best in it so far. The Gentlemen is a perfect blend of everything Mr Ritchie is known for - non-linear plot, twists and turns here and there, rich narrative and outstanding dialogues with tons of jokes, great performances from top notch actors - shout out to Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam for stealing most of the spotlight in this near perfect spectacle of a movie; I have to admit the first 10-15 minutes is a slowburner but after that there are balls of fire all the way. Although The Gentlemen offers almost nothing new or something we havent't seen before it brings Ritchie's formula of a great movie to a sheer perfection and makes you enjoy every single second, catch every single line and hit the replay button once the movie's over.", "Ritchie is back doing what he does best": "When weighed up directly against the beloved staples of Guy Ritchie's filmography, Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the charismatic directors newest film The Gentlemen is not even in the same league but as a refreshing return to his roots, this newest crime caper (proudly bought to you by the Lonsdale clothing company) is still a whole lot of fun should you go along for the ride.After a relatively forgettable decade or so that saw commercial hit Aladdin but a fair share of failures including King Arthur and The Man From Uncle, Gentlemen sees Ritchie return to the genre that made his name stand out from the crowd for the first time since 2008's RocknRolla and it's great to see the visually talented and energetic creative back on deck in a universe of British crims that he knows so well.Recruiting an all star cast led by American import Matthew McConaughey as marijuana kingpin Mickey Pearson, Charlie Hunnam as the softly spoken steak loving Raymond and a scene stealing Hugh Grant as slimy investigator/paparazzi fiend Fletcher, Gentlemen has Ritchie and his players navigate a rather complicated crime yarn that doesn't always gel together efficiently but when it does, you're quickly reminded as to why you feel in love with Ritchie crime capers in the first place.With Raymond and Fletcher telling the films story over a long night time set conversation, Gentlemen takes us on a ride through the underbelly of British crime tropes as we visit drug dens, soccer matches, royal estates, corner pubs and more tea connoisseurs than a Tetly convention and while the yarn is perhaps less action packed and visually inventive than we've come to expect from Ritchie offerings, the director's trademark character creation and dialogue work is still a cut above the usual.With barely a moments respite, Ritchie keeps things moving at a rapid pace as additional players like Colin Farrel's Coach, Henry Goldings criminal upstart Dry Eye and Michelle Dockery's fiery Rosalind partake in proceedings that give you little time to think or ask questions about what you are seeing, other than the fact it's all done in a tongue in cheek way that shows off the fun side of Ritchie that is what we love most about the British wunderkind.The journey of Gentlemen may never end up taking us to the outstanding destination or culmination that we hope for as we watch a bunch of deceiving and scheming players act up around the sale of Mickey Pearson's criminal enterprise but there's little denying the fact that the easy to watch, curse-ridden and well played out journey we partake in is a thoroughly enjoyable one, without ever becoming a downright memorable one.Final Say -It's great to see Guy Ritchie back doing what he does best and while The Gentlemen never reaches the dazzling heights of the directors best works, this is a step back in the right direction for a filmmaker who had lost his sense of purpose.3 1/2 parachutes out of 5", "Would you accept anything less?": "Speaking for myself I'd have to say this is Guy Ritchie's best film to date. Not a huge fan but I will say this movie was a fun watch. Very high paced film with a great cast and story. Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell stole the show. Part two? Doubt it. 7 stars", "Not bad, not bad": "Mostly talk than action the gentleman totally feels like a through back to Guy Richie's proper lad films. The combo of Richie working with Matthew McConaughey was worth the price of the ticket alone, but you get that extra added bonus with Hugh Grant being slightly out of his element but working it is hard.\nDefinitely a good watch.", "The power of weed": "I must say great story and very entertaining ,just a one character it doesn't fit to that movie is a Hugh Grant. It's a gangster movie Jason Statt ham should be here. I must say rest of the boys was fantastic plus the big fish boss . Brilliant escape from reality", "About as good as a straight up popcorn action flick can get": "Guy Ritchie's best film. About as good as a straight up action flick can get. No philosophy or political underlayer just straight up gangster entertainment with brilliant characters and acting. Hugh Grant gives a stand out performance how you've never seen him before. I love that after so many years he is finally embracing his career and enjoying it and playing around with it.", "Guy Ritchie in Top Form": "This is a unique and complex movie. Matthew McConaughey is very good as the American head of a Marijuana empire in Great Britain struggling with the complexity of trying to keep his empire flourishing amidst double crosses and warring gangs. The film is visually sleek and filled with twists. The characters are clever and funny. While McConaughey is the center of the film and very good, so are Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery, and Charlie Hunnam. Colin Farrell, once again proves he is an actor with great range. The rest of the supporting cast is very compelling. The movie is well filmed and well directed. It is one you must be engaged in to follow because of the language used and the plot twists. There were times in it that I thought it was taking place much earlier in time due to the costumes and scenery but then a cell phone or technological visual reminded me it is a modern fable. This is Guy Ritchie in top form.", "Almost a classic": "A movie which defines Guy Ritchie; great 'gangster-type' characters, an addictive & stylish script, and a driving storyline which never stalls or disappoints. The acting and actors are simply superb. And finally in true Ritchie-style, the innovative usage of the English language which separates this film from other tough-guy movies.\nBut if there is one thing which stops this from being an exceptional movie, it is Ritchie's unnecessary and sometimes pointless tradition of four-letter words. If any movie needs gore, sex or language to enhance it, it can demean it's quality. Unfortunately this movie loves the \"C\" word unlike true gentlemen, and while it might be just one fault, it could be one which isolates it from being a classic.", "'Bobby.... A pint and a pickled egg.'": "I was hooked instantly from the distinctive dialogue we have missed from Guy Ritchie for so long and it really is Ritchie's best since Snatch! Mickey runs a hugely successful marijuana empire in England and looks to sell it to the highest bidder. All the while, various outside influencers attempt to steal it from under his nose. That's the plot in a nutshell although there's many more strands that are great to discover on your first watch. I loved particular sequences in this one and really liked it overall! The plot is presented to us initially through Fletcher, a slimy private detective with plenty of dirt on the other characters in the story, with Hugh Grant on incredible form in a role we haven't really seen him do before. His frequent cinematic musings on the story that he has been following for some time is told beautifully through Ritchie's trademark dialogue which is the key highlight here combined with the performances. Mcconaughey provides an unorthodox 'good guy' and has a lot of fun in the role portraying someone genuinely menacing but also with clear morals in his business and a man who deeply loves his wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) who is also fantastic here. Colin Farrell is fantastically funny and badass in his role as Coach which also can be said for everyone in this movie; they take on the roles and effortlessly convey coolness! I was most impressed however with Charlie Hunham as Ray, a man with obsessive compulsive disorder yet when he's placed into a difficult situation to retrieve a clients daughter in a place he would prefer to avoid, he completely commands the situation and it makes for compelling viewing. The plot is very hard to follow in the first act and almost feels like you're having to catch up with what's going on straight away, but once you get into the flow with the characters, it's consistently entertaining, deliciously dark and absolutely hilarious, beautifully edited by James Herbert and a must see return to the British crime genre from one of the masters", "Great Movie": "In the beginning you think it's a boring story which is completely told. But at a certain point you find yourself solving the puzzle.\nSometimes it's very funny but brutal at the same time. It's a great movie with a complex plot.", "A star studded gem": "This star studded film has a convoluted plot that gets you thinking and thinking. To understand it, you have to pay lots of attention and keep thinking to follow it! It is crisp, clever and has great performances too. I enjoyed it.", "Back to doing what Guy Ritchie does best": "It's been a very long time since I've enjoyed a Guy Ritchie movie. He hasn't been able to capture the magic of Snatch ever since that film but thankfully, Ritchie went back to the drawing board and gave us The Gentlemen.The Gentlemen centers around Mickey Pearson, an American born marijuana kingpin, who's trying to sell off his business in London leading to a chain of events involving blackmail and schemes.Guy Ritchie's recent films like Aladdin have been disappointing me so it was very satisfying to see him back in his element with The Gentlemen. It felt really to see him go back to doing what he does best and I had a lot of fun with this film. This is Guy Ritchie at his most Guy Ritchie. The script is as snappy as you would expect from him with dialogues that flow very beautifully. They come at you fast and include some great moments that are hilarious. One of the things I enjoyed was the meta aspect to the film. There's a whole element where Hugh Grant is writing a script on the events that take place and the references to the filmmaking was fun to watch. Like Snatch, this film paces at breakneck speed. The film moves so quick that I feel like it needed to slow down at times to give some breathing space for the audience. The story has many twists and turns and the fast pacing can make it difficult to keep up with everything.The cast that Ritchie assembled for this film is amazing. Matthew McConaughey is excellent here as Mickey Pearson. Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan and Henry Golding all do a great job as well. Michelle Dockery is great but I wish more was done with her character. The standouts in my opinion were Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell. Hugh Grant was very entertaining to watch and the witty dialogue he was given added so much to the fun of his character. This is the best I've seen Charlie Hunnam in a film. I loved his calm demeanour but he was also someone you wouldn't want to mess with. Colin Farrell was absolutely hilarious and gave another strong performance. I was also surprised to see Bugzy Malone here but I thought he did well. There's one amazing sequence with him and Farrell that had me laughing out loud.Whilst The Gentlemen doesn't reach the levels of Snatch, it's still an entertaining watch and a return to form for Guy Ritchie. I hope Ritchie continues making flicks like this as this is where he plays to his strengths.", "Solid Film!": "Just came back from the theater and I have to say it was a fun ride with some solid acting and cinematography.So personally I'm not all to familiar with Guy Ritchie's films, but if anything I feel like I know his style from seeing this movie, and it's really enjoyable for the most part. This movie really likes to play with modern toys of editing and some cool visuals, like when Fletcher and Ray are talking about movie formats. It's fun and different from the traditional stuff and I like that.Now, first off the Directing, really solid with some really pretty shots in the film. Most of the movie is very static, camera on a tripod kinda style, but once there's action it goes loose, really making stuff chaotic and pulling you out from the serenity. It doesn't go overboard with cuts and crazy camera shake though, that's a good thing, its very well balanced and the violence is visceral and engaging. I already addressed it a bit but this movie can be really pretty at times, great color grading and set design.Acting was fantastic in this, my only issues were with Hugh Grant and Hunnam, the latter being a bit wooden/flat at times, but with does have some highs. Grant was the comedic relief and he did okay, sometimes it just felt a bit out there. Standouts where Colin Farrell and McConaughey, great stuff. Dialog was good too, definitely has some funny moments written in that worked well, and the harsher lines worked great too.Music, don't always address this but what there was was good and effective, and some really interesting choices, loved it.Now story, this is where most of my negatives come from. The movie starts with a cold open where Michael gets shot (you assume). It's fun and gets you into the movie nice and fast, then it's slowly burns up till about the last 20 or so minutes. During that slow burn there was some fun but a lot of it was setting storylines up, backgrounds and characters. The point of the movie where it got to slow for me was the scene before they threw that russian kid out the window (we'll get to that later). There was just so much buildup to a really short scene without a strong payoff in the scene itself, they decided to cut the plummeting of the russian kid which took me out of it for a bit. The movie does this a lot by the way, it likes to have ''cliffhangers'' which the way it tells the story, sometimes this works great, other times, not so much. Then we get to the finale, first off Matthew doesn't get a full ending and resolve, so we have to assume he transferred the money and did the deed, which is a bit lacking.Then comes the russian out of nowhere, so far we had some great backstory to most of our characters, but Atlas(?) the russian kid thrown out the roof, apparently had a rich dad which ended up putting a hit on Pearson. This came way too fast and outta nowhere, felt like it needed a small scene or 2 to establish this russian guy was actually mad/seeking revenge.Third, the ''you didn't play me, I played you! trope'' got used which is okay if there are clues sprinkled in the movie, but there weren't, not once did we know Ray was outsmarting Fletcher besides the one on one dialog maybe where we can sense some confidence but that's reaching. It was actually shown that Ray WASN'T that smart with his encounter with the kid who's phone he needed. And after that you're telling me he's in a ghillie suit spying on the professional detective spying on them? The whole movie is about tying up loose ends and connecting the dots, and it missed a few dots so to say, not dramatically though, the story is still strong, just felt a tiny bit rushed.At the end of the day I still really enjoyed the movie, fun fact with all the killing and crime, not a single cop in this movie, just a casual mention or two.For me 7.5/10 , would recommend.", "Great start to 2020!": "A modern day Smatch, Guy Richie back on form!Great mixture of bad language, jokes... cheesy action and plot, thoroughly enjoyed and recommend seeing and ignore any negative reviews", "Better than expected": "The film was better than expected let's just keep it at that.", "Guy Ritchie is back!": "This is how you make a proper Gangster movie, I didn't think he could ever make a movie as good as Snatch, but ladies and gentlemen he's done it and it's fucking brilliant!", "A bit slow, and vulgar language, with some quirk thrown in": "There is a lot of storytelling here, particularly by a very out of character Hugh Grant, which is fun to see. Everyone else seems fairly typical, except the language is not for the faint of heart. Accents too can be tricky to understand. It's not a horrible story, but not the best either. It does indeed feel very much like a Guy Ritchie movie, so fans of his will eat this up.", "Like a privileged adolescent trying desperately to impress adults at a party": "A dull film that is trying way too hard to be edgy and fun. Non of the characters ring true in any shape or form - sounding exactly like the rich actors trying their best to be \"hard\" and \"street\" that they are. The plot is predictable. The comedy tone deaf and flat. Truly an annoying privileged teen wanting to impress the adults. Oh and the joke at an animal's expense towards the end is painfully try-hard and beyond obvious. I got a free ticket. I'd suggest you don't pay for the renos on his country estate with your patronage.", "After the huge hit of Aladdin, Ritchie gets back to basics": "Last year, Aladdin the remake came out of nowhere to become Guy Ritchie's most popular movie of all time. His next movie? A return to classic Ritchie movies, the Gentlemen, a low budget crime movie starring an American (Matthew McConoaghey) and many familiar British stars. There's comedy, love, suspense, and tons of action. Go see this movie on the big screen if you can.", "Happy go lucky film": "It's an action movie. But yeah that's all. It's also a formula 1 race with so many twists and turns. It shows you how the world really works.", "It will keep you hooked till the end but wait...": "This isn't the end yet. It's worth a sequel and there will be.The story starts with one drug lord selling his empire to another businessman. There is speed in the mood and chaos in the motion with a lot of impeccably strong grip over the plot. I enjoyed every moment of it.", "Fun, sleek and entertaining!": "\"The Gentlemen\" is thoroughly enjoyable, sleek and smart. It proves writer/director Guy Ritchie has still got it.\n.\nIn this crime comedy, an American tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain out from under him.\n.\nBacked by an all-star and killer cast, \"The Gentlemen\" is tons of fun and well executed. Matthew McConaughey is fantastic, Hugh Grant is hilarious, Charlie Hunnam is great but Colin Farrell steals the show. A funny and twisted performance. I really enjoyed how the film was shot kind of like a \"film within a film\" (once you see it you'll get what I mean). Ritchie's dialogue is sharp as ever and his storytelling is still worth watching develop. I had a lot of fun with \"The Gentlemen\".", "Left Handed Cigarettes": "Matthew McConaughey plays Mickey \"The Man\" head of a British Marijuana Empire he built from scratch. Looking to get out of the business and possibly return to his native America and retire with Wife Roz played by Michelle Dockery. He offers his empire for sale which leads to about three layers of thieves looking to snuff him out. The Film directed by Guy Ritchie is sort of like a pyramid scheme with Mickey on top like Amway except the product is Weed. Plenty of fast paced action and dialogue especially from Hugh Grant as Fletcher a Blackmailing Private Investigator and fledging Screenplay writer and Colin Farrell as Coach a Gangster Boxing Club Owner with but with Empathy. I personally liked this Movie but think they can do better on the next installment sure to be out next year or sooner. McConaughey embodies Mickey", "Just great": "Great narrative, plenty of twists and a gold standard cast involved. Had me gripped from start to finish. Guy Ritchie smashed it here, a must watch.", "Confused movie": "After 15 or 20 minutes you don't know who the personages are.\nContinuing to see the movie is not much what you can clarify\nBoring\nIt is a pity .So many excelent actors wasted in that way.", "\"The American Lion in the English Jungle\"": "\"The American Lion in the English Jungle\"Guy Ritchie returns to both the writing and directing chair to craft an exciting action-filled comedy that only he and he alone could create. \"The Gentlemen\" stars a wide array of talent that perfectly bring Ritchie's patented expressive dialogue to life with every word they utter. The excitement in this film is not solely found in the action and gunshots that were heavily marketed but is instead felt within the elaborate narrative that keeps at a steady pace, along with the eccentric characters that help shepherd it along. Ritchie's style bleeds throughout this film's core from the very opening title credits, to the final cut to black; all of his standard trademarks are here which some may find tiresome, while others will find great enjoyment out of. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that with Ritchie in the driver's seat \"The Gentlemen\" is an immensely entertaining film that will keep audiences engaged in its wonderful world of formalized chaos.\n\"The Gentlemen\" centers around the suave Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a kingpin that reigns over his established marijuana empire as he navigates throughout London attempting to remain on top, despite the many adversarial forces he faces along the way (But it is far more complex than that). A private investigator known only as Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is hired by Big Dave (Eddie Marsan), an editor for the Daily Print tabloid with the strict assignment of investigating Pearson's personal ties to a royal named Lord Pressfield (Samuel West). During the course of his investigation, Fletcher uncovers several secrets shrouded in mystery and deception. It is realized, that Pearson is fully intent on selling his business to the American billionaire, Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) for a grand sum of $400 million. However, at the exact same time, a young Chinese crime boss named, Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is looking to relieve Pearson of the stress by outright buying the entire establishment. When Pearson refuses, he and his wife Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery) along with his right-hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) are thrust into a world of chaos where they are the primary targets everyone is aimed at. Having said that, it should be noted that the first two-thirds of the film are framed within a late-night conversation Fletcher invites Raymond to, with regards to his findings. Fletcher fully intends on selling his discoveries to Raymond in exchange for \u00c2\u00a320 million or he will go to print, a simple blackmail technique.\nRitchie provides an exhilarating screenplay that keeps audiences glued to their seats guessing where it will go next and just when you think you've figured it out, the film takes a complete detour of absurdity that most would fail in their attempts The film rarely stops to take a break which on paper may seem like a real flaw; but for \"The Gentlemen\" it is not. The narrative is told by the character of Fletcher and it feels extremely meta, so much so that a poster of one of Ritchie's previous projects can be spotted for keen eyes. This type of narrative structure is a technique that some may find distracting and unfocused, but I personally find it to be brilliant. After the beautiful opening credits, we are instantly thrown into a shocking moment that immediately grabs your attention like a salacious headline; it is hard to forget. With this inciting moment now lodged in our brains, the audience becomes hyper-focused as they watch in awe eagerly waiting for that fatal moment to come back; and when it finally does, it is just as shocking as it was when we first witnessed it. Although this is a method used by many writers and directors, Ritchie pulls it off in a way that does not entirely spoil the film from the offset. With the film's events unfolding through Fletcher's recounting of the situations, as an actual written screenplay titled, \"Bush\" you cannot help but be fully captivated. The constant callbacks to past incidents and shifts of perspective all add to create a story that is one of the most entertaining ones of the year.\"The Gentlemen\" as I expressed earlier, is a film constructed by an auteur that relishes in a flashy, yet extravagant style that only he could design. From a very entry-level observation, the first thing that will catch anyone's attention are the elaborate and debonair outfits everyone on the cast, dons. Regardless of whether it is a fresh tapered suit, a loose-fitting jacket, or a bold tracksuit, every character showcased on-screen displays a level of sophistication only Guy Ritchie could pull off. Every shoe, every top, every pair of glasses; every single article of clothing appears to have been hand-picked as a means of painting each individual cast member as a figure you will not soon forget. Surprisingly, this quality is not exclusive to only the main cast as many of the extras also have a unique visual flavor that brings more life into every moment. When the film travels from scene to scene, the characters look fantastic, but so is the dialogue they are speaking. Ritchie's use of language is rather impressive as none of his characters are presented as shallow one-trick ponies. Every line of dialogue is pointed with a purpose that perfectly sets the stakes for every scene as all of the actors and actresses are constantly vying to dominate the verbal battles they find themselves in. With metaphors and jokes littered all throughout, it is hard to not find all of the English accents just a bit endearing. Unfortunately, on the flip side, because of how animated the characters and their words can be at times, they will occasionally slip into the territory of a cartoonish caricature of themselves. It is not distinctively a fault of the film that ruins it by any means, but it can be a bit overwhelming from time to time (A sentiment that is true for the entirety of the film).\n\"The Gentlemen\" is a blast of a film that explodes with character and features a fabulous cast that all bring their best. From the costumes and sets to the characters and their dialogue, Ritchie's fingerprints are all over this film and it appears as though he is playing in a wheelhouse where he feels the most comfortable. Now of course, if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's films or his overabundant style, then \"The Gentlemen\" may not be your cup of tea. However, the story and visual flair used to present it, flows throughout every frame and is certainly something that will entertain from beginning to end. Truly the first must-watch of 2020.Final Verdict - B-", "Waste of talent...": "What was loved about Snatched was how every character, or group of characters not only are loved, but are all interconnected to the story. The story moves fast, and every actor fits their role perfectly.\nThe Gentlemen has none of that.\nMatthew McConahay feels so out of place in his role, and in this film. As does every other actor in this film. While watching this, I found myself questioning why the story unfolds so slowly. The action is so few and far in between, that I started hoping the ending great climax, which it doesn't. The writing is just poorly done. While Snatch just felt fun, this movie doesn't, including a cringy but brief attempt of rape.\nOverall, its a waste of time. There are several great actors in this movie, but they all feel out of place. The story isn't interesting, its poorly written and not worth watching.", "Decent watch, but way too incomparable with Guy Ritchie earlier classics...": "Decent watch, but way too incomparable with Guy Ritchie earlier classics...\nTrying to be honest here)The movie was definitely a piece of art and anybody else would create it, would be strait 10 stars from me! But considering who made this film, it is definitely not on the par with Snatch or Lock, stock...That's why only 6 stars...", "Phuc-ing great": "\"The Gentlemen\". Well, are they actually Gentlemen? This is a great Mob style movie, gangs treading on other gangs feet so to say. The \"Gentlemen\" take care of the problems that the mob boss finds himself in, in a very proper style. The movie is packed with story, dialogue, action, crime, and, strangely, humour. Though you might not get the humour at first, it is there hidden amongst the crime and gore. It is a well written story, with some hard hitting facts about society as a whole. It is a very entertaining {though brutal} film, well worth watching.", "Be gentleman do not complain about boring movie!": "First 20-25 minutes are very boring and nothing happened. Is this entertainment ?", "The King of the Genre": "The opening monologue by Matthew McConaughey is a good sum up of Guy Ritchie's career, if you are the king of the jungle you need to prove it from time to time so that there is no doubt, and for those that had forgotten, Guy Ritchie is indeed the king of this genre. His English crime thrillers are so spectacularly entertaining that you are always having a good time watching them and time just flies by. I think the secret lies in the writing, with the creation of unforgettable side characters to his very elaborate stories. I mean who can forget Vinnie Jones in both Lock Stock and Snatch, or Brad Pitt in Snatch? Here it's Hugh Grant and Collin Farrell that steal the show, so much so that McConaughey's protagonist is a bit one dimensional and forgettable. But almost every other character is really good and has a moment to shine. One almost forgets that it's been twelve years since his last foray into the genre with RocknRolla, and more than twenty since Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels exploded to the screen. He has been a bit lost trying to build a successful franchise in Hollywood, and after some not so well received movies he came back to familiar ground and knocked it out of the park. I am scoring this only a 7 because after all is said and done I had already seen this movie three times before, that was my problem with Snatch and even more so with this one, but boy, did I have a good time watching it.", "The Gentlemen is a jolly, violent, and funny with the crime families of England and Matthew McConaughey": "For a guy that loves movies, I do have my favorite and least favorite genres. One of those least favorite genres are mob movies. It has nothing to do with the explicit content or their morals. I just don't find them as engaging as a shoot-em-up western, hilarious comedy, or a fantastical science fiction. A lot of it has to do with the overall dialogue and plot structure. They play out like soap operas where family members and friends will get on board, but then betray those around them, usually whenever it's very convenient for the story to progress forward.That's not to say I dislike mafia stories in general. I'll even admit that The Godfather, Scarface, The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, and the recent The Irishman are all incredible works of art. I think it has to do with how people try to imitate mobs, only to come off boring. The key to making them work, especially for me, is the really make the characters engaging and worth caring for. In something like The Godfather, you consistently feel sorry for Al Pacino who got dragged into the family business. So let's see what The Gentlemen has to offer.In England, an American crime boss Mickey Pearson (played by Matthew McConaughey) runs a successful drug business that he's in the process of trying to sell for $400 million dollars. All he wants is to retire with his wife Rosalind (played by Michelle Dockery). But along with overall process of hiding it, an underboss for the Chinese mafia, Dry Eye (played by Henry Golding) offers to purchase the drug business, but is rejected. At the same time, one of the hidden drug labs is vandalized and raided by amateur boxers who film their encounter and post it on social media as a part of a rap video.This angers the boxer's coach...named Coach (played by Colin Farrell) who offers his services to Mickey's underboss Raymond. This leads Coach into capturing members of the Chinese mafia to try and intimidate them into leaving them alone. Of course, this only entices them to get more violent with their methods. On top of all this, Big Dave (played by Eddie Marsan), who's the editor of the Daily Print tabloid, hires a private investigator Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) to dig into this criminal underworld. It just so happens that Fletcher also wants to try and make some blackmail money.The Gentlemen certainly has a lot of characters and plots to get through. I didn't even list smaller parts. That's why I'm glad to say that I was very entertained by The Gentlemen. Director Guy Richie (Sherlock Holmes, Aladdin) tends to use a lot of plot within his stories and can be hit or miss. He seems to love making these mob movies as they can take advantage of that. Where The Gentlemen succeeds is it's characters as I found them to be interesting and balances things by showing off lower and higher class gangsters. It may not be the first, but something about it here feels distinct.This is another movie where the casting is perfect. I can't call them deep characters, but each actor, whether it's Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, or Henry Golding, they all do a good job bringing a balance of intimidating and funny. I would count the film as a comedy (I'm not even going to spoil what happens to Hugh Grant's character), as a lot of the humor relies on whose trying to rip off who or who their trying to impress.Having said that, the movie can get a little too caught up in it's plots. While most I could follow, there were a lot that were either formulaic or just didn't go anywhere. An editing process probably would have helped make it tighter and focused. Plus you should know the movie does not follow a straightforward story. Because of this, you really need to pay attention to what's going on. This may turn off some people who just want to sit back and have fun. There's a lot of fun here too, though it'll help to keep tabs on whose who and what their doing.I'll give this eight tweed blazers out of ten. I'd say it'll have a good life on video and on the streaming platforms. If this sounds good, then I expect you'll enjoy this. It's teatime and The Gentlemen brings the mafia with it.", "Written by Laurence Fox...": "I used to like Guy Ritchie as a director but this film feels like he's playing discriminatory bingo & attempting to win a full house.\"The Gentlemen\" is laden with vile anti-semitism, racism, homophobia, classism, xenophobia, misogyny, elitism etc. It's a Donald Trump supporter's idea of heaven but a sane individual's conception of hell.", "Smoking Barrels": "I'm not exactly sure why this film is called The Gentlemen. Maybe \"Bush\" was too raunchy for the MPAA? Or people would have associated it with a former president? Either way, that was the title of the screenplay of which this meta movie is based upon. This is Guy Richie's return to form in the genre of British gangster movies. This time, however, he places himself and the genre he mastered under a parody. This is a self-aware comedy about British gangster movie cliches. A deconstructed version of Snatch, if you will. I thought I'd grow very tired of the constant winking to the audience. Yet, this film doesn't just derive its humor through self-deprecation. It's one of the few comedies out there that feels truly free and alive. The dialogue flows so quick and gracefully, in that classic English way. It's just really funny throughout. I can also give the movie major props for doing three minor, but critical things that just pull everything together. One, this film might just have the only Hugh Grant performance that I didn't hate. Out with the bashful, handsome dope, in with a foul-mouthed, pitch perfect impersonation of Michael Caine. Two, this film might hold the record for the most times the C-Word was used in dialogue, and yet, so classily that you could barely notice it. Three, this film rehabilitates the Miramax brand. Miramax was founded, and permanently tainted by Harvey Weinstein. To see it return here, under new management, is a fascinating conversation all it's own.", "Is Guy Ritchie back?": "Guy Ritchie started his career with a bang: \"Lock, stock & Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998) and \"Snatch\" (2000) defined a genre and solidified a very unique style of doing British gangster films. They were messier, faster and bolder than their American counterparts but still powered with great scripts and powerful performances.\nIt also created a faithful legion of fans who loved Richie's first two features enough to disregard a streak of subpar films after that and still keep looking forward to any new film he put out.Being one of those fans, my expectations to \"The Gentlemen\" were still high and I sat down expecting to watch a true Guy Ritchie film, if not as good as the first two hits, at least something that could make them justice. After all, he was finally returning to the gangster genre and that was enough of a promise.I wasn't left disappointed. The film brought back many of his traits he had seemed to forgot how to use, presenting at the same time a more mature and cleaner style.\nI didn't have as much fun as with Snatch, but I felt entertained and at times drawn to that magic and filthy universe filled with violence, quirky characters, and politically incorrect racial and homophobic slurs - it's clear these are not ill intended, it's simply the world where this characters live in.Grant, McConaughey and Hunnam convincingly exchange jabs at each other, making the most of a very tongue in cheek script with some well directed moments of drama and a few well timed twists. There are also some minor but interesting perfomances by Collin Farrell and Michelle Dockery who seem to be well positioned to have a lot more screening time in any eventual sequel this might have.It's very satisfying to see Guy Ritchie closer to his prime! May he not lose the balance again.", "Finally": "A good Guy Richie movie again. Cool acting and excellent script. Loved all the characters, particularly Colin Farrel was just great.", "Just another Guy Ritchie gangster movie - if you liked his others, you'll enjoy this.": "A more mature gangster movie that glorifies the gangster life without glorifying the violence, which means there's a lot of talking, but not much else. Solid performances from the entire cast, but the story wasn't that engaging and the twists weren't that surprising. Good use of humour and style, but the lead up to and inclusion of the 4th wall cameo felt unnecessary.", "Guy Ritchie successfully returns to his roots": "The Gentlemen has such marvelous style that it's nearly impossible not to get swept up in its intricate tale. This is the type of movie Guy Ritchie does best and I for one am in favor of him continuing to make these kinds of movies. His Tarantino-esque dialogue is delivered perfectly by a very talented cast. Hugh Grant is probably the most entertaining I've ever seen him and Colin Farrell is wickedly funny. The movie is filmed with such flair that you get sucked into this goofy world and it doesn't let you go until the credits hit. I had an absolute blast watching this film and it is one that rewards you for paying close attention.", "That's a very solid 9": "This film is very very good, it makes you debate a 10. The acting all round was amazing especially from Matthew McConaughey, he was the stand out but the acting from everyone involved was brilliant. If you get that many talented actors and Bugzy malone you're guaranteed a good film. My expectations were high going into it and they were exceeded.", "Slick but I've seen similar . before": "The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie directed movie on Netflix, entertaining, yet very very derivative of earlier Guy Ritchie movies and Tarantino. Worth watching but nothing that will stay in your memory 6/10.", "Ritchie returns home with stylish \"Gentlemen\"": "Like Wes Anderson, Tim Burton and Michael Bay, you can tell when a film is made by Guy Ritchie just by watching a few minutes of it. The British director has carried a sense of hyper stylization through each of his films, most notably in crime comedies that began with the one-two punch of \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch.\" Now, after a few big studio duds (\"King Arthur,\" \"Aladdin\"), Ritchie has come home to his roots with \"The Gentlemen.\"Growing tired of the marijuana business and fearing for the security of his future, Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) decides he wants to sell his lucrative empire. Luckily for him, a rich American buyer is willing to fork over a pretty penny. Unluckily for Mickey though, his life of crime has made him a few enemies that would like nothing more than to see him ruined. With his enemies fast approaching on all sides, Mickey will now have to get his hands dirtier than ever if he ever wants to have a chance to clean them off.\"The Gentlemen\" is business as usual for Ritchie as he dives right back into the street crime genre he made his name in.What may seem overindulgent to others is only conventional to Ritchie as he uses all the flashy tactics in the book. Even the opening credits - which contain numerous minor spoilers for some odd reason - remind one of a Bond film. After that, we are led on an endless parade of rapid editing, exaggerated characters and many other stylish facets. It's a bombardment of the senses, but one that never becomes overbearing.However, like all Ritchie films, \"The Gentlemen\" ends up leaning too hard on style over substance, which is saying a lot because there is a lot of substance here. Some directorial choices seem to be made only for vanity, such as one bit where a character drones on about the magic of classic cinema. I was reminded of the great \"Jurassic Park\" quote which I am paraphrasing: \"Ritchie was so preoccupied with whether or not he could; he didn't stop to think if he should.\"Such is the case in Ritchie's previous crime films: there are plots within plots, and those plots have plots on top of them. In this film, the narrative revolves around a discussion between two characters as one tells the other about the events that have unfolded. These events are new to us but have already happened within the timeframe of the film. What we get is a sort of comedic murder mystery where each event is changed and then rechanged again based upon a certain character's perspective on what happened.This framing device makes the movie an interesting puzzle, albeit a needlessly convoluted one. Specific details sometimes get lost in the shuffle, only to come back again to confuse us more. Just like the directing, this problem seems to stem from Ritchie's insistence on overdoing things. It's quantity over quality as too many things are thrown into the script without much regard for clarity or purpose.Since his Oscar win in 2014, Matthew McConaughey has had a hard time picking projects that use his acting strengths and that also turns out to be good. Thankfully, Mr. \"Alright, Alright, Alright\" chose wisely here as Ritchie uses his captivating screen presence in some impressive monologues.Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant play the two characters having a banterous discussion around the film's events. Grant easily takes the top spot between the two as he seems to thoroughly enjoy his character's eccentric quirks.Rounding out the cast is Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding and, most notably, Colin Farrell as a boxing coach simply named \"Coach.\" Even though Mickey is the main character, Coach is the one you'll remember the most after.It can be easy to forget sometimes that movies are allowed to solely be entertaining popcorn flicks. This rings truer during awards season when every film is trying to take a stand on something and fighting to make a mark on our culture.Of course, you still would like that popcorn flick to be well-made. Being as how January is usually a dumping ground for maligned films, you could do a lot worse than this enjoyable romp.", "Now that's a movie!": "Right from the getgo you know you're in for something good.

You have to carefully manage your exit so you get out alive, cos it's much cheaper to take it over if the boss is dead.With Matthew David McConaughey wearing his r\u00c3\u00b4le like an well tailored suit, Hugh Grant as a sleazy blackmailing cockney ( leaving his plummy accent behind) and the rest of the cast fitting together like a jigsaw puzzle, you have some great working materialThe London crime scene is so much more intelligent than the North American shootfests we are used to, sort of like Downton Abbey against Dallas, and this movie cashes in on the intellectual nature of the criminals. They're all so smart!It's Guy Ritchie at his best, he explains things as the plot unfolds without breaking the storyline.He injects humour into nasty situations, pulls off plot twists that are perfectly believable and, something which is Ritchie's true talent, he makes the villains likeable.No woke undercurrents in this project, that I can tell you.... and I'm still trying to get over hearing Michelle Dockery using the \"f\" word.. something Lady Mary Crawley would faint over if she heard it.A few weak moments in the plot ( which is why I only rated it an 8 ) but you can expect that with the tangled stories that are the hallmarks of his films.Sit back and enjoy this one", "Everything that I was hoping it wouldn't be......": "I'm not a lover of Guy Ritchie, who always seems to want to perpetuate the Kray myth that all cockneys (note small 'c') and the really are not.

The plot does have its twists, and I enjoyed Farrells performance, but I've had enough of Ritchie making every character into a metamorphosed Vinnie Jones, so this won't get more than a 5 from me ..... almost wish I'd gone to see Little Women instead", "Just terrible. Overacted and Unconvicncing.": "I'm usually a big fan of UK crime films but this one got up my nose from the beginning with its senseless idea of 'story telling; the film.

The line of the wrestler is even the gold finger of the screenwriter who madly hangs. When there is no crisis that cannot be solved, he suddenly kills the enemy. Like \"Theft and Smuggling\" and \"Two Big Cigarettes\", Geric wants to shoot a farce caused by a small incident, but the script level is no longer as good as it once was. There is no longer the kind of hearty refreshing feeling that year. But fortunately, Gerici is a clever director, he knows how to modify the details of the story to cover up the flaws and increase the visibility (an interesting narrator, the suspense of the opening \"one shot\"), he can write lines, and Very good at editing, so the tension of at least a few highlight scenes is still preserved. Under this creative thinking, Geric has become more and more a representative of some tasteless movies in recent years: it will not be ugly and boring, but it is definitely not a good work.", "Pleasantly surprised!": "Guy Ritchie's reputation for cockney gangster films has begun to wane, as people have begun to forget their initial excitement over Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones punching people in films like Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. More recently, Ritchie's big-screen productions have been underwhelming - those who've seen Aladdin and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will no doubt agree. However, The Gentlemen is more his style of flick, and does a good job getting back to his best (namely, plots he understands).I am not a massive gangster fan, I must admit; Peaky Blinders doesn't do it for me, nor did any of the Godfathers (they are slow and boring - come get me). Quirky gangster films, however, have enough comedy and lightheartedness in them that I don't feel myself drowning in overacting, so I went into this with an open mind. My reward was a colourful world, more colourful characters, and a half-decent plot that wasn't content to meander, but kept you guessing. Loosely, the story follows Matthew McConaughey's Ricky, a drugs lord wanting out the game by selling his empire to the highest bidder. There are several interested parties with offers on the table, but nothing in the criminal underworld is as straightforward as that.The star of the film isn't the big-billed actors: it's not McConaughey (who, by the way, needs to be taught how to pronounce \"pint\" - I don't know why, but he actually butchered this one word ordering a drink at the start of the film), nor is it Charlie Hunnam as Ray, the right-hand man of the kingpin. No, the real gem in this film is none other than HUGH GRANT. I don't really watch romcoms, so I haven't seen him act before (to be fair, nobody who's seen him in a romcom has seen him act properly either), but Grant is exceptional as a sleazy reporter doing his best to earn a bit before everything goes mad. He is equal parts funny and sordid, and is the ideal foil to a plot that is guilty of occasionally taking itself too seriously.One casting issue I did have was, to be fair to Ritchie, always going to be a gamble: Bugzy Malone. Now it's not because he's a bad actor (to be honest, I didn't realise who it was until halfway through), but because Ritchie tried really, really hard to make grime music a part of the film. This isn't a vendetta against grime - it just didn't make a lot of sense when a music video was suddenly cut into the middle of a film, and made even less sense when the plot tried to justify why these street thugs started rapping on camera. It's only a minor plot point, but was jarring enough to take me out of the reality for a second, which really does nobody any favours.The Gentlemen delivers on what it promises. Guns, drugs, thugs, plenty of swearing and a touch of deceit to keep the more observant viewers guessing. Ritchie should stick to what he's good at - this is proof enough that he has a popular niche, and there's still something left in the tank.", "Ritchies Back and Better Than ever": "No review as one word could Sum this latest\nOffering from Mr Ritchie\"AWESOME\"", "perfect gangster movie": "Its not a documentary. it has some things out of reality. its a movie, 2 hours of top notch entertainment. i would say it is much better then classics of gangster genre boomers love to bolster about. great characters, great performances, tight gripping script, nice camera. what more do you want?", "Noble scrupulous criminals, brutality as entertainment, again, meh.....": "Not that it was ever quality film making but in 2020 the stylish criminal committing acts of brutality with a knowing wink for our entertainment, has gotten old and uncool.

They make irreparable mistakes, turning their situation into a critical one. In the end, the gentlemen cut off their oxygen, but there is no strategic, interesting solution in this. The antiheroes sowed their own shoals. The gentlemen have only a simple way to resolve the situation.Also stamps and plagiarism. It's really annoying when the film is full of stamps. A lot of scenes and dialogues resemble typical Hollywood designs. Humor is very weak. Well, the scene with the pig, which is stolen from the \"Black Mirror\", is generally too much.

He's trying to sell his business to Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong). Dry Eye (Henry Golding) is a ruthless ambitious drug dealer. Coach (Colin Farrell) is a youth boxing coach.This Guy Ritchie film is chock full of the Ritchie style. Every character has the brash Ritchie gangster style. Something is missing which made it a start and stop watch for me. I come to realize that I don't care about any of the characters. It starts with the structure which is unreliable narrator Fletcher telling the story to Raymond (who should already know most of it anyways). Hunnam is playing an unemotional henchman. Otherwise, he should be the perfect rooting interest. There is no reason for Fletcher to recount the whole story other than a movie reason. Raymond already knows most of the story making the film a waiting game for his character. It saps the tension out of the twists and turns. I do wonder if it would be more compelling to play it straight. This is very much a straight up Ritchie film and his fans will root for it.

Cool movie!\". No different for The Gentlemen.Cast, chemistry, action, a flare of whodunnit, background score everything falls into place like magnet and metal.The rating is 9 because I'm waiting for the sequel now.", "The Guy Ritchie Crime Caper Had its Time.": "Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), an American expatriate, tries to sell off his highly profitable marijuana empire in London to American billionaire Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong). Things are complicated by Dry Eye (Henry Golding), a Chinese underboss who wants to take the weed business for himself and Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a private investigator who claims to have dirt on Pearson. The rivalry triggers plots, schemes, bribery, and blackmail from all sides in an attempt to steal Pearson's domain out from under him.After the release of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in the mid-nineties spawned a wave of crime comedies featuring an ensemble cast, snappy dialogue, and non-linear plot structure, such as Two Days In The Valley, The Boondock Saints, and Killing Zoe. Guy Ritchie was the most successful filmmaker to rise out of that wave with his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and quickly followed by its higher budgeted counterpart Snatch.In film school, Lock Stock was on everybody's top ten list and it was hip. The non-linear storytelling broke the mold and the witty dialogue (although realistically no gangster would ever speak in such a manner) felt fresh and entertaining onscreen. The comedy of errors between the bumbling gangsters and how they inadvertently ruin each other's plans was laugh-out-loud funny.Trying to engage with Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen was a flitting experience. The story keeps moving sideways instead of forward; it zigzags between its numerous gangsters who will spiel and pontificate about the gangster life and explaining the philosophy behind what they're doing as they're about to do it. One can't help to imagine whether if these gangsters would get more things done if they'd just pull the trigger instead of monologuing.Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Collin Farrell, and Henry Golding all deliver fine performances, trying very hard to add dimension their thin characters and make the stylized dialogue feel believable. The endless switching between characters undermines all the performances. It's hard to tell who you should be rooting for and at times, as if I was going crosseyed, all the characters blend into being the same Guy Ritchie gangster.The unreliable narration device, in the form of a conversation between Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam, is meant to add humor and suspense but ends up completely sucking the life out of the entire story because the story is completely told to the audience by two people in a living room. There's no narrative purpose to the unreliable narration because it is not developing the character or presenting their mindset like for Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey or Edward Norton in Fight Club. It just presents an event on what the two narrators are speculating happened and then the film reveals what really happened in a \"just kidding\" type way. A fan edit would drastically improve the narrative just by removing all the unnecessary elements to its portentous structure.Guy Ritchie even goes to add an unnecessary meta-layer to the story. Hugh Grant's private investigator presents the dirt on Matthew McConaughey's gangster as a written screenplay, which allows for his blackmail to sound like a film pitch. This opens up conversations about film stock and editing, which makes the film even more pompous. There's also a The Man From U.N.C.L.E poster hanging in one of the gangster's offices.In the end, The Gentlemen ends up coming off as smug and obnoxious like it knows it is genius and ahead of its audience. The thing is, I have seen this movie before (4 times in fact) so it didn't outsmart me nor was it particularly funny. I sat through it wondering when things will finally take off but the plot never goes anywhere. The story played like Guy Ritchie was playing mad-libs with his usual crime comedy template.Contrary to most of the writers-directors' careers, Guy Ritchie is one of the rare examples of a director who fares better doing higher-budget franchise properties. His reinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as a bickering couple in steampunk London was fresh. Little stylistic touches like his use of slow-motion to show Sherlock Holmes's thinking up a plan right before doing it in real-time were creative. His penchant for high-energy frenetic cinematography enlivened the dance sequences in Aladdin.Possibly with the box office disappointment with King Arthur, perhaps Guy Ritchie felt like he needed to revisit his grassroots by making The Gentlemen.All in all, the Guy Ritchie crime comedy is finished. The well has been dry a decade ago with Rocknrolla. Ritchie should have stopped at its peak as he has said everything he had to say with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. I'd recommend people rewatch them instead.Facebook.com/OCinemaD/", "Affected Accents Are Almost Always Annoying And Asinine": "Why does everyone speak with a funny voice in this? The worst accent goes to Matthew McConaughey who I assume was going for Little Lord Fauntleroy or Oliver Twist in a grade school drama production. His wife, the cockney mob moll, was way too much of a clich\u00e9. I blame the director for all of these annoyances because it's his film.He was going for stylish and campy, but it was cartoonish and unconvincing. His use of timeline irregularities was also annoying; the whole unreliable narration thing has been over-done to death.I was never convinced of the protagonist was capable of ruling over a pot empire, and how he built it wasn't realistic in the least. If you think about his grand plan for even a second, it makes zero sense.There sure was a lot of blood, blood everywhere. He must have bought fake blood in fifty gallon drums.Not the director's best.", "Worth watching it...": "\"The Gentlemen\" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch a man who is the lord of a marijuana empire in London and trying to sell his empire, getting involve in bribery and blackmail. He has to overcome many obstacles and difficulties in order to retire and relax.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot combined with some great interpretations made by its cast. The direction which was made by Guy Ritchie was for one more time magnificent and remind me the movie \"Snitch\" and \"RocknRolla\". The interpretations of both Charlie Hunnam who played as Ray and Hugh Grant who played as Fletcher were simply outstanding. Some other interpretations which have to be mentioned were Matthew McConaughey's who played as Michael Pearson, Colin Farrell who played as Coach and Jeremy Strong's who played as Matthew, and they all did a great job. I highly recommedn everyone to watch this movie because even if you are not a fan of Guy Ritchie's movies I am sure that you will enjoy it due to the fact that it has a very interesting plot consisted of some plot twists that you won't and some very good interpretations. Finally, if you are a fan of Guy Ritchie's movies then I don't have anything more to say except to watch it and afterwards I am sure that you will consider it as one more of his masterpieces.", "Guy Ritchie is done.": "What I hate the most in life, is paying for something I hated...my hard earned money for your poor attempt to slap together what you think is a motion picture, Guy! You could sit at a boulevard and beg for change and it would have been more dignified than to ask for $14 for this piece of work. Next time I'm using torrent to Dl your movie.", "The usual Ritchie in terms of both strong and weak aspects": "\"The Gentlemen\" is the newest movie by director Guy Ritchie, who is also one of the three writers here and is nowadays still not only known for his movies, but also for the fact that he was once married to Madonna. This film runs for approximately 110 minutes and looking at it in detail, I would say that his approach and the outcome in terms of style and pretty much everything else is the same like it was 20 years ago for him. It's very frequently style over substance. The fact how over the top the story may be is not too important if there are constantly cool quotes, spectacular characters and outrageous events happening. The best example is the kid falling out of the window. Or that there are rails where the Asian guy falls down and that this very second also a train arrives. Or his name of course and the many jokes about this are also a prime example. But it also results in a lot of fun. I just mentioned Aslan falling out of the window already. Now that entire scene was hilarious with Hunnam's character and the kids there and the two strong folks too of course. And also after he falls out of the window when we see Hunnam run after the boys (or one of them), then have a conflict with them, then pull his gun. And so on. Also how one of the two brutes deals with the situation and we see it just like Hunnam's character does. All accompanied by some of the smartest and most hilarious dialogues out there.I think Hunnam was my favorite from the cast here. And that means something because it is a really good cast. He is growing more and more on me. I still wonder if his character is actually a cannibal, if he is eating what he seems to be eating near the end? And if yes, then if he knew what he was eating? Namely a juicy piece of prey meat handed to him from the boss lion to his most precious aide? Anyway, my praise for Hunnam means even more because folks like Grant, Marsan and McConaughey are actors I also like a lot. Not to mention that Farrell, Dockery and a few other experienced and highly successful actors are on board here. I somehow feel that with this cast at his disposal, Ritchie could have come up with something better. But it is really all almost pointless fun from beginning to end. Of course there are also sexual references, but the most \"worrying\" is the great deal of violence here. Also not just that it happens, but how it happens. It is sometimes pretty extreme. Take the meat references towards the end. Or how it starts right away as we see McConaughey's character at a restaurant just having a tea or coffee or so and then somebody comes and shoots him in the head. Well, at least it seemed that way. Reality is different as we find out later on. But it could have happened like this because all we see afterwards for over 60 minutes after this little opening takes place before said opening. Other than that, it's a fairly chronological movie.McConaughey seems like the protagonist early on, the lion as he calls himself, but the longer the film goes, the more it turns into an ensemble performance really and there are long sequences that do not feature him at all, even if at the very end, he is back again as strong as possible and he almost looks like a lion there, too strong maybe even because at some point, it just felt like a film that tried his best to show us the most hopeless situations for McConaughey's character and how he always manages to get out of them. Often through mere luck. It is just really absurd. Hunnam's character arriving on time at the restaurant was still alright, but how the boxer kids open fire and kill the two Russian gangsters in the front seats was just too ridiculous honestly. Or also how Farrell's character kills those at Hunnam's character's house. I must say I struggled a bit with Farrell's role in general, already his very first scene when he shows these boys how he is physically and intellectually superior there. Prime example of the aforementioned style over substance. Oh well. Then again I am not a big fan anymore as I was years ago when it comes to Farrell.The one actor I like more is Hugh Grant (he has steadily risen in my perception and was Oscar-worthy in \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" not too long ago), so I was a bit disappointed that he is basically only used for the framework here and a bit of a blackmail story because honestly I could have done without this part completely. He is not needed to tell the story, even if he has his fun moments too like how he comes from the bathroom when the two gangsters arrive with Aslan's corpse. But as a whole, he could have added a lot more if his character had been written more convincingly. At the end, how he ends up in that box and still has this revelation to share about Aslan's dad and the consequences coming with it and how it all happens at the same time is also really exaggerared. I did not like it too much. At the end, he seems free, but nope not yet, he is again in Hunnam's character' car. When Grant's character gives the script to Miramax (also the actual producer here of course), he implies there could be a sequel to his ideas, which certainly can be understood in a way that this film here could also get a sequel. Also fairly fun how people in his story at the end end up in cars under dangerous circumstances while also he ends up in a car in a situation he desperately wants to get out of. Will he live or die? We also will see in a sequel perhaps. I think this one here was good enough for me to check out a sequel if they ever make one. I hope they use another awesome song for the opening credits there just like they did here (\"Cumberland Gap\"). Had to download immediately when I was home. I hope such a sequel features Hunnam's character prominently then, maybe even more at the center of the story than he was here.Okay, what else can I say about this film. I was really tired at the beginning, so maybe this is why I felt that it needed a while to become a good film. Or I don't know, maybe it never turned into a good film, but just a funny, fairly creative one. The core story is really easy to criticize with how absurd it turns out at times (also the complete absence of police) and I am not one bit surprised that critics apparently did not like the film too much from what I have read. I probably could write another two paragraphs, most likely more, only filled with cool quotes here, but I won't. Instead I say: Go watch the film yourself and I am positive you will smile or even laugh a lot. Also about the absurd comedy. Even when there is talk about a guy being locked in a gigantic freezer, it is somewhat funny. Enough said. Tarantino will perhaps like it too. Let's just hope the guy in the freezer will not have a similar fate like Aslan('s corpse). Oh well, then again I did not like him too much either, the guy in the freezer I mean, the Jew with his crabs that is, perhaps also because of his introduction early on. Later on, he was slightly more interesting, but there it was also basically McConaughey just doing all the work in the scene with him. Oh and Eddie Marsan yes, I have to mention him because I really adore the actor. Now his scene with the pigs and the implications what happened (luckily they spare us the visual side) were just so wrong and yet hilarious. Nice to see Marsan getting to work with some really big stars here. In that scene, or the aftermath, even Farrell's comments were truly hilarious about how they could never unsee what happened there. They should have named the pig Napol\u00e9on though, no idea how they forgot about this reference.Okay, this is all then I suppose. I give the movie a thumbs-up for sure and recommend checking it out. Could have been 10-15 minutes shorter though if they had left out some of the weaker parts or the entire frame story (and given Grant a better role). Even there, when they try to be smart, like with the wire in the shoes, it is never \"Knives Out\" level. Still, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, especially if you like most of the actors as much as I do. What I do have to say though is that in terms of character writing, Ritchie still has to win me over that he can also come up with high-quality female characters. Sure, it is difficult in a world of organized crime, but Dockery definitely is not it here. The young girl at the apartment that they are supposed to bring home is even more interesting although she has like 10% of Dockery's screen time. At least in terms of items Dockery delivers. That tiny golden gun is really cool and also the references to it being just a paperweight. Okay, now that is really all. I think you could say that \"cool\" is the perfect word to describe the movie, even if it certainly is also a bit on the shallow side.", "My Take on The Gentlemen - Hussain-AL-Naseer": "Director Guy Ritchie has his unique way of story telling which makes his films different from others whether its Sherlock Holmes series or The Man from U.N.C.L.E the guy has some skills to make his films standout from others with same genre Crime Drama or Mystery and The Gentleman is no exception.

The characters have no other personality other than the one-dimensional characteristic of \"I'm better than you.\" They are the typical cigar-and-gun-lovers trope. They swear without purpose; they just want to be seen as intimidating without proving much of any point. Don't get me wrong, I love a good classy/gentleman character if done well, just like in the Bond movies for example, but this is NOT it. The characters walk and act like cheap imitations of so-called classy gentlemen but without any complex emotions or truly deep backstories.And because these characters were so cliche and one-dimensional, the story was ruined. Usually, a good story line is propelled due to some intense moral dilemma or some higher purpose, but no. There was none of that, the plot was secondary; the whole purpose of the film was just to show how \"cool\" the characters are.I watched this movie in theatres and it was literally the first film I had to walk out of. I made it maybe 3/4 through the movie and it felt like there was no cathartic reveal or fight or anything, just pure power play. I doubt that the end of the movie would've made me feel any better.

Something happens at the beginning (the first minute) and it's all told in sort of a flashback by Hugh Grant.Everyone is clearly having fun, Matthew McConaghey is as charming as ever, and this is the best I have ever seen Charlie Hunnam in a movie and Colin Farrell is just great and someone you'd want on your side when things are going bad. Hugh Grant's accent was not as annoying as the trailer (thank God) and he is clearly having fun camping it up, whilst Henry Golding does his best to keep up.It has a great energy and the dialogue is wonderful (it got some huge laughs). It goes a bit all over in its narrative, but I'll be watching this again, sometime soon.", "Fun times are here again": "Remember when movies used to be fun? Remember movies like Snatch, Lock Stock, Boondock Saints, Lucky Number Slevin? This isn't a homage to those movies, it's its own thing, but it feels just as fun. This movie will keep you guessing from start to finish. Well written, well shot, well acted. Instant classic.", "This is probably the best film I've seen so far this year.": "Once upon a time this would have been called 'post-modern'; now it's just smarter than the smartest kid on the block and really terrific fun. It's a Guy Ritchie picture set in the heart of Guy Ritchie territory and it's like an amalgam of all the best Guy Ritchie pictures strung together. It starts with a killing...or does it and if so, who's been killed, before leaping forward to what's basically a pitch for the film we're watching being made by a very dodgy private investigator, (a never better Hugh Grant), to a well-heeled gangster, (Charlie Hunnam).Part of the fun is the way Ritchie subverts our expectations, not just in the torturous way he tells his tale, but in the casting. I mean, who would have imagined 'Downton Abbey's' Lady Mary, (a superb Michelle Dockery), playing a foul-mouthed Cockney moll or indeed Grant's terrific turn as a blackmailing scumbag. The rest of the cast can be taken as read; for the Ameriican market, Matthew McConaughey as Mr Big, Colin Farrell, (brilliant as 'The Coach'). Eddie Marsan as a sleazy newspaper magnate, 'Succession's Jeremy Strong as one of McConaughey's rivals and Henry Golding, getting better with every picture, as a small-time Asian gangster with big ideas.They are all wonderful, spouting some of the best dialogue of any Guy Ritchie film but then perhaps they had to be since the plot isn't that easy to follow, (everybody seems to be double-crossing everyone else), making this the only Guy Ritchie movie you will almost certainly need to see twice. I loved every fantastic, foul-mouthed minute.", "the gentlemen": "Guy Ritchie returned to the early style: multiple clues, multiple characters, excellent rhythm control, various black humor and satire, addictive violence scenes, and play with the plot and audience. In addition, Charlie Hannum played a particularly pleasing role, which is really flattering. Several male actors are particularly handsome, and their visibility is still very high.", "A return to form and a league of dishonorable bastards": "A uniformly excellent cast, razor-sharp dialogue and all sorts of scheming gangsters coming out of the woodwork; The Gentlemen is Guy Ritchie's triumphant return to the genre. This is a movie that keeps your focus by force; the story just sort of attacks you. And I was onboard for every twist, gunshot and poetic use of profanity. I have no doubt I'll be seeing this again, these characters and the tone are so distinctive. It's just such a brazen and stimulating script.Give this a shot, you will not regret it.", "Don't Miss It!": "Like all Guy Ritchie movies \"The Gentlemen\" is well written, well directed, well cast and well acted.It is an intriguing, winding, but riveting story that doesn't lose the viewer at any point, and, endorsing my opening sentence, every character is almost born for their role.Another Guy Ritchie bullseye!Enjoy.", "The Not-So-Gentlemen": "This movie is crazy. Guy Ritchie back to his signature, multi-faceted crime dramedy ways. This is important because of his style doesn't work for you I could easily see this being a rough watch.To me, this was a blast. Everyone in this is spectacular. There's not a single bad performance to be found really. There are a few that go above and beyond but everyone is solid. The movie is funny, clever, violent and terribly entertaining.Still, it's not without imperfections. There'sa few instances where we could have really benefited from subtitles. It also has a few cheats and conveniences in the plot. Oh, and it's pretty darn racist at times too. There's also a moment that's so meta it popped me out of the movie pretty heavily.Negatives aside, this was still a fun experience. It was a fun ride from start to finish and absolutely worth giving a shot. Can't wait to watch this one again and see if there was anything I missed.", "Really enjoyable!": "A really interesting and engaging storyline. Initially I wasn't sure about the format of the story telling. But it worked out really well. I like that it's a British movie as I feel there aren't so many movies like that.I would say it was slow at parts... but that was a good thing in terms of building suspense.Hopefully there's a sequel.. really looking forward to that!", "A Solid Crime Thriller": "Just came back from seeing this tonight & must say it was pretty damn good!The film follows a wealthy man who wants to sell off his marijuana business but the rival gangs & mobsters are trying to steal/sabotage the business & of course kill off the man himself. The film starts off with Fletcher who tells the story like that of a screen play pitch, but this film has more layers than an Onion as more & more revelations to the story start to unfold.I found the film to be pretty entertaining & enticing. The film features the typical gangster elements seen in other films of its type, mixed in with some humourous & dark moments too. The dialogue & witty banter heard in the film was good. The story telling kept you locked in from start to finish.While the film is solid, there is a lot of details & plots points going on so prepare yourself when watching as it has many layers to the overall synopsis.Overall a solid crime thriller. 8/10", "Brilliant": "This one is brilliant and any one who says otherwise needs to stop reviewing movies. Direction casting acting editing is spot on. Movie moves at a fast pace. The under belly of a system exposed with wit and finesse. The American audience might find it difficult to understand these characters but thats the beauty of it. You are told a story by a British lens. Its a British 'Get Shorty'.", "Guy Richie returns to his forte.": "\"The Gentlemen\" sees writer/director Guy Richie returning to what he does best in spectacular fashion with yet another truly admirable crime flick. The directing, acting and dialogue is great, the characters are a blast to watch and the writing is simply phenomenal. Of course, as is to be expected from a crime flick written and directed by Guy Richie, it will prove to be a tad bit too complicated to follow and overstuffed with characters for some, but those who are willing to give the movie their undivided attention will find it to be a truly well written and cleverly thought out film that will have them going crazy at every single twist and turn it takes.", "Hollywood Should Take Some Notes from Ritchie": "If you know Guy Ritchie's movies, you'd know he has his own style. From the cinematography, to the dialogue this hits the mark. Ritchie's story revolving around Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant going over the story so far. What happens is the great hallmark of Ritchie and his epic style of fun, mixed with dose of action and plenty of witty and natural dialogue.\nRitchie continues pace from start to finish and the depth of the characters were on cue. Not only Matthew McConaughey, but Colin Farrell and many others add to story in their unique and impact ways that one could easily believe and relate to. This was a perfect movie in a time where Hollywood has missed the mark over and over, this was extremely fun and the kind of movie the audience needed.", "Film of the year already?": "After watching highly rated films with high quality casts bore the pants off me last year I was wondering what Guy could conjure up and well it was Guy Ritchie at his best with Matthew Mcconnaughey leading the cast Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell putting in stand out performances and the film chugged along with excellent witty dialogue Loved it \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a5", "A Gentleman Comes Calling In Quality": "Have you ever wondered what the dry atmosphere of Downton Abbey would be like if presented in the form of a mafia movie? Yeah me neither, but it is the thought that came to mind when I was watching this film today. A trailer that was sort of lost on me, today's work directed by Guy Ritchie had me a little undecided how this film would go. Potentially a stuffy, slow, hard edged movie with lots of cursing and torture, I could only imagine what I would get, especially when another fan left in a rant 20 minutes into the film. What was the end result? Robbie K here to give you some insight as he checks out:Movie: The Gentleman (2020)Director:\nGuy Ritchie\nWriters:\nGuy Ritchie (screenplay by), Guy Ritchie (story by)\nStars:\nMatthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle DockeryLIKES:The Humor\nThe Character Usage\nThe Mystery/Politics\nThe Connections\nThe Presentation\nThe Censorship of violence, for the most part\nThe ActingDISLIKES:The Excessive Cursing For Me\nMissing Some Action\nThe Extended Ending\nSome Stereotypical Annoyances\nThe Rapping Video\nSlow At Parts\nSUMMARYWhen it comes to the British writing style, this reviewer always looks to the potential for balanced writing. Sure enough, this is one of the times where the writing is truly representative of a master writer in multiple facets. This tale contains some amazing humor to it, not so much in the form of slapstick, one liner filled form, but a much deeper levels that uses timing, setting, and wit to maximize the laughs. It's dry I'll admit, but the humor goes so well with the plot at hand that it adds rather than distracts from the enriching plot that this film contains. With this supporting component, the movie continues to get better in the way it balances so many things to make an engaging mafia tale. First the character usage, the movie is filled with a lot of stars and they are utilized very well, with so many (including secondary characters) having a purpose and contribute to the film in a way or manner to make their inclusion worthy. While it seems spotty at first the movie's progression begins to start connecting all the players in the game, starting to unravel and help give pieces of the story without ever giving away the big mystery. It's this balance of connections with the mystery that for me was the biggest engaging piece to the movie, that teasing to see how deep the politics run always being that itch you can't scratch. Yet, for a movie about crime lords, you know politics is going to make an appearance and once more they impressed me with the presentation. Again choppy, The Gentleman appealed to me because the politics had heat, tension, but were not so drawn out and convoluted to be boring, something not easily accomplished in this day and age for a movie. Yet if that's not interesting enough, the movie also manages to sneak in a more unique presentation, told through the imagination and sleuth of Hugh Grant's character, who is filling the pieces with his evidence and theories to help piece the story together. The genius for me is, the holes he has acts as the missing pieces for you to try and string together the ideas yourself before the big reveal. You might also be concerned for violence, after all, the crime lords with this much power do not show the nicest attitudes to those that threaten them. Fortunately, the movie manages to censor most of the extreme violence and torture that these movies can be famous for, and this little extra class did not take from the movie, but only added. Finally, all of this is fantastically acted, with each major character executing their role in so many levels I could take another page to describe. Let's just say McConaughey has found a new favorite role for me, finally ditching the super sleazy for a role that is much more complete to show off his talents. Hunnam as well was indeed a fantastic pillar character, filled with a level of emotional complexity that seems to be so monotone, but yet contains layers that unravel. I did not find too many overacted moments and was very thrilled with seeing so many stars shine.Yet, there are still some styles of this movie that did not quite hit me as hard as the others, at least in terms of liking it. First of all the cursing. Old record, I know, and given my own mouth sometimes it's becoming less, but there are a few words used freely in this movie that were a bit excessive. Part of the culture, great, but like in Django overuse of the word soon starts to become lazy and stale for this writer. While I enjoyed much of the toned-down storytelling, I'm always partial to a bit more excitement to help spice up the mob war films. A shoot out here or there could go a long way but the satire and humor in this film sort of dilutes the action that starts forming, before dropping back into the mincing tactics. Anyway, looking at the character profiling, the film is both genius and frustrating for me in its generational portrayal, with the contenders for the crown. At the same time the stereotypical summaries of each generation are little overdramatic and extreme, leading to sort of annoying moments that weren't the worst, but felt a little out of place (this is especially true for Henry Goulding's character). I'll admit there are also some bloated moments in the film, but these are few and far between and as stated, a little swap out with some action could have helped with these moments, again few and far between. Finally, the part that really stuck out for me was the rapping. Kudos for the art behind it, the impressive speed at which they rap, and the dance stunts in the back, but that's about all I'm going to say in terms of appropriate. When the video first appears it sort of does not make sense, but thankfully the writing uses it as a good plot device to help make up for how forced and advertising it seems. Like I said earlier, it's a generational stereotype that was a bit annoying to watching and were probably the most annoying characters of the bunch, despite having some of the coolest moves. Again, thank goodness for the writing making up for them. Sadly, the other thing that was both funny, yet again excessive is the ending, a few fake out and extension that almost feel like last minute tag-ons that may or may not have been needed.The VERDICT:To be honest, I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie and how much the trailers did not ruin the experience for me. British settings, humor, and styles of writing continue to prove successful in balancing a lot of balls and I'm super impressed with how much correlated together in this piece. The drama, the mystery, the presentation, and the politics are all super well represented in this gang war, never getting so caught up in details to be boring, but not slighted to feel robbed of good development. That unique presentation we talked about only further adds some fun edges to it, and works with the gaps to help keep you engrossed. Finally, the actors really bring the characters to life and worthy of several awards with how well they bring these strange characters to some cool levels. Yes, the writing is still a little overdone at times, there are some annoying moments/stereotypes to consider, and a few slow parts that could have been ironed out. However, the balance of this movie and just fun, classy writing really make this one a worthy trip to watch in theater for performances, and a definite check in at home when you get the chance.My scores are:Action/Crime: 8.0 (not as much action)\nMovie Overall: 7.5 - 8.0", "Welcome back Ritchie.": "After such a long period of repeated missfires and last year's disastrous Aladdin remake, Guy Ritchie has divorced himself from the mouse and has come back in full swing with The Gentlemen, a film harking back to his two previous cult classic gangster films \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\". And it's just what you would want if you loved those movies. The acting is pretty good all around and the pacing is as quick as you'd expect, but what really makes this movie is the writing itself. Just like with Snatch and Lock Stock, the dialogue is clever, witty and has a lot more meaning behind it than you may realise, which is another thing I love about Ritchie's films: They actually require you to PAY ATTENTION. So many people just switch a film on and don't think about anything that's happening. Ritchie basically bends those people over and forces them to think about what is happening and what is being said. This is why you find a lot of people who say they found Snatch to be confusing due to all of the plotlines happening at the same time as well as them not paying attention to what is actually being said. Which is a shame because the dialogue in Ritchie's films is insanely funny and brimming with wit. Snatch is probably better in terms of dialogue simply because I can quote every line in the film at this point, but The Gentlemen has a lot of great lines for sure. It isn't all humour of course, but I thought I'd just go over what makes Ritchie's films so good when compared to other things released nowadays.Overall I would HIGHLY recommend The Gentlemen for people who loved Ritchie's previous gangster films as well as those who haven't watched anything he's made before and want a good place to start. It may be hard to get used to, especially with how vulgar it is compared to the rest of the politically correct garbage being dumped out of Hollywood these days, but it's certainly worth paying to see.", "Go See It.": "As a regular movie goer, I'll jump to the point and say this: definitely go see The Gentleman. Guy Ritchie nails it with this one. I was roped in, hook, line and sinker from the start and that's what it needed to do. All 113 minutes keeping you attentively sucked into the little twists and turns.Usually it doesn't take much to annoy me when it comes to narration, but this is a story - and a story told well. It's clever, it keeps pace, it doesn't stop. And it was more than I expected. Where it succeeds is holding you captive to the wonderment of anticipating every characters' next move on the plot chessboard that unfolds before you.The acting is great; I can't fault anyone in performance or their placement in their roles. Putting this film together...and I am just stubbornly refusing to give it the perfect 10 in my assessment as a 9... but it's just shy of being a modern theatrical masterpiece.If you get bored,, somehow lose it along the way... blame me. But I don't think you'll have regrets giving 113 minutes of your time away for this one.", "'Brilliance should be acknowledged.' - Matthew": "Guy Ritchie is back to his best dealing with subjects he is a master of, East London and gangs. This film is full of action, gratuitous violence and comedy. It hits the mark in all that it does.Matthew McConaughey is Pearson, the main man is the local drug business who is looking to move on and retire from the life. His future purchasers are trying to get better deals for themselves and he is having issues with the respectable drug addled daughter of some rich friends. His right-hand man, Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) is there to sort out problems and find solutions. His wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) has her own business and her own problems. Coach (Colin Farrell) trains the local youths and tries to keep them on the straight and narrow and when he can't he sorts out their screw ups and Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a PI hired to do a job and rather enjoying himself doing it.As you would expect with any great Guy Ritchie film, there are twists and turns galore and plenty of laughs along the way. Charlie Hunnam is superb, in fact Sons of Anarchy is the only thing I've seen him better in. He carries a threat about him with a sense of enjoyment in what he does. Colin Farrell, who I have no strong feelings about either way, is fantastic as Coach who is very very dangerous but only when he has to be and is more concerned about his students.This is one of the better films I've seen recently and I will happily put this up there with Lock Stock and hope it is remembered with the same fondness by everyone. Though be warned there is more than a few casual C Bombs dropped! Well done Mr Ritchie, well done! An 18/20 for this action/comedy romp!Forgot to say Hugh Grant has immense fun in his role as Fletcher and it is great to see him do something different. Brilliant!", "Lad flick": "It was fair. I went with the husband and expected to be bored and I wasn't. It's not really my type of film but it was entertaining and it was well acted, I especially loved Colin Farrells performance he was great. Wasnt as gruesome as I expected and the storyline was fair. My husband would give it a ten but he hasn't got an IMBD account however I have lol....", "Fun, Fun, Fun Movie as Only Guy Richie Can Do": "If you liked his previous crime movies, you will not be disappointed. A bit of a surprise to see the actress from Downton Abby in this one. Performed well. Matt is fine but I wonder if maybe a different actor might have been a bit more edgier, like Brad Pitt. That would have been wildly crazy if that happened. Go enjoy!", "Wicked writing": "Weaving story like a posh three piece suit, Guy Richie's stitches are fast, funny, & fashionable. The film's look, the quick pace of the dialog, and the choice of music are pure Ritchie. The Gentlemen is a wicked fun romp with a gaggle of well-dressed baddies.", "The Gentleman is one of Guy Ritchie 's best films": "The Gentleman is one of Guy Ritchie 's best films. A return to the roots of his creativity, again there is freedom in his creativity. One of the best films to watch in 2020. And again a few parallel developing stories with a common end. Excellent cast. The only thing disappointing was the ending. Well, you can 't just break the story, how can you kill a couple of sixes to get rid of the persecution of the Russian mafia? I really hope it 's just for a sequel.", "Awful, couldn't watch....": "How's this garbage rated 8 out of 10???? I'd rather watch ads than this trash.", "I'm sorry Mr. Ritchie": "I have no idea, why so many people rated this movie so highly. Maybe it is ok in terms of cinematography and acting, but the story and writing is just bad. First of all there is no protagonist. There no interesting characters in this. Is Matthew McConaughey a protagonist? - No! He is doing almoust nothing through the whole film. He had a cool disposition abot his rise to power though, i would love to watch that movie instead. There is no depth to this character, except a couple of cool speaches. Is Charlie Hunnam, who's basicaly a McConaughey's butler a protagonist? - No! He's main characterestic his unexplained loyalty. Basicaly the two characters are some sort of snobish gangsters look a likes, spending time in some pretensious bar. Martial guys disposition was cool, could also be a good movie. And the biggest flaw is that the whole premise is not believable. Good thing about previous Guy Ritchie movies was the chaos. Characters are being drawn into a mayhem of events. Stupidity and chance make movies funny and give them that sense of reality, because reality is also unpredictable. Gentlemen is all about plans, and characters magicaly forseeing each other actions, so the film fieels like a scenario, it fails in creating an illusion of reality. So it is just a generic gangster movie.", "Guy Ritchie does it again": "This movie is everything you expect and want from a Guy Ritchie film. It's funny, well-paced, full of great actors, and executed perfectly. His detour to do Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur, and Aladdin was fine. But his style and sense of humor really shine in good ole English gangster films. This one does not disappoint.", "Guy Ritchie returns to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood.": "After the critically panned Alladin, Guy Ritchie returns to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood in a refreshing yet entertaining story. It's a complicated tale about a turf war in the maijuana business - where everyone knows it will soon get legalised - therefore the end is near. One of the best acting ensembles in a movie recently with Mathew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant (in a never-seen-before performance which is far removed from his romantic comedy roles). I thought his voice was dubbed; it isn't. Michelle Dockery is sensational in her small role. If you've seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch then you know what to expect. But instead of fast edits, narrative overlays in slow motion, etc, here you'll find static camera, actors on their marks, quick cuts and fast speaking performances. Not in the same league as Lock, Stock....and Snatch, yet it's an enjoyable 2 hour British crime caper that doesn't take itself too seriously.\nN.B. There were 5 people in the theatre when I went to see the movie.", "The kind of movie so rare I almost forgot still exists": "It's the acting and the actors, I licked my fingers it's that delicious. Directing is well done, the plot is last, it really doesn't matter that much as long as Guy Ritchie is holding the wheels, it's what he does best directing his unique films.\nIf you like Guy Ritchie's movies, this is it, with a little help from Matthew McConaughey who takes the leading role, and some of the best British actors around.\nGo see it, pure fun.", "\u00f0\u0178\u0152\u02c6 AN ENGLISH GANGSTA MARIJUANA BREAKING BAD \u00f0\u0178\u0152\u02c6": "Just when I thought I hadn't seen a good gangster, drug movie, my eyes were opened to a really good double cross, triple cross English gangsta drug movie that was very good. Matthew McConaughey, Tom Hardy, and Hugh Grant Brought the correct amount of star power to their roles. It wasn't as good as Scarface, but it was an enjoyable movie that had some moments of comedy wrapped up in a good old fashion drug gangsta movie.", "Painfull to watch": "Bad acting and probably wrong choose of actor, our two main alpha male handle the cigares like it was ... well ...something else. Add the immense planting of weed that use as much electricity as a city and that somehow goes undetected by the police. And our fancy main character have several of them in England because one is not improbable enough. And you just met the first multi-millionaire in england that made his millions selling 12 pounds on the street...", "THE SAME OLD SONG DRESSED NOT SO DIFFERENTLY...!": "Guy Ritchie's (Snatch/Revolver) latest is a return to his 'lad' films after his brief foray into Disneyland (his Aladdin live action remake from last year) & it's more of the same then something that's radically different. Always, I felt, being a traveler in the world of warmed over Tarantino, Ritchie always had a muscular presence behind the camera (he can put together a vibrant soundtrack like Q as well) but his overwritten monologues for his working class thugs has always struck me as great audition pieces for actors (which this film boasts a ton of like Matthew McConaughey, Henry Golding, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam & Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery) but as plots go, Ritchie has done this before maybe better but definitely the same & this tale of a battle for a weed farmer's territory & the ensuing crosses & double crosses which follow starts to wear on the viewer's nerves than tickle their cinematic funny bones.", "My fitbit thought I fell asleep. Unfortunately, I didn't.": "I don't understand how this film has such high reviews. The narrative structure killed any possible suspense. The story was not great to say the least. It had potential but it seemed to be trying to pull off too many tropes at once and it all fell flat. It was decently original but that does not mean it was worth the watch.I am not a highly critical spectator and can almost always find merit to the most mediocre films but man, this film.... yikes.", "Silly Brit film about an American or two": "Whoever told the writer that a gangster flick narrated by Hugh Grant to Charley Hunnam could be a winner just lied to him. This was the silliest waste of time made to date. I hated it.", "A surprisingly fun and engaging Guy Ritchie film!": "I hadn't planned to see this until it came to streaming, but since I had no power yesterday morning and afternoon for mains work and it was a holiday, we decided to catch this in the cinema after all. I'm glad we did, because I really (and rather unexpectedly) liked it a lot. It was much more entertaining than I thought Guy Ritchie capable of (or that he showed in \"King Arthur\"). The storytelling was sharp and twisty and fun, and it was well cast all around, with an excellent Hugh Grant camping it up and the always gorgeous Colin Farrell as charming as ever and sporting some natty plaids. Definitely recommend it!", "Glad to see he's back": "To me Ritchie's films have been inching downward since Lock Stock. This one isn't as innovative of course but tells its story well and helps one forget King Arthur. I loved the casting, particularly Henry Golding and Hugh Grant. Golding's charismatic villain almost steals the show.\nMy only complaint might be Lord George could have been fleshed out a little better. Lock Stock and Snatch had multiple antagonists and this seemed like a missed opportunity. Seeing behind the villain's door adds depth to the story.", "Really wanted to like this movie": "But I tried to watch it three times and I get no further then 15 min to 20 min top.\nI am sure the great cast is not to blame. I am just bored out of my skull. I just really don't like it. But for the actors sake whom I all love I give it a six.", "Refreshing and real": "An actual film in the mainstream. Reaaaally nice compared to the superhero drivel that hollywood is pumping out lately. You can tell someone with respect for the viewers made this film and not to make money off toys and merchandise at the sacrifice of a real story with consistent characters. A good start to bringing hollywood standards back up. Same with anything Jordan Peele makes.", "A funny movie filled with a bit of action and plot twists": "I'm very glad that I watched \"The Gentlemen\", Guy Ritchie returns to another incredible movie.The first 40 minutes of the movie were so freakin boring and I was lost, felt like there was confusion or chaos in the story, I couldn't understand anything and there was NOTHING AT ALL that grabbed my attention, but after that, the movie starts to have some events that grabbed my attention this time and they made me excited for what's coming next.Loved the \"Narration Style\" (Idk if that's the perfect word to describe it) of the movie, and how the movie starts off with Fletcher (Played by Hugh Grant) telling a little story but then we realize that it wasn't just a little story it's actually a long story and it's actually the story of the whole movie.The action scenes in the movie were very cool but they were very few and they were weak by that I mean I didn't \"FEEL\" the action and one thing that I really noticed is that \"comedy\" was taking over \"action\", but of course the few action scenes were so cool and I really enjoyed them.Really loved the \"little\" plot twists that were in the movie and unfortunately, I can't talk about them or I'll spoil everything.The characters were LIT and that's thanks to the cast of course. Coach (Played by Collin Farrell) was my favorite character in the whole movie, Ray (played by Charlie Hunnam) was amazing, Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant) was also amazing, the charisma of each character is the thing that really saved the long conversations or maybe the whole movie, to be honest, and without it, these conversations would've been boring as hell and the movie was gonna be dead.Really loved the production design that really suited the environment and the characters, also the custom designs were pretty cool and fancy exactly like they should be.Now for Mickey Pearson (Played by Matthew McConaughey ), I wish if we could have seen him more in the movie, felt like he didn't have much of a role or something, he was just the \"BOSS\" that has his guys to do everything for him and to be honest it makes sense he's the guy who built the highly profitable marijuana empire so of course, he's just gonna have his guys do everything for him, they even call him \"BOSS\" the whole movie, but I still wanted to see more of Mickey Pearson or to be specific, I wanted to see more of Matthew McConaughey.Although all the characters in the movie were \"BAD CHARACTERS\", we still really loved them that's a thing that I loved about the movie.\nFelt like there were some characters that weren't even important in the whole movie or they didn't have much impact in the story and one of them is: Dry Eye (Played by Henry Golding), although his acting was okay, his character was a waste of time.The Gentlemen is a very funny and interesting movie, filled with a bit of action that you'll enjoy, really recommend this fun movie.My rating is: 7.5/10", "If you love Guy Ritchie films watch it": "I don't know what else to say. If you like Ritchie's work you need to give this a watch. There's nothing more to say.", "THE GENTLEMEN (2019) - 11/03/2020": "Quite well-rounded film. Excellent casting, acting, directing and story. It took some time to get going, around 20-30 minutes of exposition to set up the story, but the rest of the movie was quite the entertaining ride. Hugh Grant's performance really stands out.

It just clicks along, with a tension-inducing plot, AMAZING acting, and enough humor to keep me giggling in between bouts of crushing action.I have yet to read a (professional) critic's review that's not all about the supposedly overwhelming racism. To them, I must say, \"please, fellows, LIGHTEN UP!\" I'll get this out of the way: I'm a woman of color. I'm a bleeding heart liberal. There. Everybody feel good? Normally, I get pretty prickly whilst reading a certain kind of IMDB review that's a thinly disguised alt-right whine-fest at having to watch (gasp) women, people of color and \"teh gays\" play roles that used to be exclusively for straight white dudes.In \"The Gentlemen\", there are racial slurs, and one of the Jewish characters and the gay character aren't \"good guys\". But the \"racism\" is presented as tongue-in-cheek, and a reflection of the stupidity and unlikeability of the characters voicing it. I think you have to be pretty humorless, pedantic, and incredibly eager to be offended to snippily mount your high horse and complain about \"The Gentlemen\" being \"horribly\" racist.As far as the performances, my gawd is this a great cast!!! Hunnam and Grant are standouts, but everyone is firing on all cylinders. And per usual in a Ritchie film, the soundtrack is just CRACKING, filled with some 70s deep cuts from Roxy Music and Can, as well as some impeccably chosen obscurist tracks from artists like El Michels Affair's horn-filled cover of Wu Tang's \"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\". The haunting, folksy opening credits song, \"Cumberland Gap\" will be echoing in your head for weeks.If you're capable of getting over yourself, \"The Gentleman\" is a solid choice that stands up to MANY MANY re-watchings. A solid YES!!!", "This is what we want! 9.5/10": "Guy Ritchie is back in top-form in this violent, hilarious, intense, completely politically incorrect masterpiece of a movie, with memorizing characters who ooze style and charisma, with ridiculously clever and witty dialogue, and meta stuff to top it all off. This movie is as offensive as they come and I loved every second, amidst all the constant plot twists, laughs, and brutal violence inflicted upon its characters. I take my hat off to you, Sir Ritchie, you have done it again my lord. Definitely 9.5/10.", "Inventive and Clever": "Ever since he burst onto the film scene with back-to-back interesting British Mob movies LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH, Director Guy Ritchie has had a \"hit and miss\" track record (including the Madonna-starring, Razzie-Award \"winner\" SWEPT AWAY). Fortunately, for us, we seem to be in a Guy Ritchie \"peak\" a this moment.Following up to his surprise strong Directing turn in the live action ALADDIN remake (if you haven't seen this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you do), Ritchie returns to his \"British Gangster\" roots with the violent, funny and original THE GENTLEMEN.Starring Matthew McConaughey as a U.S. born and bred, Cambridge educated hustler who becomes king of the British Marijuana scene who is looking to get out of the business, THE GENTLEMEN tells the tale of the...ahem...gentlemen that are pursuing (both legitimately and illegitimately) his empire.The way that this film is constructed, the most essential casting of this film is that of the central character of Michael Pearson. He is billed as an enigmatic, charismatic, violent and brilliant legend of the British drug trade, so Ritchie needed someone with all these qualities to inhabit that role. Fortunately, with McConaughey, Ritchie finds his man (I'm sure the backstory of this character needed to be tweaked a bit upon this casting to explain why an American is the king of British Weed). McConaughey is at his laconic best in this role, bringing star quality - and star power - that holds the center of this film together well.He is joined by a strong cast that understands the type of film they are in and are game to join in on the (violent) fun. Michelle Dockery (DOWNTON ABBEY), Henry Golding (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) , Jeremy Strong (THE BIG SHORT) and the always watchable Eddie Marsan (THE WORLD'S END, amongst others) all are strong in the limited moments that their characters are allowed to shine, but with McConaughey and 3 other actors I will speak to in a moment, they are relegated mostly to the background.This is because Hugh Grant (4 WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL), Colin Farrell (PHONE BOOTH) and (surpisingly) Charlie Hunnam IPACIFIC RIM) almost steal the film from McConaughey, Each one of these characters could have easily been the centerpiece of their own film and I would be happy if Ritchie would spin one of these characters off.Credit, of course, for all of this has to go to Ritchie who wrote and directed this film I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness and inventiveness in storytelling and style as well as the restraint that Ritchie shows in the violence. He uses it (somewhat) sparingly and well, so the violence punctuates the action.All-in-all a fun (though violent) time at the movies.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)", "Funny, great storytelling by guy Ritchie": "Really really enjoyed this . If you love guy Ritchie films and all types of gangster flicks this is one you have to watch", "More twists and turns than a mountain pass": "Wow.At first I was about to turn it off but the cast drew me back in.You gotta pay attention & keep second guessing what the heck next.Best British gangster comedy in a very long while!!", "Stupid, preposterous - and great fun.": "This film does everything it says on the tin. Gangster A is trying to double-cross gangster B, who in turn is trying to eliminate gangster C - and all the time someone else may or may not be pulling all the stings. It's cheesy, it's formulaic, and does everything by the numbers.But - it does it with style and panache. Provided you remember to check your brain at the door, it's seriously entertaining.", "Very interesting concept": "Funny, clever, gritty, funny, intelligent, entertaining, did I mention its funny? Like, really really funny? Hugh Grant in this was amazing, his quirky homosexual character had me dying! Like there is dialogue in this film between characters where the humor and wittiness just just doesn't stop, it's exhausting and at points I was to nervous to drink anything out of fear i may choke. The story is fantastic, the dialogue is great, and the film is surprisingly non complicated if you simply pay close attention, but it's genuinely easy to follow. I highly recommend, Guy Ritchie can be a genius. Great acting all round. At points it can feel a bit ridiculous., but it's not meant to be taken seriously sometimes. It's a fun film, and just very original. May offend some, the constant use of the word c#@t made a woman close to me tut throughout. Amazing characters, loved everything about it. How everything unfolds, where it leads to, it's just a cool ride that manages to keep you engrossed. It's got that typical Guy Ritchie style that we're used to at this point. If you like the guys movies, I'm sure you'll be impressed and leave the cinema with a smile. I look forward to going back to see it, I'm sure there's details I probably missed. As a film fan, it was great to kick of 2020 with this. The only movie I saw twice last year was Joker, glad I have found another one that I am hyped for seeing again! Go see it, and pack your sense of humor!!", "Perfectly boring, and it gets worse the longer you hang on": "Great cast. Now that the list of positives has been detailed, the problems with this film is endless so a capsulized summary is: poor plot, assuming there is one in there; unbelievable in the context that cartoons are far more convincing and closer to possible; slow, so be sure to shoot up with something to keep you immobile and incapable of escaping; the absence of reason has set a new low (who thought that something could be worse than Hell even though this is limited to only 1 hour and 53 minutes); etc.What is surprising is that people paid money to suffer through this. And even more, that many viewers thought this was good, people probably so desperate from being locked down by Covid that to have even this hog slop was perceived to be entertained, sad.", "small issue": "Someone pulls a light green piece of metal from under the floor. engraved on it are the words 'stay on your rails.' Never really understood why that happened so I assumed the piece belonged to his ancestors, more specific, it was probably carved by someone during their last minutes on a ship. They would of gone through something to the equivalent of a full day of push ups because it wasn't optional.", "Incredible": "The best Guy Ritchie film so far. Watched about 10 times already.", "Great fun!": "First off, the acting is superb. Hugh Grant steals the show. Every character is memorable and the story is unpredictable, funny and intelligent. Guy Ritchie at his best. This is what cinema is meant to be. Highly recommended.", "Guy Richie does what he does BEST!!!": "Guy Ritchie returns to the Crime genre and brings back the good old days of Snatch and Lock,Stock and two smoking Barrels.The casting is perfect.The direction is top notch.Its hilarious,bloody and loads of fun..", "It's a Guy Ritchie film": "Exactly that.If you like Tarantino films, watch them. If you don't, don't.If you like Nolan films watch them.... You get the jist.It's a Guy Ritchie film... Its a good film, lots of laughter, cockney and typical London movie.", "second worst after Revolver": "Another worse movie for Ritchie after Revolver and the travesty he directed and called it Aladdin...too talent less and incompetent to direct anything anymore...why are people like with no skill and no taste like this directing movies????", "Ritchie wrote this at his country estate most probably...": "It's what Ritchie most probably had created whilst being in the countryside with Madonna. Right down to the terrible dress sense. Ramblers and weed must've been his first initial idea when he wanted the ramblers out of his property.It's another example of a bloated ego with very little to go on.STOP the stupid macho \"cool\" stylised crap stereo types of geezas, goons and gangsters. Have some gravitas.It dulled the hell outa me. BORING.", "Guy is doing his thing": "When I finished watching the movie I thought imediatly about writing a review and first thing that came up to my mind was \"damn, Guy is back to his best\" and I imagined that it would be a nice review.\nTurns out when I went to write it, people had already written that... and that's actually a good thing, after all there are more people around that agree Guy is doing great well-acted, paced, full of humour crime movies again!\nWaste no more time time reading this review... go see this awesome movie!", "Not for me": "Too much talking. Despised every character. Hugh Grant talked so fast with a strong accent impossible to understand. Awful.", "Gangster comedy god!": "Guy Ritchie is a master @ the comedic gangster movies. It's always a twisting tale of witty dialogue, gritty, bloody murders and sophistication. A fantastic job is done at creating a background to fully immerse the viewer in a Sorcese like gangster espionage. Unlike Martin, Guy brings an undeniable humor that I can't resist. The characters are interesting, well developed and well dressed. The settings are beautiful and the plot is air tight. There is a perfect balance of action and drama. I was on the edge of my seat guessing at what will transpire next. Colin Farrell's character is a huge standout; he steals every scene he is in with an easy that palpable. Hugh Grant is phenomenal as the shiesty opportunist! This film is a major go!", "Really Very Slow, Not Everyone's Cup Of Tea!": "The GentlemenThis is definitely for Guy Ritchie fans, I like his movies so for me it's a must see.What was goodStrong acting from the whole cast and Hugh Grant was brilliant.Comprehensive highly stylish plot delivered in a tongue in cheek manner.Tight directing and editing.What was more challengingVery slow and inaccessible start, it took the best part of 45 minutes to warm up.Labyrinthine plot that was more than a challenge to follow.Quite repetitive in places and a need for less talk more action.Overall I liked this movie but others walked out in droves clearly bored by a talking gangster movie. I would love to give Hugh Grant an award after all he was robbed last year in Paddington 2, he was great here, quite a revelation, but the vehicle that contained his brilliance was flawed.", "Critics?? This film was fantastic": "I loved this film a lot. Guy Ritchie did a great job at directing this, with a top notch cast making this film great. There is not much else I can say except that I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I am sure you will too.", "The Gentlemen is classy!!!": "It's been a long time since Guy Ritchie has made something that's distinctly his own. He's spent the last decade chasing blockbusters, trying to turn himself into a mega-director the studios love to employ, only to receive a few kicks in the teeth (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) and one lucky break from basically a sure thing (Aladdin remake). Initially making a name for himself with gangster cinema, Ritchie returns to form with \"The Gentlemen,\" which examines criminal conduct and games of intimidation from a community of bosses, lowlifes, and outsiders. Ritchie isn't taking a tremendous creative gamble with the movie, but it feels like a man flushing the gunk out of his system, returning to his favourite genre to find his violent English playfulness again, which he hasn't been near since 2008's \"Rock'n'Rolla.\"\nFletcher (High Grant) is a sleazy reporter for a British tabloid who's in possession of information that will be of use to Raymond (Charlie Hunnam), employed as a right-hand man for Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), who runs a drug empire with his wife, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery). Eager to collect a fortune for his knowledge, Fletcher shares his concern about a deal Mickey is negotiating with Matthew (Jeremy Strong), ready to sell his marijuana business to a fellow American for 400 million dollars. Trouble is, the secret enterprise has been comprised by Dry Eye (Henry Golding), a small-time stooge trying to purchase Mickey's business for a considerably lower amount, while Coach (Colin Farrell) discovers his boxing students have infiltrated one of Mickey's weed lairs to make a rap video. Fletcher has witnessed this mess from afar, attempting to inspire Raymond to buy his silence, but the gangster is not impressed, listening to the reporter weave together fact and fiction as the future of Mickey's holdings falls into flux.\nIn line with Ritchie's \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch,\" \"The Gentlemen\" brings the helmer back to the basics in terms of underworld storytelling interests. It's a tale of corrupt figures navigating a disruption to their daily business, with Mickey the central figure of crisis here. He's a smooth operator in fancy suits, sucking on a cigar, overseeing a kingdom of marijuana he runs in the English countryside, paying estate owners a fortune to grow weed underground. That alone is an enticing tale, building on the crumbling realities of \"Downton Abbey\" as Mickey provides cash flow to castle owners unable to pay for massive repairs, allowing them to continue projecting power. However, this is a Guy Ritchie movie, and simplicity of threat isn't of interest to the filmmaker, who quickly complicates a dangerous situation with fresh characters and problems, as everyone is coming after Mickey's marijuana factory in one way or another.\n\"The Gentlemen\" uses Fletcher's manipulation as a way into the story, with the reporter requesting a moment with Raymond in the man's luxury apartment, presenting his version (a \"cinematic journey\") of Mickey's woes to collect a fortune for himself. The screenplay delivers a mighty collision of opportunism and limited patience, generating an intellectual fencing match of sorts between Fletcher and Raymond. The rest of \"The Gentlemen\" explores the narrative up to this point, with Fletcher sharing his information about Mickey's holdings and the plans of Matthew, who's not interested in paying an extraordinary sum of money for the weed farms, while Dry Eye goes against gang interests by making a bid of his own. Coach is the bystander pulled into this dangerous orbit, blessed with his own criminal backstory to keep bad elements away from him and his boxers. The stew thickens throughout the picture, finding trust eroding among the players, which results in the occasional chase and burst of violence.\nRitchie doesn't go wild with \"The Gentlemen,\" which is largely a psychological game between arrogant and scheming men who enjoy the thrill of the hunt and possess a huge fondness for the C-word. It's tightly edited and enormously entertaining, watching a handful of decent actors become great during the run time, with Hunnam, Farrell, and McConaughey contributing some of their finest efforts in the picture, focused on remaining in sync with the director's vision for twisty language and turns of plot. Dockery is a joy as well, portraying a \"Cockney Cleopatra,\" while Grant steals the movie, clearly relishing a chance to portray a tabloid sleazebag. They're pawns in Ritchie's big screen chess game, which delivers on betrayals, heated confrontations, and bruising banter. \"The Gentlemen\" is incredibly fun, restoring some faith in Ritchie's abilities to do what he does best, which is to throw a festival of bad choices from rotten characters with iffy survival instincts.", "7.5_8 beautiful movie but complex at begining": "The movie is goodBut the main disadvantage is being complext at first hour\nAnd it is disappointed iexpect more", "Another Gritchie win.": "Went for Guy, Charlie, Eddie and Henry; walked out loving everybody.Was a little nervous just for the first 5 minutes when Matthew McConaughey's short narrative reminded me of his Lincoln commercials, but I had nothing to worry about. Classic Guy Ritchie movie (funny, twists and turns, constant thrilling/entertaining/slightly bloody one-upping); long-time fans won't be disappointed.As I said, well-cast with no complaints but want to say Michelle Dockery was excellent, and I was happy to see Henry Golding get to show more gritty yet comedic range here. Hugh Grant seems to have gotten a second wind the last few years - he's great in this; same for Colin Farrell.Only complaints would be that I wish Eddie Marsan and Tom Wu had more screen time; both are fantastic supporting actors and it would have been nice to have seen more of them.Go, see, enjoy.", "You've gotta love Guy Ritchie": "The characters were well cast and well suited for their roles except for the lead. McConaughey wasnt bad, he just didn't fit the role. Charlie Hunnam and Collin Farrel stole the show and Hugh Grant was awkward (in a good way) and hilarious. As with all Guy Ritchie films the production value was great. Great cinematography. The storyline was a masterpiece. There were plenty of twists and turns that you saw coming but a lot of others that you did not see coming. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes crime films or Guy Ritchie films in general.", "Super entertaining!!!!": "Guy Ritchie mandou muito bem dessa vez! Roteiro, dire\u00e7\u00e3o e produ\u00e7\u00e3o por conta dele pr\u00f3prio e o resultado foi um filme divertid\u00edssimo com um elenco talentoso e vers\u00e1til! \"GENTLEMEN\" Guy Ritchie really nailed this time!

The casting also let's itself down in some cases. Overall a lack of menace to every character doesn't give this the gang land feeling of his other efforts. Should have stayed \"pure London\" since he knows that best.Look, it's still enjoyable but not as slick and funny as I expected.", "Fun Fun Fun": "Enjoyed the characters and the dialogue!\nSuper fun film to watch if you need a break from the garbage on the streaming sites.", "See It": "The plot often comes off as thinking its more clever than it actually is, but the fantastic characters and consistent laughs do more than enough to make up for it. Perfectly cast and well directed, the Gentlemen is an entertaining return to form for Guy Ritchie.", "Okay, okay, Hugh Grant can act!": "Hugh Grant was a revelation in this. Having doubted his ability to be anything other than Four Weddings Bumbling Hugh - even in The Undoing - he's proved me wrong. And now I want more!I do enjoy Guy Ritchie movies. I always stare them with my nose slightly upturned but equally always enjoy them by the end. There is a formula, we know this, but they are fast becoming one of my guilty pleasures.This movie is beautifully crafted and now I must watch everything Michelle Dockery has ever been in.A romping good yarn - but the 'C' word is used too often and like it's big and clever (it's not), hence only 9/10.", "Excellent. Guy at his best": "What could I say, I really enjoyed this movie. All the characters, from the principal ones to the small parts, are glorious, in excellent performances in an originally and perfectly told story. Thank's, Mr. Ritchie for this. And Michelle Dockery was my crush all the movie. I think it was an excellent casting decision to give her this role. Her character shows brilliantly that you can present a powerful, smart, beautiful, likable, brave and badass woman without all the ridiculous woke stuff of the late Hollywood.If you enjoyed Snatch, Rocknrolla and two smocking barrels, please, stop now what you are doing and run to the movie theater. This movie is great and it will be a cult classic. And in the final credits, wait for the music video.", "A Question": "Why doesn't IMDB have any specs on the music/soundtrack from the film? As I begin to watch, I hear a great song Cumberland Gap? And can't find any reference. The movie is great, but I like to know all the little details, also.", "Expected better": "I was excited to see this with Richie back to his roots with a British Gangster Flick and a interesting cast.Disliked the whole story telling theme I wasn't sure if I was watching them pitch a movie and none of it was real or what was going on. Blatant advertising with half the characters wearing the same brand tracksuits for the whole movie.Some other small details that seemed a little lazy too.", "Enjoyable": "Watching was enjoyable. I liked. With great acting performance and good script it was fluent.", "Boring": "Started off slow and became unwatchable. Hugh Grant totally miscast. Could not decide what this film was trying to be. For me it just didn't work.", "Outstanding, Thank you Guy Ritchie!": "The only movie I can think about is Aladdin. Well that was a Disney fairy tale but this is spectacular. Matthew once again nailed it. The selection of cast was brilliant. Everybody did their best according to their role.The story had so much twist and fun, truly enjoying. Humors, casts, action, background, costumes, soundtrack were so perfect. Brilliant direction by Ritchie. If you haven't watched it, go watch it now. Well worth of your time.", "\"There's only one rule in the jungle: when the lion's hungry, he eats!\"": "If you are a fan of Guy Ritchie's older movies like Snatch, then you might like this movie. I am a fan of the fast cuts and quirky characters he uses in his movies. Doesn't always work for me, but I really enjoyed this movie. I would say Guy is self aware with this movie, and uses that to his advantage.", "a good british gangster film": "I liked this film, its not as good as 'snatch' but close,i just felt it dragged a bit,i ofund myself day dreaming, then woke up and came back, not a good sign for a film,\ni can watch 'snatch ' over and pver, but i wont watch this again, it reminded meof 'layer cake'\nsome very funny bits, and shocking action.\nSPOILER ALERT!!!!. there is no way he could grow skunk under ground and make a profit, the electric bill would be enormous, also his staff all seemed happy, they would all have to be enslaved immigrants, was micky a real gangster? not really.\na few other plot holes, hence 6 /10", "Guy does it again": "Long time fan of Guy Ritchie and again he does not disappoint on a similar style to his previous Brit bad boy movies give it a go you will not be disappointed", "Dull, lackluster, borefest!": "This movie is just dull. Apparently to enjoy it, you need to be a Guy Ritchie fan. No expectations going into this movie and never saw a Guy Ritchie movie. Very few laughs, too much dialogue and the story line is lackluster. Couldn't sit through the whole thing, a borefest to put it mildly. If this is considered entertainment, Shoot me in the head and put me out of my misery.", "Fun but not a diamond": "It's glad to see Guy Ritchie back to his style: This is what he does better. The Gentlement is a great shot of fun, plenty of good characters and moments like the first Ritchie movies. It has also its own style not trying to be just a copycat of them. However, it's miles away from the genius of Lock&Stock and Pinks&Diamonds, wich will remain classic gems, difficult to imitate again.", "Crap": "This movie tries to be everything, but it's nothing. It wants ti be dirty, but it's rather clean, it wants to be funny, but it's not and it is as sexy as my grandmother. No idea, where all the good ratings come from", "Too much": "Typical Ritchie with the overdone script and complicated story line that runs v fast, so you really have to keep up with its fast dialogue & pace/cuts and storyline.\nA few laughs but not many and predictable tough guys trying to climb each other. Go go back 20 years and see a much better film when the director was more hungry the fantastic neat & tidy script of Lock stock and it's follow up are far more fun.\nThis was tiresome and quite surprised at the high rating. Perhaps it's a grower, but Lock stock quality it isn't.", "I liked it but it is what you expect from a Guy Ritchie film.": "I enjoyed this film but it is not going to live in my mind for long.If someone likes previous Ritchie directed crime films they will like this one.\nIt has dubious defence of drug dealing and some interesting choice of words in the language used but it is a fun romp.Maybe he can use the profit from this to make another Man From Uncle Film?", "Guy Ritchie is back in the territory where he feels most comfortable, the London crime-scene": "\"The Gentlemen\" is similar in nature to Guy Ritchie's previous British gangster movies, but it's at the other end of the scale, more up-market. Many of the major characters even dress like hipsters, but they're still delightfully foul-mouthed low-lives thanks to some brilliant performances from a very colorful cast. Hugh Grant has embraces his villainous role to great effect as he is is an absolute delight as the tabloid journalist while McConaughey, Farrell, Hunnam, Dockery are clearly having a blast. This stylish violent funny thriller may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this film is exactly what you think it will be - it's vulgar, violent, erratic, and mostly all over the place - and that's why it succeeds and doesn't disappoint. Ultimately, some fun performances and the occasional stellar scene make this worth the watch. \"The Gentlemen\" is a trip to the theater that you won't regret, just shut you brain off and have some fun.Rating: 7+/8-", "Sorry not very good. SLOW": "I think people pay movie theater prices and review the movie higher than what it is because they paid.Slow movie, many times i felt like i was watching a commercial.The best part was watching Huge Grant act again and hes still very good.

It's a throwback to his gangster flicks of yesteryear, but cruder, dumber and more generic than ever. The plot is updated to modern times with smart phones, street gangs and rap, but it's just mindlessly convoluted, deeply unfunny, profane, and seems to go on and on with no end in sight. Hugh Grant's narrator is more caricature than character, and the only decent performances come from Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell; literally the only decent things in this.", "I c_ _t believe how great this film is": "If you are offended by the 'c word' then this film might not be for you, but if you want to watch a fantastically seedy, despicable Hugh Grant and some great set pieces, with great casting following fun story telling along the way (the audience laughed out loud a lot) you can't go wrong with more smokin' barrels.", "The best guy Richie movie since lock, stock": "Very enjoyable, very cool, very Guy Richie!\nWorth a watch all day long 8/10", "Its like a party....": "Think about a party that you remember from when you were younger.

Everybody looked amazing. The 'remember that time they did {something crazy}' party for that specific group of people. It lives in your memory as this epic adventure, maybe you met somebody special there, or you reconnected with them. Now, twenty years on, you call all of those people that you shared the lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels party with and organize another party. Now though, its in somebody's backyard. Its boozy, and maybe even fun. But its not lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels. Everybody still looks OK, just larger than you remembered and with money.

Great performances from all involved, with Colin Farrell excelling in a sort of comedic minor role. You'll love this film if you are fed up with all the political correctness in the world, enjoy it for what it is. A very well made entertaining film.", "Hats off!!": "Awesomely done!

Guy rips out a true winner probably since Snatch with The Gentlemen. From beginning to end his storytelling is forever crass and sharp witted, keeping you enthralled to the very end. Always bringing in new characters each with their own charisma adding different nuianceses to the script, but always keeping it on track.Mickey Pearson (McConaughey) a typical narcissistic arrogant Yank and Kingpin narcotic dealer is selling his business to who wants it the most. Matthew (Jeremy Strong) is the most likely but not before he does his own digging. He then hires a gang of youth wannabes under the eye of the coach (Farrell) to make a deadly mistake and try to take down Mickey. Then there is the Asian connection with young hotshot Dry Eye keen to also becoming \"the lion\". The narrator of this fine tale is Fletcher (Hugh Grant).

Only negative comment is the used of the c u next Tuesday word throughout the movie.", "I won't spoil the movie..JUST WATCH IT": "I freaking loved this movie... i haven't watched Snatch or LSAB...but i will now", "An imperfect film but a perfectly good time at the movies": "The Gentleman is definitely a welcome return to form for Ritchie, who has proven that the meh-ness of his most recent films is more a symptom of the Hollywood studio system rather than a lack of talent on his part. The Gentleman doesn't fit together quite as neatly as Lock, Stock but it has the same propulsive energy, crass yet laugh out loud humor, and stylized violence to satiate die-hard Richie fans. It's by no means a perfect film, but the stuff I liked, I REALLY liked, and the stuff that I didn't care for didn't come close to ruining it for me. That being said, The Gentleman isn't for everyone, particularly for people who aren't fans of Lock, Stock, Snatch, and the like. However, for everyone else looking for a rip-roaring good time at the movies, then grab a beer, put your feet up, and let Guy Ritchie do his thing.", "Funny. Clever. Sharp": "Hugh Grant at his best\nGreat line-up\nGreat story\nGuy Ritchie comes of age\nSee it.", "Better then most action films": "This film is getting a lot of great reviews so I checked it out. I like all the older Guy Richie stuff so this should be the same. The acting, cinematography and pace of the film was great. The film lacked in originality. There are so many films about some great (person) drug lord and I don't think we needed another one. By the ending of the film it felt like they tried to cram and make as many twist as possible.", "To be honest, I was hoping for more": "To be honest I was hoping for moreThe main issue in the movie is its story. It has a fun concept and it does draw you in quickly, but the way the storytelling works hurts itself. Basically the movie is a journalist explaining everything he knows about a Marijuana dealer to the dealer's right hand man, so it's essentially 2 stories in 1 (The journalist explaining and the main story).Like I said, its a fun concept, but the problem is that they never balance the two storylines well. You get invested in the main storyline and are eager to see what's next and then it suddenly cuts and now we're watching the journalist talking to the right hand man, which ruins the flow and takes you out of the moment entirely.I will say though that it is well paced and to be honest, it was surprisingly unpredictable.It doesn't help either that the characters are dull. Most of them don't have any density that makes me actually care enough about them. There's a scene towards the end where Michael's wife is in danger and I felt no tension because they just don't give the characters enough to make you care. But the main 3 characters are structured nicely, and they matter most.Even though I had a few issues with the story, The Gentlemen is still a very enjoyable movie that has that special charm that most Guy Ritchie films have to keep you watching.", "Disappointed": "I was so looking forward to this film but what a disappointment. I love Hugh Grant and Guy Ritchie normally but what a snooze fest. It was more like a series of tenuously linked scenes than an actual story. Ropey old fashioned racism that would make any right thinking person cringe and feel deeply uncomfortable. School boy repetitive offensive language for no real reason but an attempt to shock or be funny (FYI it did neither). Plus weird 1 dimensional characters with seemingly meaningless traits ie why does Charlie H's character have OCD one minute and no symptoms of it the next? Why exactly was the young girl with a heroine addiction an addict and why did she die? Even HG's involvement couldn't save it. Good accent and bit of humour but my God can the man take a breath and stop talking for 5 seconds?\nGive it a miss and watch Lock Stock again on Netflix is my recommendation.", "Well, Well, Well that's Guy Ritchie for you": "The Gentlemen is a crime comedy movie directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Jeremy Strong, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant and Henry Golding.To be honest this is a pure Guy Ritchie movie. The movie has twists, crisp, comedic and off course action.The movie is fast and will not let your interest deviate. The way Guy Ritchie creates it's characters is just a class.Matthew McConaghey does pure justice with his character of a drug mafia and his baritone voice does the rest magic. Charlie Hunnam as his right hand man is not like other henchmen who are ready to fire bullets here and there but is a very calm and cleans the mess created because of the business with an elegance. Hugh Grant in the role of a blackmailing private investigator does his job with an ease. Colin Farrell in the role of a boxing coach of some rowdy boys is an endearing. Jeremy Strong and Eddie Marsan with Michelle Dockery were also impresses and makes the movie complete and joy ride.Overall a great comedy movie with the signature direction from Guy Ritchie. A must watch.", "Not good": "Felt like all the bits left out of Ritchie's previous movies stitched together with a poor result . The first 20 mins it jumps all over the place . The story is mundane and the acting clich\u00e9d . I suppose there are so many times you can go to the cockney gangster well before it runs dry. And this movie struggled all the way through.", "Lots of Plot Twists.": "Nice movie with lots of plot twists.

This scene is intercut with 3 other scenes and is never brought up again after it happens and it just seemed like an incredibly dark scene for a film that was going for a more lighthearted feel", "Fabulous": "What a great film. Such good fun. A great script, great actors and great characters. Exactly what you'd expect from a Guy Ritchie film.It's so enjoyable and is stylish yet funny. It's clever and tongue in cheek. The soundtrack is pitched perfectly. I don't tire of it. I can't find fault in it at all.IMHO, this film is right up there with greats such as Pulp Fiction. I've watched it several times and I always see something new. Quite simply it's fabulous.", "Stylish, funny and brilliant 10/10": "Guy Richie doing what he does best, a good gangster flick with plot twists, humour and cliche character's...best film I've seen this year so far. Charlie Hunnam's performance was fantastic.", "Mr McCoy?": "It works, I guess. Matthew McConaughey does all the heavy lifting and at times almost has to will this film into being as good as it comes off as being. I can not be too hard on it, most films are trash nowadays so mediocre movies are almost a gift.", "What a waste": "If it wasn't for Colin Farrell I wouldn't have bothered watching to the end. This movie is so mediocre that I stopped watching half way through and went to bed! Went back the next night because 1. We're in \"social isolation\"; and 2. It's raining.\nGuy Ritchie has lost the plot and he sure didn't find it in this mess. So many talented actors and all he can make is this shambles? Shameful!", "Guy Ritchie knows his roots": "Fantastic return to the good old english gangster films just like he knows. This film I did find was a slow burner to begin with but once the fire is lit it's hard to stop watching. Colin Farrell in this is his best in a very long time when he was ever on the screen i couldn't help but smile. If you love guy ritches older gangster films this ones for you but be warned it takes a little while to get going so stay with it please the reviews are good for a reason!!", "Not quite....": "I loved Lock stock & Snatch, but for me Guy Ritchie lost it a long time ago (aside from Sherlock Holmes). This is a 21st century attempt to be Snatch/Lock stock & for me it fails, though not totally. The script is awful, working on the basis of when we can't think of anything else chuck in the C word. The plot is reasonable but nothing you haven't seen before... 20 years ago. It has decent moments and Hugh Grant is quite funny but overall there's much better to spend your time on.", "Excellent Dark Comedic Crime Story": "Ritchie has previously gone a bit toward a ridiculous level in his dark crime comedies in the past. Sure, the were good watches, but you needed a big non and wink. Not this time though. It's a very matured Ritchie film digging from his past while taking a much more intelligent path. This crime doesn't need that nod and a wink to digest. Dare I say it has some gripping moments? In for a penny and in for a pound here. It will get you early and it doesn't have silly or weak moments. I'm sure there's plenty of reviews regarding the cast so all I'll say is everyone nails their parts properly in addition to a story that seems plausible. Yes, it has a device of a reporter character played by Hugh Grant telling the story in order to line his own pockets. Grant is even glib, smarmy, and narcissistic without any of his usual cutesy schtick. Matthew McConaughey continues to impress and Colin Farrell is excellent in every scene. It's a violent, it's politically incorrect, yet it doesn't pander as it all fits in the story being told. The best film in the Ritchie canon and, probably, the best in the genre. It will keep you watching right up until the end which is actually quite satisfying and excellent too.", "I'm sorry, I just can't...": "I only lasted 14 minutes and 9 seconds before I tapped out. I felt like this movie tried too hard to be witty, comical, and clever. Every word, every sentence was a joke or some smart/cheeky remark and it wasn't funny. I was beyond over it. There was no balance of seriousness in the narrative. I did like the outfits in the movie.......thats why I gave it a 4. LOL.", "Not For Me": "I think I've finally accepted that Guy Ritchie's style is simply not for me. While The Gentleman is very much an improvement on his version of King Arthur (which I liked more than most), it's still over-stylized, stuffed with over-the-top characters, convoluted storytelling, and just too much goofiness for my liking. Again, I can acknowledge that Ritchie is a very talented filmmaker, but I don't think his style is for me. Even his Sherlock films are a bit much at times. I tend to gravitate more to substance over style and not vice versa. With that said, there are several pretty dam* cool scenes that will excite fans of this style and I undeniably appreciated them. But they are few and far between.6.3/10", "Loved it.": "It's a pretty good movie. Loved the climax. The story line was good and the actors were great too.", "A Guy Ritchie Film": "Having seen LS/Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla, and the new Sherlock Holmes films, I don't think there's a better description to describe The Gentlemen: it's a Guy Ritchie Film.Expect criminals with themes of betrayal, trust, greed, and pride, and a good ensemble cast with a web of intricated twists and somewhat convenient situations.The remarkable similarity between Ritchie's films is how he often portrays a sympathetic anti-hero who is clearly involved with all the illegal good stuff but there's something we root for despite his villainy. It's the inherent morality involved in his character. He might be killing people, breaking the law, but he has his principles. And he abides by them. He is charming, assertive, and most of all, he is adamant on smiting those that betrays him, and rewards those that honors his trust.But how he rewards the trust is very subtly displayed in film, if at all. It's never directly stated how much he trusts his henchmen, just the general comradery he displays with them. You also see Ray, his go-to henchman, is pretty well off financially. But you never really see just how intimate he trusts his henchmen. And that... is a Guy Ritchie film. Characters are often quirky, and it's interesting to see how they interact with other quirky characters, but it's a bit difficult to say you actually care about them. Rather than feeling like real people, they are caricatures and the vehicles to see how the plot unfolds, rather than the driver that pushes the plot forward.That is a subtle nuance, and one might argue it's simply a preference. And it is. There's nothing wrong with characters being pushed by the plot, than the other way around, but you do just end up caring less about them. I often don't remember anything about Guy Ritchie films, other than the unique style and my weak spot for having an ensemble cast.As a whole, the Gentlemen is entertaining, but I can see why there's an abundant of reviews here talking about how the critics are wrong and the audience loved it more. If you've seen his previous movies, as a critic, The Gentlemen will feel too similar, rather than a distinct story on its own. The general audience will find this a blast with its slick edits and dark humor.", "Great fillum": "Best movie I've seen at the cinemas since the departed", "My faith in intelligent crime movies has been restored SUCCESSFULLY": "This movies was a great watch, brilliant from start to finish, absolute joy, . funny, smart and creative.", "I like it": "The story was attractive,good acts and good cast ,it could be mini series .", "Pure entertainment pleasure!": "LOVED IT!

While it wasn't his best, it certainly did not disappoint. All actors were on point, especially Colin Farrel who was surprisingly perfect. Overall, this was a fun film to watch and well worth the price of admission.", "Guy Richie at his best": "My favourite Guy Richie film has always been Snatch hands down but The Gentleman is equally as good just a little more current and 'gentrified'. Whilst a completely different vibe and story, it maintains the style of story telling which I love most in Guy Richie movies - strong characters with great introductions and development that eventually all tie into the same event.Awesome cast, brilliant characters and some hilarious moments pretty much summing up British culture. I was particularly impressed with Hugh Grant who nails the sleazy reporter perfectly. I never thought I would say this about Hugh Grant in any movie but I think he is my favourite part!", "Gangster garbage": "This flick gave me everything that shouldnt be in movies: multiple narration, scenes that didnt actually occur but were imagined by one of the characters not sure who, all kinds of flashbacks, and not a single character to care about. There is no substitute for Vinnie Jones, who is the rare kind of actor who can make menacing also funny. So many of these devices were used that i felt no suspense nor caught on to any real plot. If you wanted something other than gangsters talking tough and beating each other up youre not going to find it here. Zero entertainment value in my books. Ritchie gave us something decent in Man From Uncle. Give that another go please.", "The movie to re-watch": "I don't get the critics here who are clearly not fans of Guy Ritchie's movies complaining what seems about the style to be \"too Guy Ritchie\".It like complaining that a western being too \"westerny\" or a comedy is too funny.It's not supposed to be a detective story or super-realistic gangster documentary. It's a lightheaded action-comedy-drama gangster flick and this exact style is why we love Guy Ritchie. This movie is as Guy Ritchie movie as it can get and if you are a fan of past directors work, this one is a must see.I'm off to the fifth re-watch.", "one of the most idiotic movie ever": "This movie has the ability to appear smart but it is stupid by far. Made for idiots who need of conspiracy emotions in the necessity to feel smart. Just to understand: the reason the fighter gang intervenes to help Micky is an apparent pretext to give the idea of the happy ending to the deceived viewer after the plot has exalted the Micky character in order to get the Stendhal syndrome. It's evident that analyzing the singular characters of the movie, indeed, each of them appears absurd enough and idiot as well, such as part of a stupid plot. One of the most stupid character is the reporter. All appears exaggerated in order to get the lovely happy ending. Yes, the recitation is good enough but cannot save the high stupidity of this movie. The proof this movie is stupid is that it is devoid of a story. It tries to be brilliant but in vain.", "Great Mix Of Story Telling To Make A Good Viewing": "Great Mix Of Story Telling To Make A Good ViewingSo you might watch this film & think it is a load of talking, well in a way it is, but its done right & is broken up by great action sequences to do with the film, not to mention the film always keeps you wondering what happens as the film goes along, it would not make as good 2nd showing because you know what is going to happen.The main talking parts of the film are with 2 people, Fletcher & Raymond, Fletcher talks in a very blackmailing way to Raymond the whole time because he has all the information for both sides of the story so he is in a powerful decision, but the way Fletcher delivers his part to the film is very enjoyable to watch as is script is spot on to how that character should be while Raymond puts up with him throughout the film.The action scenes for the rest of the film are great, each character feels unique & in their own life, you have a good mix of people all trying to buy Micky's empire, they all try & undercut Micky or try to defeat any body else who tries to buy it instead. It was really interesting going through how Micky made his empire & where all his farms are hidden amongst the UK countryside, all the set up required & all the necessary people to keep it going, the film portrays this throughout the film.Defiantly give this film a chance if you are not sure, even if you think its just talking, it is NOT.Age - 25\nCinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D (Unlimited Card)\nWatch, Avoid, Consider: 100% Watch.", "Alright, alright.": "F you were ever wondering how far can a marijuana side-hustle get, fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride. This casual and light reply to Scorsese's \"The Irishman\", is an interesting and intelligent interpretation of exiting the exciting world of crime.

Things start falling out of windows fairly quick, but it appears that something else is missing to make it a masterpiece.", "Guy Richie is back in \"the game\"": "I'll keep it short and sweet. This movie is incredible. The story unfolds beautifully and the acting is brilliant. My only problem was with the dialogue, I didn't like the little quotes they had, the little metaphors, it just wasn't for me. The use of cgi bugged me, there was no need for it.

They are violent, nasty and have that brilliant sense of humour that the British are renowned for. The Gentlemen is a return to that crime/black comedy that Ritchie is known for, although I probably wouldn't class this as much as a black comedy like his previous films, but it is definitely a cool, suave gangster flick. The cast couldn't have been more perfect, Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as the lead, and the other actors, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell and Michelle Rockery (yes from Downton Abbey) are all superb and entertaining in their roles.

Well I guess you know what i'm saying if you have the patience to read down here.

It's worth your money.", "Good Film; Terrible Ending": "Ritchie and McConeghy have one thing in common; they are both afraid to take chances. They always take the easy, predictable way out. This film is a perfect example. Except for Gold, McConeghy has never really taken many chances with his characters in previous films, and it this one, he is highly predictable as well. There was a a moment when the film could have been as good as The Long Good Friday, but that moment was lost rather quickly with the ridiculous ending. Both Ritchie and McConeghy opted for the Hollywood happy ending syndrome, instead of a more realistic film.

Zzzzz bit cringey if anything.", "The Gentlemen Film Review - Guy Ritchie Directs Every Kind Of Stereotype With Matthew McConaughey The King Of The Jungle And You Play By His Rules": "I have really enjoyed watching Guy Ritchie's recent movies including the varied bag of King Arthur, Aladdin and Man From Uncle. No one trick pony here. And his latest The Gentlemen, that he wrote, co-produced and directed was fantastic, even though it included every kind of stereotype. Still funny in our politically correct time! And said stereotypes looked like they were having a blast. Especially Matthew McConaughey's Mickey Pearson. Not your usual stereotype as a Rhodes Scholar from the wrong side of the tracks, but savvy enough to realise how easy it is to sell weed to posh students in their dreaming spires. And so begins his career and advancement up the social ladder to join the gentry himself.Of course in every (crime) business, there are falling outs, and we find the older and now very successful Mickey, taking 5 one day with a pint and a pickled egg. And from behind he gets his brains blown out. A big player in the London Underworld. Someone must really want him dead.Shifting the time frame around enters the entertaining Fletcher, Hugh Grant, and I guess working from his true life tabloid experience, while adding a bit of Michael Caine sauce to it. His Private Investigator Fletcher is working for the Daily Print's Editor Big Dave, ironically played by Eddie Marsan. Mickey slighted him one day and in revenge Fletcher has been employed to dig the dirt on him. And there's a lot of dirt. So now Fletcher brings it to Charlie Hunnam's Ray. Mickey's No 2 and well Fletcher spins quite the story. So entertaining he's even written a screenplay to go along with his investigation. Bush! And he's willing to sell it all to Mickey for \u00a320million. And he loves Ray's patio barbecue. And it is terrific. Although I did wonder at one point what, or who! was being served.And now Guy Ritchie gets creative telling Fletcher's story. You see prior to the pint and pickled egg, Mickey has taken the decision to cash out of his underground drug business, and spend more time with his beloved wife Rosalind. Michelle Dockery having a ball, from Essex and type cast as the future Lady Rosalind.The film barrels along at a terrific rate, with a motley cast of the aforementioned stereotype gangsters, all preening and cock fighting to get their hands on Mickey's business. And Mickey has agreed a \u00a3400 million price tag. Yes it's that good a deal. And keeps the roof over the heads of the Upperclass in their stately homes of Britain. And so audacious. So much so that American Jewish business man Matthew Berger, played by the almost unrecognisable Jeremy Strong, is keen to get high on the marijuana profits himself, and he has the readies. You could say he wants his pound of flesh. But there's competition, or is it collusion, from the Chinese, or some Asian type!, James Bond himself. Henry Golding playing Dry Eye. And he's Ricensed to kill Fletcher suggests, as he continues his tale to the disbelieving Ray. Dry Eye actually wants in on the weed as his Uncle is a heroin drug lord and won't willingly retire. And then there's the black street boys with their Coach the hilarious Colin Farrell. We'll forgive his crime of fashion because he'll do a job or two to paper over his good but dim boys bad deeds. Pretty handy too in the end. In a David Cameron sort of way. But nothing like a David Cameron sort of way I hasten to add!And of course the Russians get a look in with Fletcher's story, having bought up London with their dirty money. But still loving parents sending their kids to our best public schools. (At a discount given they are all Charitable institutions saving tax, with all UK tax payers losing out.) But some of these new residents still have a hotline to their previous roles in the KGB. But here Fletcher may have over-egged the pickled egg, and his screenplay Bush may not be worth much in his hand.Yes Guy Ritchie has it all covered and how he brings it together is a sight to behold. Spinning the twisting story, and then rewinding to play it again with added testosterone, and plenty of guns, not much blood, and unintentional high speed drops. The language is fruity, with f's and c's, but you don't expect to mind your p's and q's in the criminal underworld. And if Guy Ritchie is auditioning for Bond, then that I have to see. How about him directing James Norton as the suave new Bond?Great fun.", "close": "This is not my favorite Guy Ritchie Movie (Snatch is #1 and Rock N Rolla is #2) but this is a close 3rd as the twists and turns of the story is perfectly Guy Ritchie style....loved all the actors, Charlie and Colin shines both in the movie.....great story, enjoyable humor and a great ending...perfect movie to watch during these quarantined times.9/10 because Snatch and RnR are still the best", "Guy Ritchie Welcome Back!": "Loved it!

The gangland missed you!", "A great overall experience": "The Gentlemen is an easy watch and Guy Ritchie strikes again by offering a great blend of thrill, comedy and action. Despite predictable plot avenues and a couple of cliche scenes, the film provided a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Great performances from all the cast with notable shout outs to Hugh Grant who plays a character far from his usual, and Colin Farrell who, as always, brings great wit and comedy. The film is far from the level that Snatch and Lock Stock are at but is definitely Ritchie's best film since those.", "Entertaining": "Guy Richie is back on form. This is what he's good at, not making Life action Disney remakes.I enjoy this movie from start to finish. Superb acting Hugh Grant is good. I liked Charlie hunnam character, calm yet cunning. Love the accents as well. You can't forget Collin Farrel and his boys \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u0152. And there's a setup for a possible sequel. I will definitely watch!", "Not very often I give a 10 to American/English movie...": "But this one is just a fantastic gem!!!\nThe caracters, the filming, the story is at top.", "Oi Blimey. An Actual Tolerable Guy Ritchie Film. Now There's Quite the Sight": "Yes, it's still silly. Yes, it's still full of itself. Yes, it has the same rude and rambunctious dialogue of your typical Guy Ritchie flick. It's sort of entertaining though. It passes the time and yeah there are some decent laughs to be found.", "First Hit: A few scenes were to fun watch, but as a film, it was poorly constructed.": "First Hit: A few scenes were to fun watch, but as a film, it was poorly constructed.I've never seen a Guy Ritchie film that I thought was constructed with thoughtfulness and skill. He either attempts to cover too much ground or is more inclined to use pop and dazzle to engage the audience.In this film, he has to use narration throughout to create, set up, and deliver the story. He hides his inability to write a good screenplay by making the narration of his story part of the storyline his characters say to each other.Specifically, watch most of the scenes between a dirt-digger detective and reporter Fletcher (Hugh Grant and Ray (Charlie Hunnam). Ray is the right-hand man and consigliere for Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), the weed lord of England. Because Fletcher is attempting to blackmail Mickey and Ray, he explains the whole story to the theater's audience by reading the screenplay with Ray.This is the main issue with this film. Having to rely on this narration to provide a lot of the movie's context is troubling. However, I will say the way it is done here is better than having an unknown voice over-explanation.The story as I saw it, was that Mickey wants to sell his vast marijuana growing and distribution empire to Matthew (Jeremy Strong). The reason for selling was unclear and unconvincing. Matthew is a wealthy eccentric Englishman who is intrigued with the possibility of buying this empire for $400M. However, it is a lot of money, and to drive the price down, Matthew engages \"Dry Eye\" (Henry Golding and a term used for Asians). Dry Eye makes an offer that Mickey scoffs at, but because the offer to sell to Matthew was supposed to be secret, Mickey is now on guard.Then the story adds complexity because we learn that Matthew and Dry Eye are working some sort of side deal to assist each other in reducing the price, but each plans to screw the other as well.Adding to this is Fletcher, who, through his detective work, documents all the goings-on between all the parties, which led to the script he reads from. His hopes are to sell the screenplay to Mickey and Ray for $20M so that Mickey and Ray will know all the subversive planning that is going on to drive the price down.The most fun part of the film is when we have scenes with Coach (Colin Farrell). His group of boys is caught raising havoc in one of Mickey's underground farms, so he owes Mickey and Ray. The payback to Ray and Mickey are amusing and fun to watch.Confused? One could be, but this convoluted story is kept on track by the narration scenes. This saves the film from being a total disaster and it also makes it a poorly constructed film.Anyway, there are lots of side plots and stories in this movie, including Mickey's wife, Rosalind Pearson (Michelle Dockery). She's supposed to be the most magnificent woman in the world, but it is only in the eyes of the beholder. There is the newspaper owner who hired Fletcher. There is Lord George (Tom Wu), head dragon, heroin distributor who crosses Mickey.The movie has lots of twists that are used for creating interest and complexity, and in some cases, it works, but mostly it doesn't.McConaughey's role in this makes me wonder. At times he selects fantastic parts like in film Dallas Buyer's Club and other times, he chooses roles like this one. He does it well enough, but it's really a role of false, blustery, and cool-man behavior. Hunnam is outstanding as Ray, Mickey's right-hand man. Grant is oddly compelling as a bad guy. I've not seen him recently, and seeing him here was fun. Farrell is brilliant as the Coach of a group of guys and honest to his word. Actually, I liked his character and role the best of all. Dockery is okay as Mickey's wife and auto builder entrepreneur. Strong is mediocre as the wealthy and odd Englishman who wants to buy Mickey's empire. Golding is formidable as Dry Eye, a youngish Asian who wants to make his mark. Wu was perfect as the wry old heroin distributor. Ritchie wrote and directed this film, and as I've indicated, Guy has little to offer in the realm of filmmaking and his background in music videos is where his talent may lay.Overall: Although entertaining at times, being so convoluted the required narration means the story and film needs additional work.", "Sequel please?!?": "I absolutely loved this film. Very unique in it's own way. I would love to see a sequel to this masterpiece.", "gentlemen": "Among these roles, I like Raymond best. He has an elegant shirt and waistcoat on the upper part of his body, and I have a closer look at his pants. They are jeans.", "Back With a Bang (of a car door)": "So we might have seen it all before, but Ritchie is on form again with a tried and tested mix of stellar cast, using the dialogue to its best. Hugh Grant stood out for me as he's made the shift from slightly edgy and nervous English chap to a run of really decent roles that he can sink his more mature teeth into. From Paddington 2 to this; he's versatile!Excellent editing strengthens the tale told and kept me intrigued enough as the usual Ritchie masterclass in a twisting and turning plot unfolds.Formulaic? Well, maybe, but the formula works. It's a geezers' playground of hazardous rides.Nice to see so many familiar faces and each service the screenplay to make a very creditable return to what Ritchie does best. Sadly, there's no Vinnie Jones, but hey, it's a great film and I would even see it a second time.", "First rule of the jungle is ...": "Ritchies back to his roots , its punched up for the roaring 20's but id say deliberately understated on the lol's to add a-little more swagger to the plot. Don't get me wrong there are lol's its just not OTT like snatch or lock stock.\nGreat cast , some stand out performances\n(Hugh Grant is priceless) one of Ritchies best films in years , go see it !", "VIEWS ON FILM review of The Gentlemen": "2020's The Gentlemen is my latest review. And no, it doesn't include Sting, Alan Ford, Jason Statham, or Vinnie Jones in its cast (I kinda wish it did). \"Gentlemen\" is about a once poverty-stricken American who sells off his marijuana enterprise only to get a bunch of criminal blokes who want to steal it from him profit free.Released in London via December of last year and featuring a persona named Dry Eye (that's so Ritchie), \"Gentlemen\" has director Guy Ritchie in held back, gangster reserved mode. It's not as violent as I thought it would be nor is it as fresh (or nasty). Yup, \"Gentlemen\" is a bona fide, Ritchie retread. Too bad it lacks the snap, crackle, and pop of his earlier stuff (Snatch, Sherlock Holmes, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels).Starring the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant (who are all quite good), The Gentlemen has plenty of jump cuts, actors with thick British accents, spit-fire dialogue, numerous flashbacks, a sloppy narrative, and plenty of good old Ritchie speak (\"lovely\", \"double bubble\", \"bullocks\", \"on the tele\"). \"Gentlemen\" also contains too many characters that fade in and out and shoot-'em-up scenes that build dramatic momentum only to come to a screeching halt.For me, Guy Ritchie has enough cinematic trickery up his sleeve and enough spent energy for five filmmakers. He's like the United Kingdom's version of Quentin Tarantino and/or Marty Scorsese. Pity that he's not much a storyteller because The Gentlemen is a little ponderous, a little shilly-shally, and all over the map. When the end credits for \"Gentlemen\" come up you hear the song \"That's Entertainment\" by The Jam. That's funny because the word entertainment and the bulk of The Gentlemen don't quite gel. Rating: 2 and a half stars for well, the empty style points and the lush UK interiors.", "Go for it": "I don't usually write reviews however I make exceptions sometimes, and this is that time I'll sum this movie up in 3 words \"WHAT A MASTERPIECE\" go for it as Guy has done his magic.", "That's how a Gentlemen look like": "Wow, to start of what a great casting. Once you have a bounded script all you need is a great director and great cast.You got all of them in once place and miracle starts to roll.Once of the best movie i saw and never felt slow even for seconds.Make more movie yo Brits with best scripts and great way of story tell directors.", "Hugh Grant is the very best thing about this very good movie": "Guy Ritchie has a pretty good track record with me. I won't say he's perfect because I haven't loved everything he's done, but I have liked everything he's done and The Gentlemen is no exception. A very finely told tale of blackmail and drug running on an epic scale, Guy Ritchie knows the art of storytelling.I won't spoil it by giving a synopsis, since I'm sure everyone else has done that and some people don't like to know how a story goes before they see/hear it. But I will say that, despite overusing the c bomb in the script and a highly unpleasant projectile vomiting scene, what I enjoyed the most was the back and forth between Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam, who are the real stars of this film. The dialogue is genius, punctuated by some genuinely funny moments. It's nice to see Michelle Dockery transcend Downton Abbey and Matthew McConaughey gets it done. There's a fine line between good acting and annoying with McConaughey and I'm pleased to say that this performance is the former.A good film. Thumbs up.", "Perfectly Average": "I think Guy Ritchie is a competent director. Early in his career he made some very entertaining comedic gangster flicks (\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", \"Snatch\"- I even think \"RocknRolla\" is alright); and I think his blockbusters are entertaining as well (the \"Sherlock Holmes\" series; and make fun of me if you want, but though \"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\" was absolutely ridiculous, I thought it was also a lot of b-movie fantasy fun). When I saw the trailer for this movie I actually got excited, because though I think Ritchie's PG-13 blockbusters are fine, he really shines when he's working with incredibly foul-mouthed, violent and eccentric gangsters. I hoped this film would be a triumphant return to form.While \"The Gentlemen\" is certainly a return to form, but it's not triumphant; it's pretty average.", "Guy Ritchie brilliantly returns to the gangster genre with a cohesively constructed jigsaw puzzle of a script": "Guy Ritchie's new movie is a cohesively constructed jigsaw puzzle. The labyrinthine plot has all the trappings of an intriguing thriller. The director will make you navigate through an intricate web of deceit with splendid panache. Ultimately, all the excitement that builds up within you as the film progresses will be justified with a superb climax that will assure you about Guy Ritchie's brilliant return towards dabbling with the gangster genre.Every character appropraitely fits into the plot's grander scheme but Hugh Grant, who has off late become one of Richie's linchpins, was phenomenal. His character is perhaps one of the most complex yet fascinating characters I've seen on celluloid in recent times. And Matthew McConaughey has done himself a favour be being in this film. Richie knew how to tap Matthew's suave demeanour in just the right way.Watch this film and get reminded of movies like \"Lock, Stock and the Two Smoking Barrels\", \"Snatch\" and \"Rock n Rolla\". Ritchie's gangster universes are embellished with alluring complexities and this film is a cherry on Richie's delicious 'gangster-flavoured' cake.", "Must Be A Ritchie Fan To Enjoy This Romp": "OK, first off I'm not a big Guy Ritchie fan. His films involve largely convoluted plots that unnecessarily meander off in complex avenues to showcase the simple message that life is not all that it appears to be.Case in point is The Gentleman. Using Hugh Grant to be the glue that supposedly ties the narrative threads together, Ritchie instead dashes an element of deviousness as he manipulates Grant into the scheme of backstabbing among business friends. We've seen these drug dealing movies all too frequently, when honor among thieves is thrown out the window. And Ritchie makes the illicit underground drug industry much more dark with numerous murders that have little consequences to the participants--other than getting shot themselves.All in all, a forgettable film that is ok in its initial viewing, but unsustainable in the memory once a week passes.", "Terrible Movie": "This is the worst movie that I've seen so far this year. I actually ended up turning it off after about an hour. I just didn't really care to watch any more of it. The plot didn't interest me enough to continue.", "Flat Out Fun and Great Movie": "This movie was fun, intelligent, with great direction, acting, cinematography, plot...etc. It's hard to find movies like this in the cesspool that they call Hollywood.

Guy Ritchie's best film since snatch", "Ritchie doing what Ritchie does best.": "What a cool film... Told as part narrative part flashback, this is a motley crew of odd ball characters who I found to be immediately entertaining, despite their apparent villainy... Hugh Grant shows off a side of himself which is at times hilarious, and repulsive... It really looked like he enjoyed his portrayal of a investigative journalist... hmmm.... For me Colin Farrell stole the show with his manic but loyal dedication to his \"boys\". This crime flick is just cool to watch, cool actors, cool action, cool clothes, and good ol'fashioned violence. I probably heard more C bombs in that movie than I've heard in a year... \ud83c\udf7f", "An intelligent film, finally,": "The Gentlemen is an intelligent film I've seen in a long time. Hugh Grant gives an extraordinary performance.", "Guy Ritchie in his element. Colin Farrell excellent Hugh Grant excellent. Everyone was excellent": "Demonstrates that Guy Ritchie still has it and that Colin Farrell is needed back on the big stage his talent ability are now basically almost perfect. Hopefully he does well in Batman. Hugh Grant finally demonstrated some unknown range and I think these kind of characters would suit him in future. Charlie Hunam shows why he's probably deserving of being a trustee of Guy Ritchie.

Guy did a great job.", "A TRUE MASTERPIECE OF MODERN CINEMATOGRAPHY!": "A TRUE MASTERPIECE OF MODERN CINEMATOGRAPHY\nPERIOD.", "Guy Ritchie doing what he does best": "There's lots of good stuff about The Gentlemen. The story is fun, engaging and clever. There are a few telegraphed twists and turns, but quite a few blindsided me. Its a good twisty turny plot, and the non-linear storytelling and the way it is told through narration is very clever in adding to this intrigue and mystery. Ritchie's direction is excellent, telling the story in a pretty inventive way in parts with good pacing.Like any Guy Ritchie gangster film, we are treated to an eclectic character list, some of whom are more developed than others. This is one of my criticisms of the film. Far too many of the characters were one dimensional, when they could have been great! Ritchie had the skeleton of some great characters, but failed to flesh enough of them out for my liking.I think McConaughey was a standout, both in terms of character and performance. The jury is still out on Hugh Grant, I haven't decided if it was a cringey or brilliant performance... Other than these two, I found the other characters uninspiring and cliched, the sorts of characters I've seen in plenty of other gangster films. It didn't help that the accents kept coming and going, and this inconsistency was pretty much across the board.I also thought that the dialogue was as rough as anything at times. It was like somebody was parodying a Guy Ritchie film, which is hard as his films already feel like a parody to start off with. I got past this as the film went on and I got more immersed, but at the start it was quite jarring.If you like gangster films and Guy Ritchie, I see no reason why you wouldn't really enjoy this.", "Very slow beginning, finished well.": "After what was a slow and tedious intro to the film, I pushed through and quite enjoyed it as a whole.Hugh Grants accent and character as a whole was not for me. Colin Farrell was excellent, felt perfect for the role.Back end of the movie gained great momentum and made the wait worth it.", "good return from Guy Ritchie": "Guy Ritchie returns to the atmosphere of his first few movies with The Gentlemen, wherein violence and chaos form a succesfull . The director, maybe predictably, gives The Gentlemen an opening stretch that overwhelms the public with exposition and context. Clear, certainly, that the barrage of information is a bit and requires a fair amount of patience from the viewer. The Gentlemen then follows into a progressively enthralling midsection which boasts one captivating sequence after another. The thoroughly watchable atmosphere is undoubtedly heightened by top-tier work of the movie's eclectic cast, and by the time all the pieces fall into place within the rather spellbinding climax.", "Hugh is a better actor.": "For a while I had been put off with Hugh Grant being in this film, but I was totally proven wrong, the film is Mint, and Hugh was brilliant.", "Great fun": "Wasn't expecting too much, but when you laugh out loud and feel like you are on a ride with no dead spots how can you not enjoy.\nRemember it's a comedy Don't take it seriously and go along for the ride - you will be rewarded.", "Must see!!": "What a fun movie.Colin Farrell is definitely badass.Funny,entertaining and really enjoyable.", "Too much language!": "Caper told in a roundabout way with a whole lot of vulgar language.

Fantastic cast, but the crass language eventually became too much for even me.", "Guy Ritchie's best and most enjoyable work since Snatch": "The real Guy Ritchie is back! A fresh and crispy film with an intricately interconnected narrative full of unique characters and humor make Genlemen feel like one of his classic British ganagster movies.

The thing that made Ritchie famous was making highly stylized underground crime thrillers that are really funny with quirky characters. He is not copying his movies from 20 years ago, but he does what he did before with more mature version of it. It has all the visual style, the quick cuts, all of that fun stuff that we liked before but it's not the same version of it. He has updated his bag of tricks. The nature of the storytelling is differtent. Even the age of the lead character is a man that's about Ritchie's age right now. That makes for a nice refreshing return to the thing that he did before without feeling like he's trying to force all of it.The cast here is amazing. With each of these actors Ritchie gives them a fun and odd role that just makes for an ensemble characters that you like watching. It just makes for a lot of quotable lines and great memorable scenes. The standouts her would be (though it was very hard to choose) Hugh Grant. Here we get him doing something pretty different from his usual thing, but it still has all that charm and charisma. Another standout is Charlie Hunman. I haven't seen a ton of his stuff, but this is my personal favorite of his roles so far.The movie builds momentum as it goes along. As you discover how the pieces are fitting together and what's actually happening, you get more and more investested in wanting to see how it's all going to pay off. All the stuff that it sets up absolutely leads to big moments of payoff.It's good for a movie to build momentum as it goeas along. It's good for a movie to end on a high note. But I felt like this one had such a build of momentum and intrigue that the beginning felt like it kind of meandered a little bit.The first 30-40 minutes of the film drags a good bit and is by far the most confusing part of the film. It's told using this framing device involving the dialogue scenes between Grant and Hunnam. Because of this it's so disjointed in the way that it's told in trying to be stylized at times and you don't fully understand who the Hugh Grant character is and what their relationship is because the characters haven't fully been introduced yet. I wasn't quite aure exactly what was going on so it took some time for me to get fully invested in the film. Once it gotten to a certain where you understood the characters and what is going on I was invested. But it took longer than it should have to get to that point.There's also a couple of reveals in the finale that I just thought were so obvious that I'm not even sure if they wew supposed to be presented as reveals.Overall this was a solid return to form for Guy Ritchie showing that he can still write great characters and story.8/10 If you're a Guy Ritchie fan go see this movie.", "The Gentlemen might be Guy Ritchie's best film to date!": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've always been a fan of Guy Ritchie's style. While I do admit that he tends to overuse his own techniques (like he does in this movie), he always manages to bring something unique to his projects. He delivered a pretty good live-action remake of Aladdin while offering his own take (Jasmine has more compelling motivations). I surprisingly enjoyed King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword, but the ending is disappointing. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the Sherlock Holmes films are entertaining and fun, to say the least. So, yes, I was sort of excited to watch The Gentlemen.With such a stellar cast, how can someone not be interested in an old-fashioned crime-thriller? First of all, I want to get this out right away: it's a movie that anyone can enjoy, sure, but for people who know how films usually work, Ritchie applies a storytelling method that's going to make every \"filmmaking nerd\" lose their minds. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) is mostly the narrator of the entire story, and he's basically interpreting a \"version\" of Guy Ritchie telling the story of his own \"flick\".This means Fletcher goes on and on about film specs like aspect ratios and film gauges but also helping the audience understand what's happening, by announcing if the story is near its climax or if \"the plot thickens\". It's a captivating and funny way of using exposition without it being lazy or forced. Grant also makes sure to ask the questions the audience should be asking. This way, even people who don't like to think when they go to the cinema (yes, they exist) will be able to follow the mystery unraveling.Obviously, the unbelievable cast makes this movie so much fun. Matthew McConaughey is a masterful actor when it comes to carrying long dialogues. Everything he says is always engaging, either by the way he says it, his expressions, or the physical intensity he puts into his own words. Charlie Hunnam (Ray) probably delivers his most amusing performance to date. Ray is definitely going to be a fan-favorite character, and his interactions with Fletcher (with who he spends most of the runtime) are hilarious.Henry Golding (Dry Eye), Michelle Dockery (Rosalind Pearson), and Jeremy Strong (Matthew) all give excellent performances, but Colin Farrell is the best of this group of characters as Coach. His scenes are some of the funniest sequences of the entire year so far. From his accent to the action he eventually gets into, he's one of those characters who will leave everyone wanting more. As for the story, it's undoubtedly one of the most complex screenplays I've seen in a while. Comparing with Knives Out, the narrative structure ends up being a bit similar.Both possess tons of twists and turns that will make everyone scratch their heads for quite some time. Both show different events of the story, featuring a specific character at a particular time in a distinct manner (flashback, flashforward, simple exposition). However, The Gentlemen abuses from its own trick a bit too much, especially during the first half. Something entertaining can quickly turn into something pretty annoying if the storytelling isn't well-balanced. Can't have too much of anything, right?This is my overall issue with the film. Guy Ritchie brings something cool and fresh to escape heavy exposition, but it's still a lot of information to transmit, and it doesn't always work smoothly. Some subplots didn't need to go so deep, which takes time away from more emotionally investing storylines. Nevertheless, in the end, Ritchie stitches every story together seamlessly to create a very well-written flick. With so many intricate layers, it's extremely difficult to bring it all together to make a cohesive finale, but Ritchie does it superbly.All in all, The Gentlemen is another hit for Guy Ritchie, and it might even be his best movie yet. With one of the most complex screenplays in a while, the phenomenal cast elevates this crime-thriller into one of the best films of 2020, so far. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, and Colin Farrell stand out, but every actor delivers excellent performances. Extremely funny and captivating storytelling through Grant's narration, which ironic or not, it's both the best and worst component of the movie. When used in excess, it can be a bit bothersome and lengthy, but for most of the runtime, this alternative to substantial exposition works brilliantly. Interesting characters, intriguing mystery, and hilarious bits of comedy make this feature very entertaining. Technically, great editing keeps a well-paced flow, but it's Ritchie's layered narrative that steals the show.Rating: B+", "Brilliant that's All have to say \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d": "Loved it, great cast, acting and story thanks to Guy Ritchie.

So many standout moments, funny scenes and quotable lines. Everyone was at the top of their game and seemingly having fun with what was a fantastic script.It was almost like everyone was playing a role opposite their usual typecasts. Hugh Grant was so hilarious, in one of his best performances. It's hard to imagine his previous film was Paddington 2! Charlie Hunnam was excellent as Raymond. I really loved his character and his interplay with Hugh Grant's Fletcher was a highlight.McConaughey and Farrell were perfectly cast in their respective roles. Michelle Dockery managed to steal every scene she was in. Can't help but wonder what Lady Mary Crawley from Downton would've thought! Eddie Marsan was his usual excellent self in his role as Big Dave too.I loved how everything tied together in typically genius Ritchie style. Definitely recommend.

Horrendous music, unnecessary violence, truly idiotic plot, and no real glue other than the large number of famous ppl on set.It is a pathetic unequivocal Zero.", "Turned it off": "I had just finished watching Just Mercy and started to watch The Gentlemen. I made it about 30 minutes into the movie before I turned it off. I rarely turn off movies but this one had to go. The only thing entertaining was Hugh Grant's accent.", "\"That's Entertainment\"": "Boy howdy, Guy Ritchie knows how to make an actor act! This flick is like The Beatles. You take away even one beat and it messes up the whole tune, you picking up what I'm laying down? I am so happy seeing this film sit at a positive 7.8 rating in late February 2023. It's such a buildup; old gangster ideology with new gangster philosophies.Example: Back in my old school play days, a gangster would say stuff like: A human soul is like an apple with some bruises, baby. And sometimes, you have to trim off the bruises to see what's crisp and delicious. Always look at your enemies this way. Because one day, your enemies just might be your best cohorts in a larger business.Now, I realize being a 46-year-old Valentine, this may seem old and dusty. But I can assure you, these are good terms to live by, plus a bit of Good Book reading, you dig? In common speak: Michael Pearson obeyed this old ideology with Lord George. I respect that.I swear sometimes that Ritchie can read minds, but you really have to give up some credit to Ivan Atkinson & Marn Davies here. What a story! It just glides across the screen like Superman slowing down the planet rotation. Brilliant, actually. I don't think we give enough credit to the TEAM of writers sometimes; you know?I hope everyone enjoyed this flick as much as I did. I'd love to be a part of a Guy Ritchie flick, even if I was just the coffee boy. But I've got so many stories that could perhaps be ballpein through some Hollyweird metal.You probably have already heard about a remaining Stones & Beatles tour by now, right? Well, just imagine if Ritchie worked on a film with Tarantino & Kevin Smith. Or if all these cats worked with Ruben Fleischer on Zombieland 3. We'd see a crack in the universe, but it would be one string theory ride with an amazing soundtrack.I know I'm a weird cat, but nobody pays me to be and that's the beauty of it all, isn't it?Call each other...please. Now, \"That's Entertainment!\"", "Sharp, surprising and funny with violence served on the side": "Guy Richie has become one of my favorite directors because he delivers very entertaining films on a consistent basis... \"The Gentleman\" keeps that streak going.A stellar cast (Hugh Grant is in his best role and best performance in years) brings the story of an ex-pat American drug dealer trying to sell off his world class criminal empire to the screen with great performances, dialogue and storytelling.Richie is a master at slight of hand directing: When you think things are going one way he introduces a twist that complicates things.If you want an entertaining break from bloated budgeted films with bad acting (Bad Boys, Jumanji, etc) try this one- I loved it!", "On the whole it's a great watch": "Well I have to say I massively enjoyed this film. A lot more than I expected as well.My slight issues with the film:\nnot as funny as the other Guy Ritchie films. Found there was little to no humour in thissame idea, but for action scenes as well. Expected a little more gore/fighting scenes etcending was a bit underwhelming. I felt like it all ended then they added 10 minutes on, which I just didn't see the point in it.On the whole though it didn't take anything away from it being an enjoyable watch. It's not as good as his classic films don't get me wrong. I don't think anything will be really. Films like Snatch etc are so good it just can't be beaten. But overall I enjoyed this. Interesting story, good acting and just well done in general. I recommend.", "He's back": "Guy Ritchie's apology for Aladdin.Apology accepted.This was a blast.\nFast paced, convoluted in a good way (the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch way) and with an excellent cast. This is Matthew McConaughey's best performance in quite a while.\nHugh Grant and Colin Farrell in particular steal the show.It's Guy Ritchie going back to his roots and it's really fun to watch.", "Intelligent, gripping and captivating from start to finish!": "The best film I've seen for a long time! Excellent acting, wonderful cast, intelligent plot, witty, very British! I was gripped by it from the second it began to the second it ended! So NOT outdated! Guy Richie thank you.", "pure tosh and gimmicks": "This crap was written without any basis for a movie, never finished it and you probably won't either. it wasn't enticing to watch and there was no story to follow. pure garbage stay away", "The Guy Ritchie Formula": "The Gentlemen is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Not a moment of boredom through the long dialog narration, thanks to the trademark Guy Ritchie school of editing. His ability to make all characters have the depth of a main character is matched by few others.\nIn The Gentleman the focus in more on intellect and less on raw violence (though present). The plot Is direct and incisive, keeping you alert without overwhelming you with too much information to follow. An easy mistake to do in these plot twist based movies, but that The Gentlemen tiptoes around with mastery.\nThat being said, the story feels straight out of the Guy Ritchie turn lever machine. While it has its unique twists and turns, they feel reused, and for those of us that have seen his previous movies, the omnipresent sense of \"dej\u00c3\u00a1 vu\" is there detracting from what is otherwise a well constructed plot.\nFor me to rate Snatch as his masterpiece, I have to rate this one at an 8, pulling on 7 for those that are not fans of the style.", "Really awesome": "Everything in this movie is awesome. Great directing, story, twists, casting of actors and acting. Good job from the producers. Need more movies like this.", "Wow. Just wow.": "Guy Ritchie returns to his story telling ways and it's brilliant. Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant are particularly amazing in this film and have you wanting more. Ritchie is back and I hope he doesn't leave.", "Excited": "Had to watch this one with popcorn and a soda ,as soon as I saw the cast and the the director I knew they wouldn't let me down .This is a very exciting film not a dull moment and done smoothly without lots of blood and violence.", "Basic Guy Richie": "A confusing but funny and beautiful to look homage to the good old days of Guy Richie. The film is neither very good nor bad. You just look at it, but you certainly won't remember it forever. Perfect entertainment for viewers who can concentrate well for almost two hours so that they can follow the fast action.", "Real bad!": "I tried it twice but what a bad movie is this.It's good to fall a sleep.", "Mostly not great and in parts, truly dreadful": "As a massive fan of Lock Stock, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell and Matthew McConaghy I was looking forward to this. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. The story is OK, rather slow at times and a few bits that make little sense when unpicked, but it was just about bearable. The dialogue is generally overblown and at times laughably bad. The whole thing is unrealistic in the extreme. The weakest part is Matthew, played by Jeremy Strong. I'm not sure if he's just an appalling actor, if his dialogue in this was particularly silly, or a combination of both, but it was distractingly, embarrassingly awful.I've happily enjoyed the highly stylised, slick, funny and brutal work of Guy Ritchie in the past, but this film is not the best.", "Waste of time": "Apart from Matthew McConaughey, the acting is terrible.\nEven worse script.\nCouldn't watch it.", "Too cool for school": "It's easy to pull a trigger in a film but a lot harder to have a plot. Couldn't figure out who was going to double cross who next or who were ultimately the bad guys. Everyone in this movie was just too cool for school. If you want to watch anything of substance just watch something else. The actors were top notch just not here. Six stars as it was professionally produced.", "Guy Ritchie gangster movies is a genre.": "This is vintage Guy Ritchie movie all over. This is one of the best movies he ever made and it's so good to have him back in his best. I don't know why most of the critics hated it or just called it ordinary. This is pure entertainment and you can enjoy every minute of the film. There's good action, humour, plot twists and brilliant dialogues with a superb cast. All of them did a brilliant job and these characters will be talked more in the years to come. Overall, I really liked The Gentlemen and I personally think it's a masterpiece.", "What an amazing film": "This movie is phenomenal. From the editing choices, to a way of narrative storytelling, cinematography, costumes and of course acting. This movie is everything I miss in latest filmmaking. It's fun, it's fast, it's loaded with humor and it places twists around every corner for you to stay where you belong - on the edge of your seat.", "Please no more Ritchie": "Someone needs to make Ritchie just retire already. How many times can he keep making the exact same film? There is no point in even reviewing this movie. Have you seen anything Guy Ritchie has ever done? Ok, there ya go. If not, then it will be enjoyable. His schtick was great around the turn of the millennium, but it is so played out. I do want to give a shout out to Charlie Hunnam as Ray. He gave an enjoyable performance.", "Violent but funny as hell": "I don't normally go in for gratuitous violence in film. It is usually cheap, like the plagiarist works of Quentin. This film however was not only violent and humorous, it was cleverly written. I don't want to spoil anything; suffice to say that this film is leagues above the low-brow exploitation of violence to which Tarantino flicks stoop.", "A Class Film.": "Overall, The Gentlemen is classic Guy Ritchie and a brilliant British crime drama. The performances from all the cast are great, but Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell deserve special mention as they were both so funny and brought such life to the film. There were parts I found myself wondering what was going on, but it all made sense and with a second viewing It will all tie in seamlessly.

We're in the minority, but save your money and time.", "One of the best times I've had at the movies in a long time.": "Slick performances. Great dialogue. Masterful storytelling. A bit of humor tossed in here and there. I seriously don't know what else a movie needs.Not sure why some critics had a problem with it. Maybe it didn't further some \"woke\" agenda or whatever. One critic actually complained that it was dated chiefly because it did not. Ridiculous. It was a riot. My wife, who rarely attends movies with me, enjoyed the hell out of it as well, heartily laughing more than a few times.", "Entertaining characters and dialogue but plot a bit slow": "While the plot might drag in the mid section, it does pick up a little towards the end.

All of the actors delivered brilliantly. Love the movie", "two times watching...and it was still good.": "Yes it was very good but like all movies there are problems with it. My biggest complaint is how much the movie jumps between different scenes, especially at the beginning it becomes difficult to follow but does straighten out towards the end. Visually the movie look great and is very stylised to suit to mood of the film. The characters are great, all with great acting as well that create intense scenes. The last forty minutes of the movie is completely dedicated to reveal after reveal that just blows your mind further and further adding to the confusion but you simply can't not enjoy. The action is pretty good, it's very grounded which definitely suits the movie. There is also a lot of straight dialogue and drawn out scenes which creates for intensity but can also become quite boring in a sense...a lot of business talk. All in all a great movie that has a couple of flaws. 7/10 ye", "If you wish to be the king of the jungle...": "\"If you wish to be the king of the jungle, it's not enough to act like a king.

Also all the actors - superbly acting! And so different from their usual Hollywood stereotypes! That means such originality nowadays! Kudos to everyone involved!", "Just wow": "What a clever movie. In the beginning i thought it was a bit slow but it was necessary for the viewer to understand the plot and everyone involved in it. The story is given to us in such a clever way the direction was captivating and the heroes really nicely structured. It has suspense and funny moments. One of the best movies I've seen lately I highly recommend it", "Back to form Guy Ritchie": "Honestly outstanding from Guy Ritchie. I just wish he stuck with this type genre because he's an absolute genius at these type of movies. When he goes off track and starts directing a different sort of movie, his films are nowhere near as strong. This is by far his best movie since the magnificent Snatch and Lock Stock. I believe Snatch is still his masterpiece and his best film along with Lock stock. This comes a close 3rd behind these 2. It's you're typical 1 liner cockney gangster comedy with superb witty dialogue in true Ritchie fashion. If are you not British, notably a Londoner, you will find it hard to understand certain phrases and the terminology, but don't let it put you off. Shove the sub titles on if you find it a little difficult to follow. That being said, the usual interweaved story that climaxes to a superb conclusion like every other similar Ritchie film is apparent and a brilliant cast is on the menu throughout. Hugh Grant the pick of the lot, playing a sleaze ball called Fletcher, who seems to have dirt on everyone ;) I won't spoil the story of the film, but I will certainly be recommending anyone to watch this fantastic British crime comedy, that's worth the 2 hours of your life. Don't miss out, superb movie.", "Guess I just didn't get it...": "To be fair I will say I took a friend to the movie and about 30 minutes and I could already see him tossing and turning. About 40 minutes and he turned to me and said how boring and slow the movie was. So this definitely affected my viewing pleasure. However I was also very bored, I couldn't believe how slow paced everything was. Basically nothing had happened 45 minutes in, and I for only the second time in my life walked out of the movie theater (The first being raising Helen with Kate Hudson)\nI may end up giving the movie another try just based off of so many good reviews/friends asking if I stayed around for part XY and Z?", "The story is common, but the way its told is very unique.": "What makes this movie good\n1. The characters of these story is vary varied and solid\n2. I can catch the definition of gentelement in every part of the movie without the movie itself tell it explicitely.\n3. Type of the movie that can be enjoyed by man and woman, because this is what we call equality, not the sequel charlie's angels.", "Cracking good fund - Hugh Grant is absolutely hilarious and Lady Mary Crawley is awesome too!": "I like Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam and generally enjoy most of the stuff they have starred in.But for me the main stars of this film are Hugh Grant, Michelle Dockery and Colin Farrell (and I don't generally like Colin - except for his Bruges movie!)Hugh Grant is absolutely hilarious in this film - I really wish he had more screen time. After his fun role in Paddington I think he plays villains better than the good guy!\nAnd watching Lady Mary Crawley playing an Essex gangsters strong independent partner was just incredible. I wish she had much more screen time as well.And Colin Farrells character is incredibly good fun too - really enjoyed every moment he was on screen.In contrast Charlie Hunnam's character and acting was pretty dull and flat.If you enjoy an gangster movie with some humour then watch this- time well spent!", "Fantastic Mystery Twist": "Fantastic mystery twist in the movie. Highly recommended if you like gangster or mafia movie scripts.", "The Gentlemen Review": "Finally saw the Gentleman! Going in I wasn't very excited for this film. It's nothing against the cast or crew of the film, I just didn't have a desire to see this film. But I will say I really really enjoyed this movie! It's not perfect but it is definitely a good time!It's really hard to talk about the movie without spoilers but I will try my best.\nI really love the way the story is told in the film, they do something pretty clever that keeps this movie fresh and keeps you guessing throughout the film! I also really appreciate that the movie doesn't rely on action and explosions to be interesting like so many films in this genre often do. There is actually a lot of dialogue and character building. But when the movie does have action they do it very well.My biggest compliant of the movie is the first act. I was very confused during most of the first act and was a little bored by the pacing of the first act. But as the movie goes on it gets better and better. I'll give the gentlemen an 8/10!", "Great": "This is one of the best movies in last 5 years. What a play, what a scenes, Colin is great.", "one of the best films of 2019": "Honestly there are very few films that were better than this in 2019 - there was so much garbage released this year.I'm not saying this is Guy Ritchie's best work, but it's damn respectable. He has managed to assemble an all-star cast and they all delivered in stellar fashion. I really haven't watched too many Hugh Grant films, but he was great in this.Great plot, great acting, bits of humor throughout. It's a Guy Ritchie films, so you know what your going to get - and it delivers.", "Vintage Ritchie!": "Hooray! We're back in Lock Stock and Snatch country; thankyou Mr Ritchie. Absolutely brilliant!

Its great to see a return to form with The Gentlemen.Fantastic dialogue and rich characters interwoven in a superb story with no weak links.Funny, sexy, aggressive and very cool...The Gentlemen is a must watch.Note to Guy...still waiting for the return of Rocknrolla!", "Disappointing for Guy Ritchie": "Fan of many films by guy ritchie but this was a let down. Bad acting and a weak predictable story. Collin Fararrell just about saved this film with the stereotypical funny Irishman. Suprised they let bugsy malone (rapper) feature so much in this film too having his cringy song mid film and end credits. I am a fan of Charlie Hannam but he can not do a british accent to save his life. The role he played should have been an American character as the entire film he sounded mumbled and mixed American, Irish, manc, scouse and every other type of strange tongue making his character awkward to watch. Doubt I'd watch this for a second time.", "Ritchie is back...": "Great Movie..Almost a masterpiece! From start to end the film will have your attention and at moments you will be amazed.", "Slow and a lot of talking": "Wow was this hard to get through.....Tons of talking and background laying and very little actual movie. The first 30 minutes are excruciating laying the ground work. Not at all worth the time.", "Entertaining crime caper": "A skilfully constructed story of blackmail, betrayal and bluff, with enough twists and surprises in the plot to keep you riveted. The dialogue was sharp, sassy and very funny at times - despite the frequent profanity.As for the actors, they were all outstanding but I think Hugh Grant might have stolen this show. He was the best I have ever seen him, a completely different character to the fop we are used to.Recommended. Go see it.", "Don't expect Lock Stock or Snatch": "Guy Ritchie burst onto the scene making the innovative British gangster film Lock Stock & Two Smokin Barrels, following it up with almost as good Snatch & the under rated Rocknrolla before heading off to la la land to make Hollywood blockbusters.\nNow he's back to his roots making a new British gangster film The Gentlemen but unfortunately he brought Charlie Hunnam with him who puts on an appauling accent.\nHunnam's accent drifts from English to Irish to American, if he can't do an accent then why not makes his character American like his boss or better still give the role to the brilliant Mark Strong who has such a small role in the film if you blinked you'd miss him?\nUnlike Ritchie's counterpart Mathew Vaughan, who still makes innovative & stylish films , he seems to have been corrupted by Hollywood.\nWhere as Lock Stock, Snatch & Rocknrolla had style & humour The Gentlemen falls a bit flat. It's storyline is good with a few twists & turns but lacks the panache & punch of his early work.\nColin Farrell is brilliant in a type cast role, as is Hugh Grant in the complete opposite of his normal role as a camp investigator looking for a quick payday.\nThe rest of the cast are good with the exception of Hunnam's accent.\nAlthough The Gentlemen overall is a good film it's certainly no Lock Stock or Snatch.", "Funny from start to finish": "Forget the 'expert' reviews, this is a smooth and entertaining flick with all the humour and blend of characters you'd expect from GR. Echo the thought of others, Hugh Grant absolutely brilliant, but equally, Colin Farrell a scream too.", "Wow best film seen this year": "Wow everything was a tick for me - fast paced, great storyline, twists n turns, great soundtrack, clever filming and great performances. Surely Hugh Grant's best acting? Didn't recognise it was him!", "It gets even better the second time": "I bought the DVD based on reviews that compared it to Snatch. The first time I watched it, I was already tired after a long day, and had some trouble following the storyline. But, I then watched it again, and the film made more sense, and it really drew me in. I suspect it will be even better the third or fourth time through. There is A LOT going on, with the typical Ritchie multiple sub-plots, and it is easy to miss important elements of plot development. In particular, the performances of Colin Farrell and Charlie Hunnam are quite engaging. Matthew McConaughey IS the protagonist, although he plays the role in a somewhat atypical (for him, and for a Guy Ritchie character), very low key manner. But, I found myself liking the character more and more as the film progressed.This is NOT Snatch, which is hilarious, and full of 'BIG personality' characters. The Gentlemen is more subtle, the characters more intricate and calculating. But, it is very enjoyable, in a different way than Snatch, or LS&TSB. It is well worth watching, several times, in fact.", "Its Odd, But True. Hugh Grant Is Really The Best Reason To Watch This": "Oddly enough, and I am not in the habit of lauding a single performance, but Hugh Grant is about 50% of what makes this movie fun and worth watching. He portrays the most un-Hugh Grant type of character that I have ever seen him play. Some of his old mannerisms are still there but overall its a transformation. The rest of the movie is on par, I felt, with Lock, Stock (I hated Snatch) and has nearly the plot complexities of that film. Its just not a great movie, in my opinion, and has a loose, and messy ending.", "Good Crime Comedy": "Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, Michelle Dockery and Hugh Grant star in this 2019 crime comedy. This takes place in London where we meet wealthy businessman, Michael Pearson (McConaughey) who is thinking about selling his Marijuana plant to the highest bidder. Soon, things get intense when people star killing, bribing, and trying to steal from underneath him. Dockery (Downton Abbey) plays Michael's wife, Rosalind, Farrell (The Recruit) plays Coach and Grant (Nine Months) plays Fletcher.

Still feel like something was missing though", "Pretty good movie.": "Ritchie back to his roots and his best. Great story and cast. Loved the leads, Hunnam and Farrell especially gave it their all and stole the show. Grant was his comedic brilliant self. Maybe not as good as Lock Stock or Snatch but close.

The \"twist\" is telegraphed from the instant it happens and you're simply left waiting to see the details of how it plays out.Basically it's a redo of Layer Cake.Nothing wrong with that, but noting terribly original either.The best part is seeing Hugh Grant playing a sleazy bad guy who thinks he is smarter than he is.", "Guy Ritchie a hack c***": "Awful show. You need to have a double digit IQ to enjoy this. Ritchie goes the same way as Matthew Vaughn. Middle aged out of touch purile nonsense.I watched this and then The predator 2018 on the same day.

What a wonderful surprise to find a well constructed film with a good plot, great characters, sharp dialogue and great acting.

My rating 7.5/10": "I have always loved the work of Guy Ritchie who directed Snatch, Sherlock holmes, Lock stock and two smoking barrels. but his recent movies we're disappointed, with this Movie he regained his throne to comedy/crime genre. This movie comes so close to snatch.It is really a fast-paced movie, although it has a predictable story the way Ritchie presented it makes us curious to see how this is going to unfold. The writing is magnificent. Really stylishly directed with quick dialogue, humor, and fast pacing script. If you saw his previous films you will know what I am talking about. A joy to watch from start to finish.The entire cast gave their best performance. Matthew Mcconaughey shined with his acting, dialogue. Best fitted role in his career. Rom-com king Hugh grant disappeared in this role of cunning, hilarious, long monologues just nailed it. Charlie hunnam has given his best performance of his career. Colin farrell with his charismatic and hilarious performance he changed the mood of the film into another level.I really liked the movie, if you're a person who is going to offended easily just skip this movie.

Total English nonsense , no where near as good as Snatch and Lock Stock.", "Another classic highly stylized Great Britain bad guys romp from Guy Ritchie": "Writer/Director Guy Ritchie does his usual unique Great Britain style of foul fast talking, double crossing ruthless killer criminals that keeps you on your toes trying to keep up with just who is doing what to whom. The dialog is delivered tough and hard-line until the recipient has had enough and takes charge of the situation. Hugh Grant (Fletcher) has observed this bunch of outlaws from afar, then with that knowledge puts it in script form and confronts them to extort many multi millions to enrich himself. Ritchie is a filmmaker so the script form figures as does the many references to movie pop culture seeps into the dialog. It dazzles the brain to keep up with the mayhem while delivering a million British style one-liners to make you smile and giggle.

That's the best advice you'll ever get on this movie.", "A Bold Fruity Cocktail": "An incredible cast terrifically articulates a tasty cocktail of freshing humour, bodied with with witty dialogue and an olive of Guy Ritchie's traditional machismo. This posh English fantasy tail is phenomenally mixed by Hugh Grant's incredible acting-narration and helps bubble up what could have, at times, been an offensive mess, into an entertaining old-fashioned caper. The film sometimes lacks originality with some of its plot and joke ingredients, however fruity writing and timing helps deliver a nice smooth overtone. Charlie's Hunnam should note that Sons of Anarchy was his rise to fame, because he can play a gangster so bloody well. McConaughey held the incredible cast together, and Farrell was a nice sprinkle over the top. Unfortunately the flawless ensemble did expose Henry Golding as the weaker gentlemen, and for the time-being he may want to stick to rom-coms, but only time will tell. A terrific fruity and bold mixer, and definitely one to drink!", "Simple but lovely story!": "This movie is not very great but really acceptable as an action comedy movie... In my idea it has a creative direcrtor and good actors, so it has worth to watch once!", "Hughs that???": "Brilliant casting sees Hugh Grant and Henry Golding play against type as just two of the Gentlemen. Matthew McConaghey has a drugs empire that a lot of people want to take control of. Lots of double crossing and madcap action ensue. Tries a bit too hard to be clever at times but the great cast save it. Good fun", "UK ( A+ Movie ) My Ratings 8/10": "Excellent: Direction, Pace Very good: Plot, Themes and Tone, Acting and Characters, Production Design, Editing Good: Cinematography, Special Effects, Dialogue Fair: Score", "Alright, alright, alright!": "A Great movie for those that love quick and snappy dialog, with a mix of violence, a mass of twist and turns - As well as a balls to the wall pace.There are many reviewers comparing this to Snatch. And, I can see where that idea came from... It is a Ritchie movie after all but; that's where the comparative stops. This movie (The Gentlemen) is to Snatch, as Rocky is to Rocky 4... This is a sophisticated Guy Ritchie. A well seasoned pro. The actors are all master mechanics. It's poetry in motion...Great movie; just watch it...:)10/10", "Am I getting old?": "Watching Hugh Grant swear a million times does not a good movie make. It was obscene, truly. I switched it off after 15 minutes. Also glamorising Illegal Cannabis Farming in the UK is irresponsible especially since the facts involve modern day slavery. So in all I was truly disappointed, more so that I know kids will watch this and think it's brilliant.\nAm I getting old?", "What a disappointment": "Was eagerly awaiting the tv release of this film, read so many positive reviews. From the beginning was entertained by Hugh Grant's character but then failed to be entertained again. Switched off after 30mins bored. Such a drop from the magic momentum of snatch, LTATSB and even Sherlock Holmes.", "Typical Guy Ritchie, for better or worse": "I was not a fan of this movie at all. When you have such a large cast, it's hard to do any real character development. So instead, this movie resorts to stereotypes with the typical, tough guy antics. The result to me feels hyped up, macho, and low brow. Just lots of thugs using intimidation and violence to drive the plot forward. There's no clever plot here that I can see either, just madness and mayhem. I prefer something more nuanced and character driven.", "Treat in disguise!": "Now that I've seen it, I can surely say that this movie so perfect that it stands with others like the departed etc. \"The Gentlemen\" is a crime drama at it's best with one of the finest star studded cast and an amazing plot.", "Good film": "Not quite the \"amazing\" film I was led to believe it was but still a good watch. Enjoy. Hope you like gore!", "Matthew ruins it": "Matthew ruins the film, the mancannot act, uses the same boring breathless voice as always.I'd give the film a solid ten if it was anyone else.Typical gangster film from Ritchie, good dialogue and the stanoit is Charlie and Hugh....the rest, same old cast with different names.Can guy write anything else... nope and doesn't have to because people buy into his films like sheep to the abattoire.Best scene...Matthew being shot...sort of.", "Comical gangster malarky": "I really liked this film, a light-romp through fictional London gangster land, laced with humour throughout. Not entirely convinced by Hugh Grant's gnarly, camp investigative journalist nor Charles Humman's gangster character but it didn't matter as it was nevertheless a pleasure to watch them. Humman's tower block raid was a gem of a scene.\nThe film holds your interest from opening credits to closing credits, the action riveting (but not overdone) when it needed to be and the dialogue and character interplay clever, fresh and funny without exception. The finale is satisfying and, as Hugh Grant's character might say, \"I DO hope there's a sequel. With me in it.\"\nI might well go and watch for a third time before it finishes its run.", "Style over substance.": "Usual London gangster fair from Ritchie. Wanted to like this but found the caricature performance from Hugh Grant unconvincing and a bit of a distraction. Clever story telling format but found it hard to engage or care about any of the characters. The film also lacked humour which given the absurdity of the plot it needed.", "Absolutely A Great Movie": "We had a blast watching this movie. Great acting by the entire cast, and what a perfect cast it was. This is the the movie that deserve award recognition.", "One of the best for a while.....": "When I finish a film and immediately want to watch it again, I rate it as a definite success!\nThe plot, although straight forward, keeps you intrigued as to how it will play out. All of the acting was BRILLIANT! A particular shout out to Hugh Grant who has completely moved away from his typecast roles; so much so, you forget it's him.\nThe style of the film is very easily identified as belonging to Mr Ritchie and, as with his other classics, it doesn't disappoint.\nSo glad we watched it and planning on my next viewing before my 48 hours of Amazon Prime film hire runs out!", "This is a re-watch material.": "I thought that \"Snatch\" vibe couldn't be recreated, ever. However, Mr. Guy Ritchie did it again & all of the performances were outstanding. This is (almost) in the same class as \"Snatch\". I'm so glad I didn't care too much about some of the bad reviews. I guess some people are just c-word(s) :)", "Disappointing": "10 out 10? Seriously? I like Guy Ritchie's theatrical style of filmmaking which works so well the Sherlock Holmes franchise. And it was fun watching Hugh Grant in an atypical role. The whole premise of the film has us following the story through exposition. BUT I think after awhile it just became tedious. The were a few mild chuckles but nothing uproariously funny for a black comedy. Eventually I just got bored and if I hadn't paid to rent it online I would have turned it off. Worth watching for Hugh Grant's performance.", "Watch it...You know you want to!": "This is an amazing film that in classic fashion drags you along at the edge of your seat. I won't be able to look away as the star studded cast delivers amazing performances in this gripping Mob/Action/Drama/Thriller...Yes it has it all. If you liked Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Thinks To Do In Denver When You're Dead, Goodfellas, Casino, Heat...you'll love this one too. And if you haven't seen those other films...what are you doing reading this? You've got some movies to watch!", "Typical Guy Ritchie... Typical Fun to watch.": "No one does cross, double cross, triple cross like Guy Ritchie. And how does he do it? Very well, thank you. For me though, the best part of the movie was Hugh Grant. But he wasn't Hugh Grant. And I mean this as a Hugh(e) compliment...was it just me or was he playing Michael Caine? That was my first thought. And I loved it. Also, Jeremy Strong needs to be higher on casting directors speed dial. He's a Swiss Army actor. He was awesome in The Big Short. Not sure what to make of Charlie Hunnam's performance yet. He too needs to get more roles. Watch this movie.", "Farrell and Grant shine": "In this polished and twisted gangster tale. Vintage Ritchie, please will a brewer actually make that ale?", "The Gentlemen (2020)": "I think people were relatively shocked when Guy Ritchie directed the live action Aladdin last year, as it didn't seem like something that he would do. I liked that film but am selective about Ritchie's filmography. The Gentlemen boasts an incredible cast of suave gentlemen who know to smoke and drink in style. Its a loud and abrasive effort which is at times hard to follow but fans of Ritchie's British gangster films will eat this one up for sure.\nThe film is about a man with a cannabis empire and the people around him that want to attain it. The men get into odds with one another and things get violent. A lot of the film is told in an unorthodox way (mostly through a conversation between Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant). The film stars a multitude of stars who include Grant, Hunnam, Matthew McConaughey, Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, and Colin Farrell.\nThe performances are what make the film for me. Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell particularly are absolutely brilliant and memorable characters. The dark and often times offensive humor works very well for the most part. There's many words thrown out there and racial insults so be ready for that. My main issue with the film was the manner in which the plot was told. For me, no matter how much I attempted to follow it was easy to get lost in thee intricacies of what went on in the story.\nI think on a re-watch I would be able to appreciate this film more once I try to work out all of what goes on. I think if you liked Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels then you will find enjoyment out of The Gentlemen as it is in the same neighborhood. I appreciated the style and suaveness of the actors involved in the film but struggled to feel the impact that I hoped it would offer.\n6.5/10", "Brilliant film": "Excellent film Hugh grant was brilliant good acting and good story", "Easily forgettable": "I would say it's a film for the boys, watched it, nodded off, recapped again almost nodded off again and 3 days later writing my review I cannot remember a thing about it.", "A clever and well made movie": "I love Guy Ritchie's films. There are so many twists and turns in this movie it is sometimes hard to keep track. I found it especially amusing that it was about a group of Oklahoma billionaires. I'm the son of an Oklahoma Billionaire. This movie will definitely keep you entertained.", "Jep, it's definitely a Guy Ritchie film": "After Guy Ritchie's somewhat disappointing foray into the medieval fantasy genre, with his 2017 box office disaster \"King Arthur: Legen of the Sword\", Ritchie returns to form with the type of lighthearted British crime-comedy which made him a household name some twenty-odd years ago.\nYes, the plot of The Gentleman can feel a little meandering at times, mostly due to the fact that we as an audience are hearing most of the story told through an unreliable narrator. And yes, there are moments where \"style over substance\" takes over and it all seems a bit excessive.\nBut if you've enjoyed watching a Guy Ritchie movie before, these things won't surprise you and chances are you will certainly enjoy his latest work. The writing isn't quite as brilliantly snappy as some of his earlier films, and since the film does bear a lot of resemblance to Snatch in a lot of ways it's easy to draw that comparison. But in a landscape where Hollywood is pumping out mindless, unoriginal garbage at an unprecedented rate, I was just pleased that people are still making movies like these for me to enjoy.\nThe acting is good. You can clearly tell McConaughey, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell had a lot of fun with their roles, which sets a nice tone for the entire film, off-setting some of the more brutal aspects of the world of crime it takes places in.\nThere's plenty of laughs, double/triple-crosses, British gangsters being British gangsters. It's the complete Guy Richie package I've come to known and enjoy over the years.\nI would definitely recommend this one to any fan of the genre, as well as to those who aren't.", "\"A gentlemen's quote is a gentlemen's word\"": "Good Guy Ritchie flick about gangsters, drugs and betrayal. It was full of locks, stocked up with gore and had many smoking barrels. With all the bourbon Matthew McConaughey was drinking all I could think of was a joke. What kind of bourbon does McConaughey like? \"All rye, all rye, all rye.\"", "One of the best movies I have watched in a while": "A real eye catcher of a movie with the best scenes", "Watching an all-star cast having tons of fun acting": "This flick is so much fun that the all-star A-list cast would probably take half pay to be part of it (more about them later). If you were charmed by director/writer Guy Ritchie's \"Lock, stock and two smoking barrels\" two decades ago, you have a right for some expectations with \"The gentlemen\". These expectations are generally met. But first, the players in the story.\nAt the pinnacle is kingpin middle-aged Mickey (Matthew McConaughey), an American who has made it on dealing in weed (and priding himself in not succumbing to more harmful substances). Together with his loyal, capable right-hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) and loving wife Rosalind (Michelle Dockery) who is every bit his equal (I suppose I can characterize her as \"queenpin\"), he is quite ready to embrace and enjoy a quieter life.\nVarious power groups covet his business. Sly as a snake, sneakily scheming is Matthew \"The Jew\" (Jeremy Strong). Openly aggressive is Chinese underworld rising-star Dry Eye (Henry Golding) who is at the same time deep in an internal power struggle to get rid of the old guard. Perching at the fringe, with dubious allegiance, ever ready to pounce is \"Coach\" (Collin Farrell), is flamboyance Irish owner of a shady boxing club developing a gang of the fearless gang of the z-generation (or whatever you want to call it). Always lurking in the background with a camera is, the cunningest of them all, one Fletcher (Hugh Grant), prepared to exploit the situation in whatever way he can devise.\nOf the plot, subplots, deceptions, betrayals, insult-hurling, chases, guns, knives, poison etc etc I'll say no more. One interesting observation I like to make though. \"Establishing scenes\" take on a new meaning here. The movie opens with Fletcher going to Ray's house trying to make a pitch. To do that, he actually uses a film projector he has brought along to show Ray scenes of various backgrounds and situations. This dialogue evolves into the backbone anchoring the entire movie from beginning to end, as Fletcher shows scene after scene (which evolve from reels to notebook screens) purportedly useful to Ray's boss Mickey for various reasons. Who will come out on top is for you to discover. Now to the cast.\nFans of the top-notch the \"True Detective\" series may note that this movie features two leads from two generations (seasons, that is). Oscar winner McConaughey (season 1) who has portrayed a large variety of characters is absolutely at ease with the seen-it-all, hard-as-nail kingpin. Equally versatile Farrell (season 2), starting with his charismatic, late entry, is quite intriguing as the boxing expert who vehemently declares that he is not a criminal, but then plays along with the rest of them, and the best of them (thanks, Dolly Levi). Having the most fun must be Dockery and Golding, both letting their hairs down, so to speak, after their respective genteel role for which they are well known. Dockery, in particular, must be having a whale of a time with every alternate line utterance of the F word! Hunnam, totally underrated in today's cinematic world, has a mesmerizing role here, totally minimalist and soft-spoken, until he is not. Awesome! The gold, however, must go to Grant, in his \"intellectual reconnaissance\" role, who captures your imagination with every word and every nuance.\nA sample of the lively dialogue throughout the movie:\nWhen someone is asked if murdered the victim by pushing him off the roof, his reply: \"It was the gravity that killed him\"\n\"I'll be gone as darkness in dawn\" for a pinch of poetic touch.\nMickey asks for a pound of flesh from Matthew \"The Jew\", for a little Shakespearean reference.", "Can't wait for a sequel": "This is the best Guy Ritchie movie since Snatch.The classic british gangster plots of Ritchie scripts has fermented into a string of hilarious gags, fun chase scenes, and some contemporaneous jabs at societal ills.Hugh Grant really steals this thing, and so does Colin Farrell. I look forward to a sequel.", "Classic Guy": "If you love guys gangster movies, well youre gonna love this. That's all you need to know to watch this.", "Expectations were not disappointed: excellent cast, entertaining and nice screeplay": "I finally watched \"The Gentlemen\", by Guy Ritchie. The movie hooked me since the very beginning, the storytelling is on point, few action scenes are nicely directed and the acting job is perfect. Well, cast is composed by great names such as Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant.The strongest point of the entire movie is for sure the storytelling. The Gentlemen will uncover little by little the criminal empire built by Michael, all plots made by rivals to take over his business and there will be many unexpected plot twists. I am happy that still in 2020 there are directors that can genuinely surprise me. Transitions between different events are nicely done and help to create a cohesive and continuous story. Movie never lose his pace: everything has the correct timing, never felt bored once.It is not the best movie of Ritchie, but is very solid and for sure worth a watch.", "Being very generous with the rating considering the rarity of good movies made nowadays": "This movie is more like a journey, an experience which you go through in reverse.This movies boosts of well scripted characters which play small but vital roles in the movie.All the actors have done justice to their roles Mathew is intense as usual. Movie will keep you glued to the screen as the the twists and turns of the movie unfolds.Must watch highly recommended.", "Take it's too lightly movie": "It's entertaining but can't catch up the fast pace, imagination story telling,messy switch scenes. it's not funny at all, frivolous character. It's try to show everyone it's cool and gentlemen to become a drug dealer which I find it absurd .A bit like Goodfellas movie but Goodfellas far more better than Gentlemen.Goodfellas dare to play to it's extreme ,not like the half way gentlemen.", "Guy Ritchie is Back": "Awesome movie great acting and great story\nHope there is many more movies like this to come", "A good film to start the decade": "The Gentlemen marks the return of Guy Ritchie to comedy-crime genre, after almost a decade of absence. The screenplay was brilliantly written, with its witty dialogues ( mostly owing to Hugh Grant's extraordinary performance) and plot twists deserving the highest praise. Subjectively-speaking, the film's suspenseful atmosphere felt like that of Knives Out (2019), although The Gentlemen is more pacey and lighthearted.However, its lack of well-choreographed fight scenes, while not a major issue, can leave a feeling of incompleteness. Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable film that will start your New Year with a smile.Rating: 7.5", "Wow I don't even write reviews for movies": "Well worth your time. If you like hateful 8, django unchained, pulp fiction you'll love this. I haven't seen a great movie that was memorable in a long time. Saw dragon tiger gate that was good. Saw killer Joe that was good. But wow this was great. If someone asks about a movie to watch I'd recommend this title for awhile now.", "Enjoyable!": "Less than the sum of its parts; cool action scenes, decent performances, interesting characterisations and bits of witty dialogue here and there, but the structure is deeply flawed and messy, and the plot is too convoluted for its own good -- I guess Ritchie thought his film is way smarter than it really is.What really bogged this movie down for me though is Ritchie's persistence to veer away from his early style which he presumably, to some degree, returned to here. I get that he wanted to return to form without making yet another version of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (both of which I liked, especially the former), but I'm quite not sure whether most of the choices he made here in order to render the film a refreshing feel worked together. Regardless, The Gentlemen is a good fun with enough clever touches to satisfy Ritchie's fans.(6.5/10)", "Good Actors Terribly Wasted!": "I had hoped to see a Guy Richie film on par with the wit and quality of Snatch. I was sadly disappointed, by a violent and slow-moving story of international drug dealing and drug dealers so wrapped up in their own \u00c2\u00a350 notes, they'd forgotten how the real world worked and were unable to cope when human instincts took over. I suppose this film would keep a gaggle of rap-loving, ganga-smoking post-pubescent urban kids amused for a while, but it hardly qualifies for quality crime drama. Come back Bullet Tooth Tony and Co! The British film fandom needs your talent!", "Gentlemen, well done": "A well crafted, fun, and very engaging romp- Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen may start out slow, but it finishes with more than just a bang. The film for the most part is acted very very well, with Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Collin Farrel all deserving some major recognition for their roles. The only performance I had a problem with was that of Hugh Grant's, who I felt was a bit over-the-top in the opposite way which Richie was trying to convey in the film, not to mention he is pretty damn annoying. Nevertheless, this fact, and the fact that the film does take a little while to get its own engines running, are the film's biggest flaws. The film can be very funny when it needs to be, and increasingly entertaining as the film and the world surrounding the characters we are falling begins to unravel. Guy Ritchie is able to balance all these tones fairly well, and it is this, and the fact that the film keeps its head after pulling so many twists, that I remain utterly impressed with it after my viewing. In the end, The Gentlemen is not Richie's best, but it is certainly something to be proud of, and is certainly worth a watch (or two) if you get the chance.\nMy Rating: 8.75/10", "Good movie": "Sir mathew is my favourite character after interstellar. But i am not giving review as per sir mathew. In my opinion this is good movie. I love fashion,style,looks. And its also a funny and i love this funny part. Its good movie overall.", "Crime thriller ends with a wimper": "This old school chess match from Guy Ritchie provides a roster of menacing and/or oddball characters in a furious turf war among London criminals of varying pedigree. Although riveting in places, this film ultimately works up a ton of momentum and then sadly pisses it away with a tepid, milquetoast ending.Although there are strong performances from Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong is perplexing as an effeminate aspiring kingpin. Inconsistent pacing in another debit. It is baffling how a film that labors so mightily with a layered storyline would ultimately yield such a flimsy, insipid conclusion. To put it bluntly, this one chokes. Not recommended", "Finally another solid Guy Ritchie film I can enjoy!": "The last Guy Ritchie film I enjoyed was The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. ( One of his most underrated movies if you ask me. And please don't bring up Aladdin that just had Guy Ritchie flavor, but was very much Disney's movie.) I actually didn't realize that The Gentlemen was a Guy Ritchie film until the opening credits and the movie started rolling. Because once the movie starts you know it's a Guy Ritchie movie. No doubts.At first I was a bit put off. Jumpy, jarring, and then click. The story gets it's footing.The main reason I picked up The Gentlemen was the cast. With some of my all time favorite actors and (sadly) only one favorite actress. (It's very female lacking overall.) Everyone was amazing and I kept thinking \"Oh, well *insert name* just stole the show! Oh, wait now they stole the show!\" I came for Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Charlie Hunnam. And wow, were they amazing!! Especially since the entire cast was, well, amazing! I did not know that the fabulous Michelle Dockery would be in this and she killed it! I feel ashamed of all the movies I've seen her in that just WASTED her skills. I want her to be in more fierce roles like this! Michelle Dockery is a true talent and I hate to see her skilled wasted. I wanted more of her character and loved every moment she was on screen!Once the movie gets going and the viewer \"clicks\" with it, the story is rather brilliant. I love all the tie ins from start to finish and the pay offs. Not to mention the themes. I don't want to give anything away. There's plenty of mystery, suspense, and dark humor that I just love!! Shocking deaths and viewers can definitely feel like every character's life is on the line.One of my favorite movies from 2019 and I wish there was more buzz around it! Not to mention for Hugh, Colin, Hunnam, and Michelle Dockery. Of course the \"star\" Matthew McConaughey (at least the face of the movie) was stellar as usual. I also think this shows another diverse side of Henry Golding who is really curating a solid portfolio of characters and skills. The script also shows it's all about the ideas and writing behind it.

You won't regret it.", "Not his best": "Big fan of Snatch, Lock Stock, etc., each of which I have watched at least dozens of times. Compared to his past films, this movie is just lacking in every area: direction, cinematography, score, script, acting, story. All just not up to par, not the quality I expected.I watched it in the theater and didn't like it. Watched it again last night, many months after the first time with somewhat refreshed eyes, and didn't like it any better. This movie just did not have the grit of past Guy films I absolutely love.

Though her lead is so tiny that Rosalind can only dispatch two of these miscreants with a pair of mini-rounds, fortunately this delaying tactic allows her husband \"Mickey\" to show up in time to blast Dry Eye to Kingdom Gun BEFORE he's able to get \"in like Flynn\" with Rosalind. Then when the Russian KGB is about to snuff Mickey with ordinary handguns, Coach's boys show up packing multiple military-style assault rifles to give these Red Commie Kremlin-sent killers the kiss off of Death. Maybe more than any recent flick, THE GENTLEMEN illustrates why EVERYBODY needs to lug around as many shooting irons as possible--the bigger the better!

This most certainly is not them. The story driven plot is mainly delivered by a camp Hugh Grant, which reviewers seem to be gushing about. I do not see why. Hugh did that standing on his head. Look, most of the acting was fine, I like Matthew Mc, I like Sons of Anarchy dude, even though he bodged his accent badly at times, sometimes London, sometimes Irish, sometimes yank. I liked Colin and the supporting cast did a great job, and I really like British Gangster flicks, with or without comedy. I think the real issue here for me was that the script, was not enough. Not enough flavour, not enough spice, not enough juice, not enough to say great film, but enough to say formulaic.", "Too clever for": "I joined confused dot con after watching this whatever it is. No spoilers here as I'm not too sure what was going on. Two actors stood out - Hugh Grant proving width and that he does haven't to always be a charming reserved casanova. Here he's the hand on the leg, slimeball and almost unrecognisable. Ironically likewise Michelle Dockery proves she doesn't have to be the jolly posh girl on a hhhhorse or a lawyer. Stunning as a nasty gangster's moll and as poisonous as a python ?Unfortunately it doesn't quite have the ridiculous humour of Snatch.

Admittedly, I went into this film anticipating a giddily in-your-face wild ride and initially did not know how to process what ended up being a surprisingly refined and mature bit of nastiness. However, I soon understood that even Guy Ritchie must grow old with the rest of us, which is something that he clearly understands as well. At face value, The Gentlemen appears devoid of sentimentality, but upon closer examination, one could argue that crime films don't get more sentimental. Honest either. It seems Ritchie, much like other seasoned auteurs, has reached that magical point in his career where he no longer caters to audiences, who are calling the film \"boring,\" or critics, who are attacking the film for being \"offensive.\" I would argue that The Gentlemen is neither, but rather the cinematic equivalent to a man of a certain age. It moves at its own pace, no matter how painstaking, voices its own opinion, no matter how unpopular, and flaunts its own style, no matter how pass\u00c3\u00a9. While not without its flaws, specifically one or two moments of unnecessary convolution, The Gentlemen starts 2020 off strong and potentially marks the start of a bold new era for Guy Ritchie. Sure, it's sexist, racist, violent, dated, mean-spirited, and countless other shades of deplorable, but it is also genuine. It proves that a punch to the gut can come from the heart, and I find that endearingly charming, like an old dog peeing on the carpet. Truly, never has such an inappropriate film felt so appropriate. Oh and what a soundtrack! B", "Really good movie": "Classic Guy Ritchie felt like a spinoff of Snatch. Charlie Hunnam steals the show, McConaughey is as good as always, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant were delightful, and pleasantly surprised by Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery. Overall, a great movie with a great cast and direction and I really hope there's a sequel or even a spinoff TV show.", "Solid cast with exceptional dialogue and story arc": "This is no doubt a guy Ritchie film. It's filled with sharp dialog, gangsters, London, and a multi faceted story. All the major leads, from Farrell's coach to Hunnam's character and Matthew McConaughey's character as ooze charisma. When each is on the screen, you can't help but be transfixed to see what they do next. The London slang further adds to the story. Great film, with excellent and unpredictable story", "Offensively memorable": "The plot is super-implausible. With difficulty, I sat through the entire, meandering thing. It starts off near the end with the suggestion that the main character is assassinated. But he's not or there wouldn't be much of a story. The storyline is convoluted with many plot holes. So, smart American has a marijuana empire and it's actually located underground, beneath various royal estates. And no one in government even knows about them or suspects them (yeah). After making his money, he wants to get out of the business. How does one do that? The prospective buyer is a stupid, American, billionaire Jew, with all of the usual anti-Semitic stereotypes, even including that well worn-out line, \"Business is business.\" It wasn't parody; it was totally uncalled for and grossly insensitive. I guess Jews are the only ethnic, racial or religious group left that is still okay to malign. Along the way, the main character manages to seems to antagonize every bad guy on the planet, one way or another, and with every attempt to kill him, his buddies just happen to be there to save the day, over and over. Perhaps this movie was an attempt at nouveau film noir. Perhaps it was supposed to be black comedy. In the end it's the kind of pointless movie you feel like showering after watching.", "watched 2/3 of it": "Boring brought to a new level. Bad accents, bad acting (female villain especially), flat story line. Could not get myself to watch the whole movie...", "Hilariously awful. Richie is stuck in the 90's.": "Guy Richie made a good film once. Since then he's been trying over and over again to make another one. Each new film is a little bit worse. This one is a new low. It's so bad it works really well as a pastiche. As if The Comic Strip' of all made a Guy Richie film.Directing by numbers from a numerically challenged director. But really it's the cringingly rubbish script that hits rock bottom.Richie really really wished he was a tough old fashioned gangster. He's not.", "Classic Guy Ritchie fare.": "The Gentlemen tells the story of Mickey Pearson(Matthew McConaughey). Mickey wants to sell his extremely successful marijuana business, in London. This leads to chaos, sinister plots, bribery, coercion & the likes, to steal Mickey's empire, no matter what the cost.The Gentlemen is a bloody brilliant film. Writer-director Guy Ritchie returns to his roots by giving us another London-set gangster epic, after Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(1998) & Snatch(2000). The action & chase set pieces are phenomenal. Ritchie uses his signature style of mixing hilarious & quotable dialogues, along with bone-crushing action sequences. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is spectacular as Mickey Pearson. Charlie Hunnam is outstanding as Ray. Michelle Dockery is amazing as Rosalind Pearson. Jeremy Strong is great as Matthew. Colin Farrell is awesome as Coach. Henry Golding is excellent as Dry Eye. Hugh Grant is awesome as Fletcher. The supporting cast is impressive. The Gentlemen is a must watch.

In short, The Gentlemen is awesome. It's a thrilling and fun movie from beginning to end. And yes, I preferred this over Snatch. I felt as if the story and various narrative twists and turns were more entertaining and interesting than in Snatch. The acting was great overrall with some shining performances like Hugh Grant's and Colin Farrell's.", "Utter gash - that's Guy Ritchie's use of words": "1 min in. Gash. 5 mins in. Utter gash. Terrible writing. Bad use of language. Like a 90's 12 year old trying to impress the cool kids. Only saving grace, it's not got Laurence Fox in it.", "Good acting but terrible storyline": "The film perpetuates several negative stereotypes. If you're a simple minded 'lad' you'll enjoy this film. Come on Hollywood change it up, we've seen rubbish like this time and time again I wish I didn't waste my money on this.", "Several lols": "The Gentlemen is excellent. Colin Farrell is hilarious as Coach, although his 'toddlers' and their rap video was a little annoying. Charlie Hunnam using his actual voice meant he avoided the baaaaad cockney of Green Street and was indistinguishable from the terrible Jax of SOA. This was probably the best I've ever seen Hugh Grant act. The film within a film felt a bit too meta, and some what of a trope, but I'm being overly picky.Watch this. Lots of lols.", "A Different Take on Usual Crime": "It was pretty good. Unusual twists (enough that I was getting lost/confused/caught off guard) to an otherwise typical crime genre movie. A bit of bloody violence (What did you expect?), but not excessive or overly emphasized. One less star because the scene jumps, although an integral part of the overall structure of the story, seemed excessive & confusing at times.", "Wow didn't expect that": "Friday night nothing on tv so head over to Amazon and I see that The Gentlemen is on prime. I had seen the poster and that it had been in cinemas previously. Sat down and thought I'll give it a go... OMG... best thing since Lock Stock & Snatch! The acting is brilliant with some real star quality. The support is fantastic with some memorable roles. It jumps a bit but this is no problem if you concentrate and watch. I will be watching this again soon to take it all in. Love the Bugzy Malone track (boxes of) Bush also", "Best Ritchie film in 20 years!": "This is one of best films in seen in ages (actually since Knives Out) and definitely Guy Ritchie's best film since Snatch. There are great performances as you would expect from a Ritchie film- the standouts are Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant who are worth the ticket alone. The story line is also fantastic and keeps you guessing from start to finish. You may get a strong urge for a wagyu steak and whiskey afterwards. I can't recommend this film enough- I will definitely be revisiting this film again very soon.", "Excellent comedy": "Guy Ritchie's editing aesthetics is already a creative model that is completely intertwined with the script. Photography may not be prominent, but the visual effects are getting harder and harder, and the dramatic conflicts become more severe. The film's black meaning is strong, the placement of the joke nodes is very systematic, there are many new ideas out of the wrong knot. The casting was excellent and the actors played well", "Better then Snatch!!": "Guy Richie back to his best. This film is way better than Snatch and was great all the way through. All the performances were amazing and loved the ending.", "I couldn't find any faults": "Good actors, good dialogue, good plot. It kept my attention throughout the film. Guy Ritchie is the undisputed king of the gangster movie jungle. Glad to see he's back.", "Great news for Guy Ritchie fan's": "Look, this movie is fantastic for people like me. If you're not a Guy Ritchie fan or been involved this world than you're not the target audience, so go back to your mundane life and watch superman or star wars for you wow's.\nGuy Ritchie, Thankyou so much for bringing solid movies for us audiences to appreciate, its such a breath of fresh gun smokey, whiskey drinking, UK driven, gentlemens comedy lovin - air. Never stop!", "The rappers/hip hop idiots ruined this movie": "I couldn't stand the young, rappers/hip hop morons in the movie. Everything else about the movie was fantastic. If there is a sequel get rid of the worthless rappers.", "Guy Richie at His Best": "Guy Richie has been a director that hasn't always blown me away in the past. I've been amused by his outings with Sherlock Holmes and quite enjoyed The Man from U.N.C.L.E., but I wasn't even all that impressed by his fan favourites, like Snatch. For myself, I see that's he's now on a nice little streak. I really enjoyed his live-action remake of Aladdin and I think The Gentlemen may be my favourite film he has ever done. Although it does get a little self-indulgent at times, here's why I believe The Gentlemen may impress you, even though you may need to have an acquired taste for it.The Gentlemen tells the story of Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a man who wishes to sell off his Marijuana empire in order to escape from the crimes he has committed. This leads to a lot of blackmailing and mistakes, which then leads to death and chaos. However, at its core, this film is about Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a man who is trying to make this story into a feature film. This element was probably my favourite portion, as it tied current events into past events, which made for an interesting experience. Sadly, that formula became a little self-indulgent by the final act.As I mentioned, Guy Richie, who directed this film, has a very unique style. To get the negative out of the way first, without ruining anything for viewers, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that breaks the fourth wall in ways I haven't seen in a while. That particular scene left a bad taste in my mouth, but I enjoyed the rest of the movie too much to let that be a huge detractor. From his witty/snappy dialogue to his hilarious choices of the way certain characters speak, he has certainly not lost touch with the types of movies he likes to make. For myself, this one just happened to work for me, more than any of his previous original work.From Matthew McConaughey to Charlie Hunnam (who is fantastic in this role), Colin Ferrell to Henry Golding, and the rest of the endless talent, The Gentlemen is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to the talent on-screen. I was actually worried throughout the first 20 to 30 minutes that it felt a little messy and that these actors wouldn't have many ways to shine, but I was wrong. This movie finds its footing by the end of the first act and never lets up. I was thoroughly impressed by the acting, screenplay, and overall editing throughout the film, that my complaints never ruined my enjoyment.In the end, The Gentlemen isn't a perfect movie and Guy Richie definitely pats himself on the back a little too often this time, but I would be lying if I didn't say I had an absolute blast. The dialogue came a mile-a-minute and it was either important to the story, clever for the sake of being clever, or simply hilarious, and I just ate that aspect up. The quick style of this movie won't be for everyone, but if you happen to enjoy that sort of thing, then you may just love this movie. I like that style when it's done well and it really worked for me here. The Gentlemen is a fun time and I recommend checking it out.", "Low votes are from bedwetters - it's brilliant": "I'm not going to write too much about this film because I honestly think the less you know in advance the better the experience as the film is unpredictable and filled with lots of surprises.\nI thought the acting was brilliant, all round.\nThe only negative reviews were added by pathetic soy boy cry babies who want every film to be politically correct and pandering to minorities and genders.\nIgnore the whiners who thought they were seeing Little Women... this film is for people of any sex or race who likes good acting, wit, action, excitement and who are not frail, whining crybabies.\nI give this film an unreserved 10.", "God damn if Guy Ritchie isn't still better than anyone else on the planet at making exactly this movie": "This movie has had me anticipating because he made King Arthur and that's is a bad movie and I was hoping he would have made a good movie and he has made a good movie. I like how they tell the story for the main storyline is flashbacks and they weave the real-time and flashbacks well. I love Matthew McConaughey in every movie and especially this one when he is the boss of a company and when he is slow-talking and his performance is very good in this movie. This movie has such a stacked cast and I loved all of the performances. Some of the action scenes are very good and it feels so smooth. The score is surprisingly good and I really liked it. I really liked the script but it is inconsistent and the script is just such so fun. There are some cliche moments in this movie and it is kinda disappointing. The movie is predictable especially in the later second act and in the third act and I really wish it wasn't predictable. They do flesh out their characters but I wish they fleshed them out some more if they did I would move my rating up more but they didn't.", "Lots of plot twists": "This movie kept me on the edge of my seat with all the plot twists. It had some funny parts, but mostly it had a very interesting storyline that got better and better.", "Warrants multiple viewings and earns it": "A confusing movie at first, but when the final scenes are taking place you start to piece together everything you watched. This movie is a film to see multiple times and I would have no problem going back to rewatch it. It's very entertaining and I would expect nothing less from Guy Ritchie in this genre. The major negative I have is the fact that the film seems a bit jumbled at the start and could leave you uninterested if you lose focus...however the film makes up for it and pieces everything together.", "Fast pace": "Went in with low expectations and was thoroughly surprised.", "Guy Ritchie is genius": "The man can't do any wrong in my eyes, lived everyone of his films and this is definitely on par with the rest of them, also hugggge love for Colin Farrell", "Don't quite remember when was the last time I had so much fun in the cinema": "The gentleman moves efortlessly from funny to intense to oh my god what is going to happen next to wow I did not expect that. Guy knows how to manipulate emotions of the audience and this is by far one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema in recent memory. It was also the last movie I have seen on the big screen before the pandemic hit, so sentimental value is strong as well.Must watch.", "So Good!": "Great movie. If you like Guy Ritchie films you should love this. If you dont like Guy Ritchie films you still may love this film because it's great.The writing and the acting are outstanding. Quick shout out to Hugh Grant for being awesome at not being Hugh Grant in this flick. He done good, he done real good :)Cheers,", "Star-studded cast with great storytelling": "The film has this spy-gangster story in a comedic tone with great dialogues and effective timing/editing. The cast is superb as well with McConaughey being great as always and Hunnam and Grant having great chemistry from top to finish. I think the best asset of the film is the way it was told - most of the scenes were narrated in a flashback fashion with perfect cuts of current scenes in between. Reminds me so much of Knives Out (another great film).", "Awesome!": "Only Guy Ritchie movie that I've ever loved. First time I watched it I thought it was good and better than I expected it to be. Second time I watched I thought this movie is sick.", "Ritchie's fourth 'cockney' film in 22 years.": "No idea why people slate the man for making this type of film. It's only his fourth. I enjoyed this film. More please.", "Gotta say this...": "The back and forth between Hunnam and Grant throughout the movie is what makes this movie over the top special. If you don't know what I mean. Watch it again. I'm almost at a loss for words at how their connection renders the movie down into their back n forth banter and witty comments with each one trying to outwit the other. Truly superb A++ acting! It felt so natural. Ty for this Guy Ritchie! Haven't seen something like that ever. You are a master of your craft and this movie is right there with your other masterpieces... Cheers", "Another movie hated by the demonic left": "Another movie that goes against the demonic control freaks that are the \"progressive\" left. Because of a little racism, they hit the movie with bad reviews. Because god forbid a little REALISTIC humour that actually does exist in the real world. Because god forbid the men out number the women in the movie just like in the REAL world of crime.

So, so sad.Plus, too much testosteronesStop overthinking it, Guy.", "This movie needs more attention!": "Entertaining from start to finish.

Throughout its run, I only became more interested in what was happening. \"The Gentlemen\" brought back the good humor that was present in Guy Ritchie's excellent film: \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", while creating a story that surpassed it. The characters and their motivations are intriguing, there are plenty of surprises throughout the film and every step of the road is entertaining. This is a great movie.", "Total CRAP! Better sit idle but do not watch this movie! i beg you!": "No writing, no plot just a pathetic movie! God knows what were they thinking. do not waste your time watching this crap! plsssss", "Guy Ritchie kills it": "He's back to what he does best - a good action packed movie with a fab acting from a star cast - especially Matthew Mcconaughey. A must watch!", "Suit up, The Gentlemen balances both style & substance like beauty with brain.": "Once in a while comes a movie that centres on a violent crime caper that will either make it or break it. Guy Ritchie's gangster-comedy, The Gentlemen is one that is entertaining as hell though it asks viewers to carry the load much higher than most of other commercial movies because Ritchie's style of providing information is skilled like a sharp shooter person.The Gentlemen unbuckles its load by telling the whole narrative with a real sense of maturity. There is an impalpable weight the audience has to carry during the two hours but the lumbersome feels as if it was afloat in a suction of vacuum because the narrative would keep you intrigued to the very end. The story is told in a uniquely satirical way that would unquestionably amuse viewers who would consider themselves as cinephiles. What wonders us is Ritchie is able to mix the satirical ingredient into the rich storytelling perfectly just like the prince who found out that Cinderella's feet is the most fitting for the sparkling silver high heels. However, the film bounces back and forth which is not easy to follow but as long as your mind does not detract from the real deal, you are along for the ride.With the title suggests a group of classical men, the actors' performance/character is the essence of the film. McConaughey's Mickey is boosted with the oh-so-handsome charisma that not only is indispensable for the narrative, but would also drool your girlfriend. Charlie Hunnam is brilliant as always, this extremely underrated actor proves that he's always got something to offer which The Gentlemen has provided ample time for him to rival against those who have the audacity to look away his talents. Fletcher, played by Hugh Grant is the main storyteller here, giving the audience directions for what's about to come while doing his best Cockney accent. Jeremy Strong as Matthew is in his name, a strong contender. This will probably be his breakthrough career in the industry. Farrell plays Coach, he is great portraying a cocky head slash boxing trainer with a handful of minions to hang around with. The only female here is Dockery as Mickey's beloved wife who acts in full shrewd and confident. Everyone is remarkable here except for one, Henry Golding. His character is not a memorable villain and the offering gets worse with his acting. With his irritating perennial lips movements like a sided-O everytime he talks in every movie added on top of his try-hard expression, he is perhaps the weakest link of the movie.An exciting part to talk about in this kind of films would be the action set pieces unfortunately, The Gentlemen does not offer much. With those that is familiar with Ritchie's past works (not Aladdin sorry), he is capable to entertain audience with frenetic action and violence. In his latest work, Ritchie's fans may be disappointed to see that the only actions lying around is assassination through targeted shootings. Not to mention that they are always served with repetitive style of negotiations before the action takes place, making it seems as if the movie barely has any at all.Which brings us to this part where the most exceptional thing is the outmaneuvering of one another to stay one step ahead of the opponent. Even greater when there are hilarious jokes to ice the ever-thicken plot as time runs out. It feels like a game of cat-and-mouse but it reveals itself in subtlety, thanks to the matured storytelling. The 'who is who' would keep you entertained 'till the end.First look on the poster and you'll see Kingsman. Second look and you'll probably say, this is a disguise to a Kingsman sequel. By the third look, everyone is already speculating the same thing like a link of wired brains. Ladies and gents, hold my beer. As shocking as it may sound, this is nothing like Kingsman. Nothing! From the storytelling, the action scenes down to the universe and its type of humours. Unless if you consider the costume design and some of the locations, then yes. In comparison, The Gentlemen makes Kingsman looks like child's play.For those looking forward on the costume design, you are in for a luck. Michael Wilkinson surely knows how to distinguish each character with each classic look. From the hair styles to the leather boots, he nails it! Not only The Gentlemen, but also Dockery as Rosalind is a charm beauty wearing that thick blazer suited with 1.5 inch circumference of golden-coloured buttons.Ritchie offers a movie about the men without focusing on the 'woke' subject nor does he care about being politically motivated. If one should care, then The Gentlemen provides the opposite of supporting the men... nor the women. It contains strong language that is offensive, racist and homophobic. Not to mention a gross sequence inspired by the debut episode of Black Mirror that is disturbing but deliberately hilarious.Verdict: Guy Ritchie proves again he is able to create an authentic storytelling, for those who are fans of his works would be pleased to follow the train. The Gentlemen is a work of art targeted for matured adults but not necessarily only for men and of which it has potential to be nominated for Best Costume Design & Best Screenplay at the grand awards early 2021!", "Avoid": "A friend recommended this, but advised me to use the handy subtitles option on Netflix. Once I saw Matthew McConaughey's name, I understood why. He makes an art form out of mumbling incomprehensibility. Not even Brad Pitt can rival him.Even with subtitles, the plot introduction made little sense. As Hugh Grant rambled on and on setting the scene, my mind began to wander. I like Hugh, and I couldn't understand how he had ended up in this nonsense.So after 30 minutes, I regret to say that I had had enough. Yes I know, maybe I should have persevered. But watching a movie should be about enjoyment, not strength of will!", "Worst Guy Ritchie ever made": "Absolutely terrible , don't even know to how begin. The only good thing about this movie is the wardrobe, such a waste of talent , the saving grace I would say is Colin Farrells character", "Best movie Ritchie has made since SNATCH": "We laughed and had a good time. Sure, his dialogue is often uncomfortably over the top, forced Shakespeare junk like a crack head trying to sound smart using words he doesn't understand, but overall a well written piece. The violence wasn't too tarantinoish. The plot was great with twists and turns. we had fun!", "Oh Guy Ritchie, what have you done?": "I didn't even realise this was a Guy Ritchie film at first. I spent the first half an hour absolutely appalled, thinking angrily to myself \"this is such a blatant Americanised rip off of Lock Stock\". I then looked up the film and realised it was a Ritchie, and will forever be disappointed that Ritchie has essentially Americanised a very classic British film.Love Matthew McConnaughey though (after he stopped doing low budget rom-coms and did some serious acting), and also Colin Farrell, so their performances have bumped this review from a 2 star to a 4 star.", "Classic Guy Ritchie": "Awesome movie, great acting and plenty of twists to keep you guessing.", "Good and entertaining": "A modern & stylish British crime/comedy/drama *ring Mathew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Collin Farrell & Michelle Dockery.

Just way worse.", "Intelligent Clever and Objective": "The Gentlemen is the one of the few best crime comedy films ever to be released. This film is directed by Guy Ritchie and distributed by SFX films. The film stars renowed actors including Matthew McConaughey and Guy Ritchie himself. The film was produced with a budget of $22 million and has grossed $110 million at the box so far.\nThe plot of the film follows Micheal Pearson played by Matthew McConaughey, a wealthy businessman who is been investigated by Big Dave, played by Guy Ritchie.\nMicheal Pearson is a marijuana kingpin who seeks to sell his business. Big Dave is an editor for the Daily print, a private investigation news outlet. The two clashed at a party but first time acquintance did not go well as Pearson refuses to shake hands with Big Dave. This gesture evoked the inqusitive spirit of Big Dave. He hires Fletcher, a private investigator to investigate Micheal Pearson's amicable relationship with Lord Pressfield, a royal duke with an addicted missing daughter. This brings Flecther in contact with Ray, Pearson's right-hand man. Fletcher's investigation reveals the dark side of marijauna business where vicious activities abound.\nThe film is racially balanced, giving it a warm global reception. The involment of Chinese mafia and gangs excited me. What I witnessed from this film is that, the East sees the drug business as a family legacy while the Western world sees it a an individual pathway to success. Fletcher's performance is fantastic. He was able to carry his investigation in a friendly and cleverly tone. The amicable connection between him and Ray spinned the film to its critical acclaims. Both parties were intelligent and objective. I really liked the calmness and timely eruptions of Ray's mannerisms.\nI have a strong feeling that this film will go down as one of the best Guy Ritchie's moments.\nI can bet my last coin on this film to be on any list of best original screenplays. Tis' a must watch film, what are you waiting for?", "Not a Ritcher oinker": "It's not an oinker or a stinker at all - need to watch it to understand that.

Even I was so bored in one stage. Movie just made me sleep! Not worth to watch!!!", "C+ (high 5). January 20' @AMC": "Too much setup with payoff that misses more than it hits. Nice moments here and there. Well acted. Unique style.

This movie should be for Oscar.", "A MODERN GUY RITCHIE CLASSIC": "As we know very well, Guy Ritchie has his own way of storytelling which always includes guns, drugs and a lot of action for sure. In this movie, he continues his tradition with an incredible male-leading cast.The movie has not a curious or thought-provoking plot just like all Ritchie movies but there's always really quality time in terms of entertainment.The cast is absolutely brilliant: McConaughey is always himself with his typical charming attitude and Texan accent. Charlie Hunham just looks like he got out from a Sons of Anarchy set. Besides, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell is absolutely hilarious as hell.The storytelling is a quite Ritchie style, has a complex structure but not deep, just as he always did in his every movie.In general, i really recommend this movie if you are just looking for have some fun, not for some more.", "Movie has pacing problems": "Too much dialogue. Slow burning fire. No climax. Sorry guy Ritchie but this isn't your best work. Great cast but a weak story with weak ending.", "Cristian Louboutin shoes": "I loved the CL pumps Michelle Dockery walked into her car shop but then the sequence when she leaves the office it was no longer the Christian Louboutin shoes oops....\nLoved the movie anyway", "Classic Ritchie...": "There is nothing new in this movie, but that does not means bad neccerserly. This is a good movie, fast and funny, with good script and very good acting.", "Fellow Ritchie's \"The Gentlemen\" plays like a fanciful story": "A yarn heard at the corner bar, loaded up with distortions and embellishments, where the narrator anticipates that you should take care of his bar bill toward the end. What's more, perhaps you wouldn't fret doing as such. The storyteller here is a scheming corrupt private criminologist (excess descriptive words, maybe) named Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who wonders in all he thinks about the meeting criminal-tranquilize master components working in England, and embarks to extort ... everybody ... with a screenplay he's composed, where he lays it hard and fast, naming names. Fletcher's screenplay is designated \"Shrub,\" bramble, for this situation, a code word for \"cannabis,\" this being a unimaginably confounded story about the \"turf war\" in the weed business: everybody realizes sanctioning is coming, and quick. The end days are near. The \"shrubbery\" ironic statement is additionally present, only for the laughs factor, and gives you a thought of the general tone.The players on board are an American named Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), who sees an open door in the grieving English privileged, sitting in their weather beaten houses longing for old fashioned \"Downton Abbey\" days. Mickey plunges in and cuts manages \"the toffs\" in return for being permitted to develop weed on the property. Discussing \"Downton Abbey,\" Mickey is hitched to Roz (Michelle Dockery, otherwise known as \"Woman Mary\" in \"Downton Abbey\"), a \"Cockney cleopatra\" (in Fletcher's words), who runs an auto body shop with just ladies mechanics. (More could be made of Roz and her business. It's intriguing, the impression we get.) Mickey cherishes his better half, and is prepared to resign from the weed business. Two adversaries develop as potential purchasers: an American Jewish extremely rich person (Jeremy Strong) and a Chinese-Cockney hoodlum named Dry Eye (Henry Golding). The special case is Colin Farrell's \"Mentor,\" an Irish person who runs a boxing club, who continues demanding he's not a hoodlum, despite the fact that he carries on reliably in criminal ish ways. Mickey's correct hand man is Ray (Charlie Hunnan), an unassuming man who appears as though a work area agent until you see him in real life. At that point he's frightening. The \"courteous fellows\" of the title is plainly implied snidely.How the entirety of this fits together is completely in the hands of Hugh Grant, who gives an unprecedented presentation, thinking about the conditions. The content, which Ritchie co-composed with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, messes with all the class tropes, however the abrogating structure is Fletcher \"pitching\" his content-of these alleged genuine occasions-to an undeniably frightened Ray. Fletcher is a parasite, one of those newspaper \"scholars\" who wants to be \"in\" on things, who considers individuals to be their notorieties for being expendable, who reveres clarifying the amount he knows, the amount he has caught with his bazooka-sized telefoto focal point. This \"pitch\" continues for the aggregate of the film, thus as scenes unfurl, with Grant describing them, it is just as the scenes radiate from Fletcher's creative mind, when in actuality we are seeing what truly occurred. Or on the other hand right? Fletcher is a long way from dependable. The whole content of \"The Gentlemen\" is extremely, at that point, a content inside a content, and this is its secret weapon. There's constantly one layer among us and the characters.I could have lived without the running jokes about \"clever sounding names\" (it's \"Sixteen Candles\"' \"In length Duk Dong\" once more), and I could have lived without the scene where an assault is undermined. The Jewish very rich person talks in a characteristically \"gay\" way (no other method to state it, he should drawl), and the counter Semitic generalization is everywhere. Perhaps that is the point, however it's a worn out point. Much is authentically interesting in \"The Gentlemen\" and much that is genuinely upsetting. These things felt motiveless and modest.", "Stylish and action packed but incomprehensible plot": "I will need to watch this again to unravel the plot but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this. The violence was a lot and trigger warning regarding sexual assault. The soundtrack is outstanding and I love The Toddlers (lol) and their rap and dance moves. Michele Dockery is elegant and fierce af. Hugh Grant looks completely different and is more interesting here than in The Undoing. Matthew McConnaughy (sp?) is very good and co-produced. Charlie Hunnman is lovely to watch. The brutality and violence is rough to watch. The UK take was refreshing and fun. The accents and Brit slang are great. Smartly written and lots of action and some fashion.", "Guy Richie back on his own track instead of Hollywood's": "This film was absolutely fantastic. The actors were great, story line was great (with uncountable plot twists that kept tilting the story to another direction) and the cinematography was amazing. best movie I have seen in a while i highly recommend.\nStick with it though the first 20-30 minutes are pretty confusing but once you get the drift, sit back and enjoy!", "Watchable": "Really enjoyed it.

It does get exciting in the end but an absolute waste of money!", "Expectations were high": "I'd give this a 1 if Colin Ferell wasn't in it. He is the only redeeming quality in this mess of a movie. Snatch is great, Lock Stock is great but this...this is just terrible. Proof: my brother likes this movie and he's an idiot.", "This film is perfection...": "Initial Thoughts:\n\"The Gentlemen\" is a poetic and romanticized masterpiece. Watching both on a small screen with headphones and a medium sized screen with TV speakers. I'm still left in the limelight of this dance. From an all-star cast to gorgeous camerawork this film offers a complete film for two hours.I enjoyed the complete aspect of the story in the film being told as a story for a film. In this regard, a narration of events for the future consideration of a movie being put together in our fictional world. With the story being narrated and subsequently acted out through each other the jump between past and present is seamless, and quite enjoyable.The camerawork was beautiful in my eyes. The biggest example that made the camerawork enjoyable was as follows. When a character was on the left side of the table there was space to their front, our right, and when a character was on the right side of the table there was space to their front, our left. This gave the enjoyment of actually going back and forth the table of conversation. Some movies tend to place characters dead center thus making the conversation work, but not entirely enjoyable.Lastly, the ensemble was perfect. Even with high profile actors, some films fall short, but for me, not in this case. The chemistry worked well and each character was definitive in who they were and what they represented. No one felt out of place and the range of emotion was brought to a front in each and every scene.Overall:\nThis film will definitely be added to my \"Must Watch\" list of 2020*. Storyline, cinematography, and character/actor chemistry was spot-on from start to finish. Although riddled with swearing throughout. I found that it adds to the authenticity I believe is \"gangster\" England. If you can get past the large amount of use of the word c*** then I think you'll be fine.Enjoy the show!*I did some digging and although the premier was in 2019. \"The Gentlemen\" falls into the 2020 awards season, and therefore I'm classifying it as a 2020 film compared to the 2019 stat in IMDb.", "Great movie, has the same feel as The Man From U.N.C.L.E.": "Great movie, feels very in line with Guy Ritchie's style.The cast is wonderful in here and packs some heavyweights, Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Henry Golding who all pull their weight. Jeremy Strong is also in this film, but his performance here is a paltry shadow of what it was in The Big Short.More importantly, the story drives enough mystery blended with action and proper pacing to keep every second and scene exciting and fresh. It's a wonderful movie that deserves as much love as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. does.", "Ritchie has lost it completely": "I'm not one to come here to write reviews but after seeing all the reviews here I feel I need to add my opinion. The film starts out with High Grant sounding like a David Williams, little Britton hard man talking to Charlie Hunnam doing his best Tom hardy impression. This goes on for most of the film with some incredibly weak dialogue which really struggle to keep you interested. McConaugheys character is very similar to his character out of true detective which is fairly enjoyable but nothing new. Now the rest of the story has a few entertaining moments and Colin Farrell is great but there really isn't anything else to enjoy. The story is trying to be upto date but just shows how out of touch Ritchie really is and you can pretty much predict the whole story as it folds out. Also the less said about the movie script ending the better. I really recommend you skip this film and save you're money. I used a gift card and still felt like I got a bad deal.", "Hilarious and Refreshing": "With a handsome all-star cast of gentlemen comes a comedic action filled story told by my personal favourite character, the witty Fletcher (played by Hugh Grant). I throughly enjoyed watching things unfold throughout the film with an ending that keeps you on your toes just trying to keep up with how it's all going to end. I found it very refreshing to watch something different and original, unlike all the latest remakes and sequels, so I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something different and entertaining to watch.", "What's not to like about this movie?": "It's probably the best movie EVER for Hugh Grant. He's funny, ad rem and develops his character as a likeable yet annoying and condescending nosy neighbour. Great performance! Then comes Colin Farrell - just superb. Dry and witty. And adds so much character to the movie. And Matthew and Charlie to tie it all together. What a great cast for this movie that is a must watch.It reminded me of the atmosphere in Lock Stock and Two sb and I had to think for a minute, but to be honest, I'm liking this one more now. It has replaced LS&2SB in my list of classics, as I'm sure this one will become one to remember and rewatch.", "Fantastic": "Amazing and perfect\nBeautiful and beautiful and beautiful and interesting", "Matthew McConaughy again.": "This proves my adage , that you should never watch a movie containing Nicholas Cage or Matthew McConaughy.", "Far from being worthwhile to be watched": "I tried at least three times to watch this movie, but never made is past 30 minutes, so I only can tell my experience about that. But it was boring, nothing that tried to catch my attention. During the 30 minutes I asked myself if the film I watch really is the same I am now rating, because it seems that many people liked that film. But I cannot understand. I have seen movies in the past that I think are far worse than the average rating here is, but this film is the one with the most extreme deviation. Is there somone making jokes and faked the ratings? As I am now writing this review, I am still surprised about that discrepancy. An I am surprised that well known actors, that I usually think the can act, have gotten into this movie. What did they like about it so that they joined that experiment? As I think most of them already have some money so that they can choose the movies thay act in, I am even more surprised. Is this an expensive extraordinary April Fool's Day hoax? Still wondering...", "Definitely a return to form for Guy Richie and Co.": "Now, if you've seen Snatch and Lock Stock, watch a One minute trailer for Gentlemen and you'll know exactly what you're in for. This is what Guy Ritchie does best. Is it mildly formulaic? Yes, but is it a fantastic watch? Yes! And I have to say, that's kind of the point when you're going to the big screen. In essence it's a story about a drug lord trying to get out, but can't, with all the classic Guy Ritchie antics along the way.I've read some of the \"critics\" on this movie and find that once again they're completely off the mark when it comes to understanding what audiences want. The nearly all male cast was on point. We know Guy Richie doesn't write compelling female characters (circa Rock n' Rolla), so why waste your time - and what's wrong with \"enticing a male-heavy demographic\"? The anti-woke jokes and witty dialogue were on point. The classic boxing ring side scene (and even the car trunk scene for that matter) proved this sentiment exactly - men cuss each other out of love, get over it - and was a much needed middle finger to today's socio-political environment (as other recent movies (The Joker) have also compellingly done so.) And finally, the spaghetti western meets London gangster ensemble was also on point. It is what he does best, so why fix something that isn't broken?For the so-called critics and toffs too blind to see something deeper, look past the realistically played London yobbos and see snapshots portraying the very real London class and generational divide. Look past the slapstick humour and see the changing face of London portrayed through it's changing music, it's variety of faces, it's changing dress sense, it's issues with knife crime, the destruction of today's youth potential by hard narcotics, the story of a gym coach training disadvantaged youths to be better and see that a woman can run a successful high end car garage. The obligatory woke nod had to be there, but it didn't feel as such because it wasn't forced (MU EndGame or Rise of Skywalker), but actually relevant to- and impacting the storyline in significant ways.Performances were fantastic bar a few minor accents fails, and although I was sceptical about Hugh Grant playing (gay?) gangster I was very pleasantly surprised! I'm not sure the very British humour (including it's cuss words/phraseology) will be understood by those outside the UK but am sure it'll be the reason this movie gets poor ratings. I loved the Toddlers, their intro and names were hilarious as was their fighting, acting and portrayal within London today. I thoroughly enjoyed the Easter Eggs; the nod to Quentin Tarantino style camera/film pull-back and on-screen scribbling, the parody of poorly dubbed Chinese films, the visit to Miramax, and the moment when Michelle Dockery (who plays Rosalind) had her Will Smith style MIB deadly-pea-shooter moment were all just brilliant.My only beef, a potential plot hole that came at the end, the shooting from the back of the van. How did they know where to be and who, how...? Maybe I missed something, but that seemed like a hole that ruined the end for me.Overall, a definite return to form. Classic Guy Richie story, done well, modernised, with a peppering of just the right amount of anti-woke and British humour to make you laugh from start to finish.Even my very \"proper\" wife enjoyed it.", "Near Perfection": "Guy Ritchie is one of those directors who makes my head tingle when I hear that he has a new movie coming to town. As soon as I hear his name, I immediately begin to imagine what new spattering of crime, English charm (and repulsiveness), violence, and asynchronous storytelling that will only become clear as the credits begin to roll... I will witness in theaters or at home. Ritchie's newest offering, The Gentleman, does not disappoint.The Gentleman invites a new twist this time around, placing an American in the starring role. Matthew McConaughey leads an all-star cast of action adventurists and comics, including Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Eddie Marsan, and Henry Golding, through a winding story of deception, violence, and backstabbing all in the name of business. McConaughey plays Michael Pearson, an American former Rhodes Scholar who capitalized on his uncanny ability to produce and sell white widow cheese (that's marijuana for those of us less educated botanists) and is now on the verge of retirement. As Michael Pearson moves to sell his operation to businessman Matthew (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's world begins to unravel in a complex tale that leaves you rooting for the heroes who would be considered villains in a court of law.Ritchie's film is a masterclass in screenwriting. The entirety of the story comes tightly packed as a screenplay within a screenplay, allowing opportunist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) to reveal the plot to Pearson's top gunman Ray (Charlie Hunnam) outside of tie and space.Nearly every breathing second of the film is full of A+ soundtrack, action, comedy, and unexpected twists. The Gentlemen is a rollercoaster and one of the most easily enjoyable films of 2019.", "Cast, Story, Dialogue and Directing at it's best.": "This is what all films should try to be.

It is just bar none. The actors gave great performances and the story was solid. Collin Farrell came in clutch and really added that extra umpf to the movie as well. Honestly, if you want to watch a movie with substance, action, and comedy...you've chosen wisely.", "A Guy Ritchie Classic": "Guy Ritchie supplies is with another exhilarating watch, the polished screenplay entails an impressive cast, all playing there part in a story of uncertainty. The plot begins with Big Dave, editor of the Daily Print tabloid, snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson, played by Matthew McConaughey, at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, mastered by Hugh Grant, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a Royal Duke with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled 'Bush') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000. Instantly confronted with a quality cast, Charlie Hunnam performs as an intimidating, tough figure standing loyal to Pearson, who's best known for his rebellious behaviour and greed for profit. The film is told as a story by Grant's character, with all other events in the past, his mysteriously slow speech adds a chilling sense to the feature, and his confidence in his investigation is rather smug. Pearson plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for \u00a3400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson introduces Berger to one of his labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson. As Fletcher's explanation speeds up, the tale experiences a transition, a turn of events from the comforting, successful life of Mickey Pearson. The Coach, played expertly by Colin Farrell, possesses a thick Irish accent and proves his ability when single handedly beating up a group of teenagers in a cafe. Dry Eye, played by Henry Golding, is brutal in his want to achieve the maximum in the drug business, informing to Mickey that the young will replace the old. Pearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a council estate where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Although Laura was then returned to her parents, she later dies of a heroin overdose, found in an emotional scene by her grieving parents. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his student's actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and in retaliation, destroys one of his heroin labs. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead. Dry Eye's manipulation is clear and his plan to become a drug kingpin is something he is close to achieving. Henry Golding doesn't usually play the menacing, merciless sinner, but engages convincingly. It is worth noting that as viewers we can't help but admire Coach, his sense of humour, cool nature and will to change \"The Toddlers\" into good people, his role is critically underrated. Unknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she run out of bullets in her two-shot derringer. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house. Fletcher's overall characterisation is ghostly, his conceited tone manifests his omniscience, surprised that Raymond sees out the story, we suggest there is still another chain of events to be released. Fletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him having sex with a pig, threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000, on account of the recent disruptions it had experienced, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a freezer, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a pound of flesh\" from his own body. As the film comes to a conclusion, McConaughey's character shows heroic actions in saving his wife and confronting Berger, his portrayal across the film as a whole is proficient, encapsulating the courage required to complete and finish his business. Fletcher, once again, approaches Raymond for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker inside his shoe during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold information to Aslan's father, a Russian oligarch and former KGB agent. Coach kills the two Russian triggermen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to Miramax. After his meeting, he gets into a taxi only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company. Director Guy Ritchie once said that he got into film-making because he was interested in making entertaining movies, who he felt there was a lack of, 'The Gentleman' is nothing short of entertaining. The process of telling the story through the viewpoint of Fletcher is magnificent. The film itself, lasting for 113 minutes, supplies fine acting, laugh-out-load one liners, and breathtaking action. The story is a chain of events, with one feature setting off another etc. The constant blackmail and schemes to undermine Mickey Pearson emphasise the seriousness of the drug business and how every figure is tied into the profession in some way. In the same spirit as Ritchie's kLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch', 'The Gentleman' grossed a total of $115 million in all territories. The already successful hit was critically noted for its racist undertones and coarse language, however, the excellent screenplay is positively seen as a welcome return to form for Ritchie.

His character seemed lame from the trailer but was a lot better in the movie. I would have to admit, having spent time in Oklahoma, I have SERIOUS doubts anyone from a trailer park there would ever apply to Oxford. But it's a movie. Henry Golding was very impressive too, definitely Bond-caliber IMO.If you know Ritchie, you know what to expect from him, I consider this likely to be better than Snatch, maybe even better than Lock, Stock.

McConaughey is McConaughey but that's not a bad thing and Ritchie's story precludes Matthew being burdened with a British accent. It's also good to see Colin Farrell doing something enjoyable. As always with a Ritchie film: Great style, brilliant editing and great music. Great good fun, beautifully executed and acted.", "Ronseal": "It does exactly what it says on the tin. Doesn't make you think much, but an enjoyable romp. This film improved exponentially upon Colin Farrell's introduction, and Michelle Dockery's performance is a highlight.", "Ritchie stays relevant with latest gangster offering": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMichael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is an American graduate of Oxford, who's built up a lucrative empire in the marijuana trade, and is planning to retire, with his partner Rosalind (Michelle Dockery.) His right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) has been approached by sleazy journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant), who thinks he's got the lowdown on a plot to overtake his empire, with Triad gangster Dry Eye (Henry Golding) at the helm, but the truth is more scattershot than he might have thought.Despite having made a name for himself in Hollywood, Guy Ritchie is still best known for his distinctive British gangster capers, of which The Gentlemen feels like an affectionate, retrospective throwback to. It's as if he didn't want to become detached from the formula that he set out with, and had to prove that he could still pull it off. The result is a serviceable, competent piece of work, though ultimately unremarkable, with a convoluted plot that does it no good.Ritchie has assembled an all star cast, ranging from American import McConaughey in the lead, and even established stars like Colin Farrell in a comic supporting role, while big British star Grant chews the scenery as a sleazy reporter, a subtle nod, no doubt, to his real life showdowns with the tabloids. It's all a big, glossy, polished affair, with the director's trademark humour still in dark abundance, just with something missing that means it doesn't hold up to his classic early work.In a day and age when crime thrillers have taken on a style all of their own, a new Guy Ritchie film truly stands alone as a particular type of affair. While The Gentlemen doesn't stand up to the quality of his early films, it's still a pleasing, darkly funny throwback to those days. ***", "15 minutes remaining": "15 minutes remaining before I realized it was Hugh Grant. I am waiting on the one Guy Ritchie movie that will cement his place as one of the greatest, if not best director of all time? As with all Ritchie's movie plot is complicated and laced with plot twists. If you liked Snatch? You will like this movie. Hugh Grant and Colin Ferrell standouts in this movie. Maybe Colin best performance since Minority Report.", "A return to form for Guy Ritchie": "After the awful King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and the bland live-action reboot of Aladdin, The Gentlemen feels like a return to form for Guy Ritchie. More in the vein of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch, this movie features fast-talking gangsters with interweaving storylines. Confusing at times, yet still entertaining, this is a film full of characters I always enjoy seeing on the screen, but hope to never meet in real life.", "Fun Flick": "This was a very fun movie, Matthew is stellar as usual. The private investigator, Hugh Grant, was also great.

This film follows Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and Ray (Charlie Hunnam) as they try to sell off Pearson's highly profitable marijuana empire in the drug territory of London, triggering plots, schemes, bribery and blackmail in an attempt to steal his domain from under him.\nThe ensemble cast is breath-taking; Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Colin Farrell, Henry Golding and Hugh Grant. I would've loved to see more scenes with Hunnam and McConaughey because they work really well together and bounce off each other really well.\nThe structure of the story is quite unique as the entire plot is being told like a story from Fletcher's (Hugh Grant) perspective to Ray. As the narrative advances the action starts to become full of twists especially with Pearson and Matthew (Jeremy Strong) nearer the end of the film.\nHowever, this film isn't perfect. In the 3rd act's sound design is way too loud so it is difficult to here the dialogue. Also, it does take a while for it to get off the mark but when it does it is great.\nOverall, I loved this film and it is obvious to see Ritchie's style bleed into every scene.

To like Guy Ritchie's movies is like liking my grandma's borscht - other people may not fancy it even a tiny bit, but I grew up with it and I like it a lot.What I'm trying to say is that if you approach Ritchie's movies looking for an action movie, say Die Hard type of thing (not that is anything wrong with it), you'll be disappointed and you'll not going to like it, you'd be eating the borscht where you expected the burger. But if you open your mind to my grandma's cooking, and give her culinary masterpiece a chance, you'll find all the intricate tastes and finesse you never find in minced beef. And that's The Gentlemen for you: all the ingredients that youd never dream of liking separately mixed together in one wonderful dish. The cinema at its best, intelligent, masterfully executed on every level: acting, directing, camera, editing, music, sound effects, all of it is just the way it should be and worthy of the fantastic cast and crew.Oh yes, and it's darn funny, if you dig that sort of humor, and I'd like to believe we all do...8 stars only because of the Snatch.

The Gentlemen. Well alright, alright!! The first 5 or so minutes were kind of jumbled, my universal translator wasn't recognizing the cockney language right away.

And now he's getting ready to retire and sell his herb empire, and he seems to be good to go, until some other interested buyers, or takers come into play, but when the cool calm and collected Mickey Pearson is pushed into a corner, well, first of all, you only think you pushed him into a corner and two he's gonna push back! Great movie from Guy Ritchie, more along the lines of Snatch than his recent gems like the Aladdin, King Arthur, Man from Uncle, or remember that time Madonna and him were together so he was forced by God to put her in a movie called Swept Away? Ugh... This is the kind of movie he shines, each character explodes on the screen. My favorite had to be Colin Farrell as Coach, and yes he is a basketball coach, and he does jobs for the organization and for fun beats up unruly teens.

A great story with a phenomenal cast.\nHugh Grant plays a writer that is trying to blackmail Charlie Hunnam and Matthew McConaughey. Hugh has written a script that includes real life events. Some he feels are dead right, and some he feels he may have given some Hollywood finesse. The performances are superb. The writing by Guy Ritchie is outstanding. I would only change a few things (like the \"fight\" sequences).\nA special shout out to Jeremy Strong. He plays the \"Vinnie\" character in \"The Big Short\" In this film he plays a homosexual thug. I forgot it was him at one point. Just unreal acting. Great job all around.", "What a FILM!": "I enjoyed this film so much...

Funny, bending and goofy story and good acting makes for success.", "Thoughts on The Gentlemen": "I had some expectations and doubts about this movie. The director Guy Ritchie directed some of my favourite films especially sherlock's 1 and 2nd movie. I really like some of his earlier works like Snatch and Lock, stock and two\nbarrels. He is one of the best directors when it comes to action for me. On the other hand I really disliked his King Arthur and skipped Aladdin. After watching the trailer of The Gentlemen I thought he was returning to his own style. Although movie reflects his style and narration of the movie could be considered as good. As a crime and mob boss movie it is not sufficient at all. Nearly all actors are very good in the movie but action scenes were very little and that's one of the biggest disappointment of the movie. I also expected some violence\nfrom this movie and it was nowhere to be found.\nMaybe it is not the director's worst movie but it is a very mediocre movie however its strong cast gave a very solid performance.", "Amazing movie": "I loved it. It's been so long since i watched a movie this perfect.\nBravo \u00e0 toute l'\u00e9quipe.", "Dialogue??": "Many people have mentioned that the movie is too wordy- it isn't. The problem is that nobody talks like that- you can get away with having one or two stereotype cockney geezers in a film but not the entire cast. The kids on the estate are the most realistic characters and they feature seemingly only as comic relief for five minutes.\nI don't think the acting is that bad but the words being put in their mouths were ridiculous and embarrassing.\nI managed to enjoy it once I got over the dialogue but it is another example of Guy Ritchie proving that he has the imagination of a 14 year old.", "Wow, great movie almost as good as Snatch.": "Guy Ritchie haven't done good movies in a while but this is really really good.\nSnatch is his best and this is not far behind, great acting and enjoyable movie.\nSee it!", "Guy Ritchie Back to His Best": "This movie should be rated way higher. It's Guy Ritchie back to his best, and for me The Gentlemen is every bit as good as Snatch and Lock Stock. At times the dialogue walks a racial tightrope, which I don't think has helped the overall rating here, while the C-bomb is used generously throughout. From what I've read online, this latter fact has horrified American viewers, who seemingly have not yet adopted the C-word as a staple of the English language as us Brits have.For any American viewer confused by this cultural phenomenon, I'll hand you over to The Coach (Colin Farrell) who hits the nail on the head when explaining to one of his boys that the word can be used as a term of \"familial affection\". That scene had me laughing out loud - it's also a perfect example of an instance whereby the script wobbles that aforementioned tightrope.I believe I loved The Gentlemen for aspects that other viewers hated. I'm sure what can be universally agreed however is the acting, soundtrack and storytelling are all absolutely on point. Special shoutouts must go to Hugh Grant, Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell, who were all especially fantastic. Overall, The Gentlemen is a must watch. 9/10.", "About \"The Gentlemen\" (2020)": "I just saw \"The Gentlemen\" (2020).\nSome ideas?\nVery good play of actors, graphics, music.The suspense was at a high level, kept me on my chair waiting for the next scene.A small detail - I liked that in this movie when someone doesn't pay attention 100% something bad happens. If you're not engaged, you pay for this.The movie was, to me, not as smart as \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998), as it was more complicated and harder to understand. Also, I really liked Brad Pitt in \"Snatch\" (2000) In here, I wasn't attached to any character.The only downside? It was a purely, 100%, totally, and a bit :)) absolutely logical movie. There were emotions in the movie, actors were living and immersing in it, the script and play had suspense, but other than making me laugh one time, I didn't have any other emotion.I give the movie a grade of 10, with the disappointment of emotions.", "Wow wow wowwwwww!!!!": "Loved this movie, everything about it from acting to direction. All the leading actors were amazing. Definitely recommended! A must watch.", "Not bad, but not as entertaining as the trailer and high ratings seemed to suggest": "There's nothing offensively bad about this movie, but its entertainment value is incredibly subjective. There's just a lot of time spent on either exposition or conversations where nothing actually gets accomplished to move the plot forward. It's then left to the strength of the actors and actresses and the writing of the characters to hold the audience's attention throughout the scenes. Colin Farrell, Hugh Grant, and Michelle Dockery were more than capable of consistently carrying this burden, but the rest of the cast and the writing seemed to get tired at times.Overall, watching this movie is a little like watching Guy Ritchie. If you really love Guy Ritchie it's quite the special treat, but otherwise not a very rewarding use of your time.", "Eazy to rate this as a 10/10": "Oh boy Just picked this up on Blu-ray from the pawnshop for only $2!

It all led to an epic ending that I just loved!I want more! That's how great it was!", "Worst film I've ever seen. Tremendously racist and sexist.": "Really bad, like old people doing a high school reunion. It feels like we're all in on some inside joke that only the writer gets, and it's not funny at all to anyone except them.

If you're in the latter category then you'd better skip this one because I'd say this is peak Guy Ritchie. I was absolutely hooked from the first few minutes until the very end, so much so that I only very reluctantly paused only once because I really really really needed to go pee!

If you manage to not get caught up in the convoluted and often very slow storytelling, you'll find that The Gentlemen is a highly entertaining and funny crime-comedy, with a perfect shortage of action that mainly consists of gunfire anyway, well-written dialogue and extremely memorable characters.The brief scene that follows after the production logos and makes space before the delightfully-done opening credits sequence demonstrates the cinematography and lifelike picture quality that remains present throughout the entirety of the film. This is a fun, popcorn-worthy cinema movie that audiences shouldn't be taking too seriously, but it's also a gorgeous, golden-age visual performance deserving of a nomination for Academy Award for Best Cinematography. \"Because it is cinema; it's beautiful, beautiful cinema\".And due to all the unique writing of the lines, the splendid performances and the fashionable clothing they each wear, the greatest thing about The Gentlemen is each of the characters, who are sarcastically referred to in the title. Hugh Grant gives his most distinctive performance, Colin Farrell is just hilarious, Charlie Hunnam is the coolest of them all, Michelle Dockery provides us with a badass female star and Matthew McConaughey is an effortlessly brilliant protagonist. Each of them have their funny moments, cool scenes or more throughout the film.To be clever and unique, the story of a rich American expat trying to sell his profitable marijuana empire is told through a modest little screenplay written by one of the characters, but this is a love-or-hate deal. Sometimes, the story can be a little confusing, where you're not quite sure how to make of what events are real and when they occur, and for others, it will be extremely boring. But if your brain can work out with this task and understand what's going on, you'll likely find The Gentlemen a very entertaining Guy Ritchie movie (recommended with subtitles).If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.", "Great movie forget the haters must see": "Great movie, keeps you on edge of your seat, great story.

One of the things that made me like those movies so much is how unpredictable they were. For example, you never knew what character could die on a scene or how he could die, and there were lots of surprises because of that. Plus, even tho some characters were clearly supposed to be more unlikable than others, none of these movies had a clear villain or antagonist, they just got into trouble with each other. Well, all of that is gone in \"The Gentleman\". First of all its not that hard to see that Matthew McConaughey's character, Michael (who i wanted to get whacked so bad) was supposed to be \"the hero\" and whoever was going against him was made the clear villain. So it became so predictable and formulaic compared to other Guy Ritchie movies. I knew from the start that Michael was never going to die no matter how much they tried to make it seem like that. Plus, his character was one of those characters where nothing could stop him or even put him in a bad situation, he just easily beats up his rivals and it became so, sooooo boring, when in reality, this character would easily get killed by another gangster. Also, the racial slurs especially against chinese people is so excessive and not funny at all in this movie, just felt very tasteless. The only good thing i really liked about the movie was the Coach and his crew, but they can't save this from being a mess and a disappointment.", "Funny, fast, ferocious": "This is a display of Ritchie's best bits. Screenplay isn't too glib; amusing and entertaining characters - full of the charisma you expect - and a couple of surprise turns to keep you on the ball.\nConstructed with a soundtrack to match the pace and tone of the movie, you're drawn into the \"now what?\" line of conscious that Richie is famous for.\nIt's not his absolute best, but it's up there.", "From ruffian to gentleman": "It is not only a return of Guy Ritchie, but also a novel. In this film, which is led by gang drug trafficking, you will see Guy Ritchie's familiar black humor and excellent control of multi-line narrative, while the unique narrative technique and the integration of Internet elements make the film Both have the gentlemanly charm of old-fashioned England. It also has the evil taste of fashion.", "Laugh out loud funny and fantastic narrative": "It is so refreshing to see not only something that is original out on our screens but also a welcome return for Guy Ritchie to take us into a gripping narrative within the british crime world.It's hard to believe RocknRolla was over ten years ago now and while Ritchie has delivered some wonderful films over that span of time, when I think of a Guy Ritchie film, The Gentlemen is the type of film I think of - and it did not fail to deliver.I truly believe that Matthew McConaughey is a brilliant actor and he absolutely delivers in this role 100%. What was a surprise for me was Hugh Grant. In an all star cast it's difficult to call out specific performances, as not one actor lets this film down.That said, Grant's performance in this film is something spectacular of it's self and should not go unnoticed.Overall this film is a classic Guy Ritchie style - if you like his films, you're going to like The Gentlemen. It will have you laughing out loud, gripped with an engaging narrative, and gasping at some of the violence (and again laughing at some of it).A must watch while out at the cinema. Go support original narratives - big or small budget, this is the stuff we want and need more of.", "Oh my Oh my...": "When I came to know a Guy's movie is out, I waited for the DVD release, and man, it was right to wait. Movie was superb as with his other movies.In the era of tragedy and despair in the world, this brought me joy and you guys wouldn't be disappointed either.Acting was superb as expected from the likes of Mathew, Hugh and others. I loved Mathew in this type of role and I wish he do this often.I am hoping there would be a sequel as I am highly anticipating a good action movie, as this was the best movie of 2020 so far for me.", "Simply awful": "Not sure how so many people found this film enjoyable.\nIt was painful , managed to get through the first hour in a roomful of my friends.two of them laughed at every swear word but the vast majority couldn't wait for it to end.Totally unreal plot and script.What possessed McConaughey to take this role-playing was beyond us all.", "Not seen a film this good in ages": "Guy Ritchie back on form, this will sit as a true classic, entertaining from the start to the end with plenty of twists and quality acting along the way.", "Its okay, but badly paces.": "It's Guy Ritchies Best since Snatch, it's where he is most playful and comfortable in a film genre he knows well. The Cast is perfectly picked, especially Hugh Grant giving a different but yet so funny performance. Sit back and enjoy 2 hours of a British crime drama, which doesn't take itself too serious If we hadn't had lock stock or snatch then this would possibly looked at in a more classic Ritchie film so don't expect it to be as great as those.", "Excellent!": "Guy Ritchie delivers another fantastic British gangster comedy! Everything you'd want and expect plus so much more. Colin Farrell is a gem.", "Very Good Movie": "Great cast and excellent in most ways. The negative reviews must be because it is about drugs - this is a quality film on all levels. Director, Dialogue, Plot, Filming, Sound, Acting - all very good. A little slow, but there is a nice twist in the plot when things get going.", "Amazing, just amazing. Period.": "I came to this movie without knowing anything about it and had the notion that it would be bad. Boy I was wrong. This movie was super fun to watch, through and through. The movie did not do anything groundbreaking or innovative. But whatever it stuck to was done very well that it doesn't really need to be the \"most influential\" movie it can be. I couldn't really see anything wrong with the movie, but I suppose I would need a second viewing to pickup on its flaws. But that alone should speak of its quality. A 9/10, purely because it's near impossible for a movie to be 10/10.", "Excellent movie!": "Well scripted! Actors were all on point! Deffo worth watching!", "A Masterpiece!": "Hugh Grant just plays the role of his life!! The story is well written with some great plot twists. The atmosphere, the costumes (suits, track suits, etc.), the acting, etc. is just on point. The dialogues in this movie are so delightful! A must watch!", "Worse than poor": "Within about five seconds of the opening moments of the camera panning across the inside of what is an ostentatiously 'proper boozer' I knew I was in trouble. Something smelt off. Then a flicker went off in my memory. Something connected. A vague memory that this might just be a Guy Ritchie movie. A few more minutes of wall to wall cliche made me certain. I decided to persevere, as Ritchie's films vary between the daftly watchable but instantly forgettable and the pompous and dull. I had hoped for the former, I got the latter. This film is dreadful. All the worst Ritchie trademarks are there. The infantile flashy 'look at me', gimmicky camera techniques, the tedious sub-Tarantino dialogue, the woeful acting performances squeezed like processed liver sausage out of a good cast, the macho cartoonish mockney roguery, all interspersed with the fortune cookie/spliffhead philosophy that really makes one ask questions, such as 'why the hell am I still watching this'. The entire cast are so constantly delighted by their own performances that you expect that they will turn to the camera at any moment and say - \"you didn't know I was this good did you\" before pausing to admire themselves in the mirror before returning dutifully to the script. But worst of all this film is just painfully dull. It takes a special talent to make something so incredibly ludicrous and hyperreal but at the same time so extraordinarily dull. For this reason I didn't even make it to the half-hour mark and, even though I didn't, I can still provide the following big spoiler - this film is very, very, very bad.", "Funnier than I expected!": "Watched this with my wife and we both loved it. Charlie Hunham and Hugh Grant were both fantastic, supported by a really fast paced and witty script.", "Don't Overthink It...": "Pretty much WYSIWYG here. If you liked the trailer and or \"Lock, Stock' and \"Snatch\" it's a pretty safe bet you'll enjoy this film as I did.As for overthinking it, ironically the film features the lead character as an Overthinker Ubermensch. Anticipation and planning make Raymundo more than Mickey Pearson's right hand-man, he's like the ultimate insurance plan. Very tidy too. But ultimately life is out of our control, much less that of the Weed King.McConaughey gets to play that Weed King, a stoner with stones....and an American invading the UK. Hey we here in the former colonies need something to feel a little patriotic about these days even if it's a fictional stretch, sorry.If you want to overthink besides\n1) the fact that god does play dice with our universe, you have no control\nthere's also\n2) a bullish endorsement of pot futures, heroin not so much\n3) a film major's thesis on homo-eroticism in this Ritchie trilogyMaybe wait and see if Guy fries up a Francis Bacon bio-pic with action adventure overtones. Or don't....in the meantime enjoy the crackling wit and knuckles here.", "Much better than expected": "The format of the film is excellent. A story, told through a discussion between two crooks. Hugh Grant, who normally doesnt appeal to me, is brilliant throughout the whole film.\nThis is a must see.", "Fast, slick and cool": "\"The Gentlemen\" shows the classic Guy Ritchie we all know and love. It is fast paced, action packed and fun. Every role is cast perfectly, the script is fun and engaging, the characters memorable, the soundtrack rocking and the direction is on point. If you are a fan of \"Snatch\" and \"Two Smoking Barrels\" than this is right up your alley and a must watch.", "Gentlemenly Entertainment": "Very simple review...if you enjoyed Layer Cake, you'll enjoy this. Its a funny story. The actors give superb over the top caricature performances of the characters. Its entertaining and amusing. Well done.", "Little action but great narrative": "The biggest draw of this film is the narrative, not the action.The story unfolds in a different way, which makes us keep interested in it all the time, it can become confusing, but in the end everything makes sense, even if it seems unreal that all this is being told from a single point of view. The little action is effective, since the scenes are well done and the blood looks very real, although it does feel that it lacks a lot of action to be more violent. The characters have decent development although some seem caricatured due to the lack of extensive development. The performances are great as it always seems like you are seeing the character not the actors. Most of the time it is effective to have a good time thanks to its script.I think it's a worthwhile film, especially for its well-told and well-developed story, it entertains despite its mistakes, mainly because of how unlikely the entire plot may seem.", "i seriously don't understand this movie": "I went into this movie with an open mind but I just couldn't grasp what the hell was happening or how it all came together. Not my cup of tea. I wouldn't recommend.", "Can tell it's a Guy Ritchie film.": "If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie films, this one is for you. Can really tell it's a Ritchie film, the sheer amount of profanity and style of film demonstrates it's a Ritchie film all over.Fantastic cast, but the standout was Hugh Grant. He really elevated in this film and his ability to use a completely different accent is top notch.Worth seeing this for the accents alone. Michelle Dockery and Hugh Grant nailed their accents.", "Really good, great Acting": "I thought this movie was a really good time,there are a lot of fun exciting scenes in the movie but there are also parts that drag.Theres a lot going on in this movie I think that's a good thing and bad thing,good thing because there's a lot of variety of entertainment but also a bad thing because with so much going on it might be a little difficult to follow the plot.The acting was amazing in this movie not one bad actor and to be honest not even one bit of bad dialogue.", "Just a bunch of has-beens measuring their ...": "But isn't always the case with Guy Ritchie films? We often say we can know a guy's ... size from the car he drives, with Guy Ritchie, it's like he's pushing a dozen fancy cars. Way too much overcompensation Guy! So a bunch of has-beens, trying as hard as ... to prove they're still relevant, by playing characters so gangsta! You know, killers, but polite at it. At least Tarantino has the cojones to be bad when he's bad, Guy, well he just wants to earn brownie points through crime, it's sad really.", "Wow!": "Super elegant movie with great timing and awesome acting.", "Why is no one talking about this movie?!": "I got to choose the movie tonight, it was either this or bad boys and let's just say glad I chose this one, haven't seen anyone talk about it. which is a shame, Colin Farrell & Charlie Hunnam were both superb while McConaughey was well McConaughey, it was a perfect role for him. I honestly can't wait to see it again.", "Crock of....": "I felt embarrassed for everyone involved. It was so bad I even felt embarrassed myself. Only Colin Farrell can hold his head up. It was like a parody of a Guy Ritchie film written by students. Mockney\ncobblers.", "Fantastic, Elegant and F***ing Cool!": "What a movie experience that was, the action, the comedy, the thrill, the tension, the twists, the characters. I loved every second of it, from the start to the end I was staring at my screen, didn't get bored one bit. It's absolutely one of Guy Ritchie's best films if not his best one. The writing is superb. and all cast members are so good, I loved every single character in the movie. Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, Jeremy Strong and the awesome Hugh Grant. I can't wait to see these kinds of movies hopefully in the future, there needs to be more of this style of cinema. 10/10.", "A Great Fun Film": "This film was one of those that came out earlier this year and actually made it to the cinema but I missed it and now I have seen The Gentlemen and here is my review for the film. The premise sees an American drug manufacturer looking to sell his business in London which leads to many different parties looking to get involved.Main Character\nMatthew McConaughey plays the lead in this film and you can tell he really thrives in this role. He is intimdiating and charming mixed into one to make him this interesting character, you don't learn too much about him but that adds a bit to the mystique to his performance and he is just fun to watch.Supporting Characters\nThis film has a big cast and everyone does a good job, Charlie Hunnam plays a big part in the film and I thought he was good. He has his usual gruff here but he actually had quite a bit of personality in this film and again he just looked like he was having plenty of fun here. Hugh Grant has a big role and he is brilliant here, he like transforms here, if nobody told me this was Hugh Grant I would not have suspected it at all. He is funny and sarcastic with him really guiding us the audience through the film and really does a great job in leading us through the journey. Colin Farrell is also really good in this film, he is incredibly funny and charming, plus he is a really menacing but likeable presence which adds plenty to the film.Story\nThe positives for the story is that it is presented and told in a pretty unique way which suprised me and kept me on my toes. It also moves very quickly making you wonder what crazy thing is going to happen next which is something most films can't do. However, the actual plot is pretty basic, there isn't much unique about it, there are some gangsters and deals and backstabbings that you aren't that unpredictable plus a few of them could have been cut out in order to make the better parts of the plot more interesting.Script\nThe script has plenty of quick witted and sharp dialogue, the humour is there to make these funny characters and add to the hyper reality that is on show. Though the dramatic dialogue was lacking for me, I wasn't sure why the characters fully cared about each other or felt there lives were in danger because the film doesn't take the time to focus on it.Style\nThe style of the film is great, it is ridiculous and over the top, it has violence throughout which is to be expected and as mentioned it moves really quickly which does keep you interested throughout.Overall\nOverall, this is a real return to form for Guy Ritchie and it is a great watch which is full of fun and worth a watch if you like this style of film.Rating - 8/10.", "Brilliant written, very funny! A classic Guy Ritchie story.": "Brilliant written, very funny! A classic Guy Ritchie story.", "A movie that is great to watch over and over": "Definitely hope Ritchie makes more movies related to this plot. A sequel. Possibly a movie on Raymond. Also a stand alone about coach and his boys. Would pay to watch all three...", "So good": "I missed Guy Ritchie! This is on par with his others. So smart, good twists, great action and a killer soundtrack. I normally don't like Hugh Grant but he was great in this! Highly recommend if you're a fan of Ritchie's other movies.", "Stunning film": "Great film. Hugh Grant was brilliant. Similar script structure to the film Scott and Sid.\nWell worth the watch.", "Back to the roots": "Guy Ritchie Returns to his roots, with a bigger Budget. It's a typcial Ritchie film with a A-List cast. It's fun, it's groteseque at Points and it has nice Twists. Still it doesnt have the touch films like \"Snatch\" or \"Lock, Stock...\" or their Cleverness but it is at least getting close to that.\nThe actors obviously had a lot of fun and that reflects in their Performances. First we have Matthew McConaughey, who is simply perfect for the role of an american marijuna farmer who tries to sell his Business and gets involvoed into a lot of Trouble with it. McConaughy's coolness and sneakiness totally fits that role. A great turn also by Charlie Hunman who really has a fantastic character on Hand with many different facettes and that is hard to figure out at the beginning. The greatest Performance however came from Hugh Grant, who is actually Award worthy and wonderfully Plays against his typical stereotype. He is the true Scene stealer of the Ensemble. Last but certainly not least we have Colin Farrell who absolutely fits a Guy Rithchie movie or character. Michelle Dockery also has her Moments but sadly was a Little bit underused. Its fun, sometimes a bit contridictive for its on good but good crime Comedy entertaninment with a Little bit of mystery.", "Very Enjoyable..!": "Worth watching for Colin Farrell's turn alone hilariously sincere ....a slightly dodgy accent from Hugh Grant but he does it with tongue firmly in his cheek and comedy grace. Charlie Hunnam (never heard of him before) gives a very cool performance throughout but the jury is still out on Mathew Mc C. In this as he seems to play down what could have been a much more vibrant role... definitely deserves a second viewing\nDefinitely a Recommended watch !!!", "Guy at his best what a flick": "This is one hell of a movie and in typical guy Ritchie fashon. From start to finish this flick did not disappoint. And the star studded cast beautiful. Colin you may have stole the show had it not benn for Matthew at the end that ending was great. Hats off gents might have to watch this 3 or 400 more times", "The Gentlemen - Superb!": "This was great! So many talented actors teaming up for the ultimate movie about the distribution of cannabis or to be put it short dealing done the right way. I really enjoyed this movie, i felt the story didn't seem silly, it was very engaging and i always love a good ole comedy and this one really hits the right spot.Charlie Hunnam, Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell 3 actors that I absolutely love, this is the ultimate stoner comedy which has tones of other genres. Such a great watch would highly recommend this to anyone searching for a positive review to go by.", "Guy Ritchie Keeps Finding Ways to Entertain": "Guy Ritchie returns to his roots (and strengths) to bring us another British gangster film full of wit, violence and stylish cinematography. It's got every element you'd expect from Ritchie, and while I would say it doesn't disappoint, The Gentlemen also doesn't quite live up to Ritchie's masterpieces like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch. By no means does that mean this is a weak film, I do think it was a stronger effort than RocknRolla. Hugh Grant leads with a fascinating performance as a private investigator who also doubles as a narrator of sorts who Ritchie uses as a vehicle to unfold and explain the story in a truly unique manner. Colin Farrell has some show stealing moments as Coach, and he seriously might be the best part of the whole movie. The Gentlemen is cool, fast and fun. If you've enjoyed any of Ritchie's previous work in the genre, you'll want to check this one out.", "Best movie I have seen in a looooong time.": "I had a little trouble understanding some of the dialog because of the English accents, but it was simply brilliant. I cant believe I have never heard of this movie. I found it just scrolling through movies to watch. I couldnt have picked a better one.", "Best \"Gritchie\" film?": "Got to love Lockstock! Got to love Snatch! Got to like(!) Rockanrolla! (the gangsta ones...)\nBut this one has got to be my favorite so far.\n\"You got to start investing in some parachutes. I can see a pattern emerging here...\"", "Ugliest (and least fun) of Ritchie's films celebrates an arrogant bully": "I found this latest Guy Ritchie concoction diverting but ultimately distasteful. His previous forays into Slapstic Noir at least stuck up for the little guy (even if the little guy was a criminal). This one, from the start, gives all the winning cards to the hero, a former Rhodes Scholar (yeah, right!) turned multimillionaire drug kingpin, played by Matthew McConaughey. He's an arrogant, menacing bully in a three-piece suit who starts out on top, punishes everyone who tries to get in his way, and ends up... on top. (And if he's not repellent enough, he has a particularly repellent wife.)No one who opposes the hero gets away with it. For some reason, McConaughey's enemies in the film never seem to surround themselves with enough protection, even though they're involved in drug deals with hundreds of millions of pounds at stake. Two key characters who've tried to outsmart him simply walk unguarded into his trap, sans bodyguards, as if they're just asking to be punished. A hostile tabloid owner is easily kidnapped, drugged, and humiliated. And London's top Chinese crime lord is caught sipping tea alone in a pub like a sitting duck, so that he can be taught a lesson when McConaughey simply strolls into the room with a pair of thugs in tow.The moral is that might makes right - which makes for a fairly unsatisfying two hours.", "Old School Guy Ritchie": "Harking back to films like Rock 'n Rolla, Lock, Stock and two Smoking Barrells, and Snatch, Guy Richie has come back to the movie style that we all love. The Gentlemen has stars, a well-witten script, and the snarky, sideways humor we have come to expect from a Guy Ritchie film. Getting back to his roots is the smartest thing he did since divorcing Madonna.\nYou will stay interested and laugh inside and outside.", "classic Guy Rutchie": "Even if you don't know who the director of The Gentlemen is, at a certain point it will become obvious it is a Guy Ritchie film. There is nothing essentially new here, he borrows from his previous movies, yet manages to delivers a fine flick. But this is not bad in itself. Heck, Christopher Nolan, the current champion of \"smart\" action thrillers, rehashed his complete filmography and made Tenet which, in turn, was supposed to save the cinema in the post-Covid world.Anyhow, The Gentlemen is fun and accessible. Matthew McConaughey even toned down his southern drawl for the occasion. And if you're looking for something to complain about, it would be the performance of Jeremy Strong. Unlike what his surname might imply, he delivers such a weak performance that it made me wonder how he manages to make a living as an actor.", "It was alright.": "Nice nod to The Long Good Friday with the car scene at the end.

The whole film until I watched was about people swearing with disgusting words without any item related to cinema. Great job.", "The typical untypical Guy Ritchie": "The Gentlemen is mostly stands out throughout its original and great way to tell a story. Like back in times where Ritchie directed \"Snatch\" or \"Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels\" this movie is entertaining in so many ways. It is funny, it is bloody and it is weird (just as you know him from his later movies). The dialogues are also just as awesome as the world-building Ritchie does. All in all this is no special flick but it is a wonderful surprise for all those Guy Ritchie fans who were disappointed with his last works.", "Gulity Pleasure.": "Exceptionally entertaining, full of stand-out performances from great actors - too many to even pick out the best. Funny and clever, arch and self-conscious without becoming pretentious or convoluted. Even die hard Ritchie fans will admit he hasn't always been hitting it out of the park in recent years, but this story feels comfortingly familiar (think Snatch) without being just a rehash. The \"single malt and wagyu\" privileged sensibilities will rub some the wrong way, and it walks a line with some very un-woke humour, but if we can't laugh at ethnic stereotypes (including our own), we are much impoverished. I loved it.", "Don't think too much about the logistics of the movie but the story.": "Twice now has Guy Ritchie amazed me. First Man from U.N.C.L.E. and now The Gentlemen. The title itself is ironic. Since none of them are really gentle...rather they dress and carry themselves as such.Can I just say Ray's relationship with his boss is the kind of loyalty I enjoyed seeing in this movie. They both have mutual respect and care for each other and you can see that when Ray talks to his boss and how Ray's house well...outdoor steak grill? The boss knows how to take care of his most trusted \"assistant?\"Smart. With a few comedy scenes that takes a fast thinking mind to catch up.\nMore talking less action. Which was what I was expecting since I didn't perceive this movie as 'The Kingsman' type of movie.\nAt least I wasn't confused when Fletcher kept going back and forth from the past to explaining his story to Ray.Enter the cinema thinking like a detective who-dun-it?\nLeave entertained and a little relieved that no table is left un-turned.", "That's the Sheeet!!": "What a movie my imdb friend,no words for Guy..and of course for the whole cast!!!", "Epic!

Well, I'm not talking about 'loving' or 'hating' Ritchie's films, but let's be frank: he's not going to go down as one of the world's greatest filmmakers, so you are either amused by Guy Ritchie's schtick or you find it increasingly irritating.Me, I tend to like it, even though his various hits (and there have been one or two misses) are pretty much the same film over again. But then they say that 'it's not the joke, but the way you tell it'. And Ritchie has patented an entertaining way of telling what, let's again be frank, are nothing but shaggy dog stories.It would be pointless to outline 'the story' of the film, because 'the story' is totally irrelevant. It's how Ritchie tells 'em which does the biz. And, oh well, I don't doubt my credibility will now go down the pan, but I like how he tells 'em.His cast all turn in very entertaining performances, there are more than enough slick lines and turns of phrase to satisfy and it - as usual - rolls along nicely. The confusion is eventually sorted out. All you have to do is hang in there.As for that cast, special mention should go to Hugh Grant who plays totally against type as a sleazy, gay, murky, East London hack who takes it into his head to try to blackmail Matthew McConaughey's cannabis big shot, and who is not quite as clever as he thinks he is.As usual user reviews say this is 10/10 'brilliant, man' or that it's 1/10 'complete trash'. It's neither: it's unpretentious, entertaining Ritchie fare. And, and as I say, you either go for it or you don't. If you like his schtick, this is very much your bag so watch it.

I quit watching this movie more than halfway through just couldn't stomach anymore. Perhaps others like this style but it was too chopped up for me and all over the place. It never grabbed me or kept me interested. I might come back and see if there was something wrong with me that night but I doubt it. I really like Hugh Grant and I was looking forward to his part in the movie but that too was a disappointment because the English man that he portrayed was evidently from the backwoods of London and it made him look and sound stupid. Matthew is always good at playing anything sleazy because it seems to come natural to him and he didn't disappoint.", "Guy is back.": "I was convinced that Guy Ritchie would never go back to his origins and was lost to Hollywood blockbusters.

I thought the plot was very intriguing, only downside was that it was hard to follow at times for me, but I understood what was going on eventually. I thought the action scenes were good and made the movie more thrilling and interesting to watch. There were also a few funny moments, including some jokes that might not be considered politically correct, but I thought it was good to hear those types of jokes in this day and age.

Good humour, a lot of plot twist and fair amount of action.", "Super boring": "Yeah, the title says it. Guess it's not my cup of tea.", "Of Coarse the Critics Hate It": "The best part about Guy Ritchie as a film maker is not his directing, but his screenwriting. And in The Gentlemen, he writes one of his smartest films. The screenplay is so clever and there's so many layers to it. The acting is great too; the cast has insane talent. The pacing was very smart and consistent, which really makes The Gentlemen watchable.The plot is very Guy Ritchie, you've got gangsters, drugs, and pigs. Guy Ritchie's films are very similar and they become predictable, so Guy Ritchie adds a death scene at the beginning, to then add a twist. Guy Ritchie's self awareness and brilliance is what made The Gentlemen stand out. The pacing is so consistently good, and I was always hooked to the plot. The story is narrated by a real time conversation through two characters; and this type of story telling is a hit or miss, but it works so well in The Gentlemen. I don't think any other screenwriter can do as good a job as Guy Ritchie in The Gentlemen.The cast is a big selling point in Guy Ritchie movies and it's no different here. Mathew McConaughey did a solid job and so did Charlie Hunnam. Unfortunately, I think the actors are more interesting than the characters. The only character that got a good amount of exposition was Michael Pearson. There wasn't enough information about Charlie Hunnam's character, Ray. The Gentlemen does focus a lot on developing the plot and not so much on the characters, so at least it was done intentionally.The Gentlemen was a solid Guy Ritchie flick, that's entertaining and likable. The screenplay is my favorite part about The Gentlemen, which is then followed by the great casting. The real thing lacking in The Gentlemen are the characters, which were poorly developed in my opinion.", "Pretty great film": "I went into this movie knowing relatively nothing, other than that this was a drug/gang-related movie & it had a great ensemble cast. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a fun ride with strong dialogue, great characters and memorable moments. It was my first Guy Ritchie film but I could certainly sense a unique style. This film doesn't \"reinvent the wheel\" or do anything revolutionary when it comes to crime films but it is a solid film and fun ride nonetheless.", "Is this the proof of fake reviews?": "I really wonder how many of these 10 star reviews are for real?\nWhat I can say is that if you - like me - don't like it after 20 minutes, you will not like it.\nThis whole movie is about storytelling the whole movie from a kitchen table between 2 persons, and for me that does not work.\nThe acting is medioker, I don't find it interesting, I'm getting bored.

I had no idea at all what the film was about. I was doing something else at home and needed something on in the background so saw this on Amazon Prime and stuck it on. Wow. Needless to say I didn't get anything else done as I got sucked into the movie. Hugh Grant is amazing. Who knew he had more to him than playing posh toffs? Really great performance. I'm not a fan of Colin Farrell but he was spot on in this role. Matthew McConaughey oozes confidence and smoulders alongside his strong ballsy wife Michelle Dockery.The plot was fab. The story telling aspect kept me interested. The main characters and smaller characters were all great. The Toddlers were great energy. I loved it all. Highly recommend it", "Blown away!": "Haven't watched a good movie like this in a long time. I was just blown away, seriously. Brilliant acting, the script was so good, and how it all came together, just brilliant.", "Funny game!": "The recipie:\nCut a little bit of \"The snatch\" (for obvious reason) with some \"The big short\" (for the storytelling device) and mix with a few \"7 Phychopaths\" (for the wierdness).\nCook for 1h53min.\nYummy!", "one up for the British Tarantino...": "...The would-be smart dialogue, would-be cool gangsters, the idiosyncratic soundtrack choices, the preference for style over substance - he is, isn't he?So Guy Ritchie finally managed to make a film linking the world to which he really belongs - that of huntin', shootin' toffs - with the gangland world of his fantasies. To be honest, the first aspect, with its moans about death duties and trespassing plebs, and its implicit assumption that everybody wants to be a chinless wonder, is a bit unsavoury. But this is less arch, less pleased with itself, than Lock, Stock..., and more genuinely fun. There are some really entertaining turns from some surprising people, most notably Hugh Grant playing a non-posho for probably the first time in his career. Entertaining though he is, mind you, his chav-facing (like Ritchie's) is a bit inappropriate: it seems as though his slimy character is a walking promotion for his anti-tabloid pressure group Hacked Off. Tabloids as the lowest form of life - really, in a film about drug lords?Still - and it's not saying all that much - I think it's Ritchie's best film. Maybe both Tarantinos are improving as they mature.", "Perfect 6. Almost.": "The Gentlemen is the same movie by Guy Ritche from 20 years ago.\nComedy isn't fun. Too much profanities. Starts slow, gains momentum. Same, same old. A terrific cast of soon-to-be old glories and the safe tracks of a known path save it for two hours of entertainment.", "Welcome to Britland, where tradition is money": "A story of an old gangster trying to get out of the gangster business. With the clash of the old money and the new money paying their way into the spiral of events that followed. This movie could have told the same way 40 years ago if it wasn't for the gaggle of youths who try and invade this movie. But me as a young adult never found myself connecting with any of them. Sure a great script and brilliant performances by the cast. But the old faces and old money don't make much sense in todays world of influencers and activism.", "Modern Day Godfather": "Different, but one for the current generation. The addition of narration was a brilliant decision. Take this review with a grain a salt, the movie isn't for everyone. Matthew M's better acting film.", "It's a Guy thing": "Glory be, Guy Ritchie is back on top form.\nThis is absolutely his territory. A Drug lord, rivals looking to take over and an assorted cast of wannabes. Filled with typically sparkling dialogue and more twists and turns than a corkscrew this is film making at its finest.\nThe director teases us with a sequel and I for one can't wait", "Simply brilliant": "This is why we love Guy Ritchie.The storyline is bizarre rollercoaster which is very entertaining. The action is a perfect dose. The comedy oozes from writing and the characters. The romance maybe a little underdeveloped but could be argued just the right amount.The actors shone (in this order best-next best/s)... Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Charlie Hunnam, Matthew Mc, Jeremy Strong, and the rest. Even the non-actors where incredible, I truly believe Ritchie is amongst a short list of directors that can allow non-actors e.g. Bugzy Malone to shine...their performances are so unpolished but brilliantly so, like a suede boot.The bloody soundtrack, Cumberland Gap is cemented in my regular listens (enough said).I wish every film he released was of this calibre but unfortunately he very hit and miss. I would say this is on par with 2 Smoking Barrels and Snatch, and thankfully way above some of the mediocre films he's made.A must watch for a fun ride.", "Really Solid Overall": "This was a really enjoyable watch, I honestly don't have much to criticise about it. The cinematography was good, some really interesting shots and all round solid. I did find that it was slightly pixelated and out of focus, I don't know if this was the fault of Netflix or my WIFI but it was sort of annoying, still very well shot. Staying with the technical aspects editing was well done and the soundtrack was very enjoyable. Guy Ritchie's direction was fantastic and I liked the story structure. What about the cast? Also excellent. I wasn't totally on board with Hugh Grant's accent but I liked his performance otherwise. I liked Mathew McConaughey and Charlie Hunnam as the two protagonists and I thought that most of the cast was great.My criticisms, I found Jeremy Strong's character annoying and I thought that the film could have been longer, after finishing I wanted to watch more which isn't necessarily a bad thing but left me feeling like there could have been another 30 minutes, specifically more action because when there was action it was really good, it just felt a bit few and far between. Still I really enjoyed the film over all and unless you have an aversion to the C word you'll probably enjoy the film.", "Guy Ritchie is back at it!": "This film just proves that Guy Ritchie still has plenty of brilliance left in him, and that his top form has always been met with these types of stories.\nCrime and gangsters is where his direction shines and his stories excel what is needed for the genre. He always seems to provide more, and yet leaves us wanting more. With a very clever script and masterful storytelling, Ritchie paints a charming and witty tale of colorful characters and funny situations that turn this into an incredibly entertaining film. Evidently this well-oiled machine works as well as it does not only because of Mr. Ritchie's outstanding ability to craft such a phenomenal piece of work but also the stellar cast that is featured in the film. From Matthew McCounaghey's serene and determined mob boss, to the awkward and calculating Fletcher played astonishingly by Hugh Grant, and the hilarious Colin Farrell, who steals every scene he is in, delivering his lines with such confidence and humour, which I don't believe is the character's intention, he speaks seriously but a lot of the things he says are actually really funny, which is something incredibly hard to pull without coming off as overdone or just plain fake. So kudos to Farrell, and the rest of the cast as well who give out splendid performances, which is hard to accomplish in an ensemble piece, but in this case, everyone is remarkable.The narrative aspect is another standout, which contains multiple layers and twists that keeps the story flowing freshly and creatively. I would go as far as to say that this is definitely one of Ritchie's best not only in the gangster genre but of his entire career. That's how great this film is: cohesively put together, a plot that doesn't tire at any minute but keeps you engaged and entertained thanks to its pace, clever writing, hilarious dialogue and spectacular performances. The Gentlemen is a no-brainer. Go watch it now and see what Guy Ritchie does best.", "Entertainment 100%": "When we watch movies, we want good stories, good casting and above all the precious 'entertainment'.\nTrust me it's\nnot Matthew McConaughey ,\nnot Charlie Hunnam,\nnot Colin Farrell,\nnot Hugh Grant...\nIt's the 100% 'Guy Ritchie' show.

The black rappers don't work...I get this is basically a Snatch remake and it can't be a verbatim copy, however, just no with them. Hugh Grant doesn't act in any movie rather he plays his smarmy, self indulging charmer and it falls waaaaaaay short of the mark here wherein he's intending to play heavy with some very heavy dudes.It's an okay movie if there's nothing else to watch. Otherwise, skip it.", "Well written and funny from start to finish!": "I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was! The performances are great, particularly Hugh Grant, he is nearly unrecognisable. It was fast paced, exciting and genuinely very funny. Henry Golding was also unbelievable here. My only criticism is the Russian story line was slightly tacked on at the very end. Satisfying and enjoyable, it's clever and never feels forced or cringe at any point. Loved it!", "The Return of the Ritchie Crime Saga": "I was excited for this one. Great actors, Guy Ritchie, and an R-Rated crime dramedy? It has to be at least entertaining!And I wasn't wrong.This has the noticeable husk of Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but it lacks much of the charm and the style that make up Ritchie's earlier, more rambunctious outings.The script is fairly tight, and the story is just interesting enough to maintain tension and wonder.Still, that signature Guy-Ritchie mind-bending flair is absent here, leaving only competent filmmaking in its wake.What's left is a fun crime romp with a focus on non-linear storytelling and top-notch acting.It's well worth a watch, but don't expect Snatch.7.5/10", "The Gentlemen (2020) - Guy Ritchie is a genius": "We loved Lock Stock, we raved over Snatch, Rocknrolla ws brilliant BUT The Gentlemen tops the lot by miles.

After it was heard that he decided to retire, various plotters carried out bribery and extortion schemes to steal his fiefdom.The Gentlemen is an interesting crime film from Guy Ritchie. Guy Ritchie is an expert in making movies full of thrilling action. The Gentlemen has an interesting story plot with a combination of dialogue in the form of a narrative to build film conflicts and a story plot built on the introduction and conflict of each character. In the end, we get the plot of the story interrelated and become a complete conflict. The film has a dense story plor. Interestingly, this film has an unexpected storyline until the end of the film. The various conflicts are neatly constructed and enigmatic so that we get a truly unexpected and unexpected ending to the film.Featuring an interesting cast lineup, such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong to Colin Farrell.

Probably not as good a story line as snatch and lock stock but still has those little moments of pure excellence.Second Guy Ritchie film with the boy Charlie Hunnam in after King Arthur.Always brilliant to see (and hear) Colin Farrell!Hugh Grant deserves a bloody oscar for his performance - it is so far detached from his personality it's outstanding - he's hilarious.Always good to see Eddie Marsan & the cameo from bugzy malone was refreshing.BUT I just come away from it being contented but not wow'ed by the storyline.Ensemble cast - exceptional, however the pace and plot could've been better.", "medium movie with great cast": "The Gentelman is one of this years gagster film that has good cast and the idea is interestinng, but the script is poor", "British Tarantino": "Thank goodness that Guy Ritchie is better at making films than his ex is at making records! This movie is a riot from start to finish, with laugh out loud moments, plot twists and engaging characters.I could go into great depth about the plot and the performances, but in reality, there is one excellent reason to watch this film - Hugh Grant. He is absolutely sublime as the seedy, blackmailing photographer, Fletcher. Playing entirely against type, Grant gives a career-best performance which will have you both cringing and laughing uncontrollably in equal measure.I've never taken to Matthew McConnaughey before this (I've always referred to him as 'The Mumbler'), but he does an excellent job here as cannabis kingpin Michael Pearson, ably supported by Ray (a hilarious Charlie Hunnam). Yet Colin Farrell pops up mid-film and nearly steals the show as a boxing coach trying to save souls from a life of crime.Taking in the UK cannabis trade, the Chinese & Russian Mafia, the British Gentry and the gutter tabloid press, The Gentlemen never lets up in laughs, twists and sheer entertainment value.It's a Tarantino-esque film for geezers and a must-see. Brilliant casting, brilliant script, brilliant character development and all set at an exhilarating pace.", "The Real Rock'N'Rolla Returns": "Guy Richie has been going through a somewhat renaissance of late, after 11 years away from the British crime genre he has finally had the faith to bring out a new adventure, but the reel question is will this drug-filled gangster flick have Layers to this Cake or be a total Snatch?I will be the first to admit, I didn't like Aladdin. I remember calling it \"the death of Disney\" I realise now that was wishful thinking. Disney is immortal. However, I can't dispute money and Aladdin made that, which is why most were surprised that it was announced that Richie's next venture (The Gentleman) was going to be something altogether more in keeping with his previous reputation.You can feel through the lens that Guy Richie is enjoying coming back to the fold, he uses every trick and joke to emphasis this. The entire premise of the film is that Fletcher (played by an outstandingly slimy Hugh Grant) is pitching his idea for a film to Raymond (Charlie Hunnam), something I am positive Guy Richie has done multiple times before. The story is complete with a reshoot of scenes (when Fletcher diverts too far from the truth) and even a comment about aspect rations for the picture. The title of Fletcher's film he wishes to make? \"Bush\". Something tells me that in a drawer in Guy Richie's house is the same title for Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels.It's nice to see that Richie has learned something in the intervening years between the truly dreadful Revolver and today. Richie has learned how to keep current with both tone and characters while keeping the more classical aspects of the genre intact. It's as if he has wholesale lifted characters from The Long Good Friday and transported them to the new millennium to face some of the more unexpected issues around. There is a moment where Raymond is faced off with several youths carrying knives while trying to acquire a mobile phone with incriminating evidence on, an issue I'm positive Colin never had to consider.The characters have too evolved with the times as opposed to the usual cut and paste hard as nails men, we are given a wide variety of parts to invest in. The most notable 4 are Raymond, Fletcher, Micky and The Coach. Each of these acts are unique, Raymond, for example, has an obsessive-compulsive disorder or The Coach who trains street kids to be better men both inside and outside the ring. These are troupes we have not seen from Richie before, he has grown.What has also grown is Richie's ability to tell a story, while films like Lock Stock, Snatch and even Rock'n'Rolla still stand up, you never realised how limited Richie's abilities were until they are highlighted by a movie like The Gentleman. In his previous work, it would be fair to say he is overly indulgent in a world he is clearly in love with. In The Gentleman, Richie chooses the high road giving us only flickers of the gangster underbelly while never letting up on the violence.The Gentleman is the perfect tonic of comedy, surprises, and outstanding acting. Like a good malt, Richie had to go through a few barrels first.10 Weeds out of 10", "A nice surprise": "After reading reviews my \"professionals\" I thought I was throwing my money away when I bought this movie.

I haven't enjoyed a Ritchie film so much as this one since Lock Stock or Revolver.", "Perfect formula": "Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Lock stock and two smoking barrels) excels at these crime comedies which ultimately end with no winners -only losers to varying degrees. Its yet another gripping film (though not perfect) with some very talented A-listers like Charlie Hunnam, Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell.You won't find many dull moments in this quirky dark comedy.

Definitely worth a watch.", "Back to roots": "I've just get out of the cinema. The Gentlman made 'The Gentlmen' amazing. Guy is the best when he makes movies about London's 'underground'.

The plot revolves around a major weed dealer who is looking to exit the criminal world....but will it really be that easy?! (Cinematic history tells us...no, it will not).The ensemble cast is absolutely fantastic, with everyone bringing their A Game. If you had to pick one standout it would be Hugh Grant who is hilarious and brilliant as the sleazy PI, \"Fletcher\".The way it's shot, is more traditional in nature, with less short shot collages, but as always the soundtrack is great, and more importantly the dialogue is on point! It has an impeccable balance between serious and satyr, all the way through...some moments are genuinely hilarious!

My opinion is fully slanted towards the favorable since watching Lock stock.To be quite honest, while this is is an original film, it's more of a slow burn rendition of previous London gangster Ritchie stories.The cast of characters each get their time to shine and steal the spotlight. There really isn't a \"main character\" and every protagonist an anti hero.Ritchie continues to show his theme of \"not that bad\" through MMS character dialogue about how his vice- weed- doesn't actually kill anyone, and tbh I have to appreciate it.The typical troupes I was yearning for were all there- excessive cockney slang, the anxiety of presumes violence (but only when necessary), and a 3rd act that has the serendipitous ending where everyone you rooted for makes it out, and the scumbag receives the sharp end of the karmic stick.I do wish there was more of Coach (Ferrell) and less Fletcher (Grant), but still loved it.My only wishlist item is that I'd woulda giggled if the narrator was Allen ford or vinny Jones, just to have a deep cut/call back to past films.", "Back to his best": "Guy Ritchie is back to his ls2sb and Snatch best.

The scene between Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery was filmed beautifully.

I suspect most highschool kids could write horrible dialogue that still was infinitely better than this. I kept trying to like this movie because I happen to think very highly of several of the stars... I even gave it something like 1 hr+ and yet instead of getting better it just got worse as time went on.If this is indicative of Guy Richie's typical movie, the ones he is currently making, then I'd happily skip anything he is attached to in future.", "Just all around criminal fun": "A must for any Guy Richie fan, and a must for moviegoers who appreciate films of the following categories: cerebral, dry comedy, British underworld crime dramas, Oceans 11-style heists, or just plain beautiful and talented actors.

Obviously this resonates well with the taste of the audiences, but I find it sad in comparison to Snatch, and Lock, stock. Those movies had better humor, suspense and acting than The Gentelman (with few honourable exemptions), and after 20 years all Guy did was a bleek copy. The plot is un-inspired, childishly inconvincing, and Mathew's character simply can't make it foat.\nEven the sterotypes in the old movies were exploited in a funny way, bit in this one they are simply worn out or straight out racist.\n6 stars is still border line watchable but I am disapointed that it gets all that praise from the viewers.", "Cant hide my enthusiasm..": "Well, this is an excellent gangster movie.

After one big flop, (king Arthur) which I sill liked, and a big-budget and definitely not authorial one (Aladdin), Ritchie returns in his safe zone with an extremely (for his career) canonical movie, it's frenetic, noisy, fancy, elaborated and it has his signature in every shot and every dialog both so sophisticated and studied that risk to be redundant as usual.\nBut here there's more talk and less shoot or punch and that's where \"the gentlemen\" find its problem: it makes you smell the tension, the action scenes, the climax but it never really comes or hits as it wanted to.\nIt's a bit a disappointment cause Richie is great with action scenes, he knows how to direct them with charisma and intelligence but, and this is how he makes this movie still be good despite the nearly absence of action and the underwhelming climax (probably caused also by some twist that didn't worked perfectly), but, as I was saying, he's also really good at makes every line, every dialog feels like a fun and satisfying fight scenes.\nSo at the end \"The Gentleman\" has his flaws and it could be better but even if it's not as good as most of Ritchie's movies, it's still as entertaining, fun and full of style as every of them", "Novel Approach to the \"Comedy of Errors\" Genre": "This movie is odd, quirky, dark, and ultimately funny. There were moments when I thought that I'd leave because something struck me as too intense. I found that I couldn't leave. The movie was just too good, and I'd have come back anyway. I began to see that there was an unfolding of the 'comedy of errors genre' that had the same feel as when watching \"The Importance of Being Ernest.\" I loved the sense of \"knowing, but not knowing\" that carried me through right up to the final screen.", "Hugh Grant with a terrible accent": "If you want to see Hugh Grant do a terrible accent, this film is for you. He does a Cockney accent, which isn't bad in itself it is just that to do the accent he is pitching his voice up a few notes, which makes him sound stupid.Actors who do not do their own accents often pitch up their voices, it is some sort of natural law. They think it sounds OK because in their head the ressonance sounds OK. Just like people who have a very nasal voice think it sounds marvellous, but viewers find it false.At least the US actor didn't fall for doing a UK accent, thank God. Forgot his name, but he is still a good actor.As for the film itself, forget it. Some good dialogue, very interesting ambience, etc, but just devoid of anything that makes you care. This is porn without the good parts.", "Phenomenal!!!!!": "I wasn't expecting this movie to be very good. However, this movie blew me away.

Great acting , great action , great story ... keeps you guessing right to the very end - you should definitely see this one .", "Enjoyable.": "I really enjoyed this movie, it was told in the eyes of Hugh Grants character, and I think that is always a good way in my opinion. I like to see movies told in the eyes of a character in a movie. I think this was a good crime thriller, with some aspects of comedy and a lot more action than I thought would happen. I really enjoyed Charlie Hunman in this, he really played a good character, and has some dark humour to him, I think that's what made this movie enjoyable, the dark humour, and with it been British as well it really plays it's part. I would definitely recommend this movie, I think that it's a top class Guy Ritchie flick.", "Lots of fun.": "I'm not really into gangster movies as a general rule, but this one caught my interest because of the cast.

Great acting, but one for rental.", "Guy Ritchie's best film since Snatch.": "Really enjoyed this despite having fairly low expectations.

Action sequences was different.An excellent drug lord movie in recent times. The movie was far above what is to be expected. A good Action thriller movie with usual twists in it. Enjoyed this movie a lot", "Another great flick": "I enjoyed watching this. The story told by Fletcher was an interesting approach and created suspense as viewers wouldn't be sure if what he said was true or less so. It's almost as good as Snatch. The man (Ritchie) seems to have a thing for pikeys and the Irish by the way. Matthew McCon was perhaps a tad too classy for the part and the way he spoke reminded me a little of his role in True Detective. I was surprised by the little badness Hugh Grant seems to able to squeeze out in this role rather than the usual pouty posh parts he portrays in other films and is almost convincing enough to play a baddy. For the rest it's an excellent, amusing and exciting movie. There should be a law that would ensure that more often movies like this are made...", "Stunning": "The best film I've seen in a very long time. This will go up there as an absolute classic. It's got everything you want, Crime, Whit, Elegance and a beautifully told story. Stand out actors include McConaughey, Farrell and Hugh Grant, adding a real spice to the film. This one has rewatch ability for years and years to come. A piece of genuine god tier cinema.I would recommend this film to every person I know.

My first Guy Ritchie - loved it!": "I felt that I had got into a rut with the types of film I was watching so decided to take a chance on this completely different genre - I'm so glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed it!It's a complex storyline that means you have to pay attention the whole way through and as a result, with so many strands introduced along the way, the time just flew by. A stylish, larger than life gangster movie it's got big names, lots of action & is liberally sprinkled with black humour. It's basically the story of a man who's made a fortune from growing & selling cannabis but who wants to sell his empire to retire from the business. Little does he know that his attempt to strike a deal will unleash all manner of mayhem. I've never been a fan of Hugh Grant but credit where credit's due - he's wonderful in this & definitely the standout performer. There is a cartoonish tone to the film so although there is quite a bit of violence, it's not the type that most people likely to find too graphic. If you are offended by swearing however then avoid this at all costs, since virtually every sentence spoken contains it. I must try and continue to view a broader selection of film types in future because if this is any example there must be lots of gems waiting for me to discover!", "Good Film with few nods to the past.": "Great London gangster film.

It's not bad, just kinda OVERRATED. My old man himself found the movie BORING, and that's coming from someone who likes gritty crime movies. This unfortunately didn't meet his standard (like Dirty Harry, The Godfather, The Untouchables, Good Fellas, Kill The Irishman, We Own The Night, etc..).Lots of Guy Ritchie fanboys are defending this really boring movie. What's so great about a movie filled with almost nothing but exposition this, and exposition that? The Godfather 1 & 2 and Good Fellas did such stuff way better. Many of the build ups in this movie get nowhere or take too long. There's hardly any action, and I even find the slow paced 1940's & 1950's Crime Noir movies far more engaging to watch.", "Boooooring.": "Couldn't finish it. Had to bail an hour in. Nonstop talking.

Absolutely brilliant and fun film, with great performances by all of the cast. Wait for it to watch it at home if you need to, but I say to go and see it in the theater with an audience. It'll add to the fun.", "Another Ritchie gem": "If you like Ritchie movie dialogue, this another one. Miss some of the usual gangsters but this group is a gas as well.

Class.": "Director Guy Ritchie rose to fame as quickly as he lost his way. During his early years he gained great popularity for his stylized Gangster tapes, but over the years he lost a bit of the tone that characterized him at first.\nWith 'The Gentlemen', Guy Ritchie intends to go back to his beginnings and give this film with a low budget a unique mark, something that he undoubtedly manages to achieve, although at a slow pace.\nThe story tells of the criminal life of different Gangsters in different social and criminal strata. It could easily be just another Gangster movie as there are better ones, however the way Ritchie stages this story and its characters is the film's true achievement. It is true that it is difficult to connect with the story in the beginning, perhaps because of the speed of the assembly or dialogue, but approaching the middle of the film it is inevitable to be fascinated by Ritchie's style, his way of narrating and the simple but smart you walk into without any problem waiting for the next move from the filmmaker.\nThis is how this film could be a rare mix between Scorsese's Gangster cinema and Tarantino's memorable dialogue, both of which come together in a film that results in the pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie style.", "Guy Ritchie never disappoints": "This film was entertaining, enjoyable and hilarious. I don't care if the critics think Guy Ritchie is re-using the same plot, if you're able to make it as surprising, fun and different every time, that's a talent in itself. Matthew Mcconaughey was a delight but I have to say Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell were by far my favourite in this film. Although it's not going to be winning Oscars and critics praise, it is an entertaining watch, and a beautifully shot film - and seriously, what else do you need?", "Another Richie Classic": "Brilliant film, packed full of twists and turns as you would expect from Guy Richie. Superb casting backed up with great acting. Don't miss this.", "Almost same with snatch": "It was a very good film.Matthew McConaughey and Hugh Grant played their roles well.Although,snatch is better and I put 9 because at the beginning they were always talking about drugs.", "I watched this movie twice in theaters early this year, and I seldom watch movies twice.": "It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie as much as this. It's not going to change your life, but it is wonderfully entertaining. Hugh Grant's dialog is incredibly well-written, and he delivers it brilliantly. Colin Farrell was also incredible.The fact that critics gave Adam Sandler's \"Uncut Gems\" a better overall score than this movie will always be a testament to how much their opinions ought to be ignored.", "Guy Richie is back!": "Great dialogue! Great characters! Classic Richie at his best! Loved it", "Stylish Gangster a la Guy Ritchie": "First things first, this is a Guy Ritchie movie. His formula includes a lot of smart talking, accidental bumbling, stylish camera work and loads of characters crossing paths with each other causing this whole violent eruption about to climax.The bad first. Many like their gansta noir or gritty... Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorites till this say because it was fresh, and the many characters were consistent to who they were meant to be. The Gentlemen has its moments, but it was not as fresh, smart ass talking or even plot smart enough with its twists. And I'm not sure I dig the storytelling format, nor the ending.Having said that, just because it's not great doesn't mean it isn't good. The all-star cast does a fantastic job. I was most impressed with Hugh Grant, as well as Colin Farrel, Matthew McConnaughy, Chris Hunnan and Michelle Dockery, among a star studded cast. Good to see Jeremy Strong and Henry Golding as well)There were a few very intense, gritty moments done very well.

The last being the least of the three. They all have their charm and capture the british identity really well.This film....felt like 1 long extended cheap advert. There is tremendous acting talent in this film with Matthew Mcconaughy, I found Hugh Grants part to be very amusing and entertaining. However, this film falls short in so many areas. Its forced diversity quota it had to meet ultimately ended up tainting it. The asian crime family felt particularly off and then came the \"buzy malone\" addition to the film....my word easily the worst and most out of place scenes in the entire movie. A random forced grime 'music' video into the film, the fighting scene was.....something you would see in a 1999 batman and robin film. It bugged me for the rest of the film I suppose you could say.By the end of movie it had me feeling that Guy Ritchie has lost touch with both the british crime genre and reality. But maybe the fact he based this so heavily around modern Britain explains why the british feeling so so absent.A movie for casual cinema goers and nothing more. I did not expect much from this film after seeing the trailer and sadly my worst fears were confirmed. It almost feels as if some sad imposter was trying to impersonate Guy Ritchies style. Very sad.", "Hilarious, yet thrilling crime comedy.": "When I finished this I almost wanted to watch it again right after I just watched it.

I don't know what it was, but I think it comes down to the fact that the basic storyline is not really that interesting and/or original. It is, after all a regular ganster movie with regular conflicts. Lots of men in suits threatening each other, lots of talk about money, barely any females. I would even go so far as to say that this could be described as being style without substance, or (if I was being radical) as being the kind of movie that promotes a dangerous image of masculinity.BUT, that being said, I did enjoy it because it had everything I like about Guy Ritchie movies. I just love the fast cuts and the often absurd humor and the slickness of it all. As a female, I just have a thing for seeing neatly dressed guys with neatly cropped hair trying to outwit each other.So yeah, there were moments I found dry and the basic story is something I rather not think about too deeply, but I do think that it was quite well-made for what it was.", "Ooooh My God": "What a Movie ??\nA collection of action and a very good comedy \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude01 which playing a good rule in this movie without any excessive use.\nGood Story and good acting\nMatthew McConaughey and Hunnam and Colin Farrel Performance are Great\nI wish anyone to see this movie ASAP\nIf not you will lose very much", "Struck": "Guy Ritchie is back with an absolute Banger!!

I'm not a big Hugh Grant fan but he's outstanding in this, show stealing. Colin Farrell is his usual whitty self but turned up to 100. Charlie is great his accent sometimes swings between a brummy and his Sons teang but after this first 5 minutes you forget all about it and Matthew McConaughey, ever since he got away from the Rom/Coms has been getting better and better, probably this nicest drug kingpin since Mr Nice himself.

Guy Ritchie never disappoints and is on par with some of the great directors, if not the greatest himself. I look forward to his future films, including hopefully, a sequel to this. I rarely LOL during movies, and this had me doing that more often than in straight out comedies. It also pulled me in and kept me there the entire time.

Hilariously funny and brilliant story telling.", "Could be Guy Ritchie's best movie!": "I really enjoyed this movie, and I enyojed it even more now the second time I watched it. Everyone in the cast fit their respective role perfectly. For me, Charlie Hunnam will always be Jax Teller, but he was really good in this role. Matthew McConaughey is a favourite of mine, he is always awesome, and I just love his voice. I was also surprised how much I liked Hugh Grant in this one, since I am not a typical fan of him. Colin Farrell was also awesome. The movie has good humour and good action, and what I love about Guy Ritchie movies is how all subplots comes together in the end.

This might be the best Guy Ritchie movie in my opinion!", "Really well-made bigoted nonsense": "The only female character was raped after she tried to stand up for herself and she had to be saved by her husband. The movie looked at how the that made him feel but not how she felt. Then, after a few hours or days, she was ready to have sex with him, even though it was his terrible decisions that had put her in that position.\nThe main black character Ernie (played by Bugzy Malone, whose upbringing in real life is a story in itself) was called a \"Black C%$\u00a3\" and when he tried to stand up for himself he was talked out of it by a white guy who was supposed to be a mentor but actually bullied teenagers, armed them and got them involved in making bestiality videos.\nI know it's a Guy Richie gangster movie called \"The Gentlemen\" so it's not like we should expect it to be socially responsible but it still seems more damaging than it needs to be. All of characters were massive stereotypes but the representations of most of the white men were that they were powerful and rich and that they could transcend class through violence.\nThis was my favourite genre growing up.

And if you have the same opinion, you will like Guy Ritchie's new crime comedy", "irritating narrative format ruins an otherwise phenomenal trip": "The narration throughout is akin to breaking the fourth wall incessantly, in this case. It's the first and last domino. It takes you out of the narrative and constantly reminds you that you're watching fiction, and it does so in a jarring way, so that any hope of escapism is as squashed as if Ritchie's film lost its fight with gravity.And this had such potential! Why drop this cast and this script from such a pretty perch? For example, great acting all around. The standout is truly Hugh Grant, and it's worth seeing just to see him so transformed it's more like a sci-fi flick, where a shapeshifter took over his body bc WHAT. You have NEVER seen nor imagined Hugh Grant like this and he deserves ALL the awards. DUDE. If this ENTIRE film is actually just a prank on the studio that funded it and in truth intended as one massive SIZZLE REEL for Hugh Grant...that tracks.", "Amazing script": "Do yourself a favour and watch this movie. This has to be one of the most creative scripts written and it is superbly acted. It has everything in it, including making me laugh a lot. For context I rate this better than the Joker which I also thought was brilliant.", "Modernised Version of Snatch": "Top tier viewing... A delightful selection of characters & amusing use of the script. Dialogue between characters was often quite joyful to follow almost like GOT.Typical Guy Richie movie following multiple stories at once that all colloid. Brilliant viewing may have even knocked snatch off the podium..", "Instant Classic": "This is easily one of my favorite films. The action, flashbacks, and possibilities of each scene kept me on my toes. The Visual Effects deserve an award. The cast is superb and the way Guy Ritchie utilized their talents and mixed the actors in different scenes allowed almost everyone to work together in one way or another on set. This helped to showcase the depth of the individual actors while creating a cinematic masterpiece for those who love crime films especially, but also for those who do not. The dry humor and wit add an entirely different element not usually associated with this type of crime genre. Any critic that bashed or had anything negative to say about this film needs to get into a different career. Don't listen to them; watch it for yourself or you're missing out on a classic film. I was actually sad when it ended because it was so amazing and refreshing. I can't say enough about it and I hope it will inspire other film companies, writers, directors, and actors to do something similar in the future because we need more movies with the storytelling and passion that this classic brought to the audience.", "Brilliant!": "Best GR movie since snatch, just brilliant. Love his style.", "So worth watching": "Never write review but this film is damn hilarious!\nGlad Charlie Hunnam found some part of his English accent! I am Scottish as well and was totally disappointed that he lost his accent", "It was fun but...": "Everyone knew everything. Like, excessive eye rolls. No depth to the characters or plot. Didn't care if the protagonists died. In fact I was hoping they did.", "Utter Rubbish": "Dear oh dear, this easily makes it onto the top 5 worst films I have had the misfortune to sit through, dreadful.", "As Good As Any Guy Ritchie Film": "Let's get it out of the way. The plot here is wildly simple. It is basically a delivery mechanism for the character drama. A rich cannabis grower / distributor wants to get out of the game. He tries to sell his business to a dude. The dude is a dick and tries to secretly devalue his business. A weird reporter guy likes to spy on the mobster guy (and his trusty ultra-violent but dapper af sidekick). He want to use this to blackmail them for a lot of money. This is where the entertainment is. The sidekick guy is a badass. The reporter is witty, and annoying in a very endearing way. The sidekick guy's reaction to the reporter guy's story telling is actually extremely well done. They really do an extremely good job of acting the part of badass witty uk gangsters (as all of Guy Ritchie's characters seem to be). So yeah if you like these movies, you will like this one. It's not the best, it's not the worst, but it is good and bad for the same reasons that all of his movies are good and bad. You will laugh. You will cringe. You will wince. You will feel something and come away with a weird smile on your face, as you always do from a Guy Ritchie film.", "Vintage Ritchie": "After the disappointment of Wrath of Men it was a treat to discover its predecessor, The Gentlemen. Although not quite up to the standard of the wonderful Snatch this comes pretty close. Great storyline with loads of twists, terrific characters, snappy script, classy editing and a plethora of great actors; Hugh Grant finally buries the upper class twit persona and is brilliant as the sleazy newspaper reporter and Colin Farrell is terrific as ever. Rollicking good entertainment and we can but hope that it leads to the rumoured TV series.", "Odlican film!!!": "Pogledala sam tek sad taj film!

Lot's of references to a typical Guy Ritchie job, but so what? He makes consistently good films and if they are a bit monotonous for people don't watch them. I love his work and admire the high standard he sets. Great performances by the cast. Hugh Grant was terrific. Entertaining stuff.", "Ok movie": "If you liked \"Pulp Fiction\" you will like \"The Gentleman.\" It is a similar CrimeCom but with a British accent. Need more help deciding, read on.McConaughey gives a memorable performance that can make you at times uncomfortable, yet never makes the type of connection where you want to cheer for his character. Not his fault, likely more due to mediocre script and direction. \"The Gentleman\" struggles between deciding whether to be a comedy or a drama.The plot is contrived, at times beyond belief, but the acting, Cinematography and editing keep the story watchable.If you have a reason to go, like you never miss a Macounaughy movie, you will likely be glad you see this movie. However, if you are only looking for something to watch you may want to wait for cable.", "Anyone notice": "Terrific movie!. My new fav. Love Guy Ritchie. Anyone notice in opening bar scene with Mickey, he says \"hello love....\" on phone to Roz. But going back to scene towards end of movie, Mickey says \"hello roz....\"?", "A best Guy Ritchie style": "A lot of great performances, Charlie Hunnam was outstanding, great movie 100% recommended,", "Accents people, please": "Mr Richie obviously has a formula for his films. A group of people all mixed in, one group wants something, another gets involved, people pulled in, a plot twist here and there to keep the audience guessing and voila, you have yourself a Richie formula.The good stuff. I'd say Colin Farrel and the kids were the best of the bunch, probably the only ones who knew the role they were playing. Not normally a Farrel fan, he's definitely put himself ahead here. Also\nMatthew McConaughey can play a bad ass, when he loses it.The bad stuff. Hugh Grant, you one dimensional squirrel, you sound like Micky blue eyes, but trying, bah its bad.\nSame with Hunnam, but he's forgiven for better acting than Grant.Story is basically Lock Stock and Snatch, not as funny and not as well acted. But if you like those, you can't go wrong, it's a solid film and you won't feel like you wasted a couple of hours.", "Another excellent Ritchie production": "While it's not quite as good as Snatch or Lock Stock, The Gentleman does not disappoint with a cast of absurd characters, fun plot twists, dark humor and a ton of creativity. It definitely helps to have seen Guy Ritchie's earlier works to see aspects he has carried over from film to film, although you wouldn't truly be missing anything if you watched this one stand-alone. Excellent work all around, a solid 8. Highly recommend, Richie is a brilliant filmmaker.", "Excellent....This movie will be watched 25 years from now like GoodFellas...A+++++": "I think in 25 years people will still be watching The Gentlemen like they do Goodfellas. The story is excellent......acting A+++ Not sure why reviews aren't all above 90% Colin Farrell is hilarious! Love the soundtrack. Every dramatic and comedic moment is enhanced by the music.....I find myself watching certain parts over and over again....like the race to get the cell phones...that scene with the accompanying music is fantastic.... Cinematography is great too. Guy Ritchie makes this a quintessential English movie...I think!....Not being an Anglophile or someone hasn't even spent time there....except for a 2 day stint on my way to Paris....who knew that such a bad word in the USA (cu***) could be used so often as a comedic and dramatic situations in a movie! Great movie.....It feels Quentin Tarantinoisc , but in a totally unique way that may become a Gut Ritchie signature in the future if he pursues it further...and I hope he does!!! I think Guy Ritchie has proven himself as a top tier director with this movie. I'm going to go back and watch that chase scene now.....and I need a good laugh so I'm going to watch Colin Farrell's and Eddie Marsan's pig scene! I find myself doing this often!", "hypermasculine trash": "Why is everyone pretending this film is not racist. Just because Hugh Grant is attractive doesn't mean he's allowed to be sinophobic as hell also the sleazy gay coded evil character is a bit old don't we think. and don't even get me started on the ONLY female character only being there to be almost r*ped so Matthew Mchanuey can save her and have a whine", "Very entertaining film": "Loved it from start to finish, great to watch at the cinema. Top notch", "Gangsters you'll fall in love with.": "Where do I even start with how much I loved this film. I loved the way they told the narrative through two people in a posh house. Thought that was really clever and gave insight into the characters by having them know the other characters in the film. Felt quite clever at times and I'd love to see more films that play out like this. I also loved all of the action, comedy and drama that came with the film. I think I'm starting to develop a love for films like this as I also love The Kingsman series which this felt similar too in my opinion.The only reason I couldn't give it 10 stars was due to moments in which it jumped about. There were a few moments where one minute I thought something had happened and then the next minute they were saying it didn't happen like that it happened like this instead. Made it a bit hard to follow in places.

The polar opposite to the awful live action Aladdin. This movie has legs, harking back to lock stock and snatch this is Richie at his best. The story snakes here and there and each actor thrives in his part, but it's not hard to follow, quite the opposite. Grant excels in his part, as do all the actors. In these strange times you could watch a lot worse there's a lot of rubbish out there. My advise crack open a beer, put your feet up and enjoy.", "Great movie!": "This is a great movie! I was very pleasantly surprised. Everyone worked very well together.", "DON'T MISS IT IF U WANT COMEDY, A THRILLER AND ACTION WRAPPED IN ONE": "The cast is great, the acting is great, the script is great, and the director ... what can I say. Guy Ritchie wrote the scripts for Revolver, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, just to mention a few and now you're beginning to have an idea of what The Gentlemen is all about. Not only that, it's ten times better. You'll never guess the end and that's the beauty of the movie. Let's not forget that Guy Ritchie also directed those 3 movies I mentioned as well as The Gentlemen.\nOh boy, is this fun!? Ups, sorry, I was about to forget RocknRolla. Another gem. But back to The Gentlemen. It's nothing personal, it's strictly business ... but never try to con a con artist. There's no such thing as honor among thieves and in this case is a business transaction gone bad 'cause one of the parts got greedy.\nThe actors: Matthew McConaughey and Hugh Grant are great. Colin Farrell steals the scene every time he appears. Michelle Dockery had me drooling all the time, ... she's had me doing it since Downton Abbey. Eddie Marsan is in one of those typical roles as made specially for him.\nSo, don't miss this movie, you won't regret it. If you want entertainment in an action movie, this is the one.", "A little Gem almost overlooked!": "The cast speaks for itself. What a great movie!

Another brilliant Guy Ritchie film for the books\nThis was a funny, intense, violent puzzle that kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing. While the plot was fairly easy to figure out, the new characters added and where their piece fit. The casting was fantastic! Each actor played their part perfectly! Matthew McConaughey and Michelle Dockery had fantastic chemistry. The banter between Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant had the theater in stitches. All in all I love this movie and definitley recommend!", "I love the vintage Guy Richie style and \"OMG\" this movie delivers exactly that": "This is Guy Riche at his finest. The story is well thought out, the dialogs are a masterpiece and the whole cast is awesome. Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell do really shine in this movie. They are funny and entertaining in a unique way. It is very refreshing. In addition to that, Farrell made me google tracksuits on the internet.The movie begins slow, and you ask yourself \"hmm, will this be boring?\", but then unfolds with such a speed, that keeps you glued to the seat till the end. Then, when you come back to the reality (with a slight adrenaline kick of pleasure), you realize it was exactly right. I watched this movie already a couple times, and because of multiple scenes and complex story, you get something new out of it every time.Some don't like the movie because it is a typical Guy Richie movie all over again, I like it because of that. Everybody who fell in love with the old Snatch movie will also love this one.Enjoy the movie!", "Thoroughly entertaining....": "I have enjoyed Guy Ritchie's other films and was looking forward to seeing this movie. The cast is excellent, perfectly suited to portray the colorful characters you typically find in a Guy Ritchie film. Hugh Grant and Colin Ferrell steal the show.", "A grand return to crime comedy.": "This movie was flawless. A great return to what made him Guy Ritchie. This movie stands right next to Snatch for me.

Typical Guy Ritchie did that again with the fire": "This film almost got anything on the stage . Good acting great actors , beautiful cinematography nice storytelling it did ALMOST anything .

I've watched it now several times and I'm till in awe. The style is original, the plot, the script unique. The timing is superb. The music just right. It's a like a huge puzzle with all the pieces fitting tightly, all are necessary and none are missing. Then the performances of the actors are extraordinary-all of them. It's a feast of performances. Matthew is a golden star tailored for this role, Michelle a delight as his 'Queen', in a role so different from Downton Abbey. Charlie Hunnam magnetic to watch as Matthew's loyal right hand man. Colin F. As the 'Coach' is so perfectly funny and tough at the same time. Hugh Grant was a big surprise as the story teller, a sleazy reporter, plotter and script writer wanna be. After so many rom coms, he plays this role with such zest perfectly. I can't do justice, so I'll just stop here.", "Good Film": "Slow start but after 20 minutes it really grips you .\nNot for kids , lots of swearing\nGreat ending .", "Is it just ME\ud83d\ude0e...": "WTF AV I JUS WATCHED HUGH TRYIN A COCKNEY ACCENT OR THE FACT THE PLOT IS TOLD AS A STORY...SPOILED MOVIE...NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL...SWESRDOWN I RECKON LOTS OF MOVIE REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY THE NEW DIMWIT YOUTH OF TODAY WI NO BRAIN CELLS", "Ritchie back to his best.": "A great movie,full of memorable performances, funny dialogue and plenty of action.

Also Hugh Grant played his part so well and didn't know it was actually him until I looked at the cast on imdb.com. It's your typical London gangster movie with alot of dark humour.The Gentleman has been out on Netflix for a while and only gave it a try because I was struggling with something to find watch and I'm glad I decided to watch it. The whole cannabis industry was one of main reasons why I gave it a miss for so long. Not because I'm against cannabis, which I'm not. But mostly because I was getting a bit fed up with the whole genre.

Some foul language and triggering scenes as you'd expect too.", "Very funny and at the same time very serious": "This movie seems to be one of the finest portrayal of a comedy gangster flick by English director Guy Ritchie and it is indeed one of the best films made by Guy Ritchie.The movie dialogues,the extraneous scenes,the soundtrack,the costumes all add a special magic to the film.Each and every character had a special purpose to the movie and it all have been justified at the end.The most notable character which I must say was Fletcher played by Hugh Grant as from the beginning we can see that the film is narrated from his point of view. All the other characters were also amazing and they did a fantastic job to bring the best out of the movie", "Layers . . .": "Guy Ritchie -- start to finish.Less visceral than some of his efforts, this is as well crafted a piece of work as . . . Wracking my mind . . . I can't think of a better written story.Yes I'm a fan of sorts in that I own copies of several of his efforts as writer or maker. Not that I admire his esthetic but -- one must acknowledge the craftsmanship that went into this production.Derivative and poignantly, self-immitative. Had this been a wholly original concept it must be seen as a full blown 10. ( well-a point off for cinematic license where technical compromises seems to have favored a nice image ). And I don't really care that parts came from elsewhere. Right off the bat I was working at deriving what original classic rock and pop tunes were 'morphed' into new-ish works for the soundtrack.Respect is due when you consider that a terrific movie was crafted by reworking pieces from many other puzzles in several genres and mediums.In the not too distant future almost no one will read the way we do today and this WILL be a Classic that informs classes of students in story writing.", "Movie reminds you of Snatch": "Was a good movie.

They can even run super fast after a car accident...I am not a sensitive asian person who talk about race stereotypes. But this is too much. I live in Melbourne and do you know how many people came here because the asian actor in the crazy rich asian is in it? A lot. His face appears in every poster coz they want to convince asian heritage people to watch this movie. Then, they use stereotypes to build those characters.

With a strong line up of great acting talent that have been in numerous other great films I had high hopes and it started well.With much of the film told through the narration between Charlie Hunnam's (Raymond) and Hugh Grant's (Fletcher) characters helped the film flowed at a good pace and helped piece it together well. Fletcher was hilarious and made the film for me.In fairness most of the characters were great and it had an exciting mix. There were also many great and memorable scenes throughout that aided a good overall story.However, as enjoyable as it was throughout the ending was somewhat of a disappointment. Not because it was lacklustre or rushed, but because it was so overdone. There were numerous twist and turns and a slightly disturbing scene on a farm which were way over the top that by the end I'd slight lost track and wondered what had happened by the end.Overall if you are a Guy Ritchie fan like myself you will enjoy this film a lot, just might be a tad disappointed with the ending.", "Definitely don't tame the kids !": "Just took a while to get going and it has a great crescendoLanguage is over the top bit reminiscent of Lock Stock", "It is nothing with repeating yourself....": "This movie certainly has it's audience. Although that is the only positive thing to say about it, if it can be positive.I can not really critic the film or how it was made. But it is a same old song, with a worse coreography then before. Bragging about who has the bigger sausage or how a gentleman pays his debts. Not much of a story telling, even less action. Reading hyped reviews even makes me to have a bitter view on the movie.It is good maybe after an exhausting day, or when you want to watch something that does not make you think. You just want to see glance, or how Mr. Ritchie depict the crime society. But still boring.However it was good to see Hugh Grant in another perspective and in my view the movie had potential.

Sparkling dialogue, great casting, and just the right amount of Ritchie's action to accompany the surprising plot twists.\nI have never rated a movie a '10' and only a few 9s, but this earned a 9. I believe anyone would find 'The Gentlemen' both entertaining and exciting.", "Although it is very beautiful, it still has something to be discussed.": "This movie is a fun to watch at a glance, the point of constant laughter, the plot ups and downs, but after watching carefully, found that some places are worth discussing.\nHugh Grant's Fletcher the lion is not afraid of being killed?\nMatthew Berger, is it stupid to play tricks behind your back?\nMatthew Berger, why are there only two bodyguards?\nWhy would Matthew Berger do business with Dry Eye in public?\nHow come you didn't know the identity of the Russian teenager until the last minute?\nThere are six bullets in the gold pistol, why are there only two?\nDadaifu, the newspaper owner, is too weak.", "Guy Ritchie back doing his best !!": "Great performances, very fast paced story telling, if your a fan of snatch and lock stock two smoking barrels you will love this.", "Top Knotch": "Extremely fulfilling, loved every minute of it.\nThe comedy, suspense, dramatization, performance were all on-point.\nWish I had watched this on the big screen back when it came.", "Good Cast - Good story": "It was a weirdly good movie.

Highly recommend it", "One of the most stylish movie ever but no substance": "Guy Ritchie comes back with an umpteenth flick.\nIt's a Lock stock and two smoking barriers movie with smartphones, YouTube and a scene from Black Mirror... all in full HD and with Matthew Mcconaughey.\nDon't expect any moral or characters' developments.\nPrepare to watch a gallery of handsome and badass characters spitting badass lines. It's very well-crafted and with precise direction but it lacks memorable scenes.\nMusic and sound editing are on point (except for some really loud scenes) but it's rather forgettable.\nThe movie relies a lot on the actors' charisma especially Matthew Mcconaughey and Hugh Grant.\nMatthew and all his crew are a mix of gentlemen and gangsters, you won't root for them and they'll get out of situation in no time anyway. Sir Hugh Grant is by far the best and only funny character of the movie thanks to his narration skills, his filmmaking references and his gay jokes to Charlie Hunham.\nIt's cute but not sexy. It's funny but lacks humor. There's technology but it's not modern.\nSnatch is a true classic and came up to the level of Pulp Fuction. The Gentlemen doesn't reach them.", "Guy Ritchie on FLYING Form, Amazing cast, Amazing performances, Amazing Movie": "Amazing movie. I frequently laughed out loud at the dialogue. The direction is stellar. Not contrived, full of cliches, or a caricature of the genre. Just solid witty dialogue, brilliant performances from all involved and amazing intrigue. Loved the homage to The Long Good Friday at the end. Top Class. Absolutely recommend this movie.", "Melt into the world of selling your drug empire...plus more laughs than expected": "Being frankly honest, I didn't know the ins and outs of Guy Ritchie's gritty films but I will certainly be on the look out for his others now. The cast are brilliant. Seeing Hugh Grant particulary in this kind of role was a breath of fresh air and showed he isn't only a rom-com man. Also a standardly good ferformance by the multi-talented Colin Farrell and I only expect to see more of Henry Golding in the near future.The film itself followed a good story, easy and interesting to follow. The comedy and wit of the characters really makes for an enjoyable 2 hours in the cinema.", "The coach steals the show": "A return of guy Ritchie to produce a great movie...but somehow lacks something...it's not quite perfect but Colin Farrell was immense and a throwback to snatch.Well worth a watch definitely a great movie...this is one of those were the sequel will undoubtedly be better and fill the holes the original left.", "It's like eating last night's left over, Lock, Stock and two smoking barrerls.": "Guy Ritchie attempts to recreate a master piece from left overs.It fills the belly, but it ain't as good as the fresh and classic Lock, Stock and two smoking barrerls.It's still better than most smart action films in 2019/2020.", "Wow!!!!": "Oh thank god this movie kept me alive ,starting it's a nice build up for a boy like Mike u ll have affection from the start but u ll always be at the risk of loosing him in between cause the movie is made that way that it'll hit u as surprise.Ithink at least it should have scored 8 ,I ll eagerly wait for the sequel.I absolutely loved it .", "Amazing storytelling": "Beyond entertaining and overall great movie to watch , Guy Ritchie doesnt fall down on yet another great film .

There was also an incredible amount of casual racism, which was unacceptable to me.", "A different kind of movie": "The movie catched me after a few seconds, because I didn't know what was going on and the character of Fletcher is so well played that it just caught me after a few seconds into the film. The film is different from a normal movie because of the timeline structure of the storyline. The actors play fantastic and it is really a pleasure to watch them. Guy Richie really did a very good job. Absolut highlights of the movie is the humour they have and Dry Eye, the Asian gangster.WHY I DON'T GIVE 10 STARS: because in my personal view there is too less interaction with Mickey. I know that the film is not about him (despite the title) but still, I would have wished a few more dialogues with the king of the jungle.", "Simply Stunning": "What a piece of cinema!! This is trueky a masterpiece. Think Snatch on heat with added action!", "Overall: Great": "Guy Ritchie returns to form with this fast-paced crime thriller. The movie is filled with witty dialogue and excellent performances all the way around. There were rarely any dull moments since all the characters were so fun and colourful, especially when the movie begins to add in elements of blackmail, bribery, deceit, and violence. However, the movie stumbles a bit in its first act. Dialogue comes at you with rapid-fire speed, which can get overwhelming and requires an adjustment period. (But that's most Guy Ritchie crime movies.) You just feel like you're already behind and need to catch up. Once you're adjusted to the narrative style and the movie settles in, everything comes together in an awesome final act.Recommended for: Fans of Guy Ritchie films, fans of colourful performances with witty dialogue, or fans of saying Phuc hundreds of times until you get it right. Phuc. Phuc. Phuc.", "Great fun to watch, very entertaining": "But not for the kids or aunties. One could of course watch again and do a c-word count but that would detract from the hilarious, engaging plot that goes to great effort to keep the viewer entertained and interested. It is a mirror-image and parody of many a gangster movie and is also a running commentary on society. I would never ever have identified Hugh Grant without the cast list.", "Absolutely Hilarious!": "This movie is worth watching! It has a great talented cast that makes the witty dialogue that much better. The story was very well written with multiple layers. The only reason it's not 10 in my opinion was it was slightly slower paced then I was expecting but otherwise, Excellent!", "This is a 'Guy Ritchie' film": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E was a good movie but not exactly a Guy Ritchie movie, King Authur was a good entertainment. Period.\nThis movie is a 'Guy Ritchie' movie, maybe not as masterful as Snatch and Lock Stock but would definitely rate it just below them.\nScreenplay first and then story telling are the backbone of every movie and what makes a movie even more refined is a satisfying ending.\nThe story starts slow but by about 50 minute, it gathers the speed and then it is just 'Guy Ritchie'\nColin Farrell stole the show and McConaughey was brilliant. Kudos to Hugh grant and Charlie Hunnam for a great supporting cast.\nWell entertained for the second half", "Return to Original Form, with Meta Grace": "This felt like the Guy Ritchie I grew up with loving, but in a new and matured way without repeating the same old song & dance. The film was very meta and aware, but it was handled with class and not obnoxious. It also fit the story and character, having Hugh Grant's char aspiring to be a filmmaker.Everything was utilized, setup well, and there were fire and great consequences to each action. Pacing was brilliant and the structure was beautiful. Going back and forth between the action and Charlie and Hugh's char scenes at the house were perfect. And right when it would have overstayed it's welcome, we move on to the next part of the story.", "guy ritchie at his finest": "Reminds me of the classic Guy Ritchie movies.\nwith brilliant performances from the cast members.", "I loved Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels": "Don't have high expectations if and when you see this movie, because it is just more of the same Guy Richie stuff. Same formula: lots of high profile actors, lots of Gilmore-Girls-style witty chat, lots of dope, lots of music, some camera effects, some action and no subtlety to be found anywhere. Great for the masses.", "Danny Boyle tries to get Sorkin-y": "Danny Boyle makes a Danny Boyle movie but if it was written by a less talented Aaron Sorkin. Some of the longest scenes are just exposition and the worst of it is the one with Matthew McConaughey and the guy from Succession trying way too hard to seem cool. I could barely get through some of it. Mostly it just limps along never really being redeemed by a cast who needed more direction than they got.", "The comeback": "I was scared that this movie wouldn't be as good as the other cult classic made by Ritchie.

Every single second of the movie was brilliant...great cast of actors and personally I thought Hugh Grant was exceptional - his role was so different from what he has portrayed in all his other movies, loved his accent. It was such a funny film in parts.... I lost count the amount of times they said the 'C' word and yes I know it is such a bad word and the worse kind of language anywhere in the world (don't hate us) yet Londoners use it a lot in daily life that we don't bat an eyelid when it's said out loud. It was pure genius of Guy Ritchie to use it in the script as it's offensive!!(My only gripe is Rosalind was wearing Louboutin's in a scene and then turns round to leave and the soles of her shoes are clearly not red - that's bad continuity!)", "Loved it.. but..": "Could have been 100x better without the 3rd person narrative.

It is really captivating and keeps you at the edge of your seat. I clapped at the end.", "Director's strange choices": "Seeing Matthew McConaughey as a gangster was a real challenge for me, and through the film I noticed myself waiting for his screentime to end, mostly because of overacting. The scene with confronting Dry Eye (with a handgun) for example, that's a pure cringe. Did Guy made Americans annoying on purpose? Jeremy Strong has the similar issue, being not living his character. Sometimes you feel like their dialogues are used only to extend the running time.Plot twists like farm raid leading back to Michael, or the Aslan being the son of Russian oligarch were somehow dull.That throw up scene caught me off guard. It doesn't fit the film and should have been left in Director's Cut.Good things: the setting is great, English underworld image is what always impressed me in Ritchie's movies. And the secondary characters such as Ray, Fletcher, Dry Eye and Coach, which kept me watching. They deserve their credit.", "Wrong movie to bring your girlfriend to.": "I think you could say I'm a causal Guy Ritchie fan, I've greatly enjoyed several of his movies before this and I (for myself) enjoyed this one.\nUnfortunately I took my girlfriend to see it for date night (BTW we are both senior citizens and widowers).

With a retired librarian at least.", "Story spoiled by poor casting": "Generally Guy Ritchie films are engaging with a distinct cinematography, this is no exception. However, you simply cannot overlook the dreadful miscasting. Aside from High Grant, and the Toddlers, the other characters would be better served with different actors. The leads lack gravitas and are misplaced in the film's gene. It comes across as though some of them asked to play the role just to be associated with this type of film rather than actually having the ability to pull it off.", "beauty that came after years": "If we look at his latest movies this movie was very good.

There is nothing more satisfying and appeasing than watching Matthew McConaughey be Matthew McConaughey and just go crazy, but the real treat of this film are Charlie Hunam and Collin Farrell, they are just perfect. With incredible witty and sharp dialogues, as expected from guy Ritchie, rapid editing, quick montage and impeccable comedic timing from all of his actors, it makes the viewing experience so perfect and so entertaining.", "A film for Gen X": "Representation of the younger generation is laughably out of touch.

Enjoyable enough far to forgettable.", "Not fully satisfied": "I was surprised I hadn't caught on to the release of this film, as I downright adores Snatch And Lock Stock etc. Maybe the previous Guy Ritchie-films spoiled me, but there was something tepid about The Gentlemen. The soundtrack was there; the costumes, the class actors, the wit and sudden changes in the storylines.\nAnd yet...\nNone of the elements were as solid as before. The music wasn't that great. The climactic scenes weren't that memorable. The story wasn't that intriguing. I didn't really care for anyone in the cast, except Hugh Grant. I honestly didn't know who to root for thought the entire movie, and I really like Matthew MacC a lot. And some of the scenes was plain uninteresting and without importance. Chasing the kids with the mobile phones? What was that, time filler?", "Rental at best": "I like Guy Richtie movies, most of them anyways. This is just a typical \"English gangster\" movie hes made in the past, but not as endearing. Its the same template that is very familiar: slick, stylized and the same usual \"twists\".His typical protagonist thinks of everything and every angle and always fakes a weakness/blind spot. Antagonist thinks he'll get away with it, some 3rd party flips the script in favor of the protagonist (intentional or not), usually at the end.

The delivery of the story from Hugh Grant is brilliant and charming. 10/10 to matthew mcconaughey and Guy Richie", "Clever, creative dialogue and": "The Gentlemen is a movie that's so incredibly produced and directed that it captures your attention from the start and keeps it throughout the entire 113 minutes. The dialogue and clever comments between the actors were impressive to say the least - remarks, comebacks, and insults that leave you wanting more from the characters. As well as the scenes being packed with exciting action, detailed visuals, and unique situations that I haven't seen in any other movie.", "This is the buisness!": "Mr. Ritchie does it again with a great cast in a fun British film, love everything about it & everyone in it but have to give a special nod to Hugh Grant who at last has come up with the goods that he always had as an actor but was never (only in my opnion) given the chance to show his worth other than that of a Plummy English Gent .

Hugh Grant is ok but the gay innuendo from him and the Jewish gangster is overly simplistic.

It comes across as trying to be smarter than it is when it is a gangster movie.", "Great yarn": "I really enjoyed this, I ding Guy Ritchie a bit hot and miss at times, but he is totally back to form with this, a nicely current take on an age old story. Lots of great characters, set piece scenes that bring a wry smile to the face and a story that is narrated cleverly and at the right pace.", "Familiar territory for Guy Ritchie": "To certain degree The Gentlemen is your stereotypical Ritchie crime caper full of entertaining and colourful characters synonymous with his films. While the script lacks the depth, twists and sub plots of his previous successful forays into the crime genre namely Lock Stock and Snatch. Richie, does have a way of getting performances of note from his cast member's. The aforementioned title certainly delivers again for the director in this respect. While Mcconnaughy delivers with the unmistakable charisma we have come to expect from him, it was the particularly interesting and unfamiliar role of Hugh Grant that caught the eye and highlighted a type of variety not often seen in the work of Grant. Another notable mention must go to Colin Farrell who presents as a sharp and quick witted character prone to a criminal venture. For all the criticism of Farrell and his perceived lack of range, this character and script play to his strengths and showcase his underrated skills as a comic actor. To summarise, this film is by no means a Richie masterpiece and does have a sense of predictability. What it lacks in substance and grit, it makes up for in a wit and it's free flowing pace.

The pretentiousness of the film dripped with Ritchie's self-importance that the story and movie itself didn't deserve. This movie took itself more seriously than anything he'd made since Snatch, yet it didn't do anything to earn that distinct honor bestowed on it. However, in the second half it seemed to shed the entitled demands to be taken seriously and just let loose in a rather enjoyable, silly gangster flick. Still, nothing spectacular as it was still a self-indulgent style over substance mess at times with dialogue so contrived only the best actors could power their way through leaving behind the lesser actors to wallow in the melodrama of it all. But I'll be damned if I wasn't entertained by the film enough to give it a 7/10 and give it the distinction of being Ritchie's 4th best film.

The witty dialogue, the fashion, and the British slum/gangster/grime music culture the movie creates is wildly entertaining.

Since we start late, let's start coeval: The Gentlemen.The Gentlemen is the 12th feature film directed by Guy Ritchie, who beside penning the last two films of the Sherlock Holmes franchise virtually singlehandedly developed his own personal subgenre, namely the Italian Job (Peter Collinson, 1969)/Get Carter (Mike Hodges, 1971) spinoff mockney comedy caper thriller, which he inaugurated back in 1998 with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, reaching in The Gentlemen its till now baroquest peak.The unimaginatively titled The Gentlemen tells the unsummarizable unimaginative irresistible story of dope (as in cannabis, didn't know such a kind still existed) mega-dealer Mickey Pearson's (Mathew McConaughey) attempts to sell the business and leave the Life, unleashing intricate manoeuvres implicating the Jewish and Chinese mobs, and also brit toffs as sort of stationary mules (you have to see it to understand it), told mostly in a series of flash backs by private eye turned wannabe hustler Fletcher (Hugh Grant gone gay, stellar) to Pearson's right hand man Raymond (Charlie Hunnam) in the course of what has to be the most convoluted attempt at a shakedown in film history.Critical reception has been mixed, and the film can be said to be self-indulgent, self-referential, vapid and/or mercenary, but who in the name of rhyming slang cares? The Gentlemen is not a guilty pleasure, for the enormous pleasure does away with the guilt long before the first reel is through (films don't come in 10 minute reels anymore, and they haven't for decades, I know, I just like to write like this). The script is so jam-packed with one-liners I am seriously considering starting an online petition to have it published in book form (already seen a couple of hints in this direction in online chatrooms). Oh and there's Colin Farrell giving Hugh Grant a run for his money for best performance as MMA coach Coach (that\u00c2\u00b4s not a typo, it\u00c2\u00b4s what he is called). And also a soundtrack the 20th Century Englishness of which stands, if memory serves, unmatched, including inter alia Roxy Music's 1973 In 'Every Dream Home a Heartache' and the Jam's 'That's Entertainment', to name but two tracks I hadn't listened to in decades but recognized instantly (although it did take my brain some 20 seconds to reset from the delusion that the latter track was by XTC).So I can't wait for the sequel, titillating insinuations to which were included in the current effort, and would dear to suggest Guy Richie commits his formidable dialogue-writing talent to the script, commissions directing to Shane Meadows and casts Michael Caine and the Kemp bros.", "Hugh Grant acting at last...": "Good film, Hugh Grant acting at last and not just playing himself for once.... needs an award for this", "A Great Storyline ?": "Hmm I went through this movie coz I saw Last Christmas a few days ago and it was of Henry Golding .", "Great Film!!": "What a film! The critics have this so wrong. This was Up there with Guy Richies best!\nLaugh out loud moments and brilliant acting by just about everyone especially Hugh grant. Entertaintment at its best.", "another gigantic Guy Ritchie film": "Great Guy Ritchie Style cinema from the first to the last minute. all actors were terrific.", "Guy Ritchie!!! Absolute treat to watch everytime.": "As soon as I was able to read in the movie Poster 'Guy Ritchie' It made my day. Big fan of Guy since Lock stock'98, Revolver (2005), Snatch (2000), RocknRolla and have watched his every movie number of times. It's like a bonus whenever his movie comes out. Plus, It stars Matthew McConaughey. What's more needed?\nAny chance of RocknRolla 2 ?? Mark strong and Toby kebbell : The Real RocknRolla. :)\nKeep 'em coming Guy!!", "A slow burn, more so that Guy's other films.": "Thought I was going to dislike it, but the final 20 minutes tyed things together better than I had anticipated. Great cast , slow pace but its not boring. A bit silly in some parts (crack on a Chinese name, gangster boxers? Or something).Overall enjoyed the watch.", "Midway upon the journey of a criminal life": "Not always is going forward a necessary improvement.\nThis is proved by Guy Ritchie's latest movie, The Gentlemen, a brilliant coming back of the British director, after the detours from his original imprint and trade mark represented by Aladdin (2019), King Arthur (2017) and in a way also The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), as well as the diptych of Sherlock Holmes, to his origins, those that brought him success and a distinctive narrative and filmic style centered around the London criminal underworld.\nNobody really believes that the British criminal gangs medley so gracefully cruelty and greed with the irresistibly cool, debonair attitude that denote Guy Ritchie's characters, but it is honestly pleasant to find them again on the screen, it is a like meeting after a long time a distant relative, a bit dissolute but in the end loved and, to a certain extent, even secretly envied without admitting it.The American Mickey Pearson, well played by Matthew McConaughey, crossed the Atlantic to study at Oxford but soon became a drug kingpin, aptly able to benefit from his contacts with the needy British aristocracy to build a commercial empire for the illegal production and distribution of marijuana on a national scale.\nMidway upon the journey of his criminal life and happily married to true cockney Rosalinde, he decides to transit to legality and offers to sell all his activities to Jewish entrepreneur Matthew, constantly body-guarded by former Mossad agents.\nThis decision sparks a far-reaching series of effects and subplots that bring onboard various secondary characters, amongst whom Colin Farrell steals the show, that are craftily kept together for the viewers by Fletcher, an investigative journalist working for a tabloid which chief editor holds a grudge against Pearson. Fletcher intends to monetise through blackmail the information he has collected, and those he has only guessed to fill the gaps of what he still doesn't know, and contacts Pearson's top man, Raymond, excellently played by a Charlie Hunnam much more at ease here than as King Arthur. Hugh Grant as Fletcher is in sterling form here, lending an unusual and idiosyncratic charm to a role that deviates, and we should say thankfully and eventually, from the expected characters he has built his successful career on.Mixing his trademark brisk and sparkling dialogues, Tarantino-like yet unmistakably made in Ritchie, with a crafted and expected British-ness of costumes and settings and a pleasant, defining yet not intrusive soundtrack, The Gentlemen is, to put it simply, a very good movie that gives the viewers what is expected of Guy Ritchie, sprinkling cinephile quotes (Coppola's The Conversation, old film reels) and well-integrated self-quotes (Snatch's pigs and poster of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. amongst others) on an excellent camerawork servicing a tight narrative pace whose thread, mainly for Fletcher's catchy story-telling, is never lost during the film and until its, partially unexpected, ending.A step back, but towards the quality if his directorial origins, for Guy Ritchie, The Gentlemen will not be remembered for its innovations but it is a solid, well-written, directed and acted, genre movie.\nNowadays, not too bad!", "I wanna say \"They dont make em like this anymore\" but they do!": "After a bit of a slow start, this movie grabs a hold of you very tightly and doesn't let go untill the credits roll.\nEvery single performance is top notch! The story at first comes across as complicated, but because of the way its told you will catch on quickly and will have no trouble following the events told.To me this movie is an instant classic. I cant wait to see it again!\nTruly a return to form for Guy Ritchie, I believe congratulations are in order.", "So polished you almost forget you're watching Ritchie": "All the characters and their machinations are so entertaining to watch unfold you don't even care if it's predictable or not. My fav was Colin Farrell.Ritchie just has a way with creating such rich and lovely characters who live on the periphery of his films and I think 3/4 of that is the talent he has for picking the right people who will be able to fulfill those tangential but important roles. Same with the leads. Same with the supporting.For me, it wasn't very predictable... I mean you knew because it's Ritchie that SOMETHING was going to happen but I try to watch movies in a null mind state. I try to not guess and not figure it out so I can enjoy the director's and the writer's intention as it's meant to be. Sometimes it's hard to do.But watching this movie was like eating a giant bowl of kids cereal. I know it's not the best meal I've ever made... but it's as comfy as I'm gonna get, I knew I was going to have fun, and boy it sure did taste good.Happy viewing.", "A brilliant, humerous film. Guy Ritchie returns to his roots.": "January tends to be the Hollywood dump month for movies. All the big players are released in November and December, so when a movie like this comes along, I have to be a little bit skeptical about it. Fortunately, The Gentlemen packs a hard punch, and is a very entertaining movie.For fans of other Guy Ritchie films, like \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch,\" then you should enjoy this one. The pacing is lightning fast, and there is a lot of information thrown at you during the 113 minute run time, but the movie flows so well, that it worked for me. Guy Ritchie wrote all the characters really well, and the witty dialogue reminded me of one of my favorites from last year, \"Knives Out.\" The way the story is told is quite unique, and the twists and fake outs used were quite entertaining, not everything may be exactly what we see. The story is written well, and every detail works together and well layered with many different moving parts that kept me on the edge of seat the entire time.The movie wastes no time getting started. It opens up on what looks like the inevitable, but then takes us back and shows everything leading up to that point. A lot of substance in the first act may lead to some confusion and maybe a little bit of a headache with all the information thrown at the audience. The second act slows down a little as the characters have already been solidified and I was able to catch my breath a little bit before the final act, which is incredible. Everything had a purpose and led up to a great finish.Perhaps the best part of this movie would have to be the acting. McConaughey puts forth one of his best performances in a while, and even with how great he was, he wasn't even the best part. Charlie Hunnam plays the right-hand man, and is one of the coolest characters I've seen in a movie for a while, his presence is powerful when on screen. The biggest highlight however would have to be Hugh Grant, the accent is great, and he delivers a hilarious and clever performance, very different than I've known him for.I would highly recommend checking out \"The Gentlemen\" for an extremely fun movie, and it might be hard to find new movie to top this one for a while. It may not be quite as violent as I was expecting, but what is there is insane and hilarious at times. A great film if you like complex storylines with witty and humerous dialogue. The Gentleman is the first great film of 2020 and I encourage you to check it out!", "Nice one.....but where can i get them dapper plaid tracksuits?": "Nice one.....but where can i get them dapper plaid tracksuits?\nWell done, thoroughly enjoyed Richie latest endevour.\nWhat is that brand of tracksuit the coach was so lucky to fashion around?", "Fun & Entertaining": "I wasn't sure what kind of movie I would be getting when I began watching \"The Gentleman\", but I was not disappointed. There are various twists and turns as well as some witty comic relief that keep you entertained. I got some \"Snatch\" vibes from this movie in that regard. Hugh Grant puts forth a great performance, as does Charlie Hunnam.", "Good old Ritchie": "Really everything is on point: the costume, the design, the dialogue, the acting.\nTo those Ritchiefans, and those who wanna become one, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.\nevery minute is a joy and I say this after seeing this movie twice already.", "Guy ritchie is is totally underrated": "This movie must be a symbol of style, discipline and humor mixed in a single movie with so so huge twists to keep you on your edge of seats.\nmovie is based on a guy (Matthew) running biggest illegal drug business in the heart of England with intelligence, smartness and with his ready-to-die assistant Ray (charlie hunnam).\nmovie is all about the show of Matthew and charlie, the way they have raised the status of their acting with the charisma added by guy ritchie's direction and style makes their acting to another level.\nso many twists, subplots and screenplay are treat to watch. A wholesome movie to be must watch if drug, mafia, crimes and thrill is what you need.\nunderrated and fresh movie of the year 2019 which will be regarded as masterpiece in coming years.", "Typical over boring rubbish from guy ritchie": "Worst movie ever. Had to turn it off after 40 minutes.", "Every actor in this film was top rate": "The movie is suspenseful, funny, and dramatic. I want to be entertained by a movie. I want to care about what happens and I want to be satisfied with the ending. I do not want to be lectured, preached to or feel worse at the end of the film than I did at the beginning. In fact, I would like to have a smile on my face when all is said and done.I have gotten to an age where I just am bored by most films and have no emotional investment in them. Add to that the fact that I dislike mobster films intensely I find myself very surprised to say I loved this movie. Every actor in the film was perfect for their role. I could not recognize Hugh Grant and had to look up who was playing his role. It was the antithesis of a Hugh Grant part and he played it perfectly. The only character who fell into a stereotype was McConaughey and I did not mind that because really the part fit him so well. Normally he rubs me the wrong way but that did not happen in this movie. Colin Farrell was another surprise but again in a very good way. Michelle Dockery is a actress who makes you believe she can eliminate you with a look. I was unfamiliar with Charlie Hunnam until this film but I am now a fan.I recommend this movie. I don't know that I have said that for awhile now.", "Tangled, Pompous, Droll": "Have you killed someone?He was killed by the gravity.However, there are many jokes there. I won 't post them here so I don 't ruin pleasure. By the way, some jokes go beyond what is generally considered permissible in today 's civilized world. And if tolerance is your middle name, think twice whether to watch this movie, cause it may innervate.Humor is what makes all the main characters nice. And there 's not just one or two of them here. I counted seven, and I probably forgot someone. Of course, everything revolves around one line, but every hero has his own time. The only character I didn't 't like was not funny and came to not good (not good at all). And also, heroes look so real, with familiar human soft spots. Soft spot for a wife, for money, for a child, for power... I think every viewer will find a character with whom he can associate himself.I liked Ray and Coach the most. At first glance they both are clumsy, kind-hearted goofs. In fact, they are fast and intelligent warriors who are deeply committed to a sense of duty. Even though they understand the duty in a very special way.I also was in the aisles because of the sassy, Machiavellian, resilient hero of Hugh Grant, who can creep into any hole without a soap and wriggle out of most unfavorable situation.Now about the dynamics of the film. At first, the plot develops slowly. But then it begins to spins, and at the very end, I barely could follow changes. Two hours flew for me unnoticed, although usually, I feel exhausted wathich even an hour without a break. Apparently, I constantly had to think intensely to trace the plot. I was ready to watch it a second time right after the movie.The trailer, IMHO, does not reflect, how much this film is cool, at least for 10%. It is a secret for me, why. Perhaps creators were afraid to make a bad break, which will destroy viewers' tension. From the trailer, I could only understand I'll see a beautiful picture and much of action. Likely, Guy Ritchie, due to his reputation, can afford such a vague trailer - viewers will come anyway. Love at first sight is not a usual thing for me, but this movie definitely fell into this category.10 of 10.P.S. We were at cinema with Mom, she liked it a lot, too.", "Surprisingly awesome": "This is simply a guilt free indulgence of a movie.It's, Whitty, smooth with great twists and a amazing script but what surprised me the most with that in this movie no one actor stole the show, each fit into the movie like the most complicated puzzle to reveal a masterpiece.Massive thank you to all who was involved in creating this movie as I find it it's rare that I can watch a movie without feeling it was either missing something or could have been edited together better.Bravo to you all", "All Style and Little Substance.": "\"The Gentlemen\" follows an American marijuana kingpin in England who is looking to sell his business, setting off a chain of blackmail and schemes to undermine him.This film is a mixed bag for me. I hadn't watched any of Guy Ritchie's films prior to this - but being aware of his trademark directing style, I can understand how this film had connected with fans of Ritchie's work - many defining this as a return to his form after a few disappointments.Hence, the following review is simply a biased account of my viewing experience, and not intended to comment on the merit of the film itself.It took me a lot of patience to get through the first half, which spent its time establishing the players of the story and the intricate plot. After a while, I kept the film playing in the background, listening to it while solving a puzzle or doing some other pastime. The second half is where the film picked up, the point where the current ongoing plot connects with the hooking prologue of the film.The tone is the traditional trademark style of Guy Ritchie - which prioritizes style over substance. The style here being the cockney-accent heavy cussing, violence and contrived twists and turns in the plot. The substance - depth in character, theme explored, etc. - are all things I personally look for in a film, and I must admit I came looking for it in the wrong film. My bad.The highlight of this film are the performances and chemistry between the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey - playing the suave leader who keeps his cool until triggered, Charlie Hunnam (the dependable and resourceful right-hand man), Colin Ferrell (the foil characters who comes across the primary players and cooperates with them to be on their good side), and finally Hugh Grant (the unreliable narrator and a weasel who sides with the highest bidder).The 'twists-and-turns' nature is most prominent at the climax, which can have a polarizing effect on the audiences - depending on whether its ending feels satisfying to the audiences. I personally wasn't satisfied - given how little I connected with the characters in the first place.I can conclude that I'm not the intended audience for this film. I do like the gangster-thriller genre, but this one failed to resonate for me. However, I'm sure the target audience will have a great time watching \"The Gentlemen\", and I rate this film 7/10 out of respect for the filmmakers and their hard-work on this.", "great movie and super script - classic A": "Brilliant story\nBrilliant script\nGreat cast\nClass performance all round\nThank you \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160Please watch and have fun", "Hilarious black comedy!": "WOW there's a LOT of very successful, well known actors in this!

The comedy felt tacked on, just rehashed internet memes (characters talking about \"nightmare fuel\" and things they \"can't unsee\" felt like I was reading a Reddit thread. Beyond that I couldn't get past how poorly characterized all the characters were. Nobody stood out as having a unique personality. No chemistry between McCounaghey and Dockery. Jeremy Strong was abysmal in his role, every line delivered with a weird, Lovitzian attempt at humor. It felt like he was reading the script as a mockery. Honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen in theaters, I nearly left because it got so tedious.", "Mediocre at best": "Very disappointing, nothing like the films that made him famous.. very convoluted plot, hard to follow, old fashioned and seems like Guy Richie has been away from home so long, he embarrassingly doesn't even know what the map of his own country looks like when he displays it in the film!

The cast does a wonderful job, the characters were fun and the dialog funny and interesting. The exception to this is the actor who played Michael--sorry but very poor casting decision. Amongst such a good cast, he stood out as extremely artificial, and I found myself wondering several times if he'd ever taken an acting course before.Other than this distraction, this film was great fun!

Fust paced, full of tense and action-packed scenes, while it also took time to explore the main characters and their motivations, giving us a pretty complete picture. I didn't quite like the narrated-speculated intro, were Hugh Grant narrates the story and the action keeps cutting back and forth from the events to the conversation he is having with Charlie Hunnan's character, but it does give some comedic interaction and character development to the film, so it is still watchable (though I think it would have been best done in some other way), and once it gets past that point the twists and turns get only better.

Big league actors in this silly movie that kept my attention all throughout. Looking forward to #2.", "Ritchie back to crime and what a return!": "Guy Ritchie's last directed film was Aladdin, a film which I felt was completely wrong for Ritchie. The film wasn't the best and that's not Ritchies fault as such, I believe that this is down to the restrictions from Disney. The Gentlemen was the opposite, it's obvious that he had a lot of fun directing this film and it's Guy Ritchie back in the crime genre! What more can you want!The first act especially before Colin Farrell's character (Coach) is very slow paced and once Coach comes in, the pace picks up a hell of a lot. The plot is about Hugh Grant's character (Fletcher) is \"black mailing\" Ray and Mickey (played but Charlie Hunnam and Matthew McConaughey respectively) as Fletcher is an investigative reporter for a large tabloid paper. Mickey runs a secretive weed empire in England and Ray is his calm and collective assistant, Fletcher finds out how it is ran and is attempting to get \u00a320 million from them to stop the story from running. Meanwhile Mickey is trying to sell and get of out the game, he shows one of his weed growing sites to a potential buyer (Matthew played by Jeremy Strong). Matthew is trying to get the whole empire on the cheap and tells wannabe gangster to steal the weed and make the asking price lowered.That is the plot, it's straight forward but it's Guy Ritchie, you need to pay attention throughout, especially early on! Each character adds a lot to the film and there isn't too much forced exposition as the film is played out in one night with cut backs to what Fletcher says what he has found out. Charlie Hunnam plays a very calm and intelligent assistant with a small amount of humour which he plays very well and it's obvious that Ritchie likes to works with him since King Arthur and I'm looking forward to what Hunnam brings in the future and hopefully with Ritchie too.There is a lot of humour which mainly comes from Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who is almost unrecognisable from his usual roles but does so so well, he plays this role without a fault. His accent is flawless throughout! Mickey (McConaughey) is similar to Hunnam's character being calm most of the time, respectful and intelligent but there are points where he loses his temper and has to get his hands dirty and McConaughey has it in him, he is intimidating and threatening and doesn't even need to lift a finger. Farrell (Coach) does very well, he adds some more humour to the film and plays the character very well as a man with experience but has morales and you can tell he almost hates the new sort of gangster (like all the gangsters in this film).Overall, the film is a class act! The casting was flawless and the way the film was played out adds a real rewatch ability to this film. I feel like everyone put the film down before it come out because it was on the January premiere list but this is honestly one of the best crime films I've seen in a while, maybe even rivals crime films like The Departed. There is a lot of camera sequences like the car crash is so nice to watch, the video edits on the fights and impressive and relevant to what people would do nowadays too! This film will become a classic crime film which will hold up for years to come, I feel especially in England as it's more relatable.", "Worth waiting for": "I have to say that this is a film that gets better as it goes on. It's slow to start and honestly, it's worth sticking with it as all stories merge to show the final outcomes.\nI won't give anything away for the plot, scenes etc..... but I will say that this is a film I will happily watch again and in recent years, there haven't been many.\nLike I said, it's slow to start with but picks up and I found myself eager to find out what happens next.\nIt's a hidden gem!", "Brilliant Ritchie strikes again and does so with both barrels.": "Guy Ritchie, what else needs to be said? He's put out movies that are nothing short of classics. It's been a minute since we've seen something come out from him and he kicks in the door with The Gentlemen as a \"did you miss me\".\nIs there nothing Matthew Mcconaughey can't master in the acting world? He put on a performance that goes against anything we've seen from him before and I must say I LOVE his character and his believability.\nCharlie Hunnam gets his first chance to really shine in my opinion. He's a wonderful actor but this sets him apart as being more than just a great looking lad with tallent.\nHugh Grant, who has really fallen off the popularity list of A level actors, makes this a personal calling card to say \"I'm still here and I'm GREAT\"! And he is great in this, steals the show on many levels and you'll love him all over again!\nColin Farrell comes into the movie towards the final third but shows why hie's an A lister! Funny, versatile, and just damn believable in whatever role you give him.\nMichelle Dockery, plays Matty boys wife and gives one truly wonderful, bad ass, and funny performance.\nAs far as the plot? Who cares! You know you're going on a British gangster ride with Guy Ritchie, just sit back and enjoy brilliant actors doing brilliant things, in brilliant roles, with a brilliant storyline. Truly a classic set from day one. Bravo!", "Give this film your full attention": "I have to admit I'm a Guy Ritchie fan- have loved all his crime caper films. This is really the best yet. The plot and dialogue are really fantastic. The characters, casting and acting could not be better and the soundtrack is very original. You can't half watch it though or you will lose the plot very quickly. This is one film best appreciated on the big screen but that's not been an option of late. Sit down, put down your phone, turn down the lights and take it in. I think it's Godfather II quality with plenty of dark humor added. If you don't like it so much the first time give it another look. You'll appreciate it more the second time. If you're not a Brit you might need to look up some slang terms like \"toff\". I don't give out many 10 star ratings but this one rates it.", "Dire to me": "Fantasy school boy stuff. Each to their own but ...", "First Guy Ritchie film since his first two.": "Finally after what seems like endless studio films we have another Guy Ritchie film.This is a classic Ritchie gangster movie with rambunctious characters and a plot that involves alot of yelling and killing. Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam lead an excellent acting performance supported by McConaughey and Jeremy Strong.Third act had some introductory elements that felt shoehorned and the meta element of this being a screenplay wasn't necessary. I know the movie was trying to add something else to make it stand out from another gangster movie but that wasn't it.Still really enjoyable, acting was great, will watch again.", "Gangsta Love Actually": "OK so the plot is cool. The dialogue is cool. It is all entertaining enough : the characters are well formed and the action is fast paced. One of Ritchie strengths is that he doesn't hold back on the side characters. Even the non key players are well rounded and intruiging.What let's this movie down, in one word, is Grant. I disagree with other comments. His performance is not inspired nor spot on. It is 'East end gangster character 101'.Growing a goatee and saying a few naughty words doth not a convincing East End character make and adopting a stereotypical effeminate lisp and making a few risqu\u00e9 bottom jokes doth not a convincing homosrxual character make. Grant assumes both.A shame as his role is pivotal. Had it been played differently then the film could well have been recieved differently.", "Colin Farrell squirts sandwhich topping into a kid's eye": "Guy Ritchie is always hit or miss for me, but this might be his unsung masterpiece. The pace of this movie is fantastic. Every interesting scene leads directly into a new plot that catches your eye and keeps you engaged with the overall story.McConaughey is fantastic especially in his ending monologue, but the stand-out roles here are Charlie Hunnam as Raymond, Hugh Grant as Fletcher. And, let's don't forget Colin Farrell as the Coach who may have one of the best character establishing scenes ever.Hunnam is the scene-stealer though. I wasn't a huge fan of the Sons of Anarchy series, but I did watch a season or two. What's crazy to me are the people who loved Hunnam from Sons, but haven't seen this movie. The chase scene in the middle of the second act is perfect. The \"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\" song always gets stuck in my head and makes this sequence almost impossible to escape my mind.The trailer for this movie made it seem to be another quick cash grab movie with not a lot of heart, but that is not the case at all.Please check this out if you haven't already seen it, and put it on the shelf next to all your favorite proper gangster flicks.", "Unforgettable": "Guy Richie comes back to the British crime thriller theme in this film and he does so in a modern tone. Like Snatch the characters collide in an epic, and to many, comic climax that's pleasing. In this case the Characters are as unique as the characters in Snatch. The acting is top Notch, especially Collin Farrow, Hugh Grant and Michelle Dockery. Matthew Mcconaughey is Matthew Mcconaughey like in the Lincoln commercials. This movie ,like Snatch, is memorable and very re-watchable. Its not as sharp and politically incorrect like Snatch was, but I believe that this is done on purpose to reflect the times and is actually a theme in the movie between Millennial Drug dealers and Gen-X Drug dealers and to me its quite comical. Apparently the politically correct Critic scores do not like it. Its a Great movie its a classic you will enjoy it.", "Honest opinion": "Definitely worth watching,one of the most entertaining movies in 2020", "Snatch version 2.0 copy": "It's a very similar version of snatch.

I should have gone with my instinct to leave after the first five minutes but I endured the first 45 minutes waiting for some kind of storyline to develop and ended up walking out to watch the tail end of another movie.It seems like the writers left nothing in the script for this cast of normally great actors to get their teeth into so they spent most of their time filling the void with expletives, drug use and trying trying to offend and shock rather than act.I could have seen this in the carpark or any houso estate for free.\nSave your money folks and give this a wide berth.", "Ritchie's Channeling Shakespeare!": "I think I spent most of my first viewing with my jaw dropped to my chest. There's a hit around every corner; a 'what the...?' in every scene; a wow in every single line.I can't remember being so literally riveted to my couch, like this experience did to me, for many years. The script is truly classic and would probably work just as well on radio!Putting it mildly, I have to say that every character was perfectly cast. Even the extras must have been plucked from the top shelf.This piece HAS to be in line for a huge string of awards. Just brilliant!", "Perfect, a piece of art.": "Another Guy Ritchie masterpiece.

Honestly, this movie is proof why you should never, ever rely on critics as they're worse paid actors than anything you'd find in even the worst movies.The Gentlemen is quite frankly pure entertainment and a rare glimpse at how engaging good storytelling and convincing acting can be.In short, it is a slow burning half 'who-dunnit' half 'is-anyone-gonna-do-it?' flick in the typical prose of Guy Ritchie. The only thing I wish to add, having seen all of Guy's films is that he has well and truly come into his own here. Whilst so many directors, like Tarantino just re-use the same gags and tricks for shock value, Mr. Ritchie has proven that he isn't an old dog that can't learn new tricks and that he hasn't been asleep during the cultural shift of the last decade.The Gentlemen is a fantastic fusion of modern Britain, technology, culture (if you can call it that at this stage haha) and old school die-hard gangster/mobster vibes.There isn't a single weak performance, so you'll have yourself laughing and gasping so often that you'll need to pause and rewind this great flick. We don't deserve actors like Matthew Mcconaughey and love him or hate him but Colin Farrel does one hell of a role in this film so it's time to get off his back for that Telephone movie he did over a decade ago.Just watch this movie and stop reading reviews, you could do so much worse. If you don't like this style, then I do kind of pity you and I wish you the best with what-ever Marvel releases in the future.I really hope we get a sequel.", "What an excellent movie!": "Overall, 'The Gentlemen' is an excellent movie.

Can't say I have seen all of his work but if you have watched Snatch and Lock and Stock you won't get nothing different than a more refined but samey rendition of his style.\nThe heavy and 4th wall breaking editing is quite on the nose and distracting, adding little to the plot. Luckily enough past the first quarter of the movie it tones done quite a bit, and by the first third the plot starts finally picking up, making the experience quite enjoyable.", "Not worth watching": "How does this film have such a high rating on IMDB is beyond me. This movie is neither funny, nor engaging, nor thrilling, nor entertaining as Ritchie probably must've intended it. So it fails on all these points miserably.It is filled with the ensemble of good actors but some of their performance is so bad it is hard to comprehend.Editing tricks and and character gimmicks Ritchie uses here were perhaps effective or innovative twenty years ago but now they just look outdated and disconnected.I addition, the music in the movie is absolutely awful.Ritchie had two very good films: \"Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch\" (although \"The Men From UNCLE\" is not too bad either).

This is most definitely a GR film - it possesses all of his trademarks, (which appear to have monetarily increased over the years), but definitely 'Mr Machismo'.What delighted me was a stand-out performance by Mr Grant. Even without the 'foppish-boy' looks of yesteryear, (sorry, we're the same age, so I can empathise with the wrinkles and hair colour); the Oscar Wilde acerbic nuances and the 'Golly, gosh, 'crikey' or 'my days', vocabulary is replaced by a rhotacism that encapsulates his character. I desperately wanted him to remove the dark glasses because I could faintly see his eyes, behind them, adding more insecurity to his bravado. Tonal qualities; pace; intonation; timing; diction; enunciation; reaction and colloquial/demographic expression were all there in a completely believable manner.Put to the back of your minds 'Notting Hill; L.

Virtues such as courage and loyalty even though the subject matter revolves around drugs.The format of the movie is creative with performances that transforms actors to memorable characters. The movie is a swift 2 hours long and easy to follow. When people look for representation in film they look for melanin, genitals and what genitals people are attracted to. I don't mind a movie with that in mind every so often but these have become boxes people seek to check. Instead here you will find riverly between jewish, american, and asian drug dealers. I love a movie that doesn't shy away from using a characters background as a way to insult them.

One line witty 'Landan' Sarcasm is all still there, just with added finesse, you will really love spending time with these guys.\nHowever, Henry Golding doesn't really have much to do but is charming all the same (not doing his Bond chances any harm). Unfortunately it's the Women that suffer, only one good female performance from Michelle Dockery, who always manages to hold her own. Maybe Guy is just a guys' guy and therefore writes better for.. you know ... guys.\nWhere this film really comes to life is when the familiar old school' gentlemen' gangsters cross paths with the younger generation. Bringing the film right in line with the you tube genaration, an amazing\"fight \" scene picks the pace up ten fold.\nThe bewilderment of the old firm when trying to deal with the new is where it's at its most fun\n(especially when it takes a sub machine gun to get a point across).

Violent. Offensive in many ways. What's not tl love?": "Guy Ritchie is one of those film makers you either love or hate. That's OK, because this is definitely one of those films - I can't imagine anyone being ambivalent about it.Now when I first heard about it I saw the two headline stars and thought it would be some sort of rom-com. Somehow I managed tio remain under a rock for a while so I never realised just how wrong I was until I watched it on a flight. Which was unfortunate because it was late and I was laughing. A lot.So if you were on that flight...sorry.It's brilliantly acted. The casting is perfect - I love people playing out of character parts, and Hugh Grant most definitely isn't playing the usual, um, Hugh Grant.The script is fantastic, with even the most offensive dialogue being used in suchj a way that it doesn't feel gratuitous and somehow becomes less offensive and more funny.The violence is actually surprisingly low-key and again it's part of the story rather than thrown in to shock.Yeah. I really enjoyed it. Particularly the scenes with The Coach...and I don't normally like Colin Farrell very much (haven't forgiven him for the truly awful Running Man reboot)", "As a POC, can you stomach this movie?": "Great story telling, very anti-pc as another reviewer put it but going straight to the point, the movie should come with a warning to people of colour. Not eveyone could stomach the all the strongly reinforced depressing representation of POC. The director surely had good intentions in his pursuit of anti-political correctness but as a person of colour, the movie was entertaining but also left me with a nagging disappointment. My thoughts at the end were, \" is this narrative ever going to change?\"", "A boring if old fan, attempt at comedy in a criminal background": "I have to say the latest British gangster film The Gentlemen from Guy Richie, so hyped, while more of a comedy and intendedly so was given an avg rating of 8/10. I give it a 6.0. Other than an all-star cast, which did their best given the writing (Colin Farrell, Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam etc.) the movie was such a bore, a sub par buildup of a literal narrator from the very start and if you have seen all of his previous films, a total rehash. Like an absurdly meh attempt at rehashing some Snatch with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with a Triple-A cast that just..came of so weak. The action scenes were strong but extremely rare in the very short amount of time the movie takes place. Seriously it less then 2 hours long with like, *SPOILER ALERT* 3 action scenes are best that are even remotely interesting. Given movies like John Wick and The Equalizer, hell even The Irishman, this movie is like watching a soap opera..and not the good kind. This felt like a family friendly Snatch but with seriously less focus on actual acting. The entire film was basically a focus on the narrator, this was its largest weakness. The main characters of the entire movie came off as side characters while the narrator, who turns out to be a piece of crap who probably dies in the end *you are left wondering* gets all the screen time. This never happened in Snatch or Lock, Lon and Loaded in which the movie was narrated as it progressed by the main protagonist, it gave sorta of a safe feeling of hope that at least the story with end with him being alive, imprisoned or will continue on but he was a likable main protagonist, there is nothing of the sort in the one here. One is left wondering, why? Why such a boring narrator who is basically a bad guy, snitch and why such lack of real action criminal underworld scenes? This felt like a comedic take on the genre but like, childish given the cast. It is an insult to the actors, The Irishman actually was a real crime genre film, this does not deserve the title of gangster or crime at all. The audience laughed more than anything, it was more of a comedy than a gangster film which I think was the wrong direction.Before it felt like it was an actual crime film with comedic elements tying it all together but it was believable, terrifying and real. This movie came off as confused about which genre it was trying to pull more for. I seriously felt like I watched a Superbad for crime movies spoofing Guy Richie. Like if Guy Richie just spoofed himself with a lame copy/paste. There were some strong scenes, but overall, what a disappointment.\nCould say more but then it would just be comparing it to Snatch and Lock, Stock and it wouldn't be fair to it...because in my opinion fails in every comparison.", "Guy Ritchie knocks it outta the park": "If you haven't already watched this movie then go look at yourself in the mirror and punch yourself in the face.

This is one of them. As a movie in this genre I'd have to say it's one of the best ever made, if not the best. It's got it all and it's a real treat to behold, in all it's aspects. The cast is perfect, the plot and pacing too; I simply love it, and it was just as beautifully good the second and third time as well. My only gripe with it is that I already knew it the following sessions. The characters are as well thought out as in Richie's other movies in the genre, if not even more so this time around, and I was especially delighted to see Colin Farrell as the coach. His odd ball characterization was danged great. Then again it was awesome to follow all of the respective characters in the movie, everyone really brought their absolute A-game. This movie is simply a masterpiece and I can't recommend it enough.Just go see it if you haven't already, it's totally worth the time.", "Great score overall, but not my type i guess": "We are set in the UK, deep into organiced crime and drug mass production.

I did liked also the comedic side of it, carefully balanced to not make it goofy.\nIn comparison with his previous work i surrelly tell you, Guy Ritchie is back at it again.Good movie, not quite my taste but would defenetly recommed you to see it.", "Guy Ritchie back to his best!!": "Loved this film! Perfect cast apart from Charlie Hunnam and that weird accent he's got going on.\nGreat story and it's left wide open for a sequel.", "Modern British Crime Movie": "This felt like a modern take on those old crime movies but with a British touch.The story is told through a narration.

Hugh Grant as the protagonist is, of course, fantastic. Boring/poorly thought-out ending. Moderately enjoyable in a typical Guy Ritchie way, up until the flippant attempted rape scene... which literally serves no purpose. The same reaction from McConaughey's character could've been triggered without it. It's disappointing that they thought it was necessary. It's crass. Casting was alright - not sure on some of the accents, as expected. Nothing made it special, I wouldn't watch it again.", "Best gangster in a decade": "The writing was awesome, directing was awesome, story simple with a proper twist.

As I specified in the title, I have seen two Ritchie movies before this one, and I didn't like them both at all: Wrath of Man, which I found really boring and slow, and above all King Arthur, which I consider one of the worst films I have ever seen. So I can say that I had my good reasons not to be totally convinced. But honestly I think I got the wrong movie, because I really loved The Gentlemen.It's a wonderfully structured movie, with a splendid narration and above all fantastic characters (I particularly liked the one of Charlie Hunnam, and here, unlike King Arthur, he shows more than one facial expression). I loved it from start to finish, and when I finished it I swear I even gave a round of applause towards the screen...but in some ways this thing made me nervous.Seeing that Guy Ritchie is capable of making such great movies, it made me angry to see that he also made the two aforementioned movies (and which, as I said, I didn't like at all). But I'm happy that now I know what he's capable of. Good job, Ritchie. I can say I \"made peace\" with you.", "I have no words...": "I had the chance to see this in the cinema in 2020 but didn't go see it which I then new was a mistake because after watching Guy Ritchie's \"Wrath of man\" since I'm a huge Jason Statham fan and really liking the movie I looked up \"The Gentlemen\" on IMDb and saw the high rating. I tried to get the movie everywhere but couldn't but yesterday I saw the movie on Netflix in the country I'm on right now for vacation and immediately decided to watch it. And DAMNNNNNN I was blown away. The movie has no \"slow parts\" in it with every talking scene having some sort of tension to it. The dialogue is well written, it's filmed really nicely, it's got some extremely hilarious scenes in it, the acting is as good as it gets with a godly cast. The movie is perfect. It does have a bit of violence and some scenes could be described as disgusting or disturbing and the language is quite bad at times but nothing out of the ordinary. The movie overall on the other hand is extremely above the ordinary and, if you've got the chance, don't even hesitate to watch it. Trust me you won't regret it.", "Another hit for Guy Ritchie": "If you liked Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels you will like the Gentlemen.", "Ritchie The Lion": "Who cares what critics write,or any of us :), if I want to read something that would be some literature and not films critics.", "Non-stop Action": "Classic Guy movie.

In fact this was the first movie of his I ever watched. But I gotta say I was pretty surprised. I walked into the theatre expecting nothing more than a decent crime movie and instead I left having seen a great one.As far as the technical side of things goes it's pretty great. The movie is shot with personality and it feels like you see a different technique or shot every few minutes. The editing had its own flare as it felt quick but still professional. Besides those things everything else was fine on the technical side of things.When it comes to the screenplay, dialogue, characters, acting, etc; there is a bit more to talk about. As far as characters and the acting goes it was great. The characters were all memorable and fun to watch and were complimented by good performances from all the actors alike.When it comes to the story it could be a bit more fine tuned. There are one or two points where things feel a bit jumbled and the movie starts to shove a bit too much exposition down your throat, and while not enough to ruin the movie it was enough to weigh it down a bit. Fortunately when these exposition dumps happened the style and manner in which the dialogue is delivered still sells it pretty well.And speaking of delivery of dialogue the witting of aforementioned dialogue is good. The lines are witting and funny most of the time and this movie managed to get a few chuckles out of me. Even when there is a weak line the actors deliveries are able to sell it.Overall this movie is a fun crowd pleaser that has a engaging style that has convinced me to check out some of Guy Ritchies other movies, so check it out.", "Should not be scored less than 8!": "How people are reviewing this as anything under 8 stars is beyond me! Perhaps it's the method of direction and production, but this is a Guy Ritchie film through and through!!Up there with Snatch and an absolute treat to watch. All the fast paced twists and turns we love from Ritchie, a lot of witty black humour and a fantastic cast. Whilst he only gets minimum screen time, Colin Farrell is fantastic!

The casting is just wrong in almost every way, McConaughey and Hunnan In this genre are about as interesting as watching paint dry and even Hugh Grant is not a good choice as the storyteller. The only redeeming main character is Colin Farrel as the coach, his quick tongue and London style swagger make him believable. If you've been living in a place like the UK for any length of time you take on some local mannerism, your accent changes, you integrate, McConaughey and Hunnan's characters did none of that.\nGuy Ritchie has 2 movies in my top ten best movies of all time so I'm definitely a fan, but this just looks like a made for America UK Crime Comedy, and that doesn't make sense or work.", "Fantastically Crafted": "I came to the movies to kill some time and had seen the trailer for this a few weeks ago.

I loved Guy Ritchies 'Snatch' and 'lock stock & two smoking barrels' but other films I've seen of his, never came to being anywhere near as good as the previously mentioned (until now). So after seeing this film, I was actually impressed! At no moment during the film did I think 'this is feeling dragged out' or 'boring', instead I was completely engaged with the complex plots filled with a mix of different hilarious characters.'The Gentlemen' is a very fast paced and confusing film. The moment you take your eyes of the screen you've missed the next plot twist or a really good laugh. Because of the complexity of the story you would have to pay attention constantly. For some this would be a pain but I didn't have any issues with this as I was genuinely entertained by the film enough, to pay full attention the whole time.My only issue with the film is that 'The Gentlemen' is very forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good movie but it's just so forgettable and blends in amongst many over films of the same genre. I can confidently say however, I would easily recommend 'The Gentlemen' to people that like this style of film and humour. If you're after a confusing but intriguing story filled with a mix of characters, violence and a lot of swearing, this film is definitely for you.Viewed on Netflix\n27/2/22.", "Class apart.

Depicting gangs has never been about an attempt to \"moralise\", but instead a way of complicating and presenting racial / class dynamics in an ambiguous way. These are not supposed to be heroes and villains, and it's frankly odd and misplaced of Ritchie to suggest that \"loving your wife\" and \"hating junkies\" are enough to redeem gang violence and countless other abhorrent acts.\nThe Gentleman's insistent fetish for a \"nostalgic past\" led to an unpalatable amount of racial slurs and derogatory terms that were just cringeworthy. We get it, free speech man.\nNonetheless, I enjoyed Hugh Grant's frame narrative a lot which prodded necessary fun at these structures. Also really enjoyed Colin Farrell, which again complicated the rigidity of these outdated structures.\n5/10.", ".": "1 hour in and zzzz. Boring.

Nothing made me excited about any of these characters or the situations that they are involved in, yet the movie is structured supposing that i'm totally hyped. Jokes don't work, yet the film is full of them. Dialogues are written as if the audience already knows how badass these characters are, yet the characters don't ever do anything, and the only real confrontation resolves with McConaughey just shooting the bad guy in a face - yeah, right... very clever. That part with the \"youtubers\" made no sense and was painful to watch anyway. I used to be a fan though.", "Nearly as good as Snatch!": "I love Snatch - Brad Pitt's performance is fabulous. Guy Ritchie has been away from this genre for a while. He has done some different films too ( I liked King Arthur )I was really concerned as Charlie Hunnam always seems to be playing Jax Teller but the one on one with a slimy Hugh Grant ( The character was slimy not our Hugh) linked everything together really well.This film had Ritchie's lots of interacting plots but at a different social class level than Snatch.Thoroughly enjoyed the film and watched it again.

It was just CRINGE.

Guy Ritchie back doing what he does best, with another cast of characters, a great soundtrack, and some surprises to keep the watcher on their toes. Nice to have a different spin from previous films of his, and some of the actors play against usual roles to shine in another way.I simply can't get enough of the way Ritchie intertwines reveal different stories into one seamless plot, no matter whether it's Lock Stock, Snatch, RockNRolla, or this film, he never disappoints in this genre.I don't need to break down the plot for you, I can only assume you will want to see the film in all its glory, and i promise you, you will enjoy it.

It is also no typical mafia film like one knows it, because it is primarily about the story as around power or drugs what, however, still a role in him film plays. A star deduction gives it still there the stories at the end a little bit compulsive tries to surprise the spectator by sudden idioms and without to spoilers I find the last action of the boxers a little bit questionably after them knew what mighty and dangerous type of the principal characters is.

And this is just the beginning.The whole movie is like putting together a puzzle, and at the end you get the full picture. You can't get distracted, otherwise you will definitely miss a detail that will be absolutely necessary in the future. I dare say that 'Gentlemen', due to such an intricate plot, can alienate a certain part of the audience. But, I definitely liked it, and here are a couple more moments, in addition to the plot, that make this movie high-quality and highly appreciated.I would like to characterize the film with such adverbs as 'beautiful and stylish'. Immediately the question: 'The film is about a drug lord. What's beautiful here, where's the style?' I answer. Actors' dialogues, action scenes, detailed shots, and, of course, costumes and images in general - all this looks exactly 'beautiful and stylish'. Each external image of the hero is the embodiment of British aesthetics. The characters are pleasant to look at and interesting to listen to - the dialogues in the film are witty and sarcastic.Well, how not to say about the great merit of the cast, they perfectly embodied the images on the screen, although it was not worth expecting anything else, because these people have long proven their professionalism.And, another point is humor, which is woven into this picture like a red thread, and makes it more lively and ironic than it could be without it.", "Goof at 1:18:43": "As the camera pans in on Pearson and Ray sitting in the Mercedes Benz , on the right side of the street is a black van parked with this name on the side \" GRITCHIE \" .Also another Goof is when the crew that broke into Pearsons farm and shot the video with their cars in it , the easiest way to have found out who the crew was , would have been just run their license plates . Its hard to stay incognito when your tags are displayed on the front bumper if your cars .", "Absolutely magnificent !!!": "Funny, dark humored, yet classy and thrilling masterpiece.A movie, that features some of the greatest actors of our time, combined with the unique directing style, which Guy Ritchie is known for, offers an exciting and phenomenal cinematic experience.The way he develops the storyline through the use of plot twists and use of different narratives captivates the viewers and makes it impossible to loose excitement throughout the film. In addition to that, the unlinear use of time catches the audiences attention and offers different insights into the lifes of the characters and their development throughout the story.The excellent combination of drama, thriller and comedy makes you experience the entire spectrum of emotions in a manner that pulls you into another world.Its serious topics, as for example drug use, addiction, and corruption, are presented to the viewer from different points of view. Once you add just a tiny bit of drama and a tasteful amount of dark humor you end up with a masterpiece that is barely comparable to any other movie.This is exactly what cinema is supposed to be and most definitely one of my all-time favorites. We highly recommend this film to anyone with even the slightest amount of taste!!!", "Brilliant Movie": "Everyone who gives 1 on this site is a heater of the work of specific director or does not like main actors!

Luckily my excitement didnt bite me in the butt as usual, The Gentlemen is amazing. All the actors in this movie do an incredible job at playing such unique characters, especially Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant. Every single scene in this movie had me 100% captivated, the action was great and the dialogue was hilarious, this movie is so quotable especially, again, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grants characters. This movie is a 10/10 for me and will be watched every few months by me just like snatch.", "Can't stand the racial jokes": "Script isn't too bad but the racial jokes made it very uncomfortable to watch.", "Solid film": "Solid cast, story and style.

For me, this is in my top 2 after Snatch, of course.A must watch movie!", "Guy Ritchie's best movie ever": "This movie is fantastic. The soundtrack and the charachters are great. Guy Ritchie did a great job. One of the best movies I have ever seen. A masterpiece. I really hope there wil be a sequel.", "Reference Sickboy": "I need to preface the following, by stating that I like Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Colin Farrell, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding and Guy Ritchie is a BJJ Black Belt. I also own Snatch, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. That being said, the movie was an empty suit, a hollow shell. It was completely void of the humor one comes to expect from Guy Ritchie or the convoluted intersecting plot lines that come together in the end. The femme fatale had zero sex appeal. Zero fun. I realize this is anecdotal evidence, but people walked out. As a fly on the wall, in the restroom taking a leak, the sentiment was similar. Not sure how it is 8.1. The masses know very little. I'm already making allowances for one of the two most trite, formulaic genres, the gangster flick. I'm reminded of Sickboy's pearl of wisdom in Trainspotting. The first one, as I don't recognize the abortion of a sequel. \"It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life. What do you mean? Well, at one time you've got it, then you lose it and it's gone forever. All walks of life..... \" All I'm trying to do Mark, is to help you understand that The Name Of The Rose is merely a blip in an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.\" Guy Ritchie also shits on Coppola's masterpiece, The Conversation. An original idea which illustrates the paramount importance of intonation. Nearly 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Leave it out mate.", "Best movie": "What a awsome film!

Repeating the lines to your friends. That kind of brilliance.If you loved Lock Stock or Snatch, go see it. If you can't afford to see it, watch it at a friend's. If you don't have any friends, use your imagination!This movie was good enough to stop me reminding myself not to move so much during a showing.

How many fabulous looking guys can overshadow the gorgeous STAR of the movie in glasses, beards, and slicked-back hair? Can you say Charlie Hunnam, Colin Farrell, and possibly even Hugh Grant? The story was impressive - I love something different. It would have been much less so without the right actors. They nailed the casting. Even the diva (Roz) would have been so much less interesting in the part if she was any better looking (although it took watching it a second time for me to figure this out). GOOD FLICK. I wonder if Marn Davies would be amenable to writing an entire movie about this Colin Farrell character - it would be glorious!", "Incredibly smart !!!": "A very very good written and directed movie with great actors and great twists .\nReally well done I can just recommend it .", "Casual rape isn't supposed to be appealing": "Honestly, I enjoyed the first part of the movie for what it is, the dialogue is great and it's well made, but predictable. The actors are fantastic. However, it's 2020; come on. The rape scene caught me completely off guard, brought nothing to the story other than to belittle the women. Everything after that just felt cheap to me. Dear directors, you have a responsibility to avoid these dated tropes that women are nothing but property.

A movie I couldn't escape into.The music, acting and characters in this film were top tier but for some reason I just couldn't get into the story. Nothing held any importance until the end, which is fine but the way it was done made the film feel slow as your waiting for the climax - and the ending and character arcs weren't as satisfying as I had hoped. In between, there were some cool moments and action scenes, and the dynamic between Fletcher and Ray was super intriguing and enticing. Love the cinema and screenplay format of storytelling from fletcher as well, and love that big misdirect. That was a cool concept, but tie it all together and it was meh.I'm super into comedic crime/mystery movies right now but this one just didn't hit for me.

Rest is , ur choice .", "Guys sense of story telling if great": "Enjoyable way to pass the time in a well spun story with fine pacing. The all star cast was an added bonus, but not necessary as Guy's screen play, direction and editing could have launched any lesser known actor to a higher place.

The perfect amount of story line mixed with suspense, great dialogue, and of course gangsters and crime.Metacritic has lost all credibility and proven themselves to be fake elitist losers, the same ones that gave bad reviews to The Joker.This is a throwback to the timeless classics like Pulp Fiction that you just don't see anymore", "Huge Guy Ritchie fan, but...": "I must say the I've been waiting on pins and needles to see this. Guy Ritchie is by far one, if not my favorite director so I really really wanted to like this, but I must say, I was disappointed. While it had an outstanding cast, the script just did not seem like it was written for them. Also, it was very slow, and no amazing scene like Snatch's fight, Lock's massive gun shoot out, RocknRolla's outside of the nightclub fight scene with \"The Subways\" playing in the background.

Everyone involved in this movie preform their role to perfection in this engaging back and forth British crime. The movie is led by the brilliant performance of Hugh Grant, as well as a phenomenal performances from Charlie Hunnam and Colin Farrell, and Matthew McConaughey's best performance to date. I myself am a huge fan of British crime movies/shows, so this was right up my alley. The story is interesting and engaging to the audience. It's hard to pinpoint a specific performance as all involved really pulled their own.

The narrator was so irritating was that I was rooting for him to get attacked by the character he's telling the story to. The characters are painful to listen to, they are pretentious without even having clever dialogue, seeming like profoundly stupid people pretending to be smart.I only paid 99 cents to rent the movie, and i'd like to get my money back.", "Pure class from Guy Ritchie": "Fantastic movie.

There was no boring moment throughout the entire film. The cast was all-star and the plot was attention grasping. The film did not see R rated except for the swearing but that's excepted from a crime thriller. I think anyone older than 15 would be fine watching it. The violence is like a PG13 rather than a violent R film. Wonderful film overall! I would definitely watch again!", "Bang on.": "Loved the movie. It's like boom boom boom.

I went and quickly watched the King Arthurish King Arthur movie and quickly forgot about him.\nI was working my way through Scorsese and Tarantino movies when I came accross \"Lock, Stock, and two Smoking Barrels\" went from this to \"Snatch\" to \"RocknRolla\" and never looked back.Movies about crime and boxing that take themselves seriously enough to be worth the watch, but lightly enough you don't end up depressed at the end.\"The Gentlemen\" is a return to form. Acting is excellent, but the writing is what brings this home.I got sucked into the action and often laughed out loud. \"Snatch\" beats this one as my favorite, but this one dodges buckshot and comes in as second.Highly recommended.", "Marvelous crime mafia caper with all the right ingredients": "Guy Ritchie does a splendid job with the direction, screenplay and cinematography. The music score complements the high paced drama unfolding on screen. The acting is spectacular led by a very natural Matthew McConaughey, a completely different but brilliant Hugh Grant and the sturdy Colin Farrell. The stars don't disappoint and are made stronger by excellent performances by the entire cast. Not a single fault, down to the goons. This attention to detail with inadvertent cuts and a quirky style of filming is what brings Richie's story to life.\nThe messages are stellar and it doesn't hold back any punches. Go and watch this in the theatre! An excellent 2 hours.", "An exciting watch.": "Didn't go into this movie expecting much. My first thought was that it is a clich\u00c3\u00a9 action movie with a predictable plot. Turns out it's not.

Even if at first the story intro didn't get me as much as I would want to, it got better and better.\nGuy Richie really brought back a little of Lock Stock and two smoking barrels, a movie that I truelly loved.\nThis movie was very funny at parts, flawless in the script, the conversations were really good, and the actors really did their jobs convincing me of their roles.\nOverall, I really really loved it", "Gentlemen": "Had fun, kept my attention, great acting. Would recommend.", "Might be Guy Ritchie's best movie yet": "Guy Ritchie is in fine form with this slick and highly entertaining crime caper. It's peppered with more swearing than any other Ritchie film to date and breaks every rule in the PC handbook. It should see reviewers from liberal media like Salon have an aneurysm. The acting is just superb throughout, with a special shout out should go to a very cockney Hugh Grant who plays a character that is very far removed from his Notting Hill days. Violent, funny, crafty and extremely well directed. Highly recommended", "Appalling Racism": "Shocked by the white supremacy and wide racism towards other race and ethnic groups surfaced in the movie. Disgusting.", "Yeesh that script.": "I assume it's the script, because surely all those actors weren't that terrible at the same time in the same movie. Very unbelievable lines, characters sounded like no actual human. At most like nerdy teens role-playing as gangsters in some tabletop RPG.One liners sounded like lines from a cheap self help book.Stopped the movie after \"when a lions hungry, he eats'.", "Could of been so much more.": "Firstly I must say the there are good things about this movie just a few bad things that let the filn as a whole down. The story was good, witty, with a shy bit of British dry humour. Those of you that know of the comedian Jack Dee will know what I mean. Now to the bad, having an 18 rating could of made this movie a 10/10 if it was used correctly. If you are going to make an 18 rated british ganster movie, you need to add the correct level of violence. There was hardly any. It's as if the continuous use of the c word was in hope to make up for what was clearly a budgeting issue. This movie clearly used up too much of it's budget on the actors leaving not enough needed to make full use of having an 18 rating.I would not recommend watching this in a cinema and wasting the money on what you are made to believe is an action packed British gangster/comedy. The lack of needed violence lets the film as a whole down.", "It's been done": "Unfortunately it didn't live up to Snatch. Too cockney, no character development, not dark or shocking enough, did play to the actors natural humour.Well produced and acting was okay but not a patch on snatch....

After seeing the trailer, I was more than convinced that this film was him returning to his genre with grace and that I had to see this in theatres. Was able to catch it on the last day it was showing in my country.First off, the script is pure Ritchie. And by that, I mean that the characters do not hesitate to use their expletives but Mr Ritchie uses them perfectly and comically. The entire cast does justice to their characters and it's hard to take your eyes off any of them, especially Colin Farrell as Coach and Hugh Grant as Fletcher, my God these guys can act! The people who think that this movie is homophobic, racist and sexist either think that criminals are all polite and tolerant people or that people in real-life don't actually talk like this. If so, they need to stay away from these kinds of movies because it's not for them. All in all, great movie, would watch it again in theatres if I could!Just two major drawbacks I have to the film: 1) the sub-plot with Pearson being asked to find Laura felt like it was straight out of Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake, another movie I love, and 2) The almost-rape scene with Dry Eye and Rosalind Pearson at the film's climax. While I don't normally shy away from such scenes, it just felt a bit gratuitous, especially since Ritchie's brand of violence and gore is meant to be much more comedic. My friends and I were laughing at almost every other instance of violence in the film. It may just be me since I wasn't expecting it, but I felt it was a tad too much.Overall, loved it! Would highly recommend it!!!", "Pure Brilliance": "Masterful writing, beautiful acting and cinematography unparalleled. This movie is everything I want and Ritchie has once again put together a great mix. Not only easily the best since Snatch but perhaps on par with the quality of depth.", "Wasted Potential": "This could have been a terrific film.Unfortunately, it isn't.The premise is interesting, the narration is good and the cast is excellent. One can immediatley get sucked into the plot and look forward to it. The dialogues and conversation are mediocre. Much of the problem here comes from overuse of profanityThere is nothing wrong with using profanity, but the way it used in the film, it is rather unnecessary and forceful.The direction and background score are also average. The film takes a good story and cast but is too casual with the execution. They have also poorly utilized British humor. Many people think there are some dark jokes here, unfortunately it is just more unnecessary profanity and not really humerous.It is a watchable movie, but it absolutely does not merit anything above a 7 on a good day!", "so out of touch with reality": "This film is like watching a cast of washed up rich straight white actors who lost touch with all emotion. The acting is cold and brutal like Brechtian drama, but without the self awareness.", "A reasonably entertaining crime thriller": "For all the reviewers boasting about The Gemtelman being one of Guy Richies \"best\" movies and the other gloating 9 and 10 star reviews, they are either completely made up or the reviewers haven't seen enough crime and comedy movies.The acting from the leading characters is not Oscar worthy here, they aren't bad either but just rather ok and average. The plot is moderately intetesting and the story as a whole is intetesting enough as it moves along briskly to keep you watching.Definately not one of Guy Ritchies best but overall a very decent crime thriller compared to other movies that have come out this year.7/10 overall.", "very nice": "The storry is telled excellent! very good movie also funny, but not too funny!", "Very Stretched": "I was not interested as the movie was not binding to the story and story telling stuff was pretty over the top", "Deserves a better rating, 7.9 isn't fair": "One of the most brilliant films I've ever watched, it is just magnificent, acting/directing/story/anticipation/thriller/comedy...

They're all really trying to be 'ard men and while the film has some nice plot twists, its kind of Samey.On a positive note, Colin Farrell is, as always fantastic. I really wish I could say the same for Charlie Hunham because I REALLY want to see him in something good because since Sons of Anarchy he's had a really had time.There are certainly worse ways to spend and evening, but if its between this or layercake ...go with Daniel Craig.", "A must watch": "Amazing performances by the whole cast, fantastic writting and directing, an absolute gem of a movie.", "I found it extraordinary, especially the climax.": "This is my first movie of Guy Ritchie. I have never seen any movies under his direction. As I read other reviews and his other movie reviews, I think I will have to watch his other films. Also about the gentlemen, this is ridiculous. This movie made my time. Really, every time the plot changes I felt much excitement. And every plot changing was amazing. Matthew McConaughey was perfect in his character. I liked him and also the quote,\"if you wish to be the king of the jungle its not enough to act like the king, you must be the king\" . About Charlie Hunnam, he works for Matthew in the film. I found his character a loyal man. Every time the plot changes, he stands behind it. And Hugh Grants works at the end really made me lough.", "Another great from Guy Ritchie": "Loved this movie!

Colin Farrell is hilarious, Charlie Hunnam is fabulous, Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as always, Michelle Dockery leaves Downtown far behind her in all the best ways, not a fan of Hugh Grant but he plays his part wonderfully. This movie leaves you wondering where Guy Ritchie's head is to write a story like this and the inclusion of the \"pig video\" left my sides aching laughing.

This movie ranks along side Guy Ritchie's best. 'Lock Stock', 'Rock and Rolla' and 'Snatch' are amongst the best British movie's and 'The Gentlemen' slots in superbly amongst them. As with the aforementioned titles casting was key, and wow were the right choices made for this title. For me personally,the choosing of Matthew McConaughey was as clever as the choosing of Brad Pitt in 'Snatch'. Before watching I wasnt to sure with the casting but after seeing his performance wow! And having his Hollywood prowess working so well alongside Charlie ' Jax Teller ' Hunnam. As a hard core SOA fan seeing Charlie on screen is always a pleasure, ( and its a good job he wore glasses as without you can see why hes so typecast with Samcro ) and he pulled of the dry sarcastic side amazingly well too. From the story all the way through to the chosen soundtrack....this is a collection of amazing choices and more importantly performances.

No channel guide so I had no idea what was on, no idea what movie this was or what it was about. But hearing the British accent made me stop surfing and watch.Typical British humor, totally irreverent, refreshingly devoid of beeps and censorship and full of hilarious one-liners. It had me hooked immediately so I watched it to the end. Then I googled movies with Matthew Mcconaughey and Henry Golding and only then did I find out the title. Hugh Grant was so good in it, playing against his usual role of affable upper class twit, that I didn't even realize it was him. Nor did I recognize Colin Farrell, who was also superb. So now that I know what it's called, I have watched it in its entirety and enjoyed it just as much again.Great cast, great plot (yes, there really is one, although a lot of it is shown as flashbacks), loads of twists and turns and classic one-liners. Don't understand all the negative reviews on here saying it's boring - maybe you need to be a Brit to understand some of the dialog - but I was thoroughly entertained for the 2 hours.

The violence is not the problem we all like Tarantino movies, nice character development, interesting plot...but this it's garbage.

Could not listen to any more of Hugh Grant's documentary.", "Gentleman's": "In our century, large multipliers have finally fallen into the abyss of money. Full-length cartoons rarely appear on cinema screens, the creators of which did not limit themselves to just one desire to make money. It makes no sense, there is no logic, there is no plot depth at all, but cute cardboard creatures mutter some nonsense from the screen, because the children will like it, they will also want a toy from the accompanying merchandise.Therefore, few expected from the director, who gave the world annoying 'minions', something more. In vain.Klaus - does not fit all of the above, from the word at all.This cartoon has a full-fledged and competent plot, the purpose of which is to show an extremely sincere and, at the same time, tragic story. Christmas story. Yes, there is a standard clich\u00c3\u00a9 of the transformation of a negative character into a positive one, but it is in place, it works 100%. A plus is morality, which will easily reach even the smallest viewer, but isn't that the main thing in cartoons?The picture is also surprising visually. Firstly, it is 2D (why not?), and secondly, the artists have neglected many laws of anatomy, so the characters can have matchstick-thick legs, a head larger than the body, or even be the size of a one-story house. All this looks unusual, however, it works great for the images of the characters in the picture.The musical accompaniment is on top, it conveys the emotional component of many scenes well.Outcome. Klaus is a wonderful Christmas cartoon with a good plot, well-written characters and an unusual visual component that evokes a certain nostalgia for the cartoons of the 90s and zero. Ideal for family viewing.", "Gentlemen as a lifestyle": "An incredible picture in which the charisma and strength of real men are shown, bandits, shootings, revenge, all this is in this film. Those who watched \"Peaky Blinders\" should appreciate this film because they really are similar in atmosphere and message, and those who have not watched, be sure to watch both of these films.

Thank you for making it.", "Surprisingly Great Movie": "A fun night at the movies awaits!\nMickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) is looking to get out of his drug empire, so he's looking to sell it off. What we get, though, is a whole lot of chaos and laughs along the way.Today is January 23rd, so when I went to see this movie I wasn't expecting a good movie. January movies are full of garbage a lot of the time, so I thought this could be next line of filth that Hollywood wanted to give us at this time of year, but this is not what happened.\"The movie was actually GREAT\"Guy Ritchie, the writer and director of the film, is most known for \"Snatch\", which is also a movie that involves a ton of chaos and laughs, and \"The Gentlemen\" is much of the same. If I had to describe this movie in one sentence it would be as follows:\"It's what 'Knives Out' wanted to be.\"\"Knives Out\" came out last year and many people enjoyed it. It was a \"who done it\" film with a ton of self aware comedy and plenty of action but, to me, the comedy didn't quite stick the way Rian Johnson wanted it to, but \"The Gentlemen's\" humor does stick with us in this film. And yes, there is plenty of mystery to go around in the film, which makes the action sequences and the dry British humor that much better.When we think Guy Ritchie, we think of humor but something that might be overlooked is the style of his movies. They are stylistic. It might come as a surprise that dry British humor can also have a sort of artistic style to go with it but it can. From the closeups to the quick cut action shots, Guy Ritchie delivers and he delivers this same style to \"The Gentlemen.\"Is there an acting performance that stands out from this movie? No, I don't think one actor steals the show or carries it. The whole cast does a good job at teaming up to make this a fun, comedic, action filled movie. Though, I will say, Hugh Grant is quite good in his scenes and so is Colin Farrell. Much of the same could be said about Charlie Hunnam, who I'm not the most familiar with.This wasn't your average January movie, and could have definitely been a Summer movie if the studios so wished to do so. If you liked \"Snatch\" you will love this movie a ton, but even if you didn't I would still go for Matthew McConaughey and his easy coolness.\"Alright, alright, alright.\"", "Guy Ritchie - From Cutting Edge To Just Plain Dull": "This really would've been a great, entertaining flick ten ... heck, maybe even seven years ago. But Mr. Ritchie's magic formula simply doesn't measure up in this case. Scenes which would've had a 'shock and awe' effect on the viewer once upon a time - now seem overdone to the point of being ridiculous and farcical.Despite the fact Matthew McConaughey is a highly talented and versatile actor, I just couldn't buy into his portrayal of a cold-blooded, murderous gangster. Once you're arrested playing bongo drums in the nude while high as a kite ... you should really think twice before taking on a role where the very mention of your name strikes fear into the hardest British gangsters and thugs.Mr. Ritchie was once a lean, hungry predator and it had a visceral effect upon his films. Now however, the pendulum has swung in a different direction and the effect it had upon this film is all too apparent.", "Guy Richie - Flawless": "One of the best dialogues ever written for a movie.

And everyone act restrained except of course when they bang each others head with a hammer and blood get's on their glamorous dresses. Of course it's Guy Ritchie, and thats why we like him, but in this movie it was too much for me. There weren't enough repulsive, raw characters which would've counterbalanced this elegant, high-class underworld.I especially hated the boxer gang with their coach, because normally they could have been these guys (they are unexperienced, just entered this world, poor etc), but what were they wearing? Spotless tweed training clothes....\nIt's absolutely fine for a one time entertainment, because some of the great acting, but for me it's nowhere near as the Snatch.", "Best movie i watched in years": "I will never understand how could someone not like this movie,(same as the man from UNCLE that was a box office flop and it is amazing ) this movie is brilliant, the humor, the actors ,everything was 10/10 , do yourself a favor and watch this ...So impressed.", "Spectacular": "All I can say is Guy and his movies have yet to disappoint.\nFriggen love this one along with all of his others", "Vulgar Language": "A heavy R for language.

The plot of the film is presented as a story within a story. One of the heroes of the film seriously wrote a whole script based on the events he saw. In fact, we only see 10% of the feed in real time. Everything else is a kind of imagination game of the participants of the dialogue. Some sudden and interesting turns are built on this, when the characters themselves admit that they simply invented some scenes.Nevertheless, there is a story in the film - a story rich in events, twisted and cunningly intertwined. All in the spirit of the good old Guy Ritchie. From this point of view, cinema is an ideological (and stylistic) continuation of his debut works \"Cards, money, two barrels\" and \"Big Jackpot\". And \"Gentlemen\" turned out so well that now it's even impossible to say clearly which of these three films is the best.The story, despite its versatility, is still not based on sudden plot twists (and there are plenty of them here), but on the heroes. The characters of the film, again in the spirit of classic Richie, are worked out to the smallest detail. Each of them is colorful, unusual in its own way, with its own unique details and character traits. Everyone is remembered without exception. And the coolest characters are those who seem to appear only in a few scenes. Strength and coolness in details - these \"Gentlemen\" are very captivating.There is also a diverse set of statements in the film, which seem to cut through the main issues of the generation. Guy Ritchie walked, it seems, on all the most relevant topics of the present day: from racism and social inequality to the legalization of drugs. The topic of cultural differences between the USA and the UK is separately disclosed. Richie is good because his reasoning on these topics does not get out of the general rhythm and style of the tape. The dialogue about racism will be as dynamic and sharp as a gang fight or a swashbuckling chase.The visual side of the tape deserves special praise. The costumes in the film are perfectly matched. The clothes also emphasize the colorfulness of the characters. Each of them has his own unique style not only in behavior, but also in appearance. The camerawork is impeccable and diverse. In the tape, there is also the staging of scenes familiar to a wide audience, and clip editing, and even shooting from GoPro cameras. The meticulousness of the approach is also visible in working with color and light.Summing up all of the above, we can draw an obvious conclusion - Guy Ritchie has returned to the roots. And he returned brilliantly. The director finally got the opportunity to do something of his own again, without adjusting to the direction of studio bosses. Here we have the original Richie again - the one we fell in love with twenty years ago. At the same time, the director is noticeably progressing and in his new work does not slip into self-repetition. \"Gentlemen\" does not copy any of Richie's previous films and is quite a self-sufficient and original work.", "Modern Knights and Landlords": "Gentlemen are a modern slice of the aspirations of the British island. It is so modern that it sets trends. Do they still remember the coach's plaid suit? People engaged in the commodity business made money selling these suits. Here's the effect of the movie.And now to the film itself. Everything is fine in it: caste, music, mood, plot. These are the real problems of Britain, which is seething in a hodgepodge of cultures and unusual businesses. Against this background, cannabis is very popular - it really is. Young people who commit crimes, and then write videos about it on social networks - are you familiar? That's why these moments are present in Guy Ritchie's film.Using the example of the main character's people, it is shown that even these bandits in the prime of life are already Gentlemen against the background of a rapidly developing society. The main character loves his woman in the most classical sense, without any modern flair. Although, of course, youth crime in Britain is a common phenomenon.", "One trick pony, and it's pony.": "Guy (wish I was Tarantino) Richie - the one trick pony make more pony. Rip offs galore as usual, maybe don't bother.", "Exceptionally Good!": "\"The Gentlemen\" is one of these movies that will be stuck in you head for quite some time. The film boasts a star-studded cast including Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Hugh Grant, who all deliver outstanding performances. The story follows American expat Mickey Pearson (McConaughey) as he navigates the cutthroat world of London's criminal underworld.One of the strengths of this film is the clever and intricate plot. Ritchie expertly weaves together multiple storylines and characters to create a captivating and suspenseful narrative. The film is also filled with plenty of twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end.The dialogue in \"The Gentlemen\" is sharp and witty, with Ritchie's signature brand of fast-paced banter and clever wordplay. The characters are all unique and well-developed, with each one bringing their own unique flavor to the story.Another standout aspect of the film is the impressive ensemble cast. McConaughey gives a career-best performance as the film's lead, exuding charm and intelligence while also displaying a ruthless streak when necessary. Hunnam and Grant are also excellent in their respective roles, with Grant in particular delivering a memorable and unexpected performance.", "Guy Ritchie Fans Rejoice": "I'll keep this short and sweet.

Top class acting all around. Enjoyed it thoroughly!", "Utter waste of time": "Another ageing director not realising he is far beyond his prime and shouldn't waste anyone's time with such a less-than-mediocre movie:Pointless and uninspired story, cringy dialogue, poor cinematography, cheap lighting in almost every scene, underdeveloped characters and an embarrassing try to copy the final scene of 'The Long Good Friday' to top it all off ...", "Hugh Grants finest hour!": "What a great film. Loads of bad language, so not one to watch with the kids! Such great one-liners scattered throughout the film which are laugh-out-loud.Thoroughly enjoyed!", "This is the best movie for last years, well done !": "This is the best movie for last years, well done !\nAs usual Guy Ritche made it 100% awesome", "Fantastic Movie From Guy": "I saw this in the theater, and without subtitles had some issues catching every line. But the way the movie played out was brilliant. Fantastic writing, and a great cast of characters that was very well acted!When I got a chance to watch it a second time, I really fell in love with the movie. It's one of those movies you need to watch again because it's so well written, and played out within the movie.", "That was awsome!": "Finally, Guy Ritchie is back! What a plot, what an acting! Liked it very much!", "A story about a hungry lion... Also, British Crime films are hella fun": "\"When the lion is hungry, he eats!\"Guy Ritchie's latest is a definite must see for the Crime comedy genre fans. If you are not familiar with this director, his most mainstream film is Robert Downey's Sherlock and the recent Aladdin live action adaptation. In this movie, The Gentlemen, we follow a boss-man who wants out of the drug game..and as in the wild, all other contenders to the throne will see this as weakness and naturally hilarity and mayhem ensue... A simple enough premise, but executed elegantly by the man who brought us Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; Snatch and RocknRolla.Excellent casting all around particularly with Matthew McConaughey as protagonist. Hugh Grant was probably the standout, haven't seen him in a while. He plays a shrewd blackmailer who serves as our unreliable narrator. I just feel like we're missing a certain Mark Strong in this movie...but we got a Jeremy Strong so I guess that'll do..heheheThe violence is sparse but effective. This isn't really a shoot em up. And as with any Guy Ritchie film, you have to pay attention to the multiple plot threads and nuances in dialogue or you'll get lost fast.I'm always fascinated with his British Crime films as this doesn't really translate well in the usual American setting that we as an audience is familiar with. Guns are banned in the UK so that dynamic greatly impacts how the criminal underground works in this story.8/10.", "Amazing film": "I have to say upfront that I have not watched Snatch (a lot of people compare these two) and this was the first film I've seen by Guy Ritchie. All I have to say is it is absolutely amazing. The plot full of satisfying twists, the acting astonishing I was really surprised by Charlie Hunnam and Michelle Dockery (not saying that the others weren't amazing but for example McConaughey is already a pretty established actor for me at least), the directing on point and the music also supreme. In a nutshell it's a really fun film and I can't get enough of it (I have watched it 3 times by now). To finish it off a you can't go wrong by watching this movie.", "The best form of cinema entertainment.": "This is guy ritchie at his almost best. Fast pace and brilliant not much more to say.", "Enjoyed it even though I knew it would be CC": "People complaining that guy is just making the same film over and over,,,,,\nWell it works, Bond has been going a fair while along with many other same film different actor productions.I love the dark humour chop scene films he makes and I would rather have a sit down and giggle to something like this rather than yet another reboot of a 80s film or a cult classic but now with all female actors....", "Stick with this and you will understand the hype": "Like many great films this isn't your point A to Z kind of film, you can't go off the opening half hour, or even hour for that fact. You go for a five course meal, the experience is based off the whole setting not just the starter. Every element of this film was finely set, the acting sharp, the writing exquisite and the casting brilliant (although I'd have loved to see Sam rockwell in for Jeremy strong, Jeremy still did a great job). This film will hopefully go down as a cult classic.", "Amazing movie!": "Very breathtaking movie with unexpected turns, typical for Guy Ritchie movies and absolutely worthwhile watching!! Awesome!", "Absolutely loving it": "Found the plot very interesting and kept me on my toes with all of its changes. Movie had some good humour in it and I really enjoyed the discussion between hugh and charlie. Also the lines of all the conversations we're spot on. Really great movie.", "Classic Guy Richie and in Best Form": "Fantastically entertaining. If you like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch then you will love this. However, it is a bit more thoughtful and more realistic. It also has more layers, if that's even possible for a Guy Richie gangster flick. Just watch the effing movie.Thank me later.", "Quality film": "Not going to give anything away, great watch. Just posting this message to all the helmets who gave it a 5 or 6 rating! Seriously 5 or 6 this is a class film some people are just plain sad", "Ritchie at his best...": "The fact that this movie is so polarised only shows how Guy Ritchie get's on with his unique style of creative genius, regardless of what the so called critics say. You either love him or hate him. Lucky for us, he keeps making class films, and leaving everyone else behind.", "\"The Gentlemen\" is the best film which I saw.": "After seeing of the \"The Gentlemen\" film, I was satisfied. This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. If I could erase one movie from my memory to watch it again it would be this movie. Most of my friends agreed with my opinion about \"The Gentlemen\".\nI liked this movie because of the very good picture and great plot. The cast was chosen perfectly, each actor perfectly revealed his character. This movie has enough humor and quotes. The movie is long enough, but I watched it in one go.\nI watched this movie in a movie, so unfortunately I can't rate it on other devices.\nI liked Charlie Hunnam, who played the role of Ray, and Matthew McConaughey, who played the role of Michael Pearson.\nI advise everyone to watch \"The Gentlemen\", you obviously will not regret the time spent watching this movie.", "Masterclass": "A Guy Ritchie Masterclass. I don't like to judge because every film has it's own story and it's own meaning. Mr. Ritchie knocked it out of the park with this one. If you're an english style fashion lover as I am this is a must-watch. There's a bonus: how could people ever get tired of watching Ritchie's films ?", "A parody of a Guy Ritchie movie": "Ritchie is trying so hard to be Tarantino. Whereas Tarantino's writing is clever and realistic, Ritchie's is cringeworthy. He's trying so hard to be cool it's embarrassing. If you're older than 15, avoid.", "Not particularly clever or complicated, but enjoyable": "Somehow I've never got around to watching any other Guy Richie films, so came at this without much in the way of expectation.The storyline isn't particularly complicated or innovative, but a combination of solid performances, mostly strong dialogue and dark humour kept me engaged throughout. Unlike a lot of more common films, this doesn't have to rely heavily on over the top action sequences and instead focuses on (albeit sometimes derivative) story telling.Without wanting to give anything away, I did feel there's a reasonable sized plot hole in the characters seemingly failing to draw the obvious conclusion as to how some information about the location of illicit activities could have been leaked fairly early on, but given how much I enjoyed the rest of it, I forgot about it pretty quickly.", "My lovely film": "So, the plot of \"Gentlemen\" plunges us into the world of the famous light drug dealer Michael \"Mickey\" Pearson (McConaughey), who, upon reaching a certain age threshold, considered that he somehow no longer became involved in crime. Having spent years building his powerful empire, Mickey has gone from an ordinary courier to one of the most prominent businessmen, who, on the one hand, enters the apartments of hereditary British aristocrats, but on the other hand, he cannot fully enjoy his status, because his earnings continue to be illegal. The thirst for violence, the destruction of competitors, the expansion of spheres of influence no longer worries Mickey as before, and therefore he made a strong-willed decision to leave the game, selling his vast empire into the hands of a person who is able to shell out the necessary amount of money and not become an obsessive, sticky nuisance. . And it seems that Mickey has very good options for retiring, enjoying a quiet life in the company of an adored woman, but in his particular situation, going into the shadows is not at all so easy. If you have chosen a criminal path, then getting off it is by no means easy. Especially when you have power and connections worth a fortune in your hands. And although Mickey tries to be two steps ahead of his enemies and even companions, he will never get out of the swirling alteration without the goodwill of changeable luck.The Gentlemen combines all the best that we have seen in the most iconic works of Guy Ritchie. Slowly placing the accents of his story, introducing us to a scattering of colorful characters and not forgetting to pay tribute to street gangs, as the basis of all British crime, the director builds a fascinating plot labyrinth, in which, traditionally, until the very end there will be secret passages, roads leading to the abyss and unexpected outcomes, forcing a fresh look to evaluate everything that happened before. It seems that we have already seen all this in Richie's past works, but The Gentlemen still know how to surprise and entertain well. Of course, they are no longer as comical and parodic as Big Jackpot, they have much more drama and serious elements that make you seriously worry about the outcome of all events, but at the same time, the picture looks at ease, captivating you into the story with your head. But in order to fully experience all the charm of Richie's idea, it's worth delving into the plot from the first minutes and not being distracted once again, because there are really a lot of different details and heroes, there are simply no extra characters, and if you omit something, then in general the impression of views may not be as enthusiastic. So getting acquainted with The Gentlemen should be done only when you expect to watch the film thoughtfully and carefully, enjoying an interesting story, excellent humor and acting, which have become one of the fundamental pillars of history along with the script and directing.Matthew McConaughey has proven time and time again that he is one of the best actors of his generation and knows what to do when a director needs more than blindly following a script. Playing the role of Mickey, McConaughey demonstrates steely restraint, and at the same time he is really capable of killing, there is no doubt about it. Mickey is an extremely dangerous hero, he is capable of terrible things, but he is also not without a code of honor. Of course, the image turned out to be slightly idealized, but this is the universe of Guy Ritchie films, in which, despite all the surprises, there are unbreakable rules. The half-comical duo of Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant turned out to be unexpectedly funny, who diluted the drama with their dialogues, and the atypical, caricatured Colin Farrell supplemented Richie's ironic mood with his appearance, becoming one of those unpredictable figures that twisted the spring of intrigue to the extent that the finale remains only applaud. And it seems that yes, something like this has already happened, but with the \"Gentlemen\" it's like for the first time.In the end, I want to say that Guy Ritchie is in excellent creative shape and it is clear that he enjoys his work. And we have a good time with him.", "Malenial drugdie movie, don't waste your time.! expensive cast": "I found this movie to be something beyond time spent.Melllnial druggie with an attention span sort of movie!And I like Seth Rogan films, this is past bad.Otherwise so bad for such an expensive cast.Wasting your time with garbage.High, sober, drunk, whatever.Awful.Are we trying to make something new with a reach to different genre?Do child bearing adults of today find that this is a good time waster?This will sound old, but here it goes. If I paid $ to spend \"at a theater\" for this I would be terribly disappointed with more than the price of snacks or dinner out.Dave yours and anyone elses time.", "Snappy and cool, but missing something in the finale": "Brilliant dialog and cool British gangsters as you would expect from Guy. But the ending seemed to predictable. I was expecting a twist that didn't show up. Perhaps my expectations were too high, as it is a good film, I just wanted a little more greatness To finish the snow. Grant was amazing and it's worth watching just see a new side of him.", "Modern day CLASSIC!": "First off, I do not understand the reviews which do not rate this as a decent film. I don't enjoy many films, but The Gentleman feels is next level.With so many mediocre films to watch it's not often one comes along, stands out, and makes a place in my heart like The Gentleman.I loved the cast, the story and the pace of the film. As others have said I didn't even click 'that' was Hugh grant, so good to see him in a role such as this one.It's one of those films where every scene stands relevance and value. Yes it's a modern day film and it's potentially difference to expectations but with it brings so much British film art delivered so expertly by the amazing actors cast in the film. I know I could watch it again and again. I'm not the sort to like films with excessive mindless violence/gore/shootings etc, the gentleman isn't much of these, however being a British 'gangster' film you expect a little and for me it was right on par with that and almost every other aspect of the film.It's not too long either, some films just keep going and you get to a point where you expect them to finish, The Gentleman is the perfect length and every scene is crammed full of action, cunning and fun.", "Oh Dear": "Guy Ritchie pays homage to The Long Good Friday briefly at the end of this film. Hugh Grant hams it up with a bad cockney accent in the best performance in this film. Instantly forgettable.", "Best watch in a while": "Stellar performance by the cast. It grabs your attention and keeps it. Definetly worth the watch even a second one to be completely honest.", "Superb fun": "Excellent cast, first class acting, but Collin Farrell stands above the rest.\nNice soundtrack too.\nWatched it three times, enjoyed every second", "Guy Ritchie's best.": "Wow, watched this movie 3 times already and wont mind watching it again.

I loved the movie.", "New age classy gangster movie": "Guy Ritchie being a pioneer in delivering a crime/comedy has delivered it once again. even though the narration and story is pretty straight forward, it's fun to watch. Absolute subtle acting by whole cast especially supporting characters were amazing and Matthew mcconaughey have portrayed the classy gangster role in the finest way. Finally special applause to the music and background it did sync with the narration perfectly. I feel \"snatch\" and \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" were better than this. if anyone hasn't seen these two masterpiece definitely give it a watch because it will be super fun ride.", "Back to proper form": "It took a long time, but gaddamn if Guy didn't get right back into proper form.

With the depth of each character to the dialogue and script to even the score this movie has had me appalled and at the edge of my seat, this is class writing and veteran film making at his highest level.", "Storytelling is an art form few ever master": "Had no idea about this movie, watched it for what it was, absolutely loved it. Great characters, in a great story, with fantastic dialogue, all brought to life by some outstanding performances.Watch it and enjoy.", "Worth watching": "Takes a bit to sift through all the ok films on Netflix and find something truely worth watching. This one is worth a watch and super satisfying. I love Guy Richie films, they are so refreshing and exciting, fun but intense. First 15mins is quite wordy but after that it's hard to look away from the screen. It is quite crude though, so be aware.", "Surprisingly captivating": "Got me stuck on the couch in front of the TV. Catching from the first minutes, and thus, impossible to quit. Guy Ritchie trademark, with a great performance from Hugh Grant.", "Really enjoyed this movie": "This was surprisingly entertaining. Not just an action movie, it was very funny in parts. As violent as some scenes were, you did actually get to like the protagonists. All the actors were very good, particularly Matthew McConaughey and Colin Farrell; possibly Hugh Grant went a little over the top. Michelle Dockery was great in a role pretty far from Downton Abbey. Jeremy Strong, Henry Golding and Tom Wu make great villains. Overall great cast, lots of action and very funny. What more can you ask? I loved the nod to one of my favorites, The Long Good Friday, a great Bob Hoskins movie, at the end.", "Spectacular from Start to Finish!": "When I heard that this was directed from the producers who made Sherlock Holmes, I knew this movie was not gonna disappoint. From the first scene to the last scene of the movie, it kept my attention so well, and the tension was built perfectly.If you like mystery and heavy action, this is the right movie for you. Definitely not for family audiences, but for a more mature audience. Loved the acting from all the amazing actors, but for me Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, and Hugh Grant were fantastic.", "Gentlemen of the Hollywood era": "A masterpiece painting by Guy Ritchie. I can't agree with the negative reviewers that the actors didn't show us anything new. Take Matthew McConaughey - inimitable in any role. In this picture, he played the main bad guy. After McConaughey managed to break out of the romcom, this is the first film in such an image. And it is played 100%. Hugh Grant took a completely unusual role, which surprised the viewer. Handsome and a heartbreaker? No! A scoundrel in the slimiest sense of the word.Richie tells the story of how Mickey Pearson is trying to end his 'career' in the criminal world. While several characters try to leave him with nothing. The film suddenly begins, flows violently and ends with clarity after all the worries and vanities. They did not miss the love line, although here it was atypical. The beautiful Michelle Dockery added peppercorn in a cheeky way. Mickey Pearson's wife, strong and domineering, turns into a cat (albeit wild) next to Matthew McConaughey's lion. It was interesting to follow their love, although the plot paid almost no attention to the couple. I want to quote dialogues, and copy images. The contrasting images of Hannam and Farrell were especially sunk in.Of course, the film does not have a deep meaning. Or maybe it's just not on the surface. But the film gives emotions, drive, aesthetic and intellectual pleasure. What else do you need? Moreover, I have already reviewed the film twice and intend to do it again. Besides, no matter who I watched it with, all my friends just like me 'went'.A typical crime story mixed with humor and romance, hyperbolized and flavored with jargon. That's what I like!", "If you like this genre then this is the one to watch": "Yes, I'm tempted to say he's back. It's not that he's gone or he hasn't had at least a few decent films in the last few years. I didn't see Aladdin, but he was kind of successful. But that's just his part! It's pure and likable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts, jumps and characters you'd think only he could write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey join our ranks, I think he will replace Jason Statham. But also Hugh Grant's involvement... role/character. Genius! Who could do it and he kills him (no pun intended). At least a few turns will be easy to spot, but I don't think you can guess everything. However, the movie is so well done that it won't really matter. If you like this genre then this is the one to watch. Fun and exciting until the very end...", "Comeback": "For those who knew Guy Ritchie's work from better times, the new one will not come as a pleasant surprise. Scolded by everyone (but my favorite) and generally recognized as the weakest (before the release of The Gentlemen) crime thriller Rock and Roller, the main claim to which was the creative auto-repeat, surpasses The Gentlemen in all respects. But it is worth paying tribute to the director for the courage to return to the roots, and for the fact that despite the unconvincing comeback, the new work is one of the few entertaining films worthy of attention in recent times. Moreover, thanks to films like The Gentlemen, when comparing, you often come across the phrase 'in the style of Guy Ritchie', and this must be earned.", "Super cool": "\"GENTLEMEN.\" - Guy Ritchie's elegant comeback. The director has returned to his roots, and I'd like to say that's what was missing. The film is fun, intriguing and entertaining. The concept of the almanac is far from new, but it will never be beaten if you have a good script on hand. The picture grabs the viewer's attention. And not only because of the very intriguing plot, but also because of the colorful characters. Driven crime thriller with great humor. The film has a powerful atmosphere, an interesting story and unrealistically cool, colorful characters with different sets of qualities that set them apart. This is accompanied by great action sequences and good acting. Even with such a hackneyed concept, you can make a great final product that is sure to please fans of the genre.", "Impression often depends on expectation": "A talented Oxford graduate, using his unique mind and unprecedented audacity, came up with an illegal enrichment scheme using the estates of the impoverished English aristocracy. However, when he decides to sell his business to an influential clan of US billionaires, no less charming but tough gentlemen stand in his way. An exchange of pleasantries is planned, which definitely will not do without shootings and a couple of accidents.So, it happened: the British 'talent' Guy Ritchie returned 'to his roots' (as if the previous picture of the British - 'Aladdin' and a couple of paintings in front of it - there was some kind of 'misunderstanding', which I want to forget a little), and understand that the true Guy Ritchie is back 'in a big way'. The plot in the film is multifaceted (and I don't want to particularly 'spoiler'), but the film itself - to use a phrase from the film itself - is still a 'grease tale': the whole film is a 'borderline conversation' between private detective Fletcher and one of Mickey Pearson's assistants - Raymond Smith, who, over glasses of whiskey and barbecue, are discussing the affairs of recently past days: showdowns of some heroes with others, when one and the second are building a 'deal', and the third and fourth are trying to break it and take the 'jackpot' for themselves. Here, on the estates of the impoverished English aristocracy, marijuana is grown, a gang of young 'bouncers' in tracksuits with a pattern of 'English tweed' terrorize everyone in the district, the Chinese mafia is on the alert, and one of the editors of the local 'tabloid' is forced to rape a pig. 'Gentlemen' is a return to 'roots' after 20 years. It's got a great cast that tries to 'outplay' each other, and who immediately caught the 'essence'. This film is an explosive mixture of drive, impudence, youth and the belief that by doing the most vile deeds, the main characters remain gentlemen.", "The Gentleman": "The presentation of the plot is implemented as a retelling of the journalist about his surveillance and ingenious conclusions that he made in the course of events. It's very exciting and exciting, but in the middle of the film you start to feel that something is wrong and you're looking at a picture within a picture.The rest of the film is close to the satirical ideal and with its irony makes you laugh even from Hollywood clich\u00c3\u00a9s. But behind the secondness lies the same Guy Ritchie from the 2000s, who, with his hyper-realistic model of narration, is able to lure any viewer. Therefore, I warmly recommend this picture for viewing, and I hope it will give you pleasure.", "Gentlemen of fun and recklessness!": "Guy Ritchie pleased. I do not share the negative reviews, those who believe that the director is exhausted or something like that. For me, the film is of high quality and coped with its role. The mood lifts, keeps in suspense, the actors are handsome. And especially pleased with the soundtrack and costumes. Now I want tracksuits in which the guys dance there)The theme of the film is of course hype, relevant, on which the script was built. Personally, I was pleased with the plot twists and want to continue. As a result, I watched this movie with my boyfriend, he also got it, but my friend tried twice and nothing came of it, she fell asleep. I don't think everyone will understand this movie. But fans of Guy Ritchie, Tarantino and other bright directors can rejoice and find something special for themselves.", "Slow Burning": "For me, Guy Ritchie's films, coarse as they might seem at first glimpse, always prove to have certain subtle value like that of some fine vintage vine; the more times you watch them, the more you can savour his 'liquorish assortment' of dialogues, which are witty and streetwise as hell at the same time.This one is possibly the most refined of his movies in terms of story-telling and character distillation, however, the thing which I really came to appreciate is how corpulent, as wine connaisseurs say, this picture is; the first time I saw it, I was left there with not much to remember, only a hint of it being just worthy enough not to have it erased from my hard drive and some sort of languish for the now-classic raw savagery of Snitch or Two Smoking Barrels. The second or third time, freed from focusing on the story, I could indulge way better in having some serious har-de-har; rotfling around about the comical situations and the pedigree performance of the cast. Finally, several viewings later, I found myself more and more coming to the conclusion that, as protagonist Mickey Pearson puts it, 'I like middle age' and everything that goes with it.In this sense, I feel there is quite some bell-ringing analogy when comparing Quentin Tarantino's early classic Pulp Fiction with the not as fancy but certainly more elaborate Jackie Brown. The same kind of refinery process is evident when looking at Ritchie's Snatch and The Gentlemen. While the first is all fracas and guffawing tomfoolery, this latter is more about grey matter and placid smiles. The only difference is that while Quentin merely took 3 years to complete this kind of ripening (just in order to get back to his rough-hewn roots with Kill Bill later on), Ritchie's incubation period was 19 years.All in all, one could say this one is slow-burning; 'rings the bell but not too loud, dipped in honey, it's on the money.'Glad to see that this gentleman can still make a good cup of tea.", "Wonderful": "Picture this. Snatch x 7 Psychopaths + Charlie Hunnam.That's what this movie is. Brilliantly put together. Just when you think you have an idea what is happening, it takes another turn.Applaud!", "If you have to write an asian male character in a British movie": "Dry eye is your guy: sells the cocaine, double cross his partner, kills his boss, screams like a little girl, fight with woman, and also almost a rapist but died on the job.Please don't have an asian character like this to be more inclusive. I used to watch Guy Ritchie's movie when I don't care about the race representation and stereotypes. But now I'm older and have seen what stereotypes can do, I become more sensitive to the matter.Despite my sensitivity on the character, it's an entertaining movie.", "Smart, Witty and Snappy lines...": "Now this is what a movie is supposed to be like, litteraly blown away by all the actors in this here movie, yes every single actor is brilliant apart from the main cast which was just Exceptional in my book. This is by far Hugh Grants best role to date and Matthew and Charlie made me wish I was part of there crew. Damn! I just remembered a scene with Colin Farrell that had me in stiches and woke up my neighbors next door. He is a badass in this movie.Im an avid movie buff and I just wish there were more gems like this out there, watch it, you wont be dissapointed; this is art. The reason I gave it a 10 out of 10 is because its an exceptionaI film and I didnt want it to, end was actually quite sad, and thats how you know when its a good movie as you feel a sense of connection with the characters and a sense of lose when its overGuy manages to raise the bar again in every aspect. Please keep em coming.", "Great storyline, awful language": "Loved the concept here, great plot. Great acting, even from Hugh Grant who I usually don't cope with.

I left the theatre underwhelmed and needing to watch Lock stock, snatch, legend or Rock n Rolla to remind me why I love his films.This movie tries too hard with the wrong cast. The first hour went on and on with hardly any point or amusing scenes. I felt like he tried to fill the casms of missing humor with simple \"\" quips. The story wasn't complicated at all, as many have said, actually it was a bit too simple. Just boring.
